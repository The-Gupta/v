Endocrine and metabolic disorders have been variably reported to be associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Therefore, the aim of this article was to critically evaluate the current knowledge of the endocrine and metabolic disorders associated with HTLV-1 infection. The literature search used PubMed, Web of Science, and LILACS databases in the past 10 years, utilizing, in various combinations, the following keywords: HTLV-1, adult T-cell leukemia, diabetes mellitus, GLUT-1, osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, autoimmune thyroid disorders, diabetes insipidus, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion; pseudohypoparathyroidism; pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism. The proven endocrine manifestations of the HTLV-1 infection are calcium disorders which occur in some patients with acute HTLV-1/Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The few reports about thyroid, parathyroid, antidiuretic hormone and diabetes mellitus are insufficient to prove a causal association with HTLV-1 infection. The evidence for an association between endocrine disorders and HTLV-1 infection in general, and in asymptomatic patients is lacking. Given all these uncertainties, the endocrine expression of the HTLV-1 infection composes a promising research line for understanding the pathophysiology of this infection.","['Alves, Cresio', 'Dourado, Luciano']","['Alves C', 'Dourado L']","['Pediatric Endocrinology, Hospital Universitario Prof. Edgard Santos, Faculty of Medicine, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Brazil. cresio.alves@uol.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Brazil,Braz J Infect Dis,The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,9812937,IM,"['Endocrine System Diseases/*virology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Diseases/*virology']",2011/02/23 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/02/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['S1413-8670(10)70120-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Braz J Infect Dis. 2010 Nov-Dec;14(6):613-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optical traps were realized by two 1070 nm single mode fibre lasers. Microflows were controlled by a syringe pump system. A novel microfluidic glass chip was designed to inject single cells, modify the flow speed, accommodate the laser fibres and sort cells after Raman based identification. Whereas the integrated microchip setup used 514 nm for excitation of Raman spectra, a quartz capillary setup excited spectra with 785 nm laser wavelength. Classification models were trained using linear discriminant analysis to differentiate erythrocytes, leukocytes, acute myeloid leukaemia cells (OCI-AML3), and breast tumour cells BT-20 and MCF-7 with accuracies that are comparable with previous Raman experiments of dried cells and fixed cells in a Petri dish. Implementation into microfluidic environments enables a high degree of automation that is required to improve the throughput of the approach for Raman activated cell sorting.","['Dochow, Sebastian', 'Krafft, Christoph', 'Neugebauer, Ute', 'Bocklitz, Thomas', 'Henkel, Thomas', 'Mayer, Gunter', 'Albert, Jens', 'Popp, Jurgen']","['Dochow S', 'Krafft C', 'Neugebauer U', 'Bocklitz T', 'Henkel T', 'Mayer G', 'Albert J', 'Popp J']","['Institute of Photonic Technology, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation/*instrumentation', 'Glass/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Lasers', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/*instrumentation', '*Optical Tweezers', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman/*instrumentation']",2011/02/23 06:00,2011/07/22 06:00,['2011/02/23 06:00'],"['2011/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c0lc00612b [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2011 Apr 21;11(8):1484-90. doi: 10.1039/c0lc00612b.

For many decades, the initial therapy for most patients requiring treatment was limited to single-agent alkylator therapy. Within the last two decades, we have seen remarkable progress in understanding the biology of CLL and the development of more effective treatment strategies that have employed monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab (anti-CD20). Furthermore, recognition of the synergy between fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) prompted investigators to explore the clinical activity of FCR in Phase II and III trials in patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CLL. On the basis of these findings, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved rituximab in combination with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated CD20-postive CLL. Recent data from a randomized Phase III trial has confirmed improved overall survival with FCR in patients with previously untreated CLL. However, FCR is not for everyone. More tolerable regimens using rituximab for the elderly and less fit patients are being pursued in clinical trials. Recent Phase II trials have explored potentially less myelosuppressive approaches by using lower doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, replacing fludarabine with pentostatin, and combining rituximab with chlorambucil. Furthermore new biomarkers predictive of early disease progression have prompted investigators to explore the benefits of early treatment with rituximab combined with other agents. In addition to the proven utility of rituximab as a frontline agent for CLL, rituximab has a favorable toxicity profile both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy. The majority of adverse events are Grade 1 and 2 infusion-related reactions (fevers, chills, and rigors) and occur with the first dose of rituximab. The improved tolerability observed with second and subsequent infusions allows for shorter infusion times. Rituximab's proven activity and favorable toxicity profile has made it an ideal agent for expanding treatment options for patients with CLL, the majority of whom are elderly.","['Bryan, Jeffrey', 'Borthakur, Gautam']","['Bryan J', 'Borthakur G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Ther Clin Risk Manag,Therapeutics and clinical risk management,101253281,,,2011/02/23 06:00,2011/02/23 06:01,['2011/02/23 06:00'],"['2010/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/TCRM.S5855 [doi]'],epublish,Ther Clin Risk Manag. 2010 Dec 22;7:1-11. doi: 10.2147/TCRM.S5855.,20101222,,PMC3039008,['NOTNLM'],"['chlorambucil', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'elderly', 'fludarabine', 'pentostatin', 'rituximab', 'tolerability']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome of these patients is poor, compared to people who develop de novo acute leukemia (p-AML). Cytogenetic abnormalities in t-AML are similar to those found in p-AML but present more frequent unfavorable karyotypes depending on the inducting agent. Losses of chromosome 5 or 7 are observed after alkylating agents while balanced translocations are found after topoisomerase II inhibitors. This study compared t-AML to p-AML using high resolution array CGH in order to find copy number abnormalities (CNA) at a higher resolution than conventional cytogenetics. More CNAs were observed in 30 t-AML than in 36 p-AML: 104 CNAs were observed with 63 losses and 41 gains (mean number 3.46 per case) in t-AML, while in p-AML, 69 CNAs were observed with 32 losses and 37 gains (mean number of 1.9 per case). In primary leukemia with a previously ""normal"" karyotype, 18% exhibited a previously undetected CNA, whereas in the (few) t-AML with a normal karyotype, the rate was 50%. Several minimal critical regions (MCRs) were found in t-AML and p-AML. No common MCRs were found in the two groups. In t-AML a 40 kb deleted MCR pointed to RUNX1 on 21q22, a gene coding for a transcription factor implicated in frequent rearrangements in leukemia and in familial thrombocytopenia. In de novo AML, a 1 Mb MCR harboring ERG and ETS2 was observed from patients with complex aCGH profiles. High resolution cytogenomics obtained by aCGH and similar techniques already published allowed us to characterize numerous non random chromosome abnormalities. This work supports the hypothesis that they can be classified into several categories: abnormalities common to all AML; those more frequently found in t-AML and those specifically found in p-AML.","['Itzhar, Nathalie', 'Dessen, Philippe', 'Toujani, Saloua', 'Auger, Nathalie', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Richon, Catherine', 'Lazar, Vladimir', 'Saada, Veronique', 'Bennaceur, Anelyse', 'Bourhis, Jean Henri', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Bernheim, Alain']","['Itzhar N', 'Dessen P', 'Toujani S', 'Auger N', 'Preudhomme C', 'Richon C', 'Lazar V', 'Saada V', 'Bennaceur A', 'Bourhis JH', 'de Botton S', 'Bernheim A']","['Institut de la Sante et de la Reherche Medicale U985, Genetique des tumeurs, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations/chemically induced', '*Comparative Genomic Hybridization/methods', 'DNA Copy Number Variations/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage/physiology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/23 06:00,2011/09/02 06:00,['2011/02/23 06:00'],"['2010/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0016623 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Feb 14;6(2):e16623. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0016623.,20110214,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],PMC3038855,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although sibling allogeneic stem cell transplantation can result in long-term survival, most patients lack a matched family donor and are destined to die of refractory disease. Greater availability of unrelated donors and improvements in supportive care have increased the proportion of patients with PREF AML in whom allografting is technically feasible, but the outcome of unrelated donor transplantation in this population has not been studied. We therefore analysed overall survival in 168 patients with PREF AML, who underwent unrelated donor transplantation between 1994 and 2006. The 5-year overall survival for the whole group was 22%. In multivariate analysis, fewer than three courses of induction chemotherapy, a lower percentage of bone marrow blasts at transplant and patient cytomegalovirus seropositivity were associated with improved survival. This allowed the development of a scoring system that identified four groups with survival rates between 44+/-11% and 0%. This study demonstrates an important role for unrelated donor transplantation in the management of selected patients with PREF AML and confirms the importance of initiating an urgent unrelated donor search in patients with no matched sibling donor, who fail to respond to induction chemotherapy.","['Craddock, C', 'Labopin, M', 'Pillai, S', 'Finke, J', 'Bunjes, D', 'Greinix, H', 'Ehninger, G', 'Steckel, N-K', 'Zander, A R', 'Schwerdtfeger, R', 'Buchholz, S', 'Kolb, H-J', 'Volin, L', 'Fauser, A', 'Polge, E', 'Schmid, C', 'Mohty, M', 'Rocha, V']","['Craddock C', 'Labopin M', 'Pillai S', 'Finke J', 'Bunjes D', 'Greinix H', 'Ehninger G', 'Steckel NK', 'Zander AR', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Buchholz S', 'Kolb HJ', 'Volin L', 'Fauser A', 'Polge E', 'Schmid C', 'Mohty M', 'Rocha V']","['Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK.

Recently, whole genome sequencing, using next generation technology, was used as a systematic approach to identify mutations in genomes of various types of tumors including melanoma, lung and breast cancer, as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we identify tumor-specific somatic mutations by sequencing transcriptionally active genes. Mutations were detected by comparing the transcriptome sequence of an AML sample with the corresponding remission sample. Using this approach, we found five non-synonymous mutations specific to the tumor sample. They include a nonsense mutation affecting the RUNX1 gene, which is a known mutational target in AML, and a missense mutation in the putative tumor suppressor gene TLE4, which encodes a RUNX1 interacting protein. Another missense mutation was identified in SHKBP1, which acts downstream of FLT3, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in about 30% of AML cases. The frequency of mutations in TLE4 and SHKBP1 in 95 cytogenetically normal AML patients was 2%.

The knockdown of beta-catenin, using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral approach, accelerates all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation and impairs the proliferation of HL60 leukemic cell line. Using in vivo quantitative tracking of these cells, we observed a reduced engraftment potential after xenotransplantation when beta-catenin was silenced. However, when studying primary AML cells, despite effective downregulation of beta-catenin we did not observe any impairment of their in vitro long-term maintenance on MS-5 stroma nor of their engraftment potential in vivo. Altogether, these results show that despite a frequent beta-catenin upregulation in AML, leukemia-initiating cells might not be 'addicted' to this pathway and thus targeted therapy against beta-catenin might not be successful in all patients.","['Gandillet, Arnaud', 'Park, Sophie', 'Lassailly, Francois', 'Griessinger, Emmanuel', 'Vargaftig, Jacques', 'Filby, Andrew', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Bonnet, Dominique']","['Gandillet A', 'Park S', 'Lassailly F', 'Griessinger E', 'Vargaftig J', 'Filby A', 'Lister TA', 'Bonnet D']","['Cancer Research UK Haematopoietic Stem Cell Group, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Haematopoietic Stem Cell Group, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Haematopoietic Stem Cell Group, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Haematopoietic Stem Cell Group, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Haematopoietic Stem Cell Group, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK.', 'Flow Cytometry Core Facility, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, St. Bartholomew's hospital, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK."", 'Cancer Research UK Haematopoietic Stem Cell Group, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta Catenin/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/02/23 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/02/23 06:00'],"['2011/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/leu.2011.17 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 May;25(5):770-780. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.17.

PCM patients account for 2% of the dialysis population, adding 5000 new patients each year worldwide. Dialysis-dependent PCM patients have a 2.77 higher risk of death compared with other dialysis-dependent patients without this diagnosis. Renal failure and especially dialysis dependency is an independent poor prognostic factor in PCM, with the majority unable to achieve dialysis independence. Renal failure in PCM is a medical emergency with the need for rapid accurate diagnosis and prompt institution of supportive care and PCM-directed therapy, because reversal of renal impairment and recovery from dialysis dependency can occur in up to half the patients early in the course of disease and can lead to enormous survival benefits. Recently, the serum free light chain (SFLC) assay and serum beta-2-microglobulin free heavy chain (SFHC) assay have been used to rapidly diagnose PCM in renal failure and provide prognostic information in the setting of renal failure where the Durie-Salmon and International Staging Systems do not. A renal biopsy early in the course of renal impairment can provide diagnostic and prognostic information. A new generation of dialyzers with larger pores than routine dialyzers can be used with extended hemodialysis to remove SFLC more efficiently than plasmapheresis, allowing for greater renal recovery. Novel chemotherapy agents such as bortezomib are associated with an improved renal response and have moved to the front line of therapy. Successful use of high-dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in PCM with renal failure and even dialysis dependency has been associated with late renal recovery and also allowed for the subsequent use of renal transplantation to provide even greater survival benefits. Combined non-myeloablative allogeneic HCT with renal transplant in PCM patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis is now being studied in prospective trials.","['Wirk, B']",['Wirk B'],"['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA. baldeep.wirk@medicine.ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Emergencies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell', 'Multiple Myeloma/*complications/therapy', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Renal Insufficiency/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy']",2011/02/23 06:00,2011/11/05 06:00,['2011/02/23 06:00'],"['2011/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt20118 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2011.8 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2011 Jun;46(6):771-83. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2011.8.

In previous studies of mouse leukemias, we showed that retroviral insertion at the ecotropic viral insertion site 32 locus leads to increased expression of Prdm14, a pluripotency gene implicated in the self-renewal capacity of embryonic stem cells and the early stages of breast cancer. Here, we show that PRDM14 is also overexpressed in approximately 25% of human lymphoid neoplasms, with increased frequencies in T-cell acute LL and hyperdiploid precursor B-cell acute LL. To test if Prdm14 overexpression could initiate leukemia, mice were transduced with bone marrow cells transfected with a Prdm14 expression vector. LLs developed in 96% of female mice and 42% of male mice. Before the onset of leukemia, differentiation of transduced cells was biased up to 1000-fold toward cells with features of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), and lymphoid differentiation showed a relative block at the pro-B stage. Microarray gene expression analysis of expanded CLP-like cells before the onset of leukemia demonstrated upregulation of genes involved in pluripotency, tumor initiation, early B-lineage commitment, Wnt/Ras signaling and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Among the dysregulated genes were imprinted genes and non-coding RNAs including Dlk1 and Meg3, which are also key pluripotency mediators. Heightened expression of the estrogen-dependent oncogene, Myb, in tumors suggests a basis for the increased frequency of cancer in female mice. These data provide the first direct evidence for the association of Prdm14 with cancer initiation in an in vivo mouse model and in human lymphoid malignancies, while suggesting mechanisms for Prdm14's mode of action.","['Dettman, E J', 'Simko, S J', 'Ayanga, B', 'Carofino, B L', 'Margolin, J F', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Justice, M J']","['Dettman EJ', 'Simko SJ', 'Ayanga B', 'Carofino BL', 'Margolin JF', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Justice MJ']","['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",2011/02/23 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/02/23 06:00'],"['2011/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201112 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.12 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Jun 23;30(25):2859-73. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.12.

The ""Philadelphia Chromosome"" found consistently among chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients was the first significant finding of a chromosomal abnormality specifically related to a particular disease. Starting from this point, cytogenetics as the study of chromosomes has become a valuable tool in the assessment of cancer - as an aid in diagnosis, thus guiding therapy, and as a prognostic marker. As is the nature of the proliferating marrow, chromosomal abnormalities were found mostly in hematologic malignancies, and the findings more pathognomonic. The situation is different in solid tumors, which when visible to the naked eye already will have complex chromosomal changes and thus pose technical difficulties to the cytogeneticist. However, scientists believe that the shift in chromosomal studies from conventional cytogenetics to molecular cytogenetics will provide further information regarding solid tumors.","['Sudoyo, Aru W', 'Hardi, Fransiska']","['Sudoyo AW', 'Hardi F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia - dr.

Overlap between these 2 diagnoses is rare. In addition, pathologic findings for these 2 diagnoses are typically notable for necrosis, apoptosis, angioinvasion, and angiodestruction. OBSERVATIONS: We describe a 15-year-old male adolescent who had painful subcutaneous nodules and plaques over his anterior thighs, shins, and lower abdomen while receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy with infliximab. He also was noted to have pulmonary nodules, liver nodules, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and transaminitis. A skin biopsy revealed atypical small to intermediate-sized EBV-positive lymphoid cells of NK-cell origin infiltrating the subcutaneous adipose tissue, mimicking subcutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Similar atypical EBV-positive lymphocytes were noted in the bone marrow, liver, stomach, and colon. This patient had a rapidly fatal disease course. CONCLUSIONS: We report a unique clinical and histological presentation most consistent with an extranasal NK/T-cell lymphoma and aggressive NK-cell leukemia overlap, although our case may represent a disease entity completely new to the literature.

Although normal HSCs sustain life-long hematopoiesis, malignant transformation of HSCs leads to leukemia. Therefore, mechanisms protecting HSCs from cellular damage are essential to prevent hematopoietic malignancies. In this study, we crippled autophagy in HSCs by conditionally deleting the essential autophagy gene Atg7 in the hematopoietic system. This resulted in the loss of normal HSC functions, a severe myeloproliferation, and death of the mice within weeks. The hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment displayed an accumulation of mitochondria and reactive oxygen species, as well as increased proliferation and DNA damage. HSCs within the Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) (LSK) compartment were significantly reduced. Although the overall LSK compartment was expanded, Atg7-deficient LSK cells failed to reconstitute the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated mice. Consistent with loss of HSC functions, the production of both lymphoid and myeloid progenitors was impaired in the absence of Atg7. Collectively, these data show that Atg7 is an essential regulator of adult HSC maintenance.","['Mortensen, Monika', 'Soilleux, Elizabeth J', 'Djordjevic, Gordana', 'Tripp, Rebecca', 'Lutteropp, Michael', 'Sadighi-Akha, Elham', 'Stranks, Amanda J', 'Glanville, Julie', 'Knight, Samantha', 'Jacobsen, Sten-Eirik W', 'Kranc, Kamil R', 'Simon, Anna Katharina']","['Mortensen M', 'Soilleux EJ', 'Djordjevic G', 'Tripp R', 'Lutteropp M', 'Sadighi-Akha E', 'Stranks AJ', 'Glanville J', 'Knight S', 'Jacobsen SE', 'Kranc KR', 'Simon AK']","['Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Autophagy/*physiology', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Damage/physiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/physiopathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/physiology']",2011/02/23 06:00,2011/05/25 06:00,['2011/02/23 06:00'],"['2011/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20101145 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20101145 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2011 Mar 14;208(3):455-67. doi: 10.1084/jem.20101145.

However, a bsscFv specific for the B-lymphoid tumor antigen CD19 and the trigger molecule CD16 on NK cells had similar affinities for both antigens (42 and 58nM, respectively) and was not optimal for cytotoxicity. Therefore, a bispecific tribody (bsTb) was constructed with two binding sites for CD19 and one for CD16. This bsTb contained a CD19-specific Fab fragment carrying a CD16-specific scFv fused to its light chain and a CD19-specific scFv fused to its heavy chain. The bsTb was compared with a bispecific bibody (bsBb) lacking the CD19-specific scFv. The bsTb had 3-fold greater avidity for CD19 than the bsBb (8 and 24nM, respectively), while both had equal affinity for CD16 (56nM).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients received conventional TBI as 2 Gy BID/day for 3 days boosted the next day by TMI (2 Gy in a single fraction) and followed by cyclophosphamide (Cy) 60 mg/kg for 2 days. While TBI was delivered with linear accelerator, TMI was performed with helical tomotherapy (HT). RESULTS: Fifteen patients were treated from July 2009 till May 2010, ten with acute myeloid leukemia, and five with acute lymphoid leukemia. At the time of radiotherapy eight patients were in relapse and seven in second or third complete remission (CR) after relapse. The donor was a matched sibling in 7 cases and an unrelated donor in 8 cases. Median organ-at-risk dose reduction with TMI ranged from 30% to 65% with the largest reduction (-50%-65%) achieved for brain, larynx, liver, lungs and kidneys. Target areas (bone marrow sites and spleen in selected cases) were irradiated with an optimal conformity and an excellent homogeneity. Follow-up is short ranging from 180 to 510 days (median 310 days). However, tolerance was not different from a conventional TBI-Cy. All patients treated with TBI/TMI reached CR after SCT. Three patients have died (2 for severe GvHD, 1 for infection) and 2 patients showed relapsed leukemia. Twelve patients are alive with ten survivors in clinical remission of disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the clinical feasibility of using HT to deliver TMI as selective dose boost modality after TBI. For patients with advanced leukemia targeted TMI after TBI may be a novel approach to increase radiation dose with low risk of severe toxicity.","['Corvo, Renzo', 'Zeverino, Michele', 'Vagge, Stefano', 'Agostinelli, Stefano', 'Barra, Salvina', 'Taccini, Gianni', 'Van Lint, Maria Teresa', 'Frassoni, Francesco', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea']","['Corvo R', 'Zeverino M', 'Vagge S', 'Agostinelli S', 'Barra S', 'Taccini G', 'Van Lint MT', 'Frassoni F', 'Bacigalupo A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Genoa and National Cancer Research Institute, Largo R.

We observed that three MMLV RT single-stranded template binding residues, Y64, D114, and R116, act as a linked set through mutual interactions, including hydrogen bonding and ion-pairing. The analogous residues of HIV-1 RT have a somewhat different environment and they lack this linked phenomenon. To understand the functional implication of this linked set of MMLV RT, we performed site-directed mutagenesis at these three positions. Then the mutant enzymes were examined for their biochemical properties and nucleotide selectivity. Mutagenesis of these residues (Y64A, D114A, and R116A) resulted in enzymes with slight to modest changes in polymerase activities. The processivity of DNA synthesis correlated positively with the binding affinity of the MMLV RT variants. Lower fidelity in mutants was indicated by measurements of misincorporation and mispair extension fidelity of wild type (WT) and mutant RTs, in contrast to earlier works that indicate that mutations at the analogous positions in HIV-1 RT result in relatively higher fidelity. These data together with structural analysis suggest that this structural set may therefore be a key factor responsible for the different fidelity of these two RTs.","['Xie, Jian', 'Zhang, Pengwei', 'Li, Chuanjiang', 'Huang, Qianhua', 'Zhou, Rong', 'Peng, Tao']","['Xie J', 'Zhang P', 'Li C', 'Huang Q', 'Zhou R', 'Peng T']","['National Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['HIV Reverse Transcriptase/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutant Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics', '*Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Templates, Genetic']",2011/02/23 06:00,2011/07/02 06:00,['2011/02/23 06:00'],"['2011/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1119(11)00074-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2011.02.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2011 Jun 15;479(1-2):47-56. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2011.02.007.

Instead of direct phosphorylation of target proteins, tribbles act as adaptors in signaling pathways for important cellular processes. These include mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP). Trib1 and Trib2 have been identified as myeloid oncogenes, and both may be involved in human leukemia. Tribbles proteins are also involved in a series of non-neoplastic disorders including metabolic and neurological diseases. The RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway molecules (in particular MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) and C/EBP transcription factors) include tribbles-binding proteins that are involved in leukemogenesis, and the role of Trib1 as a linker between MAPK signaling and C/EBP degradation is proposed.

First, we confirmed the correlation of dPCR to conventional RQ-PCR using 30 patient samples with various minimal residual disease (MRD) levels. When the sensitivity limits were determined using cell line and patient sample dilutions, rRQ-PCR and dPCR with pre-amplification showed 2-3 log improvement compared to conventional RQ-PCR, and 24 of 32 PCR negative samples as assayed by conventional RQ-PCR showed detectable BCR-ABL in rRQ-PCR and/or dPCR. More important, using dPCR in conjunction with a pre-amplification step, a continuous decline in MRD level could be precisely monitored even after it became undetectable by conventional RQ-PCR. In this study, both rRQ-PCR and dPCR demonstrated successful detection of BCR-ABL transcripts not detectable in conventional RQ-PCR, and these data show the potential feasibility of highly sensitive PCR approaches for molecular monitoring and clinical relevance in future CML management by allowing further characterization of patients who achieve PCR negativity in a conventional RQ-PCR assay.","['Goh, Hyun-Gyung', 'Lin, Min', 'Fukushima, Takashi', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Kim, Dongho', 'Choi, Soo-Young', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Lee, Jeong', 'Lee, Young-Seok', 'Oh, Sang-Mi', 'Kim, Dong-Wook']","['Goh HG', 'Lin M', 'Fukushima T', 'Saglio G', 'Kim D', 'Choi SY', 'Kim SH', 'Lee J', 'Lee YS', 'Oh SM', 'Kim DW']","['Molecular Genetics Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Feasibility Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*standards', 'Nanotechnology/*instrumentation/methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/instrumentation/*methods/*standards', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2011/02/23 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/02/23 06:00'],"['2011/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.555569 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 May;52(5):896-904. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.555569.

The aim of this study was to analyze the secular trend of cancer mortality in Korea from 1983 to 2007. Mortality and population data from 1983 to 2007 were obtained from the Korea Statistical Office. The annual cancer death rates for 18 age groups were estimated, and joinpoint regression was applied to detect significant changes in cancer mortality. The age-standardized mortality rate for all sites combined increased until the mid-1990s and has been decreasing thereafter, this also being the case for cancers of the esophagus, liver, lung and bladder, as well as leukemia. With stomach and uterine cancers a constant reduction was evident throughout the period. The declines in stomach, liver, and uterine cancer mortality have made major contributions to the recent overall favorable trend. Mortality for cancers of the colon and rectum and the prostate increased in the early 2000s and then leveled off, whereas female breast cancer mortality has displayed a constant increasing trend. In conclusion, overall cancer mortality is decreasing in men and women in Korea, and this trend will probably continue and improve further in line with advances in management as well as the expected impact of the national screening program for major five cancers over the next decades.","['Jung, Kyu-Won', 'Shin, Hai-Rim', 'Kong, Hyun-Joo', 'Park, Sohee', 'Won, Young-Joo', 'Choi, Kui Son', 'Park, Eun-Cheol']","['Jung KW', 'Shin HR', 'Kong HJ', 'Park S', 'Won YJ', 'Choi KS', 'Park EC']","['National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Korea/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",2011/02/23 06:00,2011/07/22 06:00,['2011/02/23 06:00'],"['2011/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2010;11(6):1451-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A diagnostic difficulty is due to selectivity of the lesion in different groups of lymph nodes, which may be accompanied by no x-ray changes in the early stages of the process and by a disseminated lesion and polymorphism of its manifestations in the extensive stages of the disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-three patients with intrathoracic lymph node lesion were examined in 2003 to 2008. Conventional x-ray was a primary study. Later on multispiral computed tomography (MSCT) was performed, which was, if needed, supplemented by bolus contrast media injection and, in some cases, by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Lymph nodes were involved by lymphoma in 154 patients, among which lymphogranulomatosis was in 74 cases, malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 59, and chronic lympholeukemia in 21.

METHODS: Over a 5-year period, 127 patients (1,355 samples) were monitored for asparaginase activity in a single-center setting. We report monitoring data from throughout the ASNase containing treatment elements. Additional information obtained on risk stratification, minimal residual disease (MRD), steroid randomization and relapse is discussed in relation to ASNase activity. RESULTS: At completion of the induction phase 93% (115/124) of patients showed sufficient ASNase activity (5,000 U/m(2) Escherichia coli ASNase), 77 of 86 (90%) monitored patients finished the first re-intensification element without requiring Erwinia ASNase. MRD, risk stratification and steroid randomization were not associated with significant differences in ASNase activity. Of patients who relapsed, only 25% (3/12) were able to maintain sufficient ASNase activity after E. coli ASNase. CONCLUSION: This single-center data set gives a true and unbiased insight into clinical reality of ASNase therapy. It shows no significant relationship between MRD positivity or risk stratification and ASNase treatment intensity.

Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to: (a) estimate the rate of occurrence of ADHD and secondary ADHD (SADHD) in a sample of pediatric cancer survivors, (b) compare the rate of ADHD/SADHD among survivors to the prevalence of ADHD in the general population, and (c) examine clinical correlates of ADHD/SADHD in this sample. PROCEDURE: Survivors of pediatric ALL or brain tumor (n = 100) participated in an assessment of attention including a Computerized Performance Measure [Conners' Continuous Performance test-II (CPT-II)], parent and self-report measures (Conners 3), and a structured diagnostic interview for ADHD and other psychological disorders [Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-IV (DICA-IV)]. RESULTS: Binomial tests revealed that the rate of ADHD/SADHD in our sample (9%) was significantly greater than the lower limits of ADHD prevalence among children in the US (3%; P < 0.001), while no difference was identified compared to the upper limits of ADHD prevalence (7%; P > 0.05). Many additional survivors (>25% of the sample) obtained clinical elevations on Conners 3 scales but did not meet ADHD/SADHD criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Attentional deficits experienced by pediatric cancer survivors do not appear to resemble the clinical presentation of ADHD or SADHD. Many survivors with cognitive and behavioral difficulties related to attention were not identified using this diagnostic approach. Findings offer needed clarification to guide researchers and clinicians in conceptualizing, assessing, and intervening on attentional late effects.","['Kahalley, Lisa S', 'Conklin, Heather M', 'Tyc, Vida L', 'Wilson, Stephanie J', 'Hinds, Pamela S', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Hudson, Melissa M']","['Kahalley LS', 'Conklin HM', 'Tyc VL', 'Wilson SJ', 'Hinds PS', 'Wu S', 'Xiong X', 'Hudson MM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Psychology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA. lskahall@texaschildrens.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'United States/epidemiology']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22998 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Jul 15;57(1):110-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22998.

The protocol focused on: (1) Intensive chemotherapy preceding allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in early bone marrow relapse; (2) Rotational chemotherapy in late relapse, without donor; (3) Postponement of cerebro-spinal irradiation in late isolated CNS relapse; and (4) Treatment in very late bone marrow relapse with chemotherapy only. METHODS: From January 1999 until July 2006 all 158 Dutch pediatric patients with ALL in first relapse were recorded. Ninety-nine patients were eligible; 54 patients with early and 45 with late relapse. Eighteen patients had an isolated extra-medullary relapse; 69 patients had bone marrow involvement only. RESULTS: Five-years EFS rates for early and late relapses were 12% and 35%, respectively. For early relapses 5 years EFSs were 25% for patients transplanted; 0% for non-transplanted patients. For late relapses 5 years EFS was 64% for patients treated with chemotherapy only, and 16% for transplanted patients. For very late relapses EFS was 58%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest the superiority of SCT for early relapse patients. For late relapses a better outcome is achieved with chemotherapy only using the rotational chemotherapy scheme.

A series of similar rhodium(III) complexes were studied for comparison purposes. The antiproliferative activity toward MCF-7 cancer cells increases eightfold from IC50=4.6 for 1 to IC50=0.60 muM for 5, and an even more pronounced 18-fold improvement was established for the analogous rhodium complexes 6 and 8, the respective IC50 values for which are 1.1 and 0.06 muM. Annexin V/propidium iodide assays demonstrated that the 5,6-dimethylphenanthroline complexes 5 and 8 both cause significant inhibition of Jurkat leukemia cell proliferation and invoke extensive apoptosis but negligible necrosis. The percentages of Jurkat cells exhibiting high levels of reactive oxygen species correlate with the percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis.

A differential diagnosis is the transient myeloproliferative disorder observed in Down syndrome. We describe the case of an apparently healthy newborn male child presenting with normal peripheral blood (PB) counts but with a blast population on differentials. The child's condition and the blast population remained unchanged during the first year of life. METHODS: Bone marrow and PB were morphologically analyzed. Multiparametric flow cytometry was performed at the time of diagnosis and repeated at 1 year. These studies were completed by cytogenetic and molecular analyses. RESULTS: Bone marrow contained 40% of undifferentiated blasts. Multiparametric flow cytometry showed low expression of CD38, HLA-DR, and CD33 markers. All other markers were negative. Constitutional and blast cell karyotypes were normal. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed no rearrangement. Molecular studies were negative. The blast percentage remained stable during several months. After 1 year, the PB counts showed thrombocytopenia, with an increase of blast cells exhibiting the same phenotype. Clinically, an enlarged spleen was found. The child did not respond to chemotherapy and only partially to gemtuzumab ozogamicin. A cord blood cell transplantation was finally performed. With a follow-up of 12 months, the child is doing well. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of congenital acute leukemia with initially indolent course in a newborn without Down syndrome. This observation emphasizes the importance of a careful follow-up.","['Campos, Lydia', 'Nadal, Nathalie', 'Flandrin-Gresta, Pascale', 'Vasselon, Christian', 'Aanei, Carmen', 'Berger, Claire', 'Stephan, Jean Louis']","['Campos L', 'Nadal N', 'Flandrin-Gresta P', 'Vasselon C', 'Aanei C', 'Berger C', 'Stephan JL']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Nord, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Saint Etienne, France. lydia.campos@chu-st-etienne.fr""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Although several studies have reported concurrent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGL), coexistence of CMML and T-LGL has not been characterized. We describe here a unique case of CMML plus an underlying T-LGL-type clonal proliferation in a patient with a long standing history of severe anemia and recent pancytopenia. METHODS: Multiparametric immunophenotyping by flow cytometry was conducted using fresh peripheral blood collected in EDTA. In addition, morphologic evaluation of the peripheral blood smear and T-cell gene rearrangement studies by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed. RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis revealed abnormal monocytosis with multiple aberrancies including expression of cross-lineage markers CD2 and CD56, plus reduced expression of multiple antigens. In addition, abnormal CD8+ T-cells were identified, demonstrating dim expression of CD5 and dim to complete loss of CD7. In correlation with clinical history and morphologic review, a diagnosis of CMML plus underlying abnormal CD8+ T-cell lymphoproliferation was made. The clonality of these abnormal T-cells was confirmed by T-cell gene rearrangement studies. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a unique case of CMML in association with subclinical T-LGL, neither of which, alone, could fully explain the clinicopathologic features identified. Our findings suggest that the coexistence of these two entities may not be coincidental, and it is likely that they may share a common pathogenic pathway related to immune-dysregulation.","['Song, Sophie']",['Song S'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA/UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California 90095-1732, USA. ssong@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

METHODS: A retrospective review of all cases of confirmed SWS during an 8-year period was conducted. Clinical and historical data and outcome of the pregnancies were noted. Fetal biometry, skeletal survey, amniotic fluid volume and associated anomalies were recorded. A sonographic algorithm was proposed to distinguish SWS from other bent bone disorders. RESULTS: In total, there were 10 cases, six of which were diagnosed prenatally. The main prenatal features of SWS were mild-to-moderate micromelia and bowing of the lower limb bones, affecting the tibia more than the femur. There was relative sparing of fibula and upper limb bones, with normal scapulae and clavicles. Camptodactyly was the main associated anomaly. All fetuses developed growth restriction in the late second trimester with oligohydramnios in half of the cases. These features could appear late in pregnancy. Although the thoracic dimensions were normal in the majority of fetuses, respiratory insufficiency, as a result of myotonia, was a leading cause for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to diagnose SWS prenatally. SWS is associated with high mortality during the first year of life, and those who survive have high morbidity.","['Begam, M A', 'Alsafi, W', 'Bekdache, G N', 'Chedid, F', 'Al-Gazali, L', 'Mirghani, H M']","['Begam MA', 'Alsafi W', 'Bekdache GN', 'Chedid F', 'Al-Gazali L', 'Mirghani HM']","['OBYGN/Fetal Medicine Unit, Tawam Hospital, Al Ain, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol,Ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology : the official journal of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology,9108340,IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*diagnostic imaging/embryology/mortality', 'Algorithms', 'Biometry', 'Exostoses, Multiple Hereditary/*diagnostic imaging/embryology/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics', 'Male', 'Osteochondrodysplasias/*diagnostic imaging/embryology/mortality', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Ultrasonography, Prenatal']",2011/02/22 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/uog.8967 [doi]'],ppublish,Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol. 2011 Nov;38(5):553-8. doi: 10.1002/uog.8967.,,"['0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 ISUOG.

We also investigated the molecular mechanisms of I3M-induced antiangiogenic effects in HUVECs. We found that I3M significantly inhibited HUVEC proliferation (2.5-20 microM), migration (2.5-20 microM), and tube formation (10-20 microM) in HUVECs. The number of microvessels growing from the aortic rings was suppressed by I3M treatment. Moreover, I3M suppressed neovascularization in Matrigel plugs in mice. The underlying antiangiogenic mechanism of I3M was correlated with down-regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 activation, at least a part. These findings emphasize the potential use of I3M in pathological situations involving stimulated angiogenesis, such as tumor development.","['Kim, Jin-Kyung', 'Shin, Eun Kyung', 'Kang, Young-Hee', 'Park, Jung Han Yoon']","['Kim JK', 'Shin EK', 'Kang YH', 'Park JH']","['Department of Biomedical Science, Catholic University of Daegu, Gyeongsan-Si 712-702, Korea. toto0818@cu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Oximes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/07/21 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.23055 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2011 May;112(5):1384-91. doi: 10.1002/jcb.23055.,,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oximes)', ""0 (indirubin-3'-monoxime)"", 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are natural products that can be made with precise specificity and in almost unlimited amounts. In addition, mAbs can be selected or engineered to efficiently recruit the body's effector systems, such as complement and natural killer cells, against the unwanted cells in much the same way as they might destroy an invading pathogen. Unfortunately, progress in the clinic has been slow, and the cytotoxic activity achieved with mAb in vitro has failed to be transferred into patients. Despite this rather disappointing outcome, recent results in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with anti-CD20 and anti-CD52 (CAMPATH 1) mAb suggest, at least for certain neoplasms, that the situation may be changing (2,3). Stevenson and colleagues (personal communication) have recently achieved more than 70% complete responses in posttransplant lymphoma treated with a chimeric anti-CD20 mAb, and Maloney and co-workers (2) recently reported a 50% response rate in relapsed, low-grade, NHL, with a 10---11 mo duration. Encouragingly, patients in these studies did not raise antibody responses to the treatment anti-CD20 mAb and, unlike the situation following therapy in many lymphomas with anti-idiotype (Id) mAb, the emergence of antigen-negative tumors has not been seen (4). To underline its clinical success, anti-CD20 mAb (Rituximab) has now become the first anticancer mAb to become licensed by the FDA for lymphoma treatment. One of the most encouraging aspects of Rituximab treatment is that, in addition to its therapeutic activity, which appears to match that of more conventional chemotherapy in a similar setting, it has very few adverse effects and can be given to patients who are in poor condition with advanced disease. Early experience suggests that it will be this lack of adverse effects that will be its most attractive feature.","['Glennie, M J', 'Honeychurch, J', 'French, R R', 'Tutt, A L']","['Glennie MJ', 'Honeychurch J', 'French RR', 'Tutt AL']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Med,Methods in molecular medicine,101123138,,,2000/01/01 00:00,2000/01/01 00:01,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2000/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1385/1-59259-076-4:85 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Med. 2000;40:85-97. doi: 10.1385/1-59259-076-4:85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another success story is the introduction of trastuzumab in breast cancers overexpressing the HER-2 receptor. In contrast, there has been little progress in other malignancies such as metastatic malignant melanoma, although very recently, clinical trials with new targeted drugs have shown increased survival.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the functional role of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MEK)/Extracellular signal-regulated protein Kinase (ERK) signaling cascade in dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells in vitro and anti-leukemic activity in vivo. Human leukemia cells were treated with DHA in dose- and time-dependent manners, after which apoptosis, caspase activation, Mcl-1 expression, and cell signaling pathways were evaluated. Parallel studies were performed in AML and ALL primary human leukemia cells. In vivo anti-leukemic activity mediated by DHA was also investigated using U937 xenograft mouse model. Exposure of DHA resulted in a pronounced increase in apoptosis in both transformed and primary human leukemia cells but not in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. DHA-induced apoptosis was accompanied by caspase activation, cytochrome c release, Mcl-1 down-regulation, as well as MEK/ERK inactivation. Pretreatment with MEK inhibitor PD98059, which potentiated DHA-mediated MEK and ERK inactivation, intensified DHA-mediated apoptosis.

Furthermore, DHA-mediated inhibition of tumor growth of mouse U937 xenograft was associated with induction of apoptosis and inactivation of ERK.

However, recent study demonstrated the potentiating effect of rapamycin on all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated differentiation of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, prompting us to investigate the effects of longitudinal inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway on both proliferation and differentiative capacity of AML. In NB4, HL-60, U937 and K562 cell lines, rapamycin exerted minimal antiproliferative effects, and combining PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 and rapamycin inhibited proliferation more than LY 294002 alone. Rapamycin potentiated differentiation of ATRA-treated NB4 cells, but the combination of rapamycin and LY 294002 inhibited the expression of CD11b in both ATRA- and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated cells more than PI3K inhibitor alone. These results demonstrate that, although the combination of PI3K inhibitor and rapamycin is more effective in inhibiting proliferation of AML, the concomitant inhibition of PI3K and mTOR by LY 294002 and rapamycin has more inhibitory effects on ATRA-mediated differentiation than the presence of PI3K-inhibitor alone, and diminishes positive effects of rapamycin on leukemia cell differentiation.","['Mise, Josko', 'Dembitz, Vilma', 'Banfic, Hrvoje', 'Visnjic, Dora']","['Mise J', 'Dembitz V', 'Banfic H', 'Visnjic D']","['Department of Physiology, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2010/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12253-011-9365-z [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2011 Sep;17(3):645-56. doi: 10.1007/s12253-011-9365-z.

During phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate-induced differentiation of U937 cells, fatty acid synthesis and its metabolic processing, the clathrin-coated pit endocytosis pathway, and the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome degradation pathways were up-regulated. In addition, global histone H3/H4 acetylation and H2B ubiquitination were down-regulated concomitantly with impaired chromatin remodeling machinery, RNA polymerase II complexes, and DNA replication. Differential protein expression analysis established the networks linking histone hypoacetylation to the down-regulated expression/activity of p300 and linking histone H2B ubiquitination to the RNA polymerase II-associated FACT-RTF1-PAF1 complex.

It has become the standard of care for all patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML based on its successful induction of durable responses in most patients. However, its use is complicated by the development of resistance in some patients. Dose escalation might overcome this resistance if detected early. The second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) dasatinib and nilotinib provide effective therapeutic options for managing patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Recent studies have shown that dasatinib and nilotinib provide quicker and potentially better responses than standard-dose imatinib when used as a first-line treatment. The goal of therapy for patients with CML is the achievement of a complete cytogenetic response, and eventually a major molecular response, to prevent disease progression to accelerated or blast phase. Selecting the appropriate TKI depends on many factors, including disease phase, primary or secondary resistance to TKI, the agent's side effect profile and its relative effectiveness against BCR-ABL mutations, and the patient's tolerance to therapy. In October 2010, NCCN organized a task force consisting of a panel of experts from NCCN Member Institutions with expertise in the management of patients with CML to discuss these issues. This report provides recommendations regarding the selection of TKI therapy for the management of patients with CML based on the evaluation of available published clinical data and expert opinion among the task force members.","[""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Berman, Ellin', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Shami, Paul J', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Snyder, David S', 'Sundar, Hema M', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Wetzler, Meir']","[""O'Brien S"", 'Berman E', 'Moore JO', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Radich JP', 'Shami PJ', 'Smith BD', 'Snyder DS', 'Sundar HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Wetzler M']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/05/20 06:00,2011/07/20 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['9/Suppl_2/S-1 [pii]', '10.6004/jnccn.2011.0125 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2011 Feb;9 Suppl 2:S1-25. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2011.0125.,,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],PMC4234100,,,"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS632989'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for VRE colonization in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Tehran. METHODS: Stools were collected from children with ALL at the Ali Asghar Children's Hospital and the Mahak Pediatric Oncology Center between March 2007 and October 2008. Demographic features and potential risk factors for VRE colonization, including duration of ALL, presence of severe neutropenia in the preceding month, receipt of antibiotics in the preceding 3 months, concurrent medical problems, days of hospitalization, and the need for intensive care since the time of diagnosis of ALL, were recorded. RESULTS: VRE was identified from stools in 33 of 130 children with ALL (25%). No clear risk factors were identified for VRE colonization in the current study, but there was a trend towards an increased prevalence in children admitted to the intensive care unit since their ALL diagnosis (p=0.07). The VanA genotype was found in 28 of the 33 stools (85%), with all other enterococci being VanB. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of VRE colonization in children with ALL in Tehran is high. Modifiable risk factors have not been identified. The implementation of routine surveillance for colonization and an increased emphasis on adherence to standard infection control precautions may prevent spread.","['Nateghian, A', 'Robinson, J L', 'Arjmandi, K', 'Vosough, P', 'Karimi, A', 'Behzad, A', 'Navidnia, M']","['Nateghian A', 'Robinson JL', 'Arjmandi K', 'Vosough P', 'Karimi A', 'Behzad A', 'Navidnia M']","[""Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Ali Asghar Children's Hospital, Tehran, Iran.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Int J Infect Dis,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,9610933,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics', 'Carbon-Oxygen Ligases/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology', 'DNA, Bacterial/isolation & purification', 'Enterococcus/drug effects/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infection Control/standards', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', '*Vancomycin Resistance']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/08/23 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/31 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1201-9712(11)00022-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijid.2011.01.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Infect Dis. 2011 May;15(5):e332-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2011.01.006.

As a high throughput technology, gene trapping helped to generate tenth of thousands of ESC lines harboring mutations in single genes that can be used for making knock-out mice. Ongoing international efforts operating under the umbrella of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC; www.knockoutmouse.org) aim to generate conditional alleles for every protein coding gene in the mouse genome by high throughput conditional gene targeting and trapping. Here, we provide protocols for gene trapping in ESCs that can be easily adapted to any other mammalian cell. We further provide protocols for handling and verifying conditional gene trap alleles in ESC lines obtained from the IKMC repositories and describe a highly efficient method for the postinsertional modification of gene trap alleles. More specifically, we describe a protein tagging strategy based on recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) that enables protein localization and protein-protein interaction studies under physiological conditions.","['Schnutgen, Frank', 'Ehrmann, Franziska', 'Ruiz-Noppinger, Patricia', 'von Melchner, Harald']","['Schnutgen F', 'Ehrmann F', 'Ruiz-Noppinger P', 'von Melchner H']","['Department for Molecular Hematology, University of Frankfurt Medical School, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Methods,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",9426302,IM,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Culture Media', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Recombinases/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods', 'Transfection/methods']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1046-2023(11)00002-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.12.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods. 2011 Apr;53(4):347-55. doi: 10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.12.037.

SP and NKA have been shown to modulate hematopoiesis and rat/mouse HK-1 has been found to be involved in the survival and differentiation of mouse B-cells. This study was designed to assess the expression of tachykinins with a focus on human HK-1 (hHK-1) in human B lymphocytes and the role of these peptides in cell differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation. Expression of tachykinin and tachykinin receptor mRNA was determined quantitatively in human B lymphoproliferative malignancies and compared to normal B-cells. Expression of hHK-1 and NK(1) receptor, but not SP, was detected in human B-lymphocytes, and was up-regulated in B-lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, while it was down-regulated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Moreover, hHK-1, in contrast to SP, was able to induce proliferation of human pre-B lymphocytes through a NK(1) receptor-independent mechanism. These data suggest a role for hHK-1 in normal and pathological B lymphopoiesis, and open the door to a better understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms leading to lymphoproliferative malignancies.","['Grassin-Delyle, Stanislas', 'Buenestado, Amparo', 'Vallat, Laurent', 'Naline, Emmanuel', 'Marx, Sirima', 'Decocq, Julie', 'Debre, Patrice', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Advenier, Charles', 'Devillier, Philippe', 'Merle-Beral, Helene']","['Grassin-Delyle S', 'Buenestado A', 'Vallat L', 'Naline E', 'Marx S', 'Decocq J', 'Debre P', 'Bernard OA', 'Advenier C', 'Devillier P', 'Merle-Beral H']","['Laboratory of Pulmonary Pharmacology, UPRES EA220, Foch Hospital, University Versailles - Saint Quentin en Yvelines, Suresnes, France. s.grassindelyle@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Peptides,Peptides,8008690,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Receptors, Neurokinin-1/genetics', 'Receptors, Tachykinin/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tachykinins/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0196-9781(11)00081-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.peptides.2011.02.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Peptides. 2011 May;32(5):1027-34. doi: 10.1016/j.peptides.2011.02.012.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of cafestol on the apoptotic pathway in human renal Caki cells and other cancer cell lines. Cafestol treatment inhibited Caki cells viability a dose-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and the accumulation of sub-G1 phase. Cafestol-induced apoptosis is associated with the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), activation of caspase 3, cytochrome c release, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and cFLIP). Cafestol-induced apoptosis was blocked by pretreatment with broad caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, showing its dependence on caspases. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 in Caki cells attenuates cafestol-induced apoptosis. In addition, we have also shown that cafestol inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signal pathway, and PI3K inhibitor LY29004 significantly increases cafestol-induced apoptosis in Caki cells. Taken together, our results show the activity of cafestol to modulate multiple components in apoptotic response of human renal Caki cells and a potential as a therapeutic agent for preventing cancers such as renal carcinoma.","['Choi, Min Jung', 'Park, Eun Jung', 'Oh, Jung Hwa', 'Min, Kyoung-Jin', 'Yang, Eun Sun', 'Kim, Young Ho', 'Lee, Tae Jin', 'Kim, Sang Hyun', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Choi MJ', 'Park EJ', 'Oh JH', 'Min KJ', 'Yang ES', 'Kim YH', 'Lee TJ', 'Kim SH', 'Choi YH', 'Park JW', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 2800 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/07/27 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(11)00071-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2011.02.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2011 Apr 25;190(2-3):102-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2011.02.013.

They induce several types of cutaneous side effect, the most common being non-specific maculopapular rash and periocular oedema. Rare cases of panniculitis have been described in patients with CML treated with imatinib mesilate and dasatinib. We report a case of recurrent panniculitis in a patient with CML treated successively with imatinib mesilate and dasatinib. CASE REPORT: An 81-year-old woman diagnosed with chronic CML experienced two episodes of neutrophilic panniculitis following imatinib mesilate therapy, as well as relapse following replacement of imatinib mesilate by dasatinib. Several skin biopsies showed a neutrophilic infiltrate throughout the fatty tissue lobules, without vasculitis and without any evidence of bacterial infection. The symptoms gradually subsided without discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. DISCUSSION: Neutrophilic panniculitis is uncommon among patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and has only been described in patients treated for chronic myeloid leukaemia. We discuss the potential causative role of imatinib mesilate and dasatinib in onset of the disease, as well as differential diagnosis of neutrophilic panniculitis, which resembles subcutaneous Sweet's syndrome.","['de Masson, A', 'Bouvresse, S', 'Clerici, T', 'Mahe, E', 'Saiag, P']","['de Masson A', 'Bouvresse S', 'Clerici T', 'Mahe E', 'Saiag P']","['Research unit EA 4339 skin, cancer, and environment, service de dermatologie generale et oncologique, Faculty of medicine Paris-Ile-de-France Ouest, CHU A.-Pare, University of Versailles-SQY, 92104 Boulogne cedex, France. adele.de.masson@hotmail.fr']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Benzamides', 'Biopsy', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Eruptions/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/pathology', 'Panniculitis/*chemically induced/diagnosis/pathology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Recurrence', 'Skin/drug effects/pathology', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*toxicity']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/07/21 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2010/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0151-9638(10)00558-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annder.2010.11.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2011 Feb;138(2):135-9. doi: 10.1016/j.annder.2010.11.009.

Fe(3)O(4) NPs increased the ability of DNR to induce apoptosis in both adriamycin-sensitive and adriamycin-resistant K562 cells through the caspase 8-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase pathway. Fe(3)O(4) NPs combined with DNR also effectively inhibited the tumor growth induced by the inoculation of K562 cells into nude mice. The increased cell apoptotic rate was closely correlated with the enhanced inhibition of tumor growth. Biodistribution studies in xenograft tumors indicated that Fe(3)O(4) NPs could be potentially excreted from the body via the gastrointestinal system.

Biological plausibility for a causal role of benzene in these diseases comes from its toxicity to hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) or progenitor cells, from which all leukemias and related disorders arise. The effect of this toxicity is manifest as lowered blood counts (hematotoxicity), even in individuals occupationally exposed to low levels of benzene. Benzene can induce AML/MDS via several well-characterized pathways associated with these diseases. Through its metabolites, benzene induces multiple alterations that likely contribute to the leukemogenic process, and appears to operate via multiple modes of action. To improve mechanistic understanding and for risk assessment purposes, it may be possible to measure several of the key events in these modes of action in an in vitro model of the bone marrow stem cell niche. Even though benzene is leukemogenic at relatively low occupational levels of exposure, it seems unlikely that it is a major cause of leukemia in the general population exposed to benzene in the ppb range. Other established non-genetic causes of AML, e.g. smoking, ionizing radiation and cancer chemotherapy, also only explain about 20% of AML incidence, leaving approximately 80% unexplained. The question arises as to how to find the causes of the majority of de novo AMLs that remain unexplained. We propose that we should attempt to characterize the 'exposome' of human leukemia by using unbiased laboratory-based methods to find the unknown 'environmental' factors that contribute to leukemia etiology.","['Smith, Martyn T', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'McHale, Cliona M', 'Skibola, Christine F', 'Rappaport, Stephen M']","['Smith MT', 'Zhang L', 'McHale CM', 'Skibola CF', 'Rappaport SM']","['Genes and Environment Laboratory, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-7356, USA. martynts@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2010/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(11)00068-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2011.02.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2011 Jun 30;192(1-2):155-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2011.02.010.

Insufficient T-cell response to HTLV-1 is a potential risk factor in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Efficient induction of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes is important for immunological suppression of virus-infected cell proliferation and oncogenesis, but efficient induction of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes has evaded strategies utilizing poorly immunogenic free synthetic peptides. Here, we examined the efficient induction of an HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell response by oligomannose-coated liposomes (OMLs) encapsulating the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201-restricted HTLV-1 Tax-epitope (OML/Tax). Immunization of HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice with OML/Tax induced an HTLV-1-specific gamma-interferon reaction, whereas immunization with epitope peptide alone induced no reaction. Upon exposure of dendritic cells to OML/Tax, the levels of CD86, major histocompatibility complex class I, HLA-A02 and major histocompatibility complex class II expression were increased. In addition, our results showed that HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells can be efficiently induced by OML/Tax from HTLV-1 carriers compared with epitope peptide alone, and these HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells were able to lyse cells presenting the peptide. These results suggest that OML/Tax is capable of inducing antigen-specific cellular immune responses without adjuvants and may be useful as an effective vaccine carrier for prophylaxis in tumors and infectious diseases by substituting the epitope peptide.","['Kozako, Tomohiro', 'Hirata, Shinya', 'Shimizu, Yoshitaka', 'Satoh, Yuichiro', 'Yoshimitsu, Makoto', 'White, Yohann', 'Lemonnier, Francois', 'Shimeno, Hiroshi', 'Soeda, Shinji', 'Arima, Naomichi']","['Kozako T', 'Hirata S', 'Shimizu Y', 'Satoh Y', 'Yoshimitsu M', 'White Y', 'Lemonnier F', 'Shimeno H', 'Soeda S', 'Arima N']","['Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan. kozako@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', 'Liposomes/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oligosaccharides/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/*immunology']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08055.x [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2011 Apr;278(8):1358-66. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08055.x.

CASE REPORT: This report describes the case of a patient who received a single haploidentical NK-DLI for a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. He underwent a cytoreductive, immunosuppressive regimen before NK-DLI and received high-dose interleukin-2 in vivo for 8 weeks afterward. RESULTS: No major adverse effect was observed. Prospective phenotypic and functional studies of the NK cells showed major expansion of infused NK cells and, more importantly, of the alloreactive KIR2DL1+KIR2DL2/DL3-NKG2A- subset, which reached 117x10(6) cells/L on Day +14 after NK-DLI, the greatest expansion of infused alloreactive NK cells reported so far.

MicroRNAs play an important role in tumour suppression and the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of haematopoietic progenitors. Using a microarray platform, we evaluated microRNA expression from 44 patients with MDS and 17 normal controls. We identified a thirteen microRNA signature with statistically significant differential expression between normal and MDS specimens (P < 0.01), including down-regulation of members of the leukaemia-associated MIRLET7 family. A unique signature consisting of 10 microRNAs was closely associated with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk category permitting discrimination between lower (Low/Intermediate-1) and higher risk (Intermediate-2/High) disease (P < 0.01). Selective overexpression of MIR181 family members was detected in higher risk MDS, indicating pathogenetic overlap with acute myeloid leukaemia. Survival analysis of an independent cohort of 22 IPSS lower risk MDS patients revealed a median survival of 3.5 years in patients with high expression of MIR181 family compared to 9.3 years in patients with low MIR181 expression (P = 0.002).

In addition, recent studies have lead to the identification of about 10-15% of AML patients displaying high expression of FLT3, not associated with mutations of the receptor (FLT3 Wild-type High, FLT3WTH). These AMLs, as well as those displaying internal tandem duplication (ITD) are associated with an unfavourable prognosis. However, the biological features of these AMLs are poorly characterized. The present study explored the immunophenotypic features of FLT3WTH AMLs in 94 de novo cases of AML. The levels of FLT3 expression, as assessed by flow cytometry and FLT3 mutational status, was used to identify four AML subgroups: FLT3WTH (14/94); FLT3 Wild-type low (FLT3WTL, 48/94); FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3ITD 26/94); FLT3 aspartic acid 835 (FLT3D835, 6/94). FLT3WTH and FLT3ITD were characterized by: high white blast cell counts; predominance of M4 and M5 French-American-British classification subtypes and associated expression of myelo-monocytic markers; high expression of CD123 and TRAIL-Rs; high expression of receptors for angiogenic growth factors. Addition of FLT3 Ligand to human CD34(+) or monocytic cells stimulated CD123 and TRAIL-R expression. These findings are of potential value for the development of new therapeutic strategies.","['Riccioni, Roberta', 'Pelosi, Elvira', 'Riti, Viviana', 'Castelli, Germana', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Testa, Ugo']","['Riccioni R', 'Pelosi E', 'Riti V', 'Castelli G', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Testa U']","['Department of Haematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Receptor, TIE-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/05/07 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08577.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Apr;153(1):33-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08577.x.

This preliminary study, in the absence of substantial evidence, reported the prevalence of the BCR-ABL gene fusion in ALL patients by RT-PCR in Pakistan. Moreover, the prognostic significance of BCR-ABL fusion along with other characteristics was also ascertained. METHODS: One hundred forty six newly diagnosed ALL patients treated at our center between 2005 and 2008 comprised the study group. The patients were treated with a Children and Leukemia Group B induction regimen. RESULTS: Among these patients, BCR-ABL fusion oncogene was present in 43 of 78 patients (55%). A statistically significant difference in BCR-ABL-positivity within three age groups (<20 years, 20-50 years, >50 years) was observed (P= 0.001). The median age was significantly higher in the BCR-ABL+ group (30 vs 19 years; P= 0.001). BCR-ABL+ patients were also characterized by higher median WBC counts (96,000/microL vs 23,000//microL, P= 0.002). Complete remission was achieved in 74% BCR-ABL- patients and 35% BCR-ABL+ patients (P= 0.001). Only 10% of BCR-ABL- patients achieved continued complete remission (CR). None of the BCR-ABL+ patients maintained a CR further to induction therapy. With the available therapeutic protocol, the presence of a BCR-ABL fusion predicted a lower survival (P= 0.001). CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of BCR-ABL gene fusion was observed that appeared as a poor prognostic factor. Identification of this genetic entity at diagnosis is crucial for understanding the nature of adult ALL and for deciding optimal treatment.","['Faiz, Mariam', 'Iqbal, Qazi Javed', 'Qureshi, Asif']","['Faiz M', 'Iqbal QJ', 'Qureshi A']","['Clinical Pathology, Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology, New Campus Road, Lahore, Pakistan. faiz_mf@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/*therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1743-7563.2010.01370.x [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2011 Mar;7(1):47-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1743-7563.2010.01370.x.

Since 1990 anthracyclines have been a key component of chemotherapy regimens. However, there is increased understanding of the long-term, irreversible toxicities associated with these therapies, including cardiac failure and secondary leukemia. The development of the taxanes in the 1990s led to new adjuvant chemotherapy regimens and trials of various combinations in an effort to further increase survival and reduce toxicity. Concerns about cardiac toxicity were reinforced with the emergence of trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab alone causes cardiac toxicity and increases the risk of cardiac toxicity when combined with anthracyclines. These data, combined with recent results demonstrating the efficacy of non-anthracycline regimens in various disease settings, have generated interest in utilizing these therapies in patients with both HER2-positive and -negative tumors. This review outlines the evidence for the use of non-anthracycline adjuvant regimens in ESBC, including cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluoruoracil, docetaxel, carboplatin and trastuzumab and docetaxel and cyclophosphamide, which have demonstrated equivalent efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to anthracycline-based regimens in various trials. The review also examines evidence for the use of non-anthracycline regimens in patients who previously had restricted access to these therapies due to their negative lymph node status. The wider availability of these regimens increases options when deciding upon adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with ESBC, especially in patients with a high risk of cardiac toxicity.","['de Boer, Richard H', 'Chan, Arlene', 'Tran, Ben', 'Wilcken, Nicholas']","['de Boer RH', 'Chan A', 'Tran B', 'Wilcken N']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Vic. 3050, Australia. richard.deboer@mh.org.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,IM,"['Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Australia', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1743-7563.2010.01353.x [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2011 Mar;7(1):4-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1743-7563.2010.01353.x.

Risk of malignancies increases after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in FA carcinogenesis have been proposed. OBJECTIVE: To investigate prevalence of oral HPV in FA patients without oral malignant lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After oral examination, 76 subjects without detectable oral malignant lesions were included and classified in four groups: 20 FA submitted to HSCT (I), 22 FA not submitted to HSCT (II), 18 severe aplastic anemia (SAA) submitted to HSCT (III) and 16 healthy subjects (IV). Liquid-based cytology sampling, HPV screening by polymerase chain reaction and genotyping by reverse hybridization were performed. RESULTS: The HPV detection rates were: group I 35%, group II 27.3%, group III 38% and group IV 6.25%. Prevalence of high risk HPV types, mainly HPV16, was detected. Compared with control group, suggestions for increased likelihood of being HPV infected in SAA (OR = 9.55, 95% CI: 1.01-125.41) and FA patients submitted to HSCT (OR = 8.08, 0.83-72.29) emerged. CONCLUSION: Patients without oral malignant lesions submitted to HSCT, have high prevalence of oral HPV. HPV screening and close follow up should be considered in these patients.","['de Araujo, M R', 'Rubira-Bullen, I R F', 'Santos, C F', 'Dionisio, T J', 'Bonfim, C M S', 'De Marco, L', 'Gillio-Tos, A', 'Merletti, F']","['de Araujo MR', 'Rubira-Bullen IR', 'Santos CF', 'Dionisio TJ', 'Bonfim CM', 'De Marco L', 'Gillio-Tos A', 'Merletti F']","['Bauru School of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. melissararaujo@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Oral Dis,Oral diseases,9508565,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alphapapillomavirus/*classification', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Fanconi Anemia/*complications/therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotyping Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Human papillomavirus 16/isolation & purification', 'Human papillomavirus 18/isolation & purification', 'Human papillomavirus 6/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Diseases/*virology', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*complications', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1601-0825.2011.01803.x [doi]'],ppublish,Oral Dis. 2011 Sep;17(6):572-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1601-0825.2011.01803.x.

METHODS: The median levels of pro-BNP were found to be higher in the whole study group as compared with the control (55.9 +/- 53.1 ng/mL vs. 38.5 +/- 47.7 ng/mL, P= 0.059). The pro-BNP values >80.0 ng/mL (standard deviation score (SDS)) were noted in 11/44 patients, including those exceeding 115.0 ng/mL (2 SDS) - in 6/44 patients. RESULTS: No correlation was observed of pro-BNP levels with the accumulated dose of antracyclines (r=-0.42, P= 0.79) or mediastinal radiotherapy (r= 0.197, P= 0.2). However, negative correlation was found between pro-BNP and the time that had passed since therapy completion (r=-0.378, P= 0.009). In echocardiography, shortening and ejection fractions remained normal, whereas the indexed stroke volume was below 40 mL/m(2) in 16/44 patients. The E/A index below 1.5 was found in 6/44 cases. The left ventricular systolic mass remained within the normal range. Negative correlation was noted between isovolumetric diastolic time and pro-BNP level. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of pro-BNP after anti-cancer treatment with the involvement of cardiotoxic substances may indicate the first symptoms of myocardial dysfunction, despite the lack of major echocardiographic disorders.","['Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Dakowicz, Lucja', 'Hryniewicz, Andrzej', 'Maksymiuk, Agnieszka', 'Zelazowska-Rutkowska, Beata', 'Wysocka, Jolanta']","['Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Dakowicz L', 'Hryniewicz A', 'Maksymiuk A', 'Zelazowska-Rutkowska B', 'Wysocka J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland. rybak@umwb.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,J Paediatr Child Health,Journal of paediatrics and child health,9005421,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Chemoradiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Diastole/drug effects', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Ventricles/diagnostic imaging/pathology/physiopathology', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Peptide Fragments/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Stroke Volume/drug effects', 'Ventricular Function, Left/*drug effects', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/22 06:00,2012/03/02 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1754.2010.01991.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Paediatr Child Health. 2011 Jul;47(7):455-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1754.2010.01991.x.

Special risk group patients are at higher risk of vaccine-preventable diseases and hence require additional strategies to maximize protection against these diseases. The special risk groups include those with an underlying chronic disease, some of whom are on immunosuppressive therapy to treat that condition. The article uses four special risk groups (acute lymphoblastic leukemia; preterm birth; juvenile idiopathic arthritis; and inflammatory bowel disease), to highlight the management considerations and potential vaccination strategies. The risks, benefits and timing of vaccination in the setting of immunosuppression require detailed discussion with treating clinicians, in particular the use of live-attenuated vaccines. The immunogenicity of vaccines in these special risk groups helps provide the evidence base for their immunization guidelines. Protection can include 'cocooning' (i.e., ensuring appropriate immunizations within the immediate family; e.g., varicella, influenza and pertussis vaccination). Improving timeliness and minimizing missed opportunities to vaccinate individuals with these special risk conditions will also optimize protection from vaccine-preventable diseases.","['Crawford, Nigel W', 'Bines, Julie E', 'Royle, Jenny', 'Buttery, Jim P']","['Crawford NW', 'Bines JE', 'Royle J', 'Buttery JP']","['SAEFVIC, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia. nigel.crawford@rch.org.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Vaccines,Expert review of vaccines,101155475,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunization/*methods', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Pediatrics/*methods', 'Risk Management/*methods']",2011/02/22 06:00,2011/06/01 06:00,['2011/02/22 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/erv.10.157 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Vaccines. 2011 Feb;10(2):175-86. doi: 10.1586/erv.10.157.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a pathologic fracture of the neck of the femur because of a preexisting bone cyst he had been taking a combined analgetic therapy with tilidin, metamizole and diclofenac for three weeks. Physical examination was completely normal. INVESTIGATIONS: The differential blood count revealed a severe neutropenia of < 100/microl and an elevated C-reactive protein. Several blood cultures were negative. Despite multiple diagnostic procedures no focus of infection could be detected. A bone marrow biopsy showed an impaired maturation of granulocyte precursor cells with a predominance of promyelocytes. Acute leukaemia could be excluded. This finding is typical for a e. g. metamizole-induced agranulocytosis. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Treatment consisted of reverse isolation, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. In the following days, the clinical condition of the patient improved considerably and the neutrophil blood count normalized. CONCLUSION: This case report presents the clinical course of an acute drug-induced agranulocytosis. This condition has to be considered as a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of a variety of drugs, for example metamizole, and requires immediate treatment.","['Pfersdorff, M', 'Spes, J', 'Kraus, M R']","['Pfersdorff M', 'Spes J', 'Kraus MR']","['Medizinische Klinik II, Kreiskliniken Altotting-Burghausen.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Agranulocytosis/*chemically induced/diagnosis/therapy', 'Analgesics/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Cysts/complications', 'Deglutition Disorders/chemically induced', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dipyrone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Femoral Neck Fractures/drug therapy/etiology', 'Femur Neck', 'Fever/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Shivering']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/03/22 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0031-1272537 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2011 Feb;136(8):365-8. doi: 10.1055/s-0031-1272537.

New effective therapeutic approaches are needed for improvement of treatment outcome. A recent study showed that sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that acts predominantly through inhibition of Raf kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, exhibited potent antitumor activity in a preclinical model of cholangiocarcinoma cells. METHOD: We tested the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of sorafenib against human ICC cell lines. RESULTS: Treatment of ICC cells with sorafenib resulted in inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in the cell lines. In the cells treated with sorafenib, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and also interleukin-6-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) paralleled the reduced phosphorylation of STAT3. However, sorafenib induced no significant change in the cell cycle distribution and the expression levels of cyclin D1 and p27(Kip1) in the cells. For the in vivo antitumor activity, oral administration of sorafenib significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors established in immunodeficient mice at doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg. Moreover, administration of sorafenib (30 mg/kg) to animals with peritoneally disseminated ICC resulted in significantly prolonged survival compared with that of untreated animals (76 vs. 43 days in treated and vehicle-treated mice, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that sorafenib is a potent agent that may provide a new therapeutic option for human ICC.","['Sugiyama, Hiroaki', 'Onuki, Kenichiro', 'Ishige, Kazunori', 'Baba, Nobue', 'Ueda, Tetsuya', 'Matsuda, Sachiko', 'Takeuchi, Kaoru', 'Onodera, Masafumi', 'Nakanuma, Yasuni', 'Yamato, Masayuki', 'Yamamoto, Masakazu', 'Hyodo, Ichinosuke', 'Shoda, Junichi']","['Sugiyama H', 'Onuki K', 'Ishige K', 'Baba N', 'Ueda T', 'Matsuda S', 'Takeuchi K', 'Onodera M', 'Nakanuma Y', 'Yamato M', 'Yamamoto M', 'Hyodo I', 'Shoda J']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Gastroenterol,Journal of gastroenterology,9430794,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Survival Rate', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/10/13 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2010/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00535-011-0380-3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gastroenterol. 2011 Jun;46(6):779-89. doi: 10.1007/s00535-011-0380-3.

FA has been utilized in traditional Chinese medicine and possesses various pharmacological properties. Previously, we reported that FA extracted from solubilized excess sludge (SS-FA) had an inhibitory effect on beta-hexosaminidase release in human leukemia basophilic (KU812) cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of SS-FA on the immediate-type allergic reaction and studied its possible mechanisms of action in KU812 cells following activation with phorbol myristate acetate (20 nmol L(-1)) plus calcium ionophore A23187 (1 mumol L(-1)) (PMACI). The inhibitory effect of SS-FA on degranulation in PMACI-stimulated KU812 cells was examined using histamine release assay. SS-FA significantly decreased the histamine release in KU812 cells at concentrations of 0.1-10.0 mug mL(-1). To gain more information regarding the mechanism of the suppression of degranulation following SS-FA treatment, microarray was conducted to determine which genes were differentially expressed in response to SS-FA in PMACI-activated KU812 cells. From a total of 201 genes in the DNA chip, 28 genes were up-regulated and 173 genes were down-regulated in cells pretreated with SS-FA for 15 min and stimulated with PMACI. From the 71 genes that showed more than two fold change in expression, 16 genes were significantly down-regulated that were subjected to hierarchical clustering. SS-FA affected the expression of genes that were involved in the following pathways: signal transduction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, immune response, cell adhesion molecules and IgE receptor beta subunit response.","['Motojima, Hideko', 'O Villareal, Myra', 'Han, Junkyu', 'Isoda, Hiroko']","['Motojima H', 'O Villareal M', 'Han J', 'Isoda H']","['Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8572, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,,,2011/02/19 06:00,2011/02/19 06:01,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2010/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10616-010-9333-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytotechnology. 2011 Mar;63(2):181-90. doi: 10.1007/s10616-010-9333-6.

Staurosporine (STS) is an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) with an inhibitory effect on cancer cells through apoptosis induction. However, the exact mechanism of STS on MK differentiation is still unclear. The present study assessed the regulatory effect of STS on MK differentiation in both human leukemia cells and mouse bone marrow-derived stem cells. STS not only inhibited the proliferation of both K562 and HEL cell lines, but also induced the cell differentiation into MK lineage, resulting in polyploidy formation, MK-specific markers CD41 and CD61 expression, and platelet factor 4 (PF4) secretions of cells. The induction effect of STS was upregulated through the expression of Stat3, but not PKC. The level of phosphorylated (p)-Stat3 showed an increased expression, translocated to the nucleus, and enhanced the DNA-binding activity in STS-treated cells. Blockage Stat3 and its upstream molecule JAK by Stat3 inhibitor VI and JAK inhibitor I, respectively, demonstrated that the cells obviously reduced the percentage of STS-mediated MK differentiation. Further investigation of the cells with Stat3 siRNA transfection showed that p-Stat3 and MK differentiation was markedly decreased, indicating that Stat3 is an important molecule in inducing MK differentiation. Additionally, the ex vivo assay also confirmed that STS effectively stimulated CFU-MK colony formation and CD61 expression in bone marrow cells. In conclusion, STS is a potent inducer for MK differentiation through the upregulation of JAK/Stat3 signaling pathway and p-Stat3 nuclear translocation.","['Peng, Hsuan-Yu', 'Liao, Hui-Fen']","['Peng HY', 'Liao HF']","['Department of Biochemical Science and Technology, National Chiayi University, Chiayi 600, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2010/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1186-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Sep;90(9):1017-29. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1186-3.

Serum ferritin was measured before transplantation to evaluate iron overload. Of 114 adult patients who underwent transplantation between 2000 and 2008, 36 (32%) developed BSI. Of the 44 isolates, 63% were Gram-positive bacteria, 32% were Gram-negative bacteria, and 4% were fungi. The median time to the onset of the first BSI was day 28 (range day 0-95) after transplantation. Univariate analysis revealed a significantly higher incidence of BSI in the high (>/= 1,000 ng/ml, n = 57) than in the low (< 1,000 ng/ml, n = 57) ferritin group (42.1 versus 21.1%, respectively, P = 0.017). Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) (n = 23) showed a greater protective effect against BSI compared with bone marrow (n = 71) and cord blood (n = 20) transplantation. Pretransplantation serum ferritin (HR = 2.844, 95% CI: 1.180-6.859, P = 0.020) and PBSCT (HR = 0.135, 95% CI: 0.025-0.717, P = 0.019) were significant factors on multivariate analysis. In conclusion, pretransplantation serum ferritin significantly predicts BSI within the 100-day period after allo-HSCT.","['Tachibana, Takayoshi', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Takasaki, Hirotaka', 'Numata, Ayumi', 'Ito, Satomi', 'Watanabe, Reina', 'Hyo, Rie', 'Ohshima, Rika', 'Hagihara, Maki', 'Sakai, Rika', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Tomita, Naoto', 'Fujita, Hiroyuki', 'Maruta, Atsuo', 'Ishigatsubo, Yoshiaki', 'Kanamori, Heiwa']","['Tachibana T', 'Tanaka M', 'Takasaki H', 'Numata A', 'Ito S', 'Watanabe R', 'Hyo R', 'Ohshima R', 'Hagihara M', 'Sakai R', 'Fujisawa S', 'Tomita N', 'Fujita H', 'Maruta A', 'Ishigatsubo Y', 'Kanamori H']","['Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, 1-1-2 Nakao, Asahi-ku, Yokohama, 241-0815, Japan. tachibanat@kcch.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, 1-1-2 Nakao, Asahi-ku, Yokohama, 241-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, 1-1-2 Nakao, Asahi-ku, Yokohama, 241-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, 1-1-2 Nakao, Asahi-ku, Yokohama, 241-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of HSCT Data Management and Biostatistics, Nagoya University, School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, 1-1-2 Nakao, Asahi-ku, Yokohama, 241-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, 1-1-2 Nakao, Asahi-ku, Yokohama, 241-0815, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adult', 'Bacterial Infections/*blood', 'Female', 'Ferritins/*blood', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*blood', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/*therapy', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/07/01 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2010/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0784-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0784-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Mar;93(3):368-374. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0784-0.

Increase in mtDNA copies in cancer cells has been suggested to play a role in MD/PRD. CSF as well as blood specimens from 6 children were assayed for MD/PRD and mtDNA copy numbers by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of 7 MD/PRD-positive specimens, 6 had increased mtDNA copy numbers; while 11 MD/PRD-negative specimens had no increase in mtDNA copy numbers, p < 0.003. This is the first proof-of-concept study to measure mtDNA copy numbers in MD/PRD-positive CSF specimens from children with ALL. Increase of mtDNA copy numbers in MD/PRD childhood ALL cells and its significance as a mechanism for recurrence requires further investigation.

However, allosteric inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin has only modest effects in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Recently, ATP-competitive inhibitors specific for the mTOR kinase active site have been developed. In this study, we have explored the therapeutic potential of active-site mTOR inhibitors against both T-ALL cell lines and primary samples from T-ALL patients displaying activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2. The inhibitors affected T-ALL cell viability by inducing cell-cycle arrest in G(0)/G(1) phase, apoptosis and autophagy. Western blot analysis demonstrated a Ser 473 Akt dephosphorylation (indicative of mTORC2 inhibition) and a dephosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream targets. Unlike rapamycin, we found a marked inhibition of mRNA translation in T-ALL cell lines treated with active-site mTOR inhibitors. The inhibitors strongly synergized with both vincristine and the Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT-263. Remarkably, the drugs targeted a putative leukemia-initiating cell sub-population (CD34(+)/CD7(-)/CD4(-)) in patient samples. In conclusion, the inhibitors displayed remarkable anti-leukemic activity, which emphasizes their future development as clinical candidates for therapy in T-ALL.","['Evangelisti, C', 'Ricci, F', 'Tazzari, P', 'Tabellini, G', 'Battistelli, M', 'Falcieri, E', 'Chiarini, F', 'Bortul, R', 'Melchionda, F', 'Pagliaro, P', 'Pession, A', 'McCubrey, J A', 'Martelli, A M']","['Evangelisti C', 'Ricci F', 'Tazzari P', 'Tabellini G', 'Battistelli M', 'Falcieri E', 'Chiarini F', 'Bortul R', 'Melchionda F', 'Pagliaro P', 'Pession A', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Human Anatomy, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201120 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.20 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 May;25(5):781-91. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.20.

However, alloantigen reactivity towards non-malignant tissues also induces graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Defining T-cell subpopulations that mediate the GVT effect in the absence of GVHD induction remains a major challenge in allogeneic BM transplantation. In this study, we show that in vitro-generated alloantigen-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) established by weekly stimulation with alloantigen-expressing antigen-presenting cells did not induce GVHD in two major histocompatibility complex-mismatched BM transplantation models, where induction of lethal GVHD is dependent on the presence of either CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells. Despite their strong alloantigen specificity, transplantation of CTLs did not induce the expression of GVHD-associated cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha or clinical or histological signs of GVHD, and lead to a survival rate of above 90%. However, transplantation of unstimulated CD8(+) T cells, which were not primed by the alloantigen in vitro, induced GVHD in both the transplantation models. Although CTLs were impaired in GVHD induction, they efficiently eradicated Bcr-Abl-transformed B-cell leukemias or mastocytomas. Thus, in vitro-derived CTLs might be useful for optimizing anti-tumor therapy in the absence of GVHD induction.","['Hartmann, N', 'Leithauser, F', 'Albers, C', 'Duyster, J', 'Moller, P', 'Debatin, K-M', 'Strauss, G']","['Hartmann N', 'Leithauser F', 'Albers C', 'Duyster J', 'Moller P', 'Debatin KM', 'Strauss G']","[""University Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/mortality', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*immunology', 'Isoantigens/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Spleen/cytology/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201116 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.16 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 May;25(5):848-55. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.16.

The new fusion proteins, therefore, differently from the wild-type RARalpha, which forms only heterodimers with retinoic X receptor alpha, are also able to homo-oligomerize. The presence of such a domain has been suggested to be crucial for the leukemogenic potential of the chimeric proteins found in APL blasts. Whether or not any self-association domain is sufficient to bestow a leukemogenic activity on RARalpha is still under investigation. In this work, we address this question using two different X-RARalpha chimeras, where X represents the coiled-coil domain of PML (CC-RARalpha) or the oligomerization portion of the yeast transcription factor GCN4 (GCN4-RARalpha). We demonstrate that in vitro both proteins have transforming potential, and recapitulate the main PML-RARalpha biological properties, but CC-RARalpha is uniquely able to disrupt PML nuclear bodies. Indeed, in vivo only the CC-RARalpha chimera induces efficiently APL in a murine transplantation model. Thus, the PML CC domain represents the minimal structural determinant indispensable to transform RARalpha into an oncogenic protein.","['Occhionorelli, M', 'Santoro, F', 'Pallavicini, I', 'Gruszka, A', 'Moretti, S', 'Bossi, D', 'Viale, A', 'Shing, D', 'Ronzoni, S', 'Muradore, I', 'Soncini, M', 'Pruneri, G', 'Rafaniello, P', 'Viale, G', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Minucci, S']","['Occhionorelli M', 'Santoro F', 'Pallavicini I', 'Gruszka A', 'Moretti S', 'Bossi D', 'Viale A', 'Shing D', 'Ronzoni S', 'Muradore I', 'Soncini M', 'Pruneri G', 'Rafaniello P', 'Viale G', 'Pelicci PG', 'Minucci S']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, IFOM-IEO Campus, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Multimerization', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201118 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.18 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 May;25(5):814-20. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.18.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 42 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who had an evaluable lesion and provided informed consent for participation in the present study were analyzed. Irinotecan was administered intravenously at a dose of 60 mg/m on days 1 and 15. Etoposide was administered orally at a daily dose of 50 mg/body weight from days 1 to 21. A 28-day period comprised one cycle. The tumor response, adverse events, progression-free survival, and overall survival were examined. Tumor response was evaluated based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and the serum CA125 levels (Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria). Adverse events were assessed according to the NCI-CTCAE (version 3.0). RESULTS: Partial response was observed in 21 patients, stable disease in 14 patients, and progressive disease in 7 patients. The response rate was 50.0%, and the clinical benefit (partial response + stable disease) rate was 83.3%. Hematological toxicities of at least grade 3 severity included leukopenia in 21 patients (50.0%), neutropenia in 22 patients (52.4%), thrombocytopenia in 1 patient (2.4%), anemia in 9 patients (21.4%), and febrile neutropenia in 3 patients (7.1%). Nonhematological toxicities of at least grade 3 severity included queasy feeling in 5 patients (11.9%), vomiting in 3 patients (7.1%), and diarrhea in 2 patients (4.8%). Acute myeloid leukemia occurred in one patient (2.4%).

In this study, we attempted to identify cell-surface markers for leukemia-initiating cells in FA-AML patients. We found that the IL-3 receptor-alpha (IL-3Ralpha) is a promising candidate as an leukemia-initiating cell-specific antigen for FA-AML. Whereas IL-3Ralpha expression is undetectable on normal CD34(+)CD38(-) HSCs, it is overexpressed on CD34(+)CD38(-) cells from FA patients with AML. We examined the leukemia-initiating cell activity of IL-3Ralpha-positive FA-AML cells in a ""humanized"" FA xenotransplant model in which we separated AML cells into IL-3Ralpha-positive and IL-3Ralpha-negative CD34 fractions and transplanted them into irradiated recipient mice. In all 3 FA-AML samples, only IL-3Ralpha-positive cells showed significant levels of engraftment and developed leukemia in the recipient mice. The FA CD34(+)IL-3Ralpha(+) blasts isolated from leukemic mice exhibited hypersensitivity to IL-3 deprivation and JAK2-STAT5 overactivation after IL-3 treatment. Finally, treatment of FA CD34(+)IL-3Ralpha(+) blasts with an IL-3Ralpha-neutralizing antibody inhibited IL-3-mediated proliferation and STAT5 activation. These results demonstrate that IL-3Ralpha is a cell-surface marker present on FA-AML leukemia-initiating cells and may be a valuable therapeutic target.","['Du, Wei', 'Li, Xu-E', 'Sipple, Jared', 'Pang, Qishen']","['Du W', 'Li XE', 'Sipple J', 'Pang Q']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA. wei.du@cchmc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Fanconi Anemia/*complications/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/immunology', 'Janus Kinase 2/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/immunology', 'Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', '*Up-Regulation']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/07/14 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45236-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-09-309179 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 21;117(16):4243-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-09-309179.

Knockdown of nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCOA6) or MLL3/MLL4 mRNAs by small interfering RNA treatment led to a decrease in BSEP and NTCP mRNA levels in hepatoma cells. Human BSEP promoter transactivation by FXR/RXR was enhanced in a dose-dependent fashion by NCOA6 cDNA coexpression and decreased by AdsiNCOA6 infection in HepG2 cells. GST-pull down assays showed that domain 3 and 5 of NCOA6 (LXXLL motifs) interacted with FXR and that the interaction with domain 5 was enhanced by chenodeoxycholic acid. In vivo ChIP assays in HepG2 cells revealed ligand-dependent recruitment of ASCOM complex to FXR element in BSEP and GR element in NTCP promoters, respectively. ChIP analysis demonstrated significantly diminished recruitment of ASCOM complex components and H3K4me3 to Bsep and Mrp2 promoter FXR elements in mouse livers after CBDL. Taken together, these data show that the ""H3K4me3"" epigenetic mark is essential to activation of BSEP, NTCP, and MRP2 genes by nuclear receptors and is downregulated in cholestasis.","['Ananthanarayanan, M', 'Li, Yanfeng', 'Surapureddi, S', 'Balasubramaniyan, N', 'Ahn, Jaeyong', 'Goldstein, J A', 'Suchy, Frederick J']","['Ananthanarayanan M', 'Li Y', 'Surapureddi S', 'Balasubramaniyan N', 'Ahn J', 'Goldstein JA', 'Suchy FJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA. mananthanarayanan@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,American journal of physiology.

In a murine xenograft T-leukemia/lymphoma model, combined bevacizumab (monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor-A) with doxorubicin, compared with doxorubicin alone, significantly delayed tumor growth and induced prevalence of tumor cell apoptosis over mitosis. More importantly, the combined treatment induced endothelial cell swelling, microvessel occlusions, and tumor necrosis. In vitro, co-culture of endothelial cells with T-leukemia/lymphoma cells showed that doxorubicin induced expression of intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1, provided endothelial and malignant T cells were in direct contact. This was abrogated by bevacizumab treatment with doxorubicin. Taken together, bevacizumab enhances the chemotherapeutic effect on T-leukemia/lymphoma cells.

DESIGN AND METHODS: From February 2003 to February 2007, 113 patients aged more than 60 years with de novo acute myeloid leukemia were enrolled in a prospective observational study. Two different quality of life instruments were employed: the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and a health-related quality of life questionnaire for patients with hematologic diseases (QOL-E). RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (42.4%) received intensive chemotherapy and 65 (57.6%) were given palliative treatments. Age greater than 70 years (P=0.007) and concomitant diseases (P=0.019) had a significant impact on treatment allocation. At diagnosis, general quality of life was affected [median QOL-E standardized score 54, interquartile range 46-70; median EORTC global score 50, interquartile range 41-66]. Most patients were given a good ECOG Performance Status (< 2), which did not correlate with the patients' perception of quality of life. At multivariate analysis, palliative approaches (P=0.016), age more than 70 years (P=0.013) and concomitant diseases (P=0.035) each had an independent negative impact on survival. In a multivariate model corrected for age, concomitant diseases and treatment option, survival was independently predicted by QOL-E functional (P=0.002) and EORTC QLQ-C30 physical function (P=0.030) scores. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life could have an important role in elderly acute myeloid leukemia patients at diagnosis as a prognostic factor for survival and a potential factor for treatment decisions.","['Oliva, Esther N', 'Nobile, Francesco', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Ronco, Francesca', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Impera, Stefana', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Vincelli, Iolanda', 'Carmosino, Ida', 'Guglielmo, Patrizia', 'Pastore, Domenico', 'Alati, Caterina', 'Latagliata, Roberto']","['Oliva EN', 'Nobile F', 'Alimena G', 'Ronco F', 'Specchia G', 'Impera S', 'Breccia M', 'Vincelli I', 'Carmosino I', 'Guglielmo P', 'Pastore D', 'Alati C', 'Latagliata R']","['Hematology Division, Azienda Ospedaliera ""Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli"", Via Melacrino, 89100 Reggio Calabria, Italy. estheroliva@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*psychology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Palliative Care', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', '*Quality of Life', '*Surveys and Questionnaires']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.036715 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.036715 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 May;96(5):696-702. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.036715.

Inter-laboratory reproducibility is, therefore, a crucial issue which requires standardization and strict alignment of BCR-ABL1 values to the international scale. An automated cartridge-based assay (Xpert BCR-ABL Monitor(), Cepheid) had been proposed as a robust alternative to non-automated assays. This study aimed to compare inter-laboratory reproducibility of automated and non-automated quantification, the possibility of converting automated results to the international scale, and the potential economic impact of automation. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and eighteen blood samples from chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors were prospectively analyzed in two laboratories using both automated and non-automated assays. The economic evaluation involved a micro-costing study and average costs were assessed as a function of sample throughput. RESULTS: Automated assays achieved similar inter-laboratory reproducibility to highly standardized non-automated assays and a short delay (</=6 h) between sampling and blood lysis had a positive impact on inter-laboratory reproducibility. Reporting automated BCR-ABL1 ratios on the international scale was possible using a specific conversion factor which may vary with batches. Cost assessment showed that automated assays could be relevant for annual activity levels below 300 since average costs were lower than those of the non-automated assays. CONCLUSIONS: The Xpert BCR-ABL Monitor() assay could be appropriately used in a near-patient setting for routine quantification of e13/e14-a2 transcripts, preferably in partnership with a regional reference laboratory. However, its prognostic impact relative to non-automated quantification remains to be tested prospectively within appropriate clinical trials.","['Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Darlington, Meryl', 'Abdelali, Raouf Ben', 'Fund, Xavier', 'Villarese, Patrick', 'Tulliez, Michel', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Sigaux, Francois', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Seror, Valerie']","['Cayuela JM', 'Macintyre E', 'Darlington M', 'Abdelali RB', 'Fund X', 'Villarese P', 'Tulliez M', 'Raffoux E', 'Sigaux F', 'Rea D', 'Seror V']","[""Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, 1 av.

We analyzed survival for lymphoid neoplasms in Europe by disease group, comparing survival between different European regions by age and sex. DESIGN AND METHODS: Incident neoplasms recorded between 1995 to 2002 in 48 population-based cancer registries in 20 countries participating in EUROCARE-4 were analyzed. The period approach was used to estimate 5-year relative survival rates for patients diagnosed in 2000-2002, who did not have 5 years of follow up. RESULTS: The 5-year relative survival rate was 57% overall but varied markedly between the defined groups. Variation in survival within the groups was relatively limited across European regions and less than in previous years. Survival differences between men and women were small. The relative survival for patients with all lymphoid neoplasms decreased substantially after the age of 50. The proportion of 'not otherwise specified' diagnoses increased with advancing age. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to analyze survival of patients with lymphoid neoplasms, divided into groups characterized by similar epidemiological and clinical characteristics, providing a benchmark for more detailed analyses. This Europe-wide study suggests that previously noted differences in survival between regions have tended to decrease.

We investigated the antileukemic activity and mechanism of action of zalypsis, a novel alkaloid of marine origin. DESIGN AND METHODS: The activity of zalypsis was studied in four acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and in freshly isolated blasts taken from patients with acute myeloid leukemia before they started therapy. Zalypsis-induced apoptosis of both malignant and normal cells was measured using flow cytometry techniques. Gene expression profiling and western blot studies were performed to assess the mechanism of action of the alkaloid. RESULTS: Zalypsis showed a very potent antileukemic activity in all the cell lines tested and potentiated the effect of conventional antileukemic drugs such as cytarabine, fludarabine and daunorubicin. Interestingly, zalypsis showed remarkable ex vivo potency, including activity against the most immature blast cells (CD34(+) CD38(-) Lin(-)) which include leukemic stem cells. Zalypsis-induced apoptosis was the result of an important deregulation of genes involved in the recognition of double-strand DNA breaks, such as Fanconi anemia genes and BRCA1, but also genes implicated in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks, such as RAD51 and RAD54. These gene findings were confirmed by an increase in several proteins involved in the pathway (pCHK1, pCHK2 and pH2AX). CONCLUSIONS: The potent and selective antileukemic effect of zalypsis on DNA damage response mechanisms observed in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and in patients' samples provides the rationale for the investigation of this compound in clinical trials.","['Colado, Enrique', 'Paino, Teresa', 'Maiso, Patricia', 'Ocio, Enrique M', 'Chen, Xi', 'Alvarez-Fernandez, Stela', 'Gutierrez, Norma C', 'Martin-Sanchez, Jesus', 'Flores-Montero, Juan', 'San Segundo, Laura', 'Garayoa, Mercedes', 'Fernandez-Lazaro, Diego', 'Vidriales, Maria-Belen', 'Galmarini, Carlos M', 'Aviles, Pablo', 'Cuevas, Carmen', 'Pandiella, Atanasio', 'San-Miguel, Jesus F']","['Colado E', 'Paino T', 'Maiso P', 'Ocio EM', 'Chen X', 'Alvarez-Fernandez S', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Martin-Sanchez J', 'Flores-Montero J', 'San Segundo L', 'Garayoa M', 'Fernandez-Lazaro D', 'Vidriales MB', 'Galmarini CM', 'Aviles P', 'Cuevas C', 'Pandiella A', 'San-Miguel JF']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC/CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'BRCA1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Rad51 Recombinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.036400 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.036400 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 May;96(5):687-95. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.036400.

In parallel in vivo treatment response was assessed by determining the presence and extent of minimal residual disease in a subset of patients (n=224). Here we report the long-term impact of in vitro sensitivity-based risk stratification according to survival and compare the results of in vitro sensitivity with in vivo response. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with a sensitive in vitro profile were treated with a reduced intensity protocol (n=167) whereas patients defined as low risk according to conventional parameters but with a resistant in vitro profile were given intensified therapy (n=47). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 6.8 years event-free survival was 0.80+/-0.03 for patients with a sensitive profile, 0.73+/-0.03 for those with an intermediate profile and 0.67+/-0.08 for those with a resistant profile (P=0.015). Overall, the treatment results of the cases stratified according to in vitro sensitivity were similar to those of the historical control group stratified based on conventional risk factors. Minimal residual disease at the end of induction was a strong predictor of outcome in B-precursor and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. There was no correlation between in vitro and in vivo treatment response in B-precursor leukemia (Spearman's r=0.13; P=0.15) in contrast to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Spearman's r=0.63; P<0.001) CONCLUSIONS: A moderate reduction in treatment intensity for patients with a sensitive in vitro profile was possible without jeopardizing treatment outcome. However, in vitro drug testing was affected by a decrease in risk predictive power over time and was not correlated with in vivo assessment of minimal residual disease in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It was, therefore, abandoned in favor of the assessment of in vivo response in subsequent CoALL trials.","['Escherich, Gabriele', 'Troger, Anja', 'Gobel, Ulrich', 'Graubner, Ulrike', 'Pekrun, Arnulf', 'Jorch, Norbert', 'Kaspers, Gjl', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'zur Stadt, Udo', 'Kazemier, Karin', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Den Boer, Monique L', 'Horstmann, Martin', 'Janka, Gritta E']","['Escherich G', 'Troger A', 'Gobel U', 'Graubner U', 'Pekrun A', 'Jorch N', 'Kaspers G', 'Zimmermann M', 'zur Stadt U', 'Kazemier K', 'Pieters R', 'Den Boer ML', 'Horstmann M', 'Janka GE']","['University Medical Center, Eppendorf Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Martinistrasse 52 20246, Hamburg, Germany. escherich@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/09/22 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.039735 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.039735 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Jun;96(6):854-62. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.039735.

AFF2/FMR2 is silenced in FRAXE intellectual disability, while the other three members have been reported to form fusion genes as a consequence of chromosome translocations with the myeloid/lymphoid or mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). All AFF proteins are localized in the nucleus and their role as transcriptional activators with a positive action on RNA elongation was primarily studied. We have recently shown that AFF2/FMR2 localizes to nuclear speckles, subnuclear structures considered as storage/modification sites of pre-mRNA splicing factors, and modulates alternative splicing via the interaction with the G-quadruplex RNA-forming structure. We show here that similarly to AFF2/FMR2, AFF3/LAF4 and AFF4/AF5q31 localize to nuclear speckles and are able to bind RNA, having a high apparent affinity for the G-quadruplex structure. Interestingly, AFF3/LAF4 and AFF4/AF5q31, like AFF2/FMR2, modulate, in vivo, the splicing efficiency of a mini-gene containing a G-quadruplex structure in one alternatively spliced exon. Furthermore, we observed that the overexpression of AFF2/3/4 interferes with the organization and/or biogenesis of nuclear speckles. These findings fit well with our observation that enlarged nuclear speckles are present in FRAXE fibroblasts. Furthermore, our findings suggest functional redundancy among the AFF family members in the regulation of splicing and transcription. It is possible that other members of the AFF family compensate for the loss of AFF2/FMR2 activity and as such explain the relatively mild to borderline phenotype observed in FRAXE patients.","['Melko, Mireille', 'Douguet, Dominique', 'Bensaid, Mounia', 'Zongaro, Samantha', 'Verheggen, Celine', 'Gecz, Jozef', 'Bardoni, Barbara']","['Melko M', 'Douguet D', 'Bensaid M', 'Zongaro S', 'Verheggen C', 'Gecz J', 'Bardoni B']","['CNRS UMR 6097, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, 06560 Valbonne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Fragile X Syndrome/*genetics/*pathology', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Gene Order', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Space/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA Splicing/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ddr069 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddr069 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2011 May 15;20(10):1873-85. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddr069.

With modern multi-drug induction chemotherapy regimens, complete remission can be achieved in most patients. However, without additional therapy at the time of the first remission, most patients will eventually relapse. Regardless of the treatment option chosen at the time of relapse, outcomes after relapse are poor, with only around 10% of all patients surviving after relapse. Thus, decision-making at the time of achieving the first complete remission is critical. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is highly effective at preventing relapse, but with significant treatment related toxicity. Ongoing chemotherapy in the form of consolidation and maintenance may be less effective at preventing relapse, but with lower toxicities. Thus, the superiority of allogeneic stem cell transplantation must be balanced against the lower toxicity of consolidation chemotherapy. This decision is further complicated by rapid changes in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, such as the use of reduced intensity conditioning regimens and alternative stem cell sources such as cord blood transplants. The available evidence suggests that allogeneic transplantation is a viable treatment option for patients in first complete remission, with overall survival superior to traditional consolidation and maintenance chemotherapy. However, whether transplantation based post-remission therapy is superior to modern, pediatric-based non-transplant chemotherapy regimens remains unclear.","['Paulson, K', 'Szwajcer, D', 'Seftel, M D']","['Paulson K', 'Szwajcer D', 'Seftel MD']","['University of Manitoba, CancerCare Manitoba, ON 2076, 675 McDermot Avenue, Winnipeg, MB, Canada R3E 0V9.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Transfus Apher Sci,Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,101095653,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hematology/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1473-0502(11)00032-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transci.2011.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Apher Sci. 2011 Apr;44(2):197-203. doi: 10.1016/j.transci.2011.01.016.

Human UTY (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat protein on the chromosome Y) has six mRNA-transcripts. UTY is subject to interdisciplinary approaches such as Y chromosomal genetics or development of leukemia immunotherapy based on UTY-specific peptides. Investigating UTY expression in a normal and leukemic setting we discovered an exceptional splicing phenomenon fostering huge transcript diversity. Transcript sequencing identified 90 novel AS-events being almost randomly combined in 284 new transcripts. We uncovered a novel system of transcript architecture and genomic organization in UTY. On a basis of a new UTY-splicing multigraph including a mathematical model we calculated the theoretical yield to exceed 1.3 billion distinct transcripts. To our knowledge, this is the greatest estimated transcript diversity by AS. On protein level we demonstrated interaction of AS-derived proteins with new interactors by yeast-two-hybrid assay. For translational research we predicted new UTY-peptide candidates for leukemia therapy development. Our study provides new insights into the complexity of human alternative splicing and its potential contribution to the transcript diversity of the transcriptome.","['Laaser, Ingeborg', 'Theis, Fabian J', 'de Angelis, Martin Hrabe', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Adamski, Jerzy']","['Laaser I', 'Theis FJ', 'de Angelis MH', 'Kolb HJ', 'Adamski J']","['Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Institute of Experimental Genetics, Genome Analysis Center, Neuherberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,OMICS,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/omi.2010.0107 [doi]'],ppublish,OMICS. 2011 Mar;15(3):141-54. doi: 10.1089/omi.2010.0107.

This has resulted in a lack of evidence that has complicated treatment in this patient group. However, data from an increasing number of subgroup analyses of recent trials as well as from trials specifically designed for elderly patients with CLL have provided some insight into the feasibility of the available treatments, thus allowing development of the first evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacotherapeutic management of these patients. Physically fit patients without significant co-morbidity are likely to benefit from the standard treatment of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). However, whether treatment with purine analogues and/or CD20 antibodies is also beneficial in physically unfit patients suffering from additional health problems remains to be determined. Latest data suggest that the alkylating drug chlorambucil rather than fludarabine is a reasonable chemotherapeutic backbone for chemoimmunotherapy in these patients. Trials are now underway to investigate combinations of chlorambucil with rituximab or with novel CD20 antibodies (GA101 [afutuzumab], ofatumumab) in older CLL patients. In parallel, other regimens, including bendamustine or lenalidomide with or without the addition of rituximab, low-dose fludarabine and low-dose FCR, hold promise in elderly patients with previously untreated or relapsed CLL.","['Goede, Valentin', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Goede V', 'Hallek M']","['German CLL Study Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany. valentin.goede@uk-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Frail Elderly', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Physical Fitness', 'Stem Cells']",2011/02/19 06:00,2011/08/16 06:00,['2011/02/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1 [pii]', '10.2165/11587650-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs Aging. 2011 Mar 1;28(3):163-76. doi: 10.2165/11587650-000000000-00000.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistant T cells were obtained by G418 selection for one week. Then transduced T lymphocytes and primary CLL cells were co-cultured. The status of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells were observed by microscope. The level of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in the culture medium were measured. RESULTS: Primary T cells expressing anti-CD20scFv/IgGFc/CD80/CD28/zeta could be constructed successfully. These T cells were able to lyse CD20+ targets and secrete high levels of IL-2 (1301.00 pg/ml) and IFN-gamma (602.18 pg/ml) in vitro.

The aim of this classification is often a better diagnosis or individualized therapy. The search for molecular markers often utilizes extremely high-dimensional data sets (e.g. gene-expression microarrays). However, in situations where the number of measured markers (genes) is intrinsically higher than the number of available patients, standard methods from statistical learning fail to deal correctly with this so-called ""curse of dimensionality"". Also feature or dimension reduction techniques based on statistical models promise only limited success. Several recent methods explore ideas of how to quantify and incorporate biological prior knowledge of molecular interactions and known cellular processes into the feature selection process. This article aims to give an overview of such current methods as well as the databases, where this external knowledge can be obtained from. For illustration, two recent methods are compared in detail, a feature selection approach for support vector machines as well as a boosting approach for regression models.

However, its role in maintaining the undifferentiated state of the embryonic stem (ES) cells remains unknown. In this study, we dissected the function of Cdk1 in mouse ES cells by RNA-interference and gene expression analyses. Cdk1 expression is tightly correlated with the undifferentiated state of the ES cells. Upon differentiation, Cdk1 expression reduced drastically. Cdk1 knock-down by RNA interference resulted in the loss of proliferation and colony formation potential of the ES cells. Consequentially, expression of self-renewal genes was reduced while differentiation markers such as Cdx2 were induced. Our results suggest a role for Cdk1 in maintaining the unique undifferentiated and self-renewing state of the mouse ES cells.","['Zhang, Wei Wei', 'Zhang, Xiao Jie', 'Liu, Hui Xian', 'Chen, Jie', 'Ren, Yong Hong', 'Huang, Deng Gao', 'Zou, Xiang Hong', 'Xiao, Wei']","['Zhang WW', 'Zhang XJ', 'Liu HX', 'Chen J', 'Ren YH', 'Huang DG', 'Zou XH', 'Xiao W']","['College of Life Sciences, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China. zhangweiwei2002@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/06/11 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.23010 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2011 Mar;112(3):942-8. doi: 10.1002/jcb.23010.,,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox2 protein, mouse)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",,,,['R01 CA113579/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 191 transfusion-dependent patients with MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Transfusion intensity was calculated at the time of each transfusion as the yearly-equivalent number of RBC units. The main outcome was acute leukemia-free survival from first transfusion. Median transfusion burden was 30 (range: 4-330) RBC units and 112 patients received >/= 25 units after a median of 9 months from first transfusion. In nested Cox models, having received >/= 25 RBC units had a significant effect on survival (P < 0.001) that was not abrogated by including follow-up >/= 9 months as a time-dependent covariate. Including transfusion intensity in the model had a significant effect on leukemia-free survival (P < 0.001) and cancelled the prognostic value of having received >/= 25 RBC units.

The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence and viral prevalence of HTLV-1/2 among patients with malignant hematological diseases. Eighty-eight patients with malignant hematological diseases were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgG anti-HTLV-1/2 and nested-PCR for the tax gene. The seroprevalence by ELISA was 3.4% and the viral prevalence by nested-PCR tax was 18.2%. HTLV-1 was found in 17% and HTLV-2 in 1% of the patients tested. HTLV-1/2 was found in 17.4% of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 28.6% of patients with Hodgkin's lymphomas, 80% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 11.4% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 22.2% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. A high prevalence of HTLV-1/2 was found in patients with malignant hematological diseases. A high proportion of patients were seronegative to HTLV-1/2 infection, similar to other HTLV-1/2 associated disorders.

Patients with adult T cell leukemia (ATL) are susceptible to opportunistic infections. In this study, the incidence, kinetics and clinical significance of reactivation of CMV, HHV-6, and EBV in ATL patients were investigated. Viral DNA in a total of 468 plasma samples from 34 patients was quantified using real-time PCR. The probability of CMV, HHV-6, and EBV reactivation by 100 days after the start of chemotherapy was 50.6%, 52.3%, and 21.6%, respectively. Although most CMV reactivations were self-limited, plasma CMV DNA tended to persist or increase if the CMV DNA levels in plasma reached >/= 10(4) copies/ml. CMV reactivation was negatively associated with survival, but the P-value for this association was near the borderline of statistical significance (P=0.052). One patient developed fatal interstitial pneumonia concomitant with peak CMV DNA accumulation (1.6 x 10(6) copies/ml plasma). Most HHV-6 and EBV reactivations were self-limited, and no disease resulting from HHV-6 or EBV was confirmed. HHV-6 and EBV reactivation were not associated with reduced survival (P=0.35 and 0.11, respectively). These findings demonstrated that subclinical reactivation of CMV, HHV-6, and EBV were common in ATL patients receiving chemotherapy. There were differences in the viral reactivation patterns among the three viruses.

Fundamental mechanotransduction processes about how applied physical forces are converted into biochemical signals have often been examined by transmitting such forces through cells and probing its pathway at cellular levels. In fact, many cellular biomechanics studies have been performed by trapping (or immobilizing) individual cells, either attached to solid substrates or suspended in liquid media. In that context, we demonstrated two-dimensional acoustic trapping, where a lipid droplet of 125 microm in diameter was directed transversely toward the focus (or the trap center) similar to that of optical tweezers. Under the influence of restoring forces created by a 30 MHz focused ultrasound beam, the trapped droplet behaved as if tethered to the focus by a linear spring. In order to apply this method to cellular manipulation in the Mie regime (cell diameter > wavelength), the availability of sound beams with its beamwidth approaching cell size is crucial. This can only be achieved at a frequency higher than 100 MHz. We define ultrasound beams in the frequency range from 100 MHz to a few GHz as ultrasound microbeams because the lateral beamwidth at the focus would be in the micron range. Hence a zinc oxide (ZnO) transducer that was designed and fabricated to transmit a 200 MHz focused sound beam was employed to immobilize a 10 microm human leukemia cell (K-562) within the trap. The cell was laterally displaced with respect to the trap center by mechanically translating the transducer over the focal plane. Both lateral displacement and position trajectory of the trapped cell were probed in a two-dimensional space, indicating that the retracting motion of these cells was similar to that of the lipid droplets at 30 MHz. The potential of this tool for studying cellular adhesion between white blood cells and endothelial cells was discussed, suggesting its capability as a single cell manipulator.","['Lee, Jungwoo', 'Lee, Changyang', 'Kim, Hyung Ham', 'Jakob, Anette', 'Lemor, Robert', 'Teh, Shia-Yen', 'Lee, Abraham', 'Shung, Koping Kirk']","['Lee J', 'Lee C', 'Kim HH', 'Jakob A', 'Lemor R', 'Teh SY', 'Lee A', 'Shung KK']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, NIH Resource Center for Medical Ultrasonic Transducer Technology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089, USA. jungwool@usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Immobilized', 'Cytological Techniques/*methods', 'Endothelial Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/physiology', 'Ultrasonics/*methods']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2010/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bit.23073 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2011 Jul;108(7):1643-50. doi: 10.1002/bit.23073.

The results of this study show that DCA-Hb-Hp is taken up by the monocytic cancer cell line THP-1, where it depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby inhibiting cancerous cell growth at a comparable level to free DCA.

A cell viability assay showed that MB inhibited cell growth of a panel of six cancer cell lines, especially in human acute promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cells, with an IC50 value of 3.8 micromol. A hypodiploid cells assay and an annexin-V-FITC/PI double staining assay showed a significant increase of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner on HL-60 cells both 24 and 48 h after MB treatment. MB-induced apoptosis was through the caspase-mediated pathway, by activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release test suggested that an MB-cholesterol interaction led to the rearrangement of the lipid bilayer and to subsequent cell membrane impairment. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that MB may exhibit cytotoxic activity against HL-60 cells by inducing apoptosis via caspase-dependent pathways and also membrane permeabilisation.","['Guan, Fuqin', 'Shan, Yu', 'Zhao, Xingzeng', 'Zhang, Dongmei', 'Wang, Ming', 'Peng, Feng', 'Xia, Bing', 'Feng, Xu']","['Guan F', 'Shan Y', 'Zhao X', 'Zhang D', 'Wang M', 'Peng F', 'Xia B', 'Feng X']","['Institute of Botany, Jiangsu Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing Botanical Garden, Mem.

METHOD: Medical records of 16 non-hemophiliac children with 20 bleeding episodes where rFVIIa was administered only after failure of standard measures to control bleeding were retrospectively reviewed and data collected regarding patient demographics, diagnosis and location of bleeding. Blood counts, coagulation and other lab parameters, both pre and post rFVIIa, were also noted. Severity of bleeding was assessed using a scoring system used previously by Nevo S et al. A record of usage of the amount of blood components (red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate) 24 h pre and post rFVIIa was also made. The dose of rFVIIa and any adverse side effects were recorded. RESULTS: Bleeding sites were gastrointestinal (13/20), pulmonary hemorrhage (6/20) and intracranial hemorrhage (1/20). Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50,000/cumm) was present in 50% episodes and five had refractory low platelets. Usage of packed red cells and platelets was significantly less after usage of rFVIIa (p value 0.001 and 0.006, respectively). Mean dosage of rFVIIa was 77 mugm/kg/dose (range 60 to 90 mugm/kg/dose). The bleeding stopped completely in 11(55%), decreased to minimal in 2 (10%), reduced but transfusions needed in 4 (20%) and did not stop in 3 (15%) episodes. Five patients (31%) did not survive the bleeding episode. None of the patients developed thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: rFVIIa appears to be safe and effective in controlling life-threatening bleed in non-hemophiliac children.","['Bhat, Sunil', 'Yadav, Satya Prakash', 'Anjan, Madasu', 'Dinand, Veronique', 'Sachdeva, Anupam']","['Bhat S', 'Yadav SP', 'Anjan M', 'Dinand V', 'Sachdeva A']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology & BMT Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Emergency Treatment', 'Factor VIIa/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",2011/02/18 06:00,2012/01/03 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2010/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12098-011-0364-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2011 Aug;78(8):961-8. doi: 10.1007/s12098-011-0364-6.

He received anti-tuberculosis drugs: isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RFP), ethambutol (EB), and pyrazinamide (PZA). His condition clearly and immediately improved after the therapy, but he experienced a high fever of about 38 degrees C every day from 1 month after the initiation of the therapy. Drug-induced fever and tumor fever were suspected as causes, but the etiology could not be determined. The tuberculosis was identified as an INH-resistant strain, so INH was stopped and levofloxacin (LVFX) was introduced, with streptomycin (SM), in addition to RFP, EB, and PZA. At 2 months after the initiation of the therapy (about one week after the change in the anti-tuberculosis drug regimen), his spinal fluid was examined, given his complaints of headache and vomiting. The spinal fluid analysis revealed invasion of lymphocytic inflammatory cells and high adenosine deaminase activity; the patient was thus diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis. His condition gradually improved after the changing of the anti-tuberculosis drugs. Thus, to summarize, the tuberculous meningitis had worsened paradoxically despite his systemic improvement, although it was successfully treated by the addition of LVFX and SM. We must keep in mind that a potential cause of fever during anti-tuberculosis therapy may be INH-resistant tuberculous meningitis.","['Ikegame, Satoshi', 'Wakamatsu, Kentaro', 'Fujita, Masaki', 'Nakanishi, Yoichi', 'Harada, Mine', 'Kajiki, Akira']","['Ikegame S', 'Wakamatsu K', 'Fujita M', 'Nakanishi Y', 'Harada M', 'Kajiki A']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, National Hospital Organization Omuta National Hospital, 1044-1 Tachibana, Omuta, Fukuoka 837-0911, Japan. ikegame-s@oomuta-h.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Infect Chemother,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,9608375,IM,"['Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/microbiology', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Isoniazid/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/microbiology', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Tuberculosis, Meningeal/complications/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Tuberculosis, Miliary/complications/drug therapy/*microbiology']",2011/02/18 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2010/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10156-011-0218-1 [doi]', 'S1341-321X(11)70447-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Infect Chemother. 2011 Oct;17(5):689-93. doi: 10.1007/s10156-011-0218-1.

Furthermore, none of the clinically available TKIs is capable of eradicating leukemia stem cells and therefore curing CML. Several new compounds have been developed in recent years in an attempt to manage TKI-resistant CML. These include third-generation TKIs (ponatinib, danusertib) and even old compounds such as omacetaxine, which were developed before imatinib and now find a possible niche in the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML.

METHOD: It applies the MIPSE classification proposed by members of the Information and Studies Service, of the Catalunya's Sanitary Resources Headquarter, Spain. By an Indicator of Socioeconomic Development (IDSE) of a University of Costa Rica economist's team, it organised each canton in groups of quintiles (I for the richest, V for the poorest), previous people standardization.

To address cellular variations among different MDR cells, we report a new microfluidic approach to study drug effect on MDR modulation, by investigating drug accumulation of daunorubicin in MDR leukemia cells. We have demonstrated that the new approach of same-single-cell analysis by accumulation (denoted as SASCA-A) is not only superior to different-single-cell analysis, but also has key advantages over our previous approach of same-single-cell analysis. First, SASCA-A is much simpler as it does not require multiple cycles of drug uptake and drug efflux. Second, it is faster, only taking about one fourth of the time used in the previous approach. Third, it provides a more 'identical' and reliable control because it compares the time points just before MDR modulator tests. To help understand the dynamics of drug accumulation in MDR cells, we also developed a mathematical model to describe the kinetics of drug accumulation conducted in individual cells.

RESULTS: A total of 79 patients, aged 30 to 81 (median = 60) years were managed. There were 34 males and 45 females (ratio = 0.8:1). About 86.1% were aged above 50 years. Massive splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were recorded in 70.9% and 29.1% of patients, respectively. More than 63% presented in stage C. Anaemia was recorded in 74.7%. Haematocrit correlated negatively with WBC but positively with platelet count. The spleen correlated positively with liver. The overall survival at 2 years was 70.2%. Logistic regression showed that younger age, male sex, higher haematocrit, and lower platelet count improved survival, while lower WBC, moderate hepatomegaly and splenomegaly conferred survival advantage.

Dysregulated expression of HOX-type transcription factors occurs in 30-40% of cases of T-ALL. TLX1/HOX11 is the prototypical HOX-type transcription factor. TLX1 may be an attractive therapeutic target because mice that are deficient in TLX1 are healthy. To test this possibility, we developed a conditional doxycycline-regulated mouse model of TLX1-initiated T-ALL. TLX1 induced T-ALL after approximately 5-7 months with penetrance of 15-60%. Similar to human TLX1-type T-ALLs, the TLX1-induced tumors were arrested at the cortical stage of T-cell development and acquired activating NOTCH1 mutations. Inhibition of NOTCH signaling abrogated growth of cell lines derived from the TLX1-induced tumors. NOTCH inhibition also transiently delayed leukemia progression in vivo. Suppression of TLX1 expression slowed the growth of TLX1 tumor cell lines. Suppression of TLX1 in vivo also transiently delayed leukemia progression. We have shown that TLX1 functions as a T-cell oncogene that is active during both the induction and the maintenance phases of leukemia. However, the effect of suppressing NOTCH or TLX1 was transient. The tumors eventually ""escaped"" from inhibition. These data imply that the biological pathways and gene sets impacted by TLX1 and NOTCH have largely lost their importance in the fully established tumor. They have been supplanted by stronger oncogenic pathways. Although TLX1 or NOTCH inhibitors may not be effective as single agents, they may still contribute to combination therapy for TLX1-driven acute leukemia.","['Rakowski, Lesley A', 'Lehotzky, Erica A', 'Chiang, Mark Y']","['Rakowski LA', 'Lehotzky EA', 'Chiang MY']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Time Factors']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/09/02 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2010/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0016761 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Feb 4;6(2):e16761. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0016761.,20110204,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",PMC3033898,,,"['K08 CA120544/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of algorithms have been proposed to obtain such classifications. These algorithms usually require parameter optimization to obtain accurate results depending on the type of data. Additionally, it is highly critical to find an optimal set of markers among those up or down regulated genes that can be clinically utilized to build assays for the diagnosis or to follow progression of specific cancer types. In this paper, we employ a mixed integer programming based classification algorithm named hyper-box enclosure method (HBE) for the classification of some cancer types with a minimal set of predictor genes. This optimization based method which is a user friendly and efficient classifier may allow the clinicians to diagnose and follow progression of certain cancer types. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We apply HBE algorithm to some well known data sets such as leukemia, prostate cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), small round blue cell tumors (SRBCT) to find some predictor genes that can be utilized for diagnosis and prognosis in a robust manner with a high accuracy. Our approach does not require any modification or parameter optimization for each data set. Additionally, information gain attribute evaluator, relief attribute evaluator and correlation-based feature selection methods are employed for the gene selection. The results are compared with those from other studies and biological roles of selected genes in corresponding cancer type are described. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The performance of our algorithm overall was better than the other algorithms reported in the literature and classifiers found in WEKA data-mining package. Since it does not require a parameter optimization and it performs consistently very high prediction rate on different type of data sets, HBE method is an effective and consistent tool for cancer type prediction with a small number of gene markers.","['Dagliyan, Onur', 'Uney-Yuksektepe, Fadime', 'Kavakli, I Halil', 'Turkay, Metin']","['Dagliyan O', 'Uney-Yuksektepe F', 'Kavakli IH', 'Turkay M']","['Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Calibration', 'Electronic Data Processing/standards', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods/*standards', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis/methods/*standards', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasms/*classification/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods/standards', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/classification/diagnosis/genetics']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/09/02 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2010/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0014579 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Feb 4;6(2):e14579. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0014579.,20110204,,PMC3033885,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two cell lines were established over 30 years ago from a patient diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Laz221 represented the leukemic cells of the patient; whereas Laz388 represented the normal B cells of the patient. Although Laz388 expressed both HLA-DR and HLA-DQ surface and gene products, Laz221 expressed only HLA-DR genes. The discordant expression of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ genes was due to epigenetic silencing of the HLA-DQ region CCCTC transcription factor (CTCF)-binding insulators that separate the MHC-II sub-regions by DNA methylation. These epigenetic modifications resulted in the loss of binding of the insulator protein CTCF to the HLA-DQ flanking insulator regions and the MHC-II-specific transcription factors to the HLA-DQ promoter regions. These events led to the inability of the HLA-DQ promoter regions to interact with flanking insulators that control HLA-DQ expression. Inhibition of DNA methylation by treatment with 5'-deoxyazacytidine reversed each of these changes and restored expression of the HLA-DQ locus. These results highlight the consequence of disrupting an insulator within the MHC-II region and may be a normal developmental mechanism or one used by tumor cells to escape immune surveillance.","['Majumder, P', 'Boss, J M']","['Majumder P', 'Boss JM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory University School Of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,IM,"['CCCTC-Binding Factor', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*genetics/immunology', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Loci', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/09/08 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['gene201077 [pii]', '10.1038/gene.2010.77 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2011 Jun;12(4):291-9. doi: 10.1038/gene.2010.77.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia survivors treated historically with protocols including cranial irradiation demonstrate increased weight gain. METHODS: We retrospectively studied all 134 patients treated on the MRC/UKALL97 protocol (without cranial irradiation as standard therapy) at a single centre, with 77 inclusions. Height-, weight- and body mass index (BMI) standard-deviation scores (SDS) were recorded at diagnosis and annually until 3 years out (YO) from end of treatment (EoT); changes across time were explored using a univariate model (significance P </= 0.001 to account for multiple comparisons). RESULTS: Whole-group height SDS was lower from 1 year into treatment until 2 YO, whereas weight- and BMI-SDS remained higher until 3 YO. In females, height-SDS was lower until EoT, but higher weight- and BMI-SDS persisted until 3 YO. In males, height-SDS was lower at EoT and at 2 YO; differences in BMI-SDS had resolved by 2 YO. By WHO criteria, more patients were overweight or obese at 3 YO than at diagnosis (P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Survivors of childhood ALL, particularly females, exhibit adverse changes in height-, weight- and BMI-SDS, which arise during treatment and persist into follow-up. Patients should be supported with appropriate dietary and lifestyle advice during ALL treatment and follow-up, which may minimise these changes and reduce associated long-term morbidity.","['Breene, R A L', 'Williams, R M', 'Hartle, J', 'Gattens, M', 'Acerini, C L', 'Murray, M J']","['Breene RA', 'Williams RM', 'Hartle J', 'Gattens M', 'Acerini CL', 'Murray MJ']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, CB2 0QQ, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Body Height', '*Body Mass Index', '*Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Obesity/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Sex Factors', '*Survivors']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/04/20 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc201116 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2011.16 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2011 Mar 1;104(5):746-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.16.

Currently, the most effective treatment for CLL consists of a combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Although this approach has encouraging results, patients with CLL eventually relapse and require additional therapies. Many of the current therapeutic regimens for CLL are myelotoxic, immunosuppressive, and associated with infectious complications. Targeted therapies can often minimize these complications. The US Food and Drug Administration has recently approved 2 agents, bendamustine and ofatumumab, for the treatment of CLL. Emerging therapies ranging from new monoclonal antibodies to small molecules that interfere with vital pathways in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation are currently being developed. This article will focus on novel agents in earlier development phases for CLL, including the immunomodulator lenalidomide; monoclonal antibodies, such as lumiliximab, GA-101, and small molecule immunopharmaceuticals; BCL-2 inhibitors, such as oblimersen, obatoclax, and ABT-263; and protein kinase inhibitors, such as flavopiridol, spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors.","['Abou-Nassar, Karim', 'Brown, Jennifer R']","['Abou-Nassar K', 'Brown JR']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/therapeutic use', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/03/11 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2010 Dec;8(12):886-95.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TRU 016)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel approaches that maintain response and therefore delay growth of MRD may ultimately improve survival outcomes. In CLL, any type of continued therapy must be not only well tolerated but also convenient to ensure compliance. There has been some exploration of rituximab as maintenance therapy in CLL; however, given its limited clinical activity as a single agent, other options need to be studied. One such agent is the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide, which has demonstrated clinical activity both in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and in the frontline setting. Other attractive agents being explored in the maintenance setting include epigallocatechin gallate, curcumin, and the citrus pectin-derived galectin-3 inhibitor GCS-100. These naturally occurring compounds are well tolerated, and they inhibit survival signals in the microenvironment necessary for tumor development, making them well suited for evaluation as maintenance therapy for CLL.","[""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kay, Neil E']","[""O'Brien S"", 'Kay NE']","['Division of Hematology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. sobrien@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Curcumin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/03/16 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2011 Jan;9(1):22-31.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the prevalence of MPL mutations relative to JAK2 mutations in patients with suspected MPDs. A total of 2790 patient samples submitted for JAK2 mutation analysis were tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction and bidirectional sequencing of plasma RNA. JAK2 V617F-negative samples were tested for JAK2 exons 12 to 14 mutations, and those with negative results were then tested for mutations in MPL exons 10 and 11. Of the 2790 patients, 529 (18.96%) had V617F, 12 (0.43%) had small insertions or deletions in exon 12, and 7 (0.25%) had other JAK2 mutations in exons 12 to 14. Of the 2242 JAK2 mutation-negative patients, 68 (3.03%) had MPL mutations. W515L was the predominant MPL mutation (n=46; 68%), and 10 (15%) patients had other W515 variants. The remaining MPL mutations (n=12, 17%) were detected at other locations in exons 10 and 11 and included 3 insertion/deletion mutations. The S505N mutation, associated with familial MPD, was detected in 3 patients. Overall, for every 100 V617F mutations in patients with suspected MPDs, there were 12.9 MPL mutations, 2.3 JAK2 exon 12 mutations, and 1.3 JAK2 exons 13 to 14 mutations. These findings suggest that MPL mutation screening should be performed before JAK2 exons 12 to 14 testing in JAK2 V617F-negative patients with suspected MPDs.","['Ma, Wanlong', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Wang, Xiuqiang', 'Zhang, Zhong', 'Yeh, Chen-Hsiung', 'Uyeji, Jennifer', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Ma W', 'Zhang X', 'Wang X', 'Zhang Z', 'Yeh CH', 'Uyeji J', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,IM,"['Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics/metabolism']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/05/05 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PDM.0b013e3181ecd261 [doi]', '00019606-201103000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2011 Mar;20(1):34-9. doi: 10.1097/PDM.0b013e3181ecd261.,,"['0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data of BK-HC in children undergoing HSCT are still limited. AIM OF THE STUDY: To describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcome of children with BK-HC after HSCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of all children aged 0 to 20 years, who underwent HSCT at Schneider Children's Medical Center between 2000 and 2008 and were diagnosed with BK-HC, were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and microbiological data. Patients in whom BK-HC had developed were compared with patients in whom it did not. RESULTS: Seventeen children (5.3%) acquired BK-HC at 10 to 180 days after HSCT (mean, 57 d); 9 had grade 3 to 4 disease. Bleeding lasted for 4 to 42 days (mean, 14). All patients but 1, who died of unrelated causes, recovered. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 91 months (mean, 35 months). Acute myeloid leukemia, use of cyclophosphamide in the conditioning regimen, unrelated donor, and older age were associated with the development of hemorrhagic cystitis (HC). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of BK-HC in children after HSCT is relatively low. Its rate of successful resolution is very high. Further prospective studies are required to determine optimal therapy.","['Megged, Orli', 'Stein, Jeremiah', 'Ben-Meir, David', 'Shulman, Lester M', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Shalit, Itamar', 'Levy, Itzhak']","['Megged O', 'Stein J', 'Ben-Meir D', 'Shulman LM', 'Yaniv I', 'Shalit I', 'Levy I']","['Pediatirc Infectious Diseases Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. orlimegged@szmc.org.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', '*BK Virus', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cystitis/*etiology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/complications', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polyomavirus Infections/*complications', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/06/03 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181fce388 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Apr;33(3):190-3. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181fce388.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various metabolites of benzene lead to toxicity through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the inhibition of topoisomerase and DNA damage. However, benzene itself is considered to have no mutagenic or cytotoxic activity. In this study, we investigated the effects of benzene itself on a human myeloid cell line with or without benzene metabolizing enzyme inhibitors. METHODS: A human myeloid cell line, HL-60, was exposed to benzene with or without cytochrome P450 2E1 or myeloperoxidase inhibitor. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in terms of global DNA methylation levels, induction of apoptosis, and ROS production. RESULTS: Benzene did not change global DNA methylation levels. However, benzene itself increased the levels of apoptosis and ROS. This cytotoxicity did not change with the addition of benzene metabolizing enzyme inhibitors. Benzene itself increased the mRNA levels of oxidative stress-related genes and transcription factors of activator protein-1. CONCLUSIONS: Benzene did not influence global DNA methylation in HL-60 cells, but had cytotoxic effects and changed gene expression levels. To elucidate the mechanisms of benzene toxicity, benzene itself as well as benzene metabolites must be investigated.","['Nishikawa, Takuro', 'Izumo, Kimiko', 'Miyahara, Emiko', 'Horiuchi, Masahisa', 'Okamoto, Yasuhiro', 'Kawano, Yoshifumi', 'Takeuchi, Toru']","['Nishikawa T', 'Izumo K', 'Miyahara E', 'Horiuchi M', 'Okamoto Y', 'Kawano Y', 'Takeuchi T']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,J Occup Health,Journal of occupational health,9616320,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Biotransformation', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/genetics']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/joh/10-002-OA [pii]', '10.1539/joh.10-002-oa [doi]']",ppublish,J Occup Health. 2011;53(2):84-92. doi: 10.1539/joh.10-002-oa.

Whether curcumin, a nutraceutical derived from turmeric (Curcuma longa), has potential therapeutic activity against human CCA was investigated using three CCA cell lines (KKU100, KKU-M156 and KKU-M213). Examination of mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, phosphatidylserine externalization, esterase staining, caspase activation and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase cleavage demonstrated that curcumin inhibited proliferation of and induced apoptosis in these biliary cancer cells. Colony-formation assay confirmed the growth-inhibitory effect of curcumin on CCA cells. When examined for the mechanism, curcumin was found to activate multiple cell signaling pathways in these cells. First, all CCA cells exhibited constitutively active nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and treatment with curcumin abolished this activation as indicated by DNA binding, nuclear translocation and p65 phosphorylation. Second, curcumin suppressed activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 as indicated by decreased phosphorylation at both tyrosine(705) and serine(727) and inhibition of janus kinase-1 phosphorylation. Third, curcumin induced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Fourth, curcumin upregulated death receptors, DR4 and DR5. Fifth, curcumin suppressed the Akt activation pathway. Sixth, curcumin inhibited expression of cell survival proteins such as B-cell lymphoma-2, B-cell leukemia protein xL, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, c-FLIP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP)-1, cIAP-2 and survivin and proteins linked to cell proliferation, such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Seventh, the growth inhibitory effect of curcumin was enhanced in the IkappaB kinase-deficient cells, the enzyme required for nuclear factor-kappaB activation. Overall, our results indicate that curcumin mediates its antiproliferative and apoptotic effects through activation of multiple cell signaling pathways, and thus, its activity against CCA should be further investigated.","['Prakobwong, Suksanti', 'Gupta, Subash C', 'Kim, Ji Hye', 'Sung, Bokyung', 'Pinlaor, Porntip', 'Hiraku, Yusuke', 'Wongkham, Sopit', 'Sripa, Banchob', 'Pinlaor, Somchai', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Prakobwong S', 'Gupta SC', 'Kim JH', 'Sung B', 'Pinlaor P', 'Hiraku Y', 'Wongkham S', 'Sripa B', 'Pinlaor S', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen 40002, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'PPAR gamma/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1/antagonists & inhibitors']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['bgr032 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgr032 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2011 Sep;32(9):1372-80. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgr032.

ATLL eruptions were categorized into patch (6.7%), plaque (26.9%), multipapular (19.3%), nodulotumoral (38.7%), erythrodermic (4.2%), and purpuric (4.2%) types. When the T stage of the tumor-node-metastasis-blood (TNMB) classification of mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome was applied to ATLL staging, 16.0% were T1, 17.7% T2, 38.7% T3, and 4.2% T4, and the remaining 23.5% were of the multipapular and purpuric types. For the patch type, the mean survival time (median survival time could not be estimated) was 188.4 months. The median survival times (in months) for the remaining types were as follows: plaque, 114.9; multipapular, 17.3; nodulotumoral, 17.3; erythrodermic, 3.0; and purpuric, 4.4. Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival showed that the erythrodermic type had the poorest prognosis, followed by the nodulotumoral and multipapular types. The patch and plaque types were associated with better survival rates. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the hazard ratios of the erythrodermic and nodulotumoral types were significantly higher than that of the patch type, and that the eruption type is an independent prognostic factor for ATLL. The overall survival was worse as the T stage became more advanced: the multipapular type and T2 were comparable, and the purpuric type had a significantly poorer prognosis than T1.","['Sawada, Yu', 'Hino, Ryosuke', 'Hama, Kayo', 'Ohmori, Shun', 'Fueki, Haruna', 'Yamada, Shigenori', 'Fukamachi, Shoko', 'Tajiri, Makiko', 'Kubo, Rieko', 'Yoshioka, Manabu', 'Nakashima, Daiki', 'Sugita, Kazunari', 'Yoshiki, Ryutaro', 'Shimauchi, Takatoshi', 'Mori, Tomoko', 'Izu, Kunio', 'Kobayashi, Miwa', 'Nakamura, Motonobu', 'Tokura, Yoshiki']","['Sawada Y', 'Hino R', 'Hama K', 'Ohmori S', 'Fueki H', 'Yamada S', 'Fukamachi S', 'Tajiri M', 'Kubo R', 'Yoshioka M', 'Nakashima D', 'Sugita K', 'Yoshiki R', 'Shimauchi T', 'Mori T', 'Izu K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Nakamura M', 'Tokura Y']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan. hinoti@med.uoeh-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/classification/*mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/classification/*mortality/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45264-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-11-316794 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 14;117(15):3961-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-11-316794.

We studied 57 FA patients with hypoplastic or aplastic anemia (n = 20), MDS (n = 18), AML (n = 11), or no BM abnormality (n = 8). BM samples were analyzed by karyotype, high-density DNA arrays with respect to paired fibroblasts, and by selected oncogene sequencing. A specific pattern of chromosomal abnormalities was found in MDS/AML, which included 1q+ (44.8%), 3q+ (41.4%), -7/7q (17.2%), and 11q- (13.8%). Moreover, cryptic RUNX1/AML1 lesions (translocations, deletions, or mutations) were observed for the first time in FA (20.7%). Rare mutations of NRAS, FLT3-ITD, MLL-PTD, ERG amplification, and ZFP36L2-PRDM16 translocation, but no TP53, TET2, CBL, NPM1, and CEBPalpha mutations were found. Frequent homozygosity regions were related not to somatic copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity but to consanguinity, suggesting that homologous recombination is not a common progression mechanism in FA. Importantly, the RUNX1 and other chromosomal/genomic lesions were found at the MDS/AML stages, except for 1q+, which was found at all stages.

Astrocyte-derived ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor have been identified as essential key factors mediating this effect. However, the outcome of this regeneration is still limited by inhibitors associated with the CNS myelin and the glial scar. The current study demonstrates that Taxol markedly enhanced neurite extension of mature RGCs and PC12 cells by stabilization of microtubules and desensitized axons toward myelin and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) inhibition in vitro without reducing RhoA activation. In vivo, the local application of Taxol at the injury site of the optic nerve of rats enabled axons to regenerate beyond the lesion site but did not affect the intrinsic regenerative state of RGCs. Furthermore, Taxol treatment markedly increased lens injury-mediated axon regeneration in vivo, delayed glial scar formation, suppressed CSPG expression, and transiently reduced the infiltration of macrophages at the injury site. Thus, microtubule-stabilizing compounds such as Taxol might be promising candidates as adjuvant drugs in the treatment of CNS injuries particularly when combined with interventions stimulating the intrinsic regenerative state of neurons.","['Sengottuvel, Vetrivel', 'Leibinger, Marco', 'Pfreimer, Mariana', 'Andreadaki, Anastasia', 'Fischer, Dietmar']","['Sengottuvel V', 'Leibinger M', 'Pfreimer M', 'Andreadaki A', 'Fischer D']","['Department of Neurology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Astrocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Axons/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Growth Cones/drug effects/pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Myelin Sheath/metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Nerve Regeneration/*drug effects', 'Optic Nerve Injuries/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retina/cytology', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/04/02 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['31/7/2688 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4885-10.2011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2011 Feb 16;31(7):2688-99. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4885-10.2011.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",PMC6623712,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Measles virus (MV) oncolytic therapy has been reported to be efficient in reducing tumour burden in subcutaneous xenograft models of lymphoproliferative disorders such as myeloma, B-cell lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, but its potential to reduce tumour burden in disseminated lymphoproliferative disorders such as ATL remains to be determined. In this study, MV oncolytic therapy was evaluated in the MET-1/NOD/SCID xenograft mouse model of ATL. Treatment with the vaccine-related strain MV-NSE led to a significant reduction in tumour burden. In mice with a high tumour burden, therapy with MV-NSE significantly increased survival beyond any other single treatment tested previously using this model. Interestingly, signs of morbidity (cachexia) in mice treated with MV were not directly associated with tumour burden, but were correlated with the secretion of interleukin-6 by MET-1 cells and host cells. The results suggest that MV therapy could be a promising therapy for generalized lymphoproliferative disease.","['Parrula, Cecilia', 'Fernandez, Soledad A', 'Zimmerman, Bevin', 'Lairmore, Michael', 'Niewiesk, Stefan']","['Parrula C', 'Fernandez SA', 'Zimmerman B', 'Lairmore M', 'Niewiesk S']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Arthur James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Arthur James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Arthur James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/mortality/*therapy/virology', 'Measles virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Oncolytic Viruses/genetics/*physiology']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/07/13 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.028910-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2011 Jun;92(Pt 6):1458-1466. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.028910-0.

Here, we have investigated whether this gene could have a deregulated expression in malignant tissues compared with their normal tissues of origin and if this potential deregulation could be associated with important clinicopathological parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: RINF messenger RNA expression was examined in biopsies from locally advanced breast tumors, metastatic malignant melanomas, and papillary thyroid carcinomas and compared with their paired or nonpaired normal reference samples. Further, the prognostic role of RINF expression was evaluated in locally advanced breast cancer. RESULTS: RINF expression was significantly higher in all tumor forms (primary breast, and thyroid cancers and metastatic melanomas) as compared with normal control tissues (P < 0.001 for each comparison). Importantly, high levels of RINF expression correlated to a poor overall survival in breast cancer (P = 0.013). This finding was confirmed in three independent public microarray datasets (P = 0.043, n = 234; P = 0.016, n = 69; P = 0.001, n = 196) and was independent of tamoxifen therapy. Notably, high levels of RINF was strongly associated with TP53 wild-type status (P = 0.002) possibly indicating that high levels of RINF could substitute for TP53 mutations as an oncogenic mechanism during the malignant development of some cases of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that (i) RINF overexpression is associated with the malignant phenotype in solid tumors and (ii) RINF overexpression represents an independent molecular marker for poor prognosis in breast tumors.","['Knappskog, S', 'Myklebust, L M', 'Busch, C', 'Aloysius, T', 'Varhaug, J E', 'Lonning, P E', 'Lillehaug, J R', 'Pendino, F']","['Knappskog S', 'Myklebust LM', 'Busch C', 'Aloysius T', 'Varhaug JE', 'Lonning PE', 'Lillehaug JR', 'Pendino F']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma', 'Carcinoma, Papillary', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)37741-5 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdq737 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2011 Oct;22(10):2208-15. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdq737.

To examine the infection potential, kinetics, and tissue distribution of XMRV in an animal model, we inoculated five macaques with XMRV intravenously. XMRV established a persistent, chronic disseminated infection, with low transient viremia and provirus in blood lymphocytes during acute infection. Although undetectable in blood after about a month, XMRV viremia was reactivated at 9 months, confirming the chronicity of the infection. Furthermore, XMRV Gag was detected in tissues throughout, with wide dissemination throughout the period of monitoring. Surprisingly, XMRV infection showed organ-specific cell tropism, infecting CD4 T cells in lymphoid organs including the gastrointestinal lamina propria, alveolar macrophages in lung, and epithelial/interstitial cells in other organs, including the reproductive tract. Of note, in spite of the intravenous inoculation, extensive XMRV replication was noted in prostate during acute but not chronic infection even though infected cells were still detectable by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in prostate at 5 and 9 months postinfection. Marked lymphocyte activation occurred immediately postinfection, but antigen-specific cellular responses were undetectable. Antibody responses were elicited and boosted upon reexposure, but titers decreased rapidly, suggesting low antigen stimulation over time. Our findings establish a nonhuman primate model to study XMRV replication/dissemination, transmission, pathogenesis, immune responses, and potential future therapies.","['Onlamoon, Nattawat', 'Das Gupta, Jaydip', 'Sharma, Prachi', 'Rogers, Kenneth', 'Suppiah, Suganthi', 'Rhea, Jeanne', 'Molinaro, Ross J', 'Gaughan, Christina', 'Dong, Beihua', 'Klein, Eric A', 'Qiu, Xiaoxing', 'Devare, Sushil', 'Schochetman, Gerald', 'Hackett, John Jr', 'Silverman, Robert H', 'Villinger, Francois']","['Onlamoon N', 'Das Gupta J', 'Sharma P', 'Rogers K', 'Suppiah S', 'Rhea J', 'Molinaro RJ', 'Gaughan C', 'Dong B', 'Klein EA', 'Qiu X', 'Devare S', 'Schochetman G', 'Hackett J Jr', 'Silverman RH', 'Villinger F']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Chronic Disease', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial Cells/virology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/virology', 'Macaca mulatta/*virology', 'Macrophages/virology', 'Male', 'Primate Diseases/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Viral Tropism', 'Viremia', 'Virus Activation', 'Virus Latency', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*immunology/*pathogenicity']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02411-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02411-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 May;85(9):4547-57. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02411-10.

We and others have shown that host restriction factors APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F), which are expressed in human PBMCs, inhibit XMRV in transient-transfection assays involving a single cycle of viral replication. However, the recovery of infectious XMRV from human PBMCs suggested that XMRV can replicate in these cells despite the expression of APOBEC3 proteins. To determine whether XMRV can replicate and spread in cultured PBMCs even though it can be inhibited by A3G/A3F, we infected phytohemagglutinin-activated human PBMCs and A3G/A3F-positive and -negative cell lines (CEM and CEM-SS, respectively) with different amounts of XMRV and monitored virus production by using quantitative real-time PCR. We found that XMRV efficiently replicated in CEM-SS cells and viral production increased by >4,000-fold, but there was only a modest increase in viral production from CEM cells (<14-fold) and a decrease in activated PBMCs, indicating little or no replication and spread of XMRV. However, infectious XMRV could be recovered from the infected PBMCs by cocultivation with a canine indicator cell line, and we observed hypermutation of XMRV genomes in PBMCs. Thus, PBMCs can potentially act as a source of infectious XMRV for spread to cells that express low levels of host restriction factors. Overall, these results suggest that hypermutation of XMRV in human PBMCs constitutes one of the blocks to replication and spread of XMRV. Furthermore, hypermutation of XMRV proviruses at GG dinucleotides may be a useful and reliable indicator of human PBMC infection.","['Chaipan, Chawaree', 'Dilley, Kari A', 'Paprotka, Tobias', 'Delviks-Frankenberry, Krista A', 'Venkatachari, Narasimhan J', 'Hu, Wei-Shau', 'Pathak, Vinay K']","['Chaipan C', 'Dilley KA', 'Paprotka T', 'Delviks-Frankenberry KA', 'Venkatachari NJ', 'Hu WS', 'Pathak VK']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, P.

We aimed to characterize ICER's role in drug sensitivity by treating myeloid cell lines and primary AML with chemotherapics. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effects on CREB target genes induced by ICER restoration and drug treatment were studied by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis were performed. Possible ICER-evoked pathways were investigated in vitro. The mechanism involved in enhanced drug sensitivity was described in primary AML cultures by silencing ICER main target genes. RESULTS: AML cell lines reduced cell growth and enhanced apoptotic behavior after chemotherapy treatment if ICER was expressed. A significantly lowered expression of CREB target genes involved in cell cycle control (CyA1, B1, D1), and in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (ERK, AKT, DUSP1/4), was found after Etoposide treatment. The dual-specificity phosphatases DUSP1 and DUSP4, directly repressed by ICER, activated the p38 pathway, which triggered enhanced caspase-dependent apoptosis. The silencing of DUSP1/4 in HL60 confirmed the same enhanced drug sensitivity induced by ICER. Primary AML cultures, silenced for DUSP1 as well as restored of ICER expression, showed DUSP1 downregulation and p38 activation. CONCLUSION: ICER mediates chemotherapy anticancer activity through DUSP1-p38 pathway activation and drives the cell program from survival to apoptosis. ICER restoration or DUSP1 inhibition might be possible strategies to sensitize AML cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy and to inhibit tumor growth.","['Pigazzi, Martina', 'Manara, Elena', 'Beghin, Alessandra', 'Baron, Emma', 'Tregnago, Claudia', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Pigazzi M', 'Manara E', 'Beghin A', 'Baron E', 'Tregnago C', 'Basso G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy. martina.pigazzi@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Dual-Specificity Phosphatases/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*physiology']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/08/16 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['17/4/742 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0886 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Feb 15;17(4):742-52. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0886.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CREM protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '135844-64-3 (Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (DUSP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (DUSP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual-Specificity Phosphatases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,,,,['(c)2011 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The finding of a JAK2-involving t(4;9)(q21;p24) in 1 case of cHL prompted us to characterize this translocation on a molecular level and to determine the prevalence of JAK2 rearrangements in cHL. We showed that the t(4;9)(q21;p24) leads to a novel SEC31A-JAK2 fusion. Screening of 131 cHL cases identified 1 additional case with SEC31A-JAK2 and 2 additional cases with rearrangements involving JAK2. We demonstrated that SEC31A-JAK2 is oncogenic in vitro and acts as a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that is sensitive to JAK inhibitors. In vivo, SEC31A-JAK2 was found to induce a T-lymphoblastic lymphoma or myeloid phenotype in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. Altogether, we identified SEC31A-JAK2 as a chromosomal aberration characteristic for cHL and provide evidence that JAK2 rearrangements occur in a minority of cHL cases. Given the proven oncogenic potential of this novel fusion, our studies provide new insights into the pathogenesis of cHL and indicate that in at least some cases, constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is caused by JAK2 rearrangements. The finding that SEC31A-JAK2 responds to JAK inhibitors indicates that patients with cHL and JAK2 rearrangements may benefit from targeted therapies.","['Van Roosbroeck, Katrien', 'Cox, Luk', 'Tousseyn, Thomas', 'Lahortiga, Idoya', 'Gielen, Olga', 'Cauwelier, Barbara', 'De Paepe, Pascale', 'Verhoef, Gregor', 'Marynen, Peter', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'De Wolf-Peeters, Chris', 'Cools, Jan', 'Wlodarska, Iwona']","['Van Roosbroeck K', 'Cox L', 'Tousseyn T', 'Lahortiga I', 'Gielen O', 'Cauwelier B', 'De Paepe P', 'Verhoef G', 'Marynen P', 'Vandenberghe P', 'De Wolf-Peeters C', 'Cools J', 'Wlodarska I']","['Center for Human Genetics, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45275-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-06-291310 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 14;117(15):4056-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-06-291310.

A number of nonrandomized clinical trials using TIL combined with high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) have consistently found clinical response rates of 50% or more in metastatic melanoma patients accompanied by long progression-free survival. Recent studies have also established practical methods for the expansion of TIL from melanoma tumors with high success rates. These results have set the stage for randomized phase II/III clinical trials to determine whether ACT provides benefit in stage IV melanoma. Here, we provide an overview of the current state-of-the art in T-cell-based therapies for melanoma focusing on ACT using expanded TIL and address some of the key unanswered biological and clinical questions in the field. Different phase II/III randomized clinical trial scenarios comparing the efficacy of TIL therapy to high-dose IL-2 alone are described. Finally, we provide a roadmap describing the critical steps required to test TIL therapy in a randomized multicenter setting. We suggest an approach using centralized cell expansion facilities that will receive specimens and ship expanded TIL infusion products to participating centers to ensure maximal yield and product consistency. If successful, this approach will definitively answer the question of whether ACT can enter mainstream treatment for cancer.","['Weber, Jeffrey', 'Atkins, Michael', 'Hwu, Patrick', 'Radvanyi, Laszlo', 'Sznol, Mario', 'Yee, Cassian']","['Weber J', 'Atkins M', 'Hwu P', 'Radvanyi L', 'Sznol M', 'Yee C']","['Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute, 12902 Magnolia Drive, Tampa, FL 33612, USA. jeffrey.weber@moffitt.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/*transplantation', 'Melanoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Patient Care']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/07/22 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-2272 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2272 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Apr 1;17(7):1664-73. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2272.

OBJECTIVE: To determine long-term safety profile of mitoxantrone (MITOX) in multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Eight hundred and two patients from 12 MS centres (308 relapsing-remitting, 352 secondary progressive and 142 primary progressive) received MITOX monthly for 6 months (87%) or every 3 months (13%). Patients underwent clinical and haematologic evaluations before every MITOX infusion and every 6-12 months up to 5 years after MITOX start. Echocardiograms were performed at the start and end of MITOX and up to 5 years after. RESULTS: The cohort was followed for 5354 patient-years (mean). One out of 802 patients (0.1%) presented with acute congestive heart failure and 39 out of 794 patients (4.9%) presented with asymptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction reduction under 50% (persistent in 11 patients (28%), transient in 27 patients (69%), on the last scan at year 5 in 1 patient). Two cases of therapy-related leukaemia (0.25%) were detected 20 months after MITOX start (one death and one with 8 years confirmed remission). Of the 317 women treated before the age of 45, 17.3% developed a persistent age-dependant amenorrhea.

Allogeneic transplantation represents a postremission therapy that is effective at reducing the risk of relapse for many cases of poor-risk AML. Whether or not allogeneic transplantation in first complete remission (CR) can improve outcomes for patients with FLT3/ITD AML remains controversial. Our institution has adopted a policy of pursuing allogeneic transplantation, including the use of alternate donors, for FLT3/ITD AML patients in remission. As part of an instituional review board-approved study, we performed a review of the clinical data from November 1, 2004, to October 31, 2008, on all adult patients under the age of 60 presenting in consecutive fashion to the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins with newly diagnosed non-M3 AML. We followed their outcomes through August 1, 2010. During the study period, 133 previously untreated AML patients between the ages of 20 and 59 were diagnosed and received induction and consolidation therapy at our institution. Of these 133 patients, 31 (23%) harbored an FLT3/ITD mutation at diagnosis. The median overall survival (OS) from the time of diagnosis for the FLT3/ITD AML patients was compared to the OS of the entire cohort and found to be comparable (19.3 months versus 15.5 months, P = .56). Historically, OS for FLT3/ITD AML patients is significantly worse than for AML patients lacking this mutation. However, the OS for the 31 FLT3/ITD patients reported here was comparable to the 102 patients with WT FLT3 over the same 4-year time period. One difference that might have contributed to the surprising outcomes for the FLT3/ITD group is our aggressive pursuit of allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) in CR1 within this group (60% of FLT3/ITD versus 17% with WT). Our single-institution study of consecutively treated AML patients supports the hypothesis that allogeneic transplant in early CR1 improves the long-term outcomes for FLT3/ITD AML.","['DeZern, Amy E', 'Sung, Anthony', 'Kim, Sharon', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Fuchs, Ephraim', 'Luznik, Leo', 'McDevitt, Michael', 'Levis, Mark']","['DeZern AE', 'Sung A', 'Kim S', 'Smith BD', 'Karp JE', 'Gore SD', 'Jones RJ', 'Fuchs E', 'Luznik L', 'McDevitt M', 'Levis M']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adult', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2011/02/18 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2010/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00097-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Sep;17(9):1404-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.02.003.

Survival rates are now excellent, but treatment is associated with a number of side effects including sexual dysfunction with potential implications for compromised quality of life (QoL). AIMS: To address the (i) prevalence of sexual dysfunction among lymphoma survivors relative to the general population, survivors of other cancers, and in survivors of HL and NHL; and (ii) relationships between sexual functioning and disease and treatment, demographic, and psychological variables. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were quantitative studies that focused on adult male survivors of lymphoma and included a comparison group and presented results separately for HL and NHL. Standardized systematic searches were used. Information about design, sample size, age, time since diagnosis, type of treatment, comparison group, measures, and findings were extracted from eligible studies. RESULTS: Ten articles met the inclusion criteria, of which, nine included patients with HL only, and one included patients with HL or NHL. Sexual function was compromised relative to the general population, better than testicular cancer survivors, and worse than leukemia survivors. Depression was consistently associated with sexual dysfunction. There was evidence that chemotherapy, relapse, reduced testosterone levels, older age at survey, and worse physical QoL were associated with worse sexual function. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions are limited by methodological issues including lack of utilization of standardized measures of sexual function and longitudinal research. Even so, there is evidence of sexual dysfunction among lymphoma survivors. Clinicians need to be sensitive to these issues. Future longitudinal work is necessary to determine the likelihood of recovery.","['Arden-Close, Emily', 'Eiser, Christine', 'Pacey, Allan']","['Arden-Close E', 'Eiser C', 'Pacey A']","['University of Sheffield-Department of Psychology, Sheffield, UK University of Sheffield-School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Academic Unit of Reproductive and Developmental Medicine, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Netherlands,J Sex Med,The journal of sexual medicine,101230693,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological/*epidemiology', 'Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological/*epidemiology', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/10/21 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02209.x [doi]', 'S1743-6095(15)33598-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Sex Med. 2011 Jul;8(7):1833-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02209.x.

CD19-L is the first CD19-specific recombinant human protein with potent anti-leukaemic activity against B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the most common form of childhood cancer and the second most common form of acute leukaemia in adults. Soluble recombinant CD19-L protein exhibited exquisite specificity for the extracellular domain of CD19 and strong binding to the surface of B-lineage leukaemia/lymphoma cells. Engagement of CD19 co-receptor on B-lineage ALL cells with CD19-L perturbed the CD19-associated signalling network, altering the expression levels of multiple genes directly involved in regulation of apoptosis, and triggered rapid apoptotic cell death in a CD19-specific manner. The identification of human CD19-L may lead to therapeutic innovation for B-lineage ALL and other B-lineage lymphoid malignancies as well as B-cell lymphoproliferative states and systemic autoimmunity.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Sun, Lei', 'Qazi, Sanjive', 'Ma, Hong', 'Ozer, Zahide']","['Uckun FM', 'Sun L', 'Qazi S', 'Ma H', 'Ozer Z']","[""Institute for Pediatric Clinical Research, Children's Hospital, LA, CA, USA. fmuckun@chla.usc.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'HMGB Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/05/07 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08583.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Apr;153(1):15-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08583.x.

This study compared the outcome of children following human leucocyte antigen-matched unrelated haematopoietic-stem cell transplantations (HSCT) from donors carrying (C77G cases: n = 8) or not (controls: n = 36) the PTPRC C77G polymorphism. Transmission of the PTPRC C77G polymorphism through the graft was suggested by unusual CD45RA phenotype in the donors and/or in the recipients after, but not before HSCT. Restriction-Fragment Length Polymorphism and sequencing confirmed the polymorphism. Overall survival rates were similar in C77G cases and controls (63% vs. 61%). Acute leukaemia relapse tended to be less frequent in C77G cases (0% vs. 32%; P = 0.09). Among recipients surviving >/= 30 d, acute GVHD (aGVHD) >/= grade 2 tended to be more frequent (100% vs. 58%; P = 0.07) and the rate of steroid-refractory or -dependant aGVHD higher (67% vs. 28%) in C77G cases. Finally, extensive chronic GVHD tended to occur more frequently (40% vs. 9%) in C77G cases. Recovery of lymphocyte subsets and virus-specific CD4 was similar in C77G cases and controls while interleukin 2 (IL2)-responses through CD3 stimulation were higher in C77G cases (P = 0.004). In conclusion, HSCT from PTPRC C77G donors could increase GVHD risk without compromising overall survival. Altered IL2-responses could be involved in this process.","['Samaan, Samaan', 'Guerin-El Khourouj, Valerie', 'Auboeuf, Didier', 'Peltier, Lucas', 'Pedron, Beatrice', 'Ouachee-Chardin, Marie', 'Gourgouillon, Nadege', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Dalle, Jean-Hugues', 'Sterkers, Ghislaine']","['Samaan S', 'Guerin-El Khourouj V', 'Auboeuf D', 'Peltier L', 'Pedron B', 'Ouachee-Chardin M', 'Gourgouillon N', 'Baruchel A', 'Dalle JH', 'Sterkers G']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Robert Debre Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Graft Rejection/genetics/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Phytohemagglutinins/immunology', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/05/07 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08568.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Apr;153(1):47-57. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08568.x.

We studied the methylation of hsa-miR-203 in 150 samples including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) by methylation-specific PCR, and miRNA expression by stem-loop RT-qPCR. hsa-miR-203 promoter was unmethylated in normal controls but homozygously methylated in two AML and four lymphoma cell lines, in which 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment led to promoter demethylation and miR-203 re-expression. Restoration of miR-203 expression in lymphoma cells inhibited cellular proliferation and increased cell death, suggesting an inherent tumour suppressor activity. In primary samples, hsa-miR-203 methylation was absent in CML but detected in 5.0% ALL, 10.0% AML, 42.0% CLL and 38.8% of NHL (including six [60.0%] natural killer-cell, nine [40.9%] B-cell and four [23.5%] T cell NHL). Moreover, hsa-miR-203 methylation was associated with hypermethylation of hsa-miR-34a, -124a and -196b in NHL but not CLL. In CLL, hsa-miR-203 methylation was associated with a higher presenting Hb level (P = 0.033). The projected 10 year overall survival of the CLL patients was 58.2%, which was impacted by Rai stage and high-risk karyotypes but not hsa-miR-203 methylation. hsa-miR-203 was more frequently methylated in lymphoid than myeloid malignancies (P = 0.002). In conclusion, miR-203, a tumour suppressor gene, was hypermethylated in a tumour-specific manner with gene silencing. hsa-miR-203 was more frequently hypermethylated in lymphoid than myeloid malignancies. In NHL, hsa-miR-203 methylation was associated with concomitant methylation of other tumour suppressor miRNAs. The frequent hsa-miR-203 methylation in lymphoid malignancies suggested a pathogenetic role of hsa-miR-203 methylation.","['Chim, Chor Sang', 'Wong, Kwan Yeung', 'Leung, Chung Ying', 'Chung, Lap Ping', 'Hui, Pak Kwan', 'Chan, Sau Yan', 'Yu, Li']","['Chim CS', 'Wong KY', 'Leung CY', 'Chung LP', 'Hui PK', 'Chan SY', 'Yu L']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. jcschim@hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenomics', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/classification/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/18 06:00,2012/04/11 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01274.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2011 Dec;15(12):2760-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01274.x.,,"['0 (MIRN203 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",PMC4373446,,,,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (c) 2011', 'Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL upregulated gene 1 (CLLU1) is solely upregulated in CLL patient samples. We hypothesized that CLLU1 could be used to monitor for residual disease in CLL patient samples after therapy. METHODS: We examined whether the CLLU1 real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) could detect small numbers of CLL cells in mixtures of normal peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) cells. We then performed a retrospective analysis on time-matched cryo-preserved specimens from patients who achieved MRD-negative remissions that underwent serial marrow biopsies for evaluation of residual disease by 4-color flow cytometry. RNA from PBMC samples collected at the time of the marrow assessments was analyzed for CLLU1. Nine patients underwent a total of 46 paired blood and marrow evaluations (median 5 assessments per patient). RESULTS: CLLU1 RQ-PCR on PBMCs of healthy donors reconstituted with varying amounts of CLL cells demonstrated leukemia cells could be reliably detected with high sensitivities depending on the CLLU1 expression level. Analysis of time-matched samples assessed for CLLU1 levels in the blood by RQ-PCR and residual disease of the marrow determined by 4-color flow cytometry revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.96 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The CLLU1 RQ-PCR is a sensitive and specific assay for detecting residual CLL cells after therapy. Assessment of blood CLLU1 levels can be used as a reliable marker of tumor burden and has the potential to complement currently used techniques for MRD monitoring in patients with CLL.","['Buhl, Anne Mette', 'James, Danelle F', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Jain, Sonia', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Buhl AM', 'James DF', 'Neuberg D', 'Jain S', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'The CLL Research Consortium, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'The CLL Research Consortium, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Biostatics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, UCSD, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'The CLL Research Consortium, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'The CLL Research Consortium, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Reference Values', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tumor Burden/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01588.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 May;86(5):405-411. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01588.x.

Due to both the poor efficacy and high toxicity of current standard AML therapies, there is an unmet need for new, improved therapies. Flt3 inhibitors have great potential to address this with mutated Flt3. AREAS COVERED: This paper provides a comprehensive review of the Flt3 inhibitor patents currently available. Information from original research articles in peer-reviewed journals and current clinical developments from several resources is also described. EXPERT OPINION: Our understanding of Flt3 inhibitors has been increased by findings from recent preclinical and clinical trials. Some Flt3 inhibitors show good efficacy in AML patients, but relapse and resistance to these inhibitors are still unavoidable. To address these problems, structurally diverse inhibitors, which exhibit inhibitory activities against both wild type and mutated Flt3, should be explored.","['Lee, Jongkook', 'Paek, Seung-Mann', 'Han, Sun-Young']","['Lee J', 'Paek SM', 'Han SY']","['Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Bio-organic Science Division, Daejeon 305-600, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Ther Pat,Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,9516419,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', '*Patents as Topic', 'Polycyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/07/12 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543776.2011.560115 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Pat. 2011 Apr;21(4):483-503. doi: 10.1517/13543776.2011.560115.

Most recently, a report in the literature identified dysfunctional induction of a type I IFN response in cancer stem cells--specifically, breast cancer-initiating cells, implicating this defect in progression to breast cancer. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that cancer stem cells/cancer-initiating cells are prevalent in leukemias and solid tumors, are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and therefore likely contribute to tumor recurrence. IFN-beta treatment of human glioma xenografts leads to disruption of the vascular niche of glioma stem cells, in further support of a potential therapeutic effect of IFN treatment in limiting cancer stem cells. The implications are that restoring an IFN response, or enhancing an IFN response, may invoke a reduction, or elimination of both cancer stem cells and tumor cells. In this review, the clinical application of type I IFNs, mainly IFN-alphas, will be reviewed.","['Wang, Ben X', 'Rahbar, Ramtin', 'Fish, Eleanor N']","['Wang BX', 'Rahbar R', 'Fish EN']","['Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Drug Therapy/trends', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Stem Cell Niche/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jir.2010.0158 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2011 Jul;31(7):545-52. doi: 10.1089/jir.2010.0158.

Single-stranded pseudotyped adeno-associated viruses of serotypes 2/1 to 2/6 (ssAAV2/1-ssAAV2/6) were screened on human CML cell lines and primary cells to determine gene transfer efficiency. Additionally, double-stranded self-complementary vectors (dsAAVs) were used to determine possible second-strand synthesis limitations. On human CML cell lines, ssAAV2/2 and ssAAV2/6 were most efficient. On primary cells, ssAAV2/6 proved significantly more efficient (4.1 +/- 2.5% GFP(+) cells, p = 0.011) than the other vectors (<1%). The transduction efficiency could be significantly increased (45.5 +/- 13.4%) by using dsAAV2/6 vectors (p < 0.001 vs. ssAAV2/6). In these settings, our data suggest conversion of single- to double-stranded DNA and cell binding/entry as rate-limiting steps. Furthermore, gene transfer was observed in both late and earlier CML (progenitor) populations. For the first time, efficient AAV gene transfer into human CML cells could be shown, with the potential for future clinical application.","['Sellner, Leopold', 'Veldwijk, Marlon R', 'Kleinschmidt, Jurgen A', 'Laufs, Stephanie', 'Topaly, Julian', 'Fruehauf, Stefan', 'Zeller, W Jens', 'Wenz, Frederik']","['Sellner L', 'Veldwijk MR', 'Kleinschmidt JA', 'Laufs S', 'Topaly J', 'Fruehauf S', 'Zeller WJ', 'Wenz F']","['Pharmacology of Cancer Treatment, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dependovirus/*genetics', 'Efficiency', 'Female', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Pseudogenes/genetics', 'Transgenes']",2011/02/18 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2011/02/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.545460 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Mar;52(3):483-90. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.545460.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic (allo) stem cell transplantation (SCT), which can be curative in acute and chronic myeloid leukemias, exemplifies the success of immunotherapy for cancer management. However, because of its nonspecific immune response against normal tissue, allo-SCT is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, secondary to graft-versus-host disease, which can occur in up to 50% of allo-SCT recipients. Targeted immunotherapy using leukemia vaccines has been heavily investigated, as these vaccines elicit specific immune responses against leukemia cells while sparing normal tissue. Peptide and cellular vaccines have been developed against tumor-specific and leukemia-associated self-antigens. Although not yet considered the standard of care, leukemia vaccines continue to show promising results in the management of the myeloid leukemias.","['Alatrash, Gheath', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J']","['Alatrash G', 'Molldrem JJ']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 900, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,"['Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Peptides/chemistry/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Vaccines, DNA/immunology/therapeutic use']",2011/02/17 06:00,2011/05/28 06:00,['2011/02/17 06:00'],"['2011/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/ehm.10.80 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2011 Feb;4(1):37-50. doi: 10.1586/ehm.10.80.,,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)']",PMC3098525,,,"['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS289171'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the higher response rates obtained with these more intensive treatments, they may not always be applicable. Patients with several comorbidities have an increased toxicity with these newer therapies. Effective tools to distinguish between fit and nonfit patients and new therapeutic approaches suitable for fragile patients with CLL are therefore necessary. Moreover, there is still a subset of patients who are refractory to standard fludarabine-based treatments who continue to have very poor survival. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of resistance to treatment in order to develop new therapeutic agents for those patients are mandatory. Finally, advances in the knowledge of the pathogenesis of CLL are promoting the emergence of drugs directed to new biological targets of this disease. Consequently, trials exploring the toxicity profile and efficacy of these new therapeutic agents, alone or in combination with standard treatments, are warranted.","['Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Crespo, Marta', 'Bosch, Francesc']","['Abrisqueta P', 'Crespo M', 'Bosch F']","[""Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Vall d'Hebron 119-129, 08035 Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', '*Precision Medicine', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2011/02/17 06:00,2011/05/28 06:00,['2011/02/17 06:00'],"['2011/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/ehm.10.84 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2011 Feb;4(1):27-35. doi: 10.1586/ehm.10.84.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome of CMV infection in hematologic patients treated with alemtuzumab in 19 hospitals throughout Spain was assessed retrospectively. Data were collected from the medical records of patients over a period of 6 months following initiation of alemtuzumab therapy. We studied 102 patients (89 with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 13 with other lymphoproliferative diseases, with a median age of 63 years [range 29-81 years]). Alemtuzumab was administered for a mean of 11.2 (standard deviation: 13.8) weeks, with a median total dose of 423 mg (range: 59-1440 mg). Alemtuzumab as a single agent was administered in 92.2% of patients and was associated with chemotherapy in 7.8% of cases. Prophylactic antivirals included famcyclovir (47%), acyclovir (34%), valacyclovir (14%) and valgancyclovir (5%). CMV viremia testing was performed a mean of 6.3 times (range: 1-19). The incidence of CMV infection was 38.9% (46% in patients treated with steroids and 75% in patients receiving >/=1000 mg of alemtuzumab). Treatment of CMV infection included gancyclovir or valgancyclovir in 94% of cases. Viremia became negative after a median of 20 days (95% CI: 13.4-26.6). CMV disease occurred in five patients. The incidence of CMV infection in alemtuzumab-treated patients was 38.9%. The incidence increased in patients treated concomitantly with steroids and in those treated with high doses of alemtuzumab, although only eight patients received 1000 mg or more, systematic monitoring of CMV viremia and early treatment of infection resulted in a favorable outcome of CMV reactivation.","['Vallejo, Carlos', 'Rios, Eduardo', 'de la Serna, Javier', 'Jarque, Isidro', 'Ferra, Christelle', 'Sanchez-Godoy, Pedro', 'Solano, Carlos', 'de la Camara, Rafael', 'Rosell, Ana Isabel', 'Varela, Rosario', 'Garcia, Maria Dolores', 'Gonzalez-Barca, Eva', 'Lopez, Javier', 'Perez, Elena', 'Ferrer, Secundino', 'Casado, Luis Felipe', 'Vazquez, Lourdes', 'Villalon, Lucia', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A']","['Vallejo C', 'Rios E', 'de la Serna J', 'Jarque I', 'Ferra C', 'Sanchez-Godoy P', 'Solano C', 'de la Camara R', 'Rosell AI', 'Varela R', 'Garcia MD', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Lopez J', 'Perez E', 'Ferrer S', 'Casado LF', 'Vazquez L', 'Villalon L', 'Garcia-Marco JA']","['Service of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/complications/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Steroids/therapeutic use']",2011/02/17 06:00,2011/05/28 06:00,['2011/02/17 06:00'],"['2011/02/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/ehm.10.77 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2011 Feb;4(1):9-16. doi: 10.1586/ehm.10.77.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Steroids)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In yeast, nuclear pores play a role in the maintenance of genome stability by means of the evolutionarily conserved family of SUMO-targeted Ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs). The yeast Slx5/Slx8 STUbL associates with a class of DNA breaks that are shifted to nuclear pores. Functionally Slx5/Slx8 are needed for telomere maintenance by an unusual recombination-mediated pathway. The mammalian STUbL RNF4 associates with Promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies and regulates PML/PML-fusion protein stability in response to arsenic-induced stress. A subclass of PML bodies support telomere maintenance by the ALT pathway in telomerase-deficient tumors. Perturbation of nuclear organization through either loss of pore subunits in yeast, or PML body perturbation in man, can lead to gene amplifications, deletions, translocations or end-to-end telomere fusion events, thus implicating SUMO and STUbLs in the subnuclear organization of select repair events.","['Nagai, Shigeki', 'Davoodi, Niloofar', 'Gasser, Susan M']","['Nagai S', 'Davoodi N', 'Gasser SM']","['Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Maulbeerstrasse 66, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Repair', 'Genomic Instability', 'Nuclear Envelope/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",2011/02/16 06:00,2011/06/21 06:00,['2011/02/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['cr201131 [pii]', '10.1038/cr.2011.31 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2011 Mar;21(3):474-85. doi: 10.1038/cr.2011.31.

In clinical adult leukemia, however, increased expression of ERG is indicative of poor prognosis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia, although the involvement of ERG in the development of adult leukemia remains elusive. Here, we show that forced expression of ERG in adult BM cells alters differentiation and induces expansion of T and erythroid cells and increases frequencies of myeloid progenitors in mouse BM transplantation models. The expanded T cells then develop T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia after acquisition of mutations in the Notch1 gene. Targeted expression of ERG into B cells also altered differentiation and promoted growth of precursor B cells. Overall, these findings suggest a general role of ERG in promoting growth of adult hematopoietic cells in various lineages. In line with this, shRNA-mediated silencing of ERG expression attenuated growth of human leukemia cell lines of various lineages. Thus, ERG is capable of promoting the development of leukemia and is crucial for its maintenance.","['Tsuzuki, Shinobu', 'Taguchi, Osamu', 'Seto, Masao']","['Tsuzuki S', 'Taguchi O', 'Seto M']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. stsuzuki@aichi-cc.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/02/16 06:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2011/02/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45311-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-11-320515 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 7;117(14):3858-68. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-11-320515.

The long-term follow-up of these regimens with respect to progression, survival, risk of secondary leukemia, and impact of genomic risk factors has been limited. METHODS: We report the long-term follow-up of the chemoimmunotherapy trial CALGB 9712 from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, for which treatment regimen was previously reported, to examine end points of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), impact of genomic features, and risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (t-MN). RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were enrolled on this study and now have a median follow-up of 117 months (range, 66 to 131 months). The median OS was 85 months, and 71% of patients were alive at 5 years. The median PFS was 42 months, and 27% were progression free at 5 years. An estimated 13% remained free of progression at almost 10 years of follow-up. Multivariable models of PFS and OS showed that immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutational status was significant for both, whereas cytogenetic abnormalities were significant only for OS. No patient developed t-MN before relapse. CONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up of CALGB 9712 demonstrates extended OS and PFS with fludarabine plus rituximab. Patients treated with fludarabine plus rituximab administered concurrently or sequentially have a low risk of t-MN. These long-term data support fludarabine plus rituximab as one acceptable first-line treatment for symptomatic patients with CLL.","['Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Peterson, Bercedis L', 'Gribben, John G', 'Morrison, Vicki A', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Byrd, John C']","['Woyach JA', 'Ruppert AS', 'Heerema NA', 'Peterson BL', 'Gribben JG', 'Morrison VA', 'Rai KR', 'Larson RA', 'Byrd JC']","['The Ohio State University, 320 West 10 Ave, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'London', 'Mutation', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2011/02/16 06:00,2011/05/28 06:00,['2011/02/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.31.1811 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.31.1811 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Apr 1;29(10):1349-55. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.31.1811.

However, the relationship between IL-32 and tumor progression is still unknown. In this study, we investigated whether overexpression of IL-32 affects susceptibility of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells to NK cells. Interestingly, IL-32alpha-overexpressing CML cell lines, K562, Kcl22, and BV173, showed higher NK cell-mediated killing. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that overexpression of IL-32alpha induced increased expression of Fas and UL16-binding protein 2 (ULBP2) in CML cells. The direct relationship between overexpression of surface molecules by IL-32alpha and increased NK cell-mediated killing was confirmed by Fas or ULBP2 siRNA transfection. IL-32alpha-induced Fas and ULBP2 expression are regulated p38 MAPK. In addition, the transcription factor Ets1 plays a key role in ULBP2 specific expression by IL-32alpha overexpression in ULBP family members. Taken together, these data show that IL-32alpha stimulates Fas and ULBP2 expression via activation of p38 MAPK, which increases NK susceptibility of CML cells. Enhanced NK cell susceptibility of CML cells by IL-32alpha overexpression may improve the efficiency of NK cell-based immunotherapy.","['Cheon, Soyoung', 'Lee, Ji Hyung', 'Park, Sunyoung', 'Bang, Sa Ik', 'Lee, Wang Jae', 'Yoon, Do-Young', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Kim, Taesung', 'Min, Hyeyoung', 'Cho, Byung Joo', 'Lee, Hyong Joo', 'Lee, Ki Woong', 'Jeong, Seung Hwan', 'Park, Hyunjeong', 'Cho, Daeho']","['Cheon S', 'Lee JH', 'Park S', 'Bang SI', 'Lee WJ', 'Yoon DY', 'Yoon SS', 'Kim T', 'Min H', 'Cho BJ', 'Lee HJ', 'Lee KW', 'Jeong SH', 'Park H', 'Cho D']","[""Department of Life Science, Sookmyung Women's University, and Konkuk University Hospital, Seoul 140-742, Republic of Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2011/02/16 06:00,2011/07/20 06:00,['2011/02/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)51584-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.159756 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Apr 8;286(14):12049-55. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.159756.

Among the most abundant elements in eukaryotes are the non long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. Here we compare the dNTP concentration requirements and error rates of the RT encoded by the non-LTR retrotransposon R2 of Bombyx mori with the well-characterized RTs of retroviruses. Surprisingly, R2 was found to have properties more similar to those of lentiviral RTs, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), than to those of oncoretroviral RTs, such as murine leukemia virus. Like HIV-1 RT, R2 RT was able to synthesize DNA at low dNTP concentrations, suggesting that R2 is able to retrotranspose in nondividing cells. R2 RT also showed levels of misincorporation in biased dNTP pools and replication error rates in M13 lacZalpha forward mutation assays, similar to HIV-1 RT. Most of the R2 base substitutions in the forward mutation assay were caused by the misincorporation of dTMP. Analogous to HIV-1, the high error rate of R2 RT appears to be a result of its ability to extend mismatches once generated. We suggest that the low fidelity of R2 RT is a by-product of the flexibility of its active site/dNTP binding pocket required for the target-primed reverse transcription reaction used by R2 for retrotransposition. Finally, we discuss that in spite of the high R2 RT error rate, the long-term nucleotide substitution rate for R2 is not significantly above that associated with cellular DNA replication, based on the frequency of R2 retrotranspositions determined in natural populations.","['Jamburuthugoda, Varuni K', 'Eickbush, Thomas H']","['Jamburuthugoda VK', 'Eickbush TH']","['Department of Biology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627-0211, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', '*Retroelements', '*Reverse Transcription', 'Templates, Genetic']",2011/02/16 06:00,2011/06/01 06:00,['2011/02/16 06:00'],"['2010/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(11)00159-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2011.02.015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2011 Apr 15;407(5):661-72. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2011.02.015.

The anti-apoptotic protein B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), encoded in a putative BD susceptibility locus, modulates ER-Ca(2+) dynamics. Recently, an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Bcl-2 gene, rs956572, was suggested as a functionally active SNP that influences its messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level as well as human gray matter volume. We sought to evaluate the impact of this variant on ICH in BD. METHODS: Basal intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+) ](B) ) and rs956572 genotypes were determined in B lymphoblast cell lines (BLCLs) from bipolar I disorder (BD-I) (n=150), bipolar II disorder (BD-II) (n=65), and major depressive disorder (n=30) patients, and from healthy subjects (n=70). Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Functional interactions of rs956572 with ICH were assessed by thapsigargin- and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-stimulated Ca(2+) responses. RESULTS: Although rs956572 variation was not significantly associated with BD, BD-I, or BD-II, BLCL [Ca(2+) ](B) was significantly higher in BD-I G/G patients compared with other genotypes and with healthy subjects. Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels were lowest in BD-I G/G patients. Compared with A carriers, BD-I patients with G/G variants showed a modest enhancing effect on thapsigargin- and LPA-stimulated Ca(2+) responses. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the notion that genetic variation in Bcl-2 affecting its expression impacts ICH in BD. Moreover, we show here for the first time that this interactive effect is diagnostically specific to BD-I.","['Uemura, Takuji', 'Green, Marty', 'Corson, Timothy W', 'Perova, Tatiana', 'Li, Peter P', 'Warsh, Jerry J']","['Uemura T', 'Green M', 'Corson TW', 'Perova T', 'Li PP', 'Warsh JJ']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Pathophysiology, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Bipolar Disord,Bipolar disorders,100883596,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Bipolar Disorder/*genetics/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/*genetics/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, bcl-2/*genetics/physiology', 'Genotype', '*Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/16 06:00,2011/07/29 06:00,['2011/02/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1399-5618.2011.00897.x [doi]'],ppublish,Bipolar Disord. 2011 Feb;13(1):41-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2011.00897.x.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,"['MOP-12851/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'MOP-69033/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']",,,['(c) 2011 John Wiley and Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PUMA is particularly important in initiating radiation-induced apoptosis and damage in the gastrointestinal and hematopoietic systems. Unlike most BH3-only proteins, PUMA neutralizes all five known antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members though high affinity interactions with its BH3 domain to initiate mitochondria-dependent cell death. Using structural data on the conserved interactions of PUMA with Bcl-2-like proteins, we developed a pharmacophore model that mimics these interactions. In silico screening of the ZINC 8.0 database with this pharmacophore model yielded 142 compounds that could potentially disrupt these interactions. Thirteen structurally diverse compounds with favorable in silico ADME/Toxicity profiles have been retrieved from this set.

AREAS COVERED: This article summarizes recent achievements in the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties and clinical activity and toxicity as well as the emerging role of newer purine and pyrimidine nucleoside analogs potentially active in lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. A literature review was conducted from the MEDLINE database PubMed for articles in English. Publications from 2000 to October 2010 were scrutinized. The search terms used were clofarabine, nelarabine, forodesine, 8-chloroadenosine, LMP-420, azacitidine, decitabine, sapacitabine, troxacitabine, thiarabine and zebularine in conjunction with hematologic malignancies, leukemia and lymphoma. Conference proceedings from the previous 5 years of the American Society of Hematology, European Hematology Association, and American Society of Clinical Oncology were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. EXPERT OPINION: Several new nucleoside analogs are currently under investigation in preclinical and clinical studies concerning hematological malignancies. Clofarabine, nelarabine, azacitidine and decitabine have been recently approved for the treatment of leukemias and/or myelodysplastic syndromes. Other agents including forodesine, 8-chloroadenosine, LMP-420, sapacitabine, troxacitabine, thiarabine and zebularine seem to be promising for the treatment of lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. However, definitive data from ongoing and future clinical trials will aid in better defining their status in the treatment of hematological disorders.","['Robak, Tadeusz']",['Robak T'],"['Medical University of Lodz, Department of Hematology, Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Nucleosides/*therapeutic use']",2011/02/16 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2011/02/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2011.554822 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2011 Mar;20(3):343-59. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2011.554822.,,['0 (Nucleosides)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although most of the vaginal GVH disease cases occurred within two years after oncologic treatment, our two cases highlight the possibility of a very long onset. We also confirmed that hormonal replacement therapy does not protect against synechia and that corticoid treatment has a good therapeutic value in recurrence after surgery. In conclusion, women with SCT experience a high risk of vaginal GVHD that could impair quality of life and sexual function. These cases pinpointed the importance of very long-term gynecological follow-up in order to diagnose early symptoms. To date, only early therapy with local corticoid application might reduce symptoms and development of severe genital GVHD. We support systematic use of topical corticoid therapy in severe cases even after surgery because of the high incidence of recurrence.","['Riera, C', 'Deroover, Y', 'Marechal, M']","['Riera C', 'Deroover Y', 'Marechal M']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hopital Civil de Charleroi, Charleroi, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Singapore,Eur J Gynaecol Oncol,European journal of gynaecological oncology,8100357,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Genitalia, Female/pathology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vaginal Diseases/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/16 06:00,2011/03/09 06:00,['2011/02/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur J Gynaecol Oncol. 2010;31(6):703-4.,,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neuropathic pain (NP) is an unpleasant side effect of chemotherapeutic agents for leukemia, especially vincristine. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 498 patients treated on a single protocol for ALL to investigate the risk factors, the incidence, and the use of therapeutic and prophylactic gabapentin treatment for NP. RESULTS: White non-Hispanic race was the only patient variable predictive of NP. One hundred and seventy-four of 498 patients (34.9%) experienced 207 episodes of NP; 16% (28 of 174) patients experienced at least one recurrence of pain after the initial episode. No statistical significance was found in the relation between the severity (grade) of the NP episode and the cumulative dose of vincristine (P = 0.45) or the vincristine dose that immediately preceded the diagnosis (1.5 mg/m(2) versus 2.0 mg/m(2) [correction made here after initial online publication], P = 0.59). Of 180 episodes with treatment data, 62.2% (112) and 37.8% (68) were treated with gabapentin or opioids, respectively. The selection of treatment with gabapentin or opioids was not influenced by the pain intensity score at the time of diagnosis of NP (P = 0.91). The mean gabapentin dose used for 112 episodes was 15.5 mg/kg/day (SD 7.9). We found no evidence that gabapentin prevented recurrence of NP.

Mutations in the TPMT gene may influence the efficacy and safety of 6-MP treatment. This multicenter study investigated the association between TPMT genotype, 6-MP dose adjustments, and the incidence of adverse effects in patients. PROCEDURE: A total of 203 ALL children were genotyped using PCR/allele-specific amplification and PCR/RFLP. The control group consisted of 394 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The TPMT*3A variant allele was found in 16 patients (15 TPMT*1/*3A, 1 TPMT*3A/*3A) and the TPMT*3C (A719G) allele in 1 patient. No TPMT*2 (G238C) or TPMT*3B (G460A) alleles were detected in the study group. TPMT*3A, TPMT*1 (wild-type), and TPMT*3C alleles were detected at frequencies of 3.94%, 95.81%, and 0.25%, respectively. The genotype and allele distributions were similar in the ALL and control groups. The 6-MP dose was reduced more frequently in patients with TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C alleles, compared with wild-type alleles (P = 0.042). Reductions because of leucopenia with respiratory tract infection, or because of leucopenia, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia were four (P = 0.007) and five (P = 0.03) times more common, respectively. The groups differed with regard to the rates of 6-MP dose reduction (P = 0.028). 6-MP was discontinued more often in patients with TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C alleles (14-fold) as a result of leucopenia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that TPMT genotype influences the safety and efficacy of ALL treatment and genotype information may therefore be useful for optimizing 6-MP therapy.","['Peregud-Pogorzelski, Jaroslaw', 'Tetera-Rudnicka, Edyta', 'Kurzawski, Mateusz', 'Brodkiewicz, Andrzej', 'Adrianowska, Natalia', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Januszkiewicz, Danuta', 'Drozdzik, Marek']","['Peregud-Pogorzelski J', 'Tetera-Rudnicka E', 'Kurzawski M', 'Brodkiewicz A', 'Adrianowska N', 'Mlynarski W', 'Januszkiewicz D', 'Drozdzik M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology Medical University, Szczecin, Poland. peregud@tstd.pl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Poland', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23013 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Oct;57(4):578-82. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23013.

We examined the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and demographic and lifestyle factors in a cohort of ALL survivors. PROCEDURE: We enrolled consecutive ALL survivors who attended the institutional AfterCare Clinic over a 1-year period. BMI (kg/m(2) ) at diagnosis, end-therapy, and current time were calculated. Survivors were classified as overweight/obese (overweight group; BMI for age >/= 85th percentile) or normal/underweight (normal weight group; BMI for age <85th percentile). We assessed the relationship between current BMI and self-reported current caloric intake, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. RESULTS: 102/157 (65%) eligible survivors consented to enrollment. Median age was 14.3 years (range 8.4-18.6) and time from end of treatment 7 years (2.5-15.6). The proportion of overweight survivors was 21%, 45%, and 35% at diagnosis, end-therapy, and current time, respectively. The overweight group reported less calories (Delta324 kcal, P = 0.018), fat (Delta14.5 g, P = 0.02), and carbohydrates (Delta39 g, P = 0.02) than the normal weight group. These differences disappeared after excluding patients classified as under-reporting their calorie intake according to the Goldberg cut-off method. There were no differences in sedentary behavior or activity between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Many children with ALL gain weight during therapy and fail to return to normal weight after treatment concludes. Subsequent diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior do not appear to differ between overweight and normal weight survivors. Clinicians should focus on ways to minimize weight gain during therapy rather than waiting for treatment to conclude.","['Love, Erin', 'Schneiderman, Jane E', 'Stephens, Derek', 'Lee, Sylvia', 'Barron, Mary', 'Tsangaris, Elena', 'Urbach, Stacey', 'Staneland, Patricia', 'Greenberg, Mark', 'Nathan, Paul C']","['Love E', 'Schneiderman JE', 'Stephens D', 'Lee S', 'Barron M', 'Tsangaris E', 'Urbach S', 'Staneland P', 'Greenberg M', 'Nathan PC']","['Department of Clinical Dietetics, The Hospital for Sick Children, SickKids, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. erin.love@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Life Style', 'Male', 'Motor Activity', 'Overweight/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",2011/02/15 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23010 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Dec 15;57(7):1204-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23010.

The aim of the study was to delineate the epidemiologic, clinical features, risk factors, and outcome of invasive fungal infections in this population. PROCEDURE: The medical records of all children with malignancies diagnosed with an invasive fungal infection in 1998-2006 at a tertiary pediatric medical center were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. Invasive fungal infection was diagnosed according to the latest EORTC/MSG criteria. RESULTS: Of the 1,047 children hospitalized in the hematology/oncology department during the study period, 75 (7.2%) were diagnosed with a proven (n = 16, 21.3%), probable (n = 18, 24%), or possible (n= 41, 54.7%) invasive fungal infection. Fifteen (20%) had candidemia (non-albicans in 60%), and 60 (80%) had a mold infection (non-Aspergillus in 55%). Crude mortality was 21.7%. The most common underlying diseases were myeloid leukemia (n = 26, 34.7%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 24, 32%). Compared to other malignancies, acute myeloid leukemia was significantly associated with the development of invasive fungal infections. Profound neutropenia and high treatment intensity were present in 89% and 73% of patients with IFI respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The current mortality rates of invasive fungal infection in children with cancer are lower than previously reported in children and adults. However, the proportion of non-albicans candidemia is increasing, and non-Aspergillus molds are emerging as important pathogens, which may have important implications for prophylaxis and empiric therapy. Improved prevention, early detection, and advanced treatment strategies are needed to improve the outcome.","['Mor, Meirav', 'Gilad, Gil', 'Kornreich, Liora', 'Fisher, Salvador', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Levy, Itzhak']","['Mor M', 'Gilad G', 'Kornreich L', 'Fisher S', 'Yaniv I', 'Levy I']","[""Infectious Diseases Unit, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petah Tikva, Israel.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Neoplasms/*microbiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23005 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Jul 1;56(7):1092-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23005.

TP53 direct sequencing is a time-consuming method, while the AmpliChip p53 Research Test is a novel non time-consuming microarray-based resequencing assay and queries Exons 2-11. We evaluated the impact of TP53 mutations on clinical outcome by analyzing 98 untreated CLL using the AmpliChip p53 Research Test and direct sequencing and performed microarrays analysis on TP53 mutated and/or deleted cases. The AmpliChip p53 Research Test detected 17 mutations in 14 patients (17.3%); a significant association between TP53 mutations and del(17p) was recorded. From a clinical standpoint, a higher percentage of mutation was found in CLL with unfavorable outcome (17.2% vs. 7.1% in progressive vs. stable cases). Detection of TP53 mutations by the AmpliChip p53 Research Test was associated with a significantly worse survival (P = 0.0002). Comparison of the array and direct sequencing tests showed that the p53 Research Test detected more mutations, although it failed to identify two microdeletions. Finally, microarrays analysis showed a more distinctive signature associated with del(17p) than with TP53 mutations, likely due to a concomitant gene dosage effect. The AmpliChip p53 Research Test is a straightforward method that bears prognostic value. This study confirms a high percentage of TP53 mutations in CLL with unfavorable outcome and a significant association between TP53 aberrations and del(17p). Finally, specific gene expression profiles are recognized for TP53 alterations.","['Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'Marinelli, Marilisa', 'Messina, Monica', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Santangelo, Simona', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Truong, Sim', 'Patten, Nancy', 'Ghia, Emanuela Maria', 'Torrente, Isabella', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Nanni, Mauro', 'Lawrence, Jeff', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Chiaretti S', 'Tavolaro S', 'Marinelli M', 'Messina M', 'Del Giudice I', 'Mauro FR', 'Santangelo S', 'Piciocchi A', 'Peragine N', 'Truong S', 'Patten N', 'Ghia EM', 'Torrente I', 'De Propris MS', 'Nanni M', 'Lawrence J', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Point Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/04/28 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20852 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 Apr;50(4):263-74. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20852.

In the present study, telomere-dependent chromosomal instability and telomere length were determined in six NB cell lines and fifty tumor biopsies. The alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway was assayed by scoring ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies (APBs). We found a reduced probability of overall survival for tumors with increased telomere length compared to cases with reduced or unchanged telomere length. In non-MYCN amplified tumors, a reduced or unchanged telomere length was associated with 100% overall survival. Tumor cells with increased telomere length had an elevated frequency of APBs, consistent with activation of the ALT pathway. The vast majority of tumor biopsies and cell lines exhibited an elevated rate of anaphase bridges, suggesting telomere-dependent chromosomal instability. This was more pronounced in tumors with increased telomere length. In cell lines, there was a close correlation between lack of telomere-protective TTAGGG-repeats, anaphase bridging, and remodeling of oncogene sequences. Thus, telomere-dependent chromosomal instability is highly prevalent in NB, and may contribute to the complexity of genomic alterations as well as therapy resistance in the absence of MYCN amplification and in this tumor type.","['Lundberg, Gisela', 'Sehic, Daniel', 'Lansberg, John-Kalle', 'Ora, Ingrid', 'Frigyesi, Attila', 'Castel, Victoria', 'Navarro, Samuel', 'Piqueras, Marta', 'Martinsson, Tommy', 'Noguera, Rosa', 'Gisselsson, David']","['Lundberg G', 'Sehic D', 'Lansberg JK', 'Ora I', 'Frigyesi A', 'Castel V', 'Navarro S', 'Piqueras M', 'Martinsson T', 'Noguera R', 'Gisselsson D']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, University and Regional Laboratories, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. gisela.lundberg@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adult', 'Anaphase', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomal Instability', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/04/28 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20850 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 Apr;50(4):250-62. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20850.

The t(7;21)(p22;q22) translocation, recently described in three cases of myeloid neoplasias, fuses the ubiquitin specific peptidase 42 gene, USP42, a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family, to RUNX1. In this study, we characterized the semicryptic t(7;21)(p22;q22) translocation, identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization and spectral karyotyping, in a novel case of acute myeloid leukemia. Sequence analysis of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products confirmed the presence of two in-frame RUNX1-USP42 and one reciprocal in-frame USP42-RUNX1 fusion transcripts. Bioinformatic analysis of the genomic translocation breakpoints revealed microhomologies and insertion of shared nucleotides at the junctions. A topoisomerase II sequence was also detected near the break site. Additionally, we demonstrated a significant overexpression of the rearranged USP42 gene in t(7;21) positive cells using quantitative real-time PCR. Our results provide the first evidence of the possible involvement of the nonhomologous end-joining mechanism in the origin of the recurrent t(7;21) translocation.

In this study, we identified the BTB and CNC homology 2 (BACH2) gene as a novel translocation partner of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus in a patient with IGH-MYC-positive, highly aggressive B-cell lymphoma/leukemia carrying der(14)t(8;14) and del(6)(q15). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using an IGH/MYC probe detected an IGH-MYC fusion signal on der(14) and IGH signal on del(6). Genome copy number analysis showed a deletion in the 6q15-25 region and a centromeric breakpoint within the BACH2 gene. cDNA bubble polymerase chain reaction using BACH2 primers revealed that the first exon of Cdelta was fused to the 5'-untranslated region of BACH2 exon 2. The Cdelta-BACH2 fusion transcript consisted of exon 1 of Cdelta and exons 2 to 9 of BACH2, encompassing the entire BACH2 coding region, and the BACH2 was highly expressed in this patient. These results indicate that Cdelta-BACH2 fusion may cause constitutive activation of BACH2. Although additional screening of 47 samples of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) patients and 29 cell lines derived from B-cell malignancies by double-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis detected a split signal with deletion of centromeric region of BACH2 only in a patient with follicular lymphoma, BACH2 was highly expressed in lymphoma cells of the patient and B-NHL cell lines with IGH-MYC translocation. These findings suggest that BACH2 plays a critical role in B-cell lymphomagenesis, especially related to IGH-MYC translocation in some way.","['Kobayashi, Satoru', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Chinen, Yoshiaki', 'Tsutsumi, Yasuhiko', 'Ohshiro, Muneo', 'Kobayashi, Tsutomu', 'Matsumoto, Yosuke', 'Kuroda, Junya', 'Horiike, Shigeo', 'Nishida, Kazuhiro', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi']","['Kobayashi S', 'Taki T', 'Chinen Y', 'Tsutsumi Y', 'Ohshiro M', 'Kobayashi T', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Kuroda J', 'Horiike S', 'Nishida K', 'Taniwaki M']","['Department of Molecular Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin delta-Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/04/28 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20845 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 Apr;50(4):207-16. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20845.

Commonly occurring genetic alterations have been identified that strongly affect the prognosis for patients with AML. These alterations represent possible targets for investigational therapies that could act to specifically halt the aberrant growth of AML cells while limiting damage to normal cells. One such gene is the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene, which is mutated in approximately 30% of adult patients with AML and has a significant impact on prognosis. In particular, internal tandem duplications in FLT3 confer a poor prognosis to this large subgroup of patients with AML. Agents that target FLT3 are in development for the treatment of patients who have AML and offer a potential paradigm change in the current standard treatment of AML. For this report, the authors reviewed the prognostic significance of genetic alterations observed in AML with a focus on the therapeutic implications of targeting FLT3. The introduction of such agents may be the next major step toward the era of personalized therapy in AML.","['Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Pemmaraju N', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25908 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Aug 1;117(15):3293-304. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25908.

If the characteristics of individual opioids are exploited depending on pain-related factors in cancer patients may yield satisfactory pain relief with a low incidence of adverse reactions. METHODS: This study involved 10 patients (5 male and 5 female) with cancerous abdominal pain, for whom the original opioid regimen was switched to morphine alone or continued in combination with morphine. The primary disease was gastric cancer in 5 patients, and uterine cervix, ovary cancer, leukemia, malignant pleuroperitoneal mesothelioma, and colon cancer in 1 patient each. Pain assessment was carried out using the Numerical Rating Scale. RESULTS: In all the 10 cases, the opioid administered first was fentanyl; the pain relief was inadequate. Satisfactory pain relief was achieved in all patients by switchover to morphine alone or by concomitant administration of morphine with fentanyl. CONCLUSION: Enhanced gastrointestinal motility accounts, at least in part, for cancerous abdominal pain. Further, this kind of pain can be relieved by suppression of gastrointestinal motility with morphine.","['Yoshino, Kazuho', 'Nishiumi, Noboru', 'Yamamoto, Soichiro', 'Mikami, Mikio', 'Iwasaki, Masayuki', 'Tokuda, Yutaka']","['Yoshino K', 'Nishiumi N', 'Yamamoto S', 'Mikami M', 'Iwasaki M', 'Tokuda Y']","['Department of Palliative Care , Division of Surgery, Tokai University School of Medicine, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa 259-1193, Japan. st_kazu0206@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Tokai J Exp Clin Med,The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,7704186,IM,"['Abdominal Pain/*drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fentanyl/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morphine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*complications/physiopathology', 'Pain Measurement', 'Palliative Care']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Tokai J Exp Clin Med. 2010 Sep 20;35(3):99-102.,20100920,"['0 (Analgesics, Opioid)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)', 'UF599785JZ (Fentanyl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1) is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling that is frequently downregulated by hypermethylation of the WIF-1 promoter in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and other malignancies. On the other hand, an acquired mutation in JAK2 tyrosine kinase involving a V617F amino-acid substitution shows a strong association with the pathogenesis of BCR/ABL-negative MPD. This is the first study to examine the relationship between WIF-1 methylation and the existence of JAK2V617F mutation in the pathogenesis of BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) including polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, idiopathic myelofibrosis, and chronic myeloproliferative disease, unclassifiable. METHODS: We evaluated 49 newly diagnosed and previously treated patients with MPD in chronic phase. Bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells, when available, or PB mononuclear cells of patients were used for the analysis. The mutation status of JAK2 was analyzed using sequencing analysis. The methylation status of the WIF-1 promoter was analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). RESULTS: The JAK2V617F mutation was found in 23/49 patients (46.9%) with BCR/ABL-negative MPD, while WIF-1 methylation was detected in 1/49 patients (2.0%).

However, which of the possible drug combinations would be the most effective and clinically useful are to be determined. We treated the HL60 and NB4 promyelocytic leukaemia cells with a combination of the ribonucleotide reductase (RR) inhibitor 3'-C-methyladenosine (3'-Me-Ado) and several hydroxamic acid-derived HDAC inhibitors, including two recently synthesized molecules, MC1864 and MC1879, and the reference compound trichostatin A (TSA). The results showed significant growth inhibitory and apoptotic synergistic effects with the combinations. Hence, we evaluated the effects of the combinations on cell cycle distribution and on the level of several proteins involved in the apoptotic process (p21, caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax, AIF). Since HDAC inhibitors increased the G1-S transition block induced by 3'-Me-Ado, an effect on RR activity was hypothesized. Indeed, the HPLC evaluation of intracellular deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP) pools showed that both TSA and MC1864 induced a decrease in dNTPs, even if with a somewhat different pattern, suggesting that RR inhibition contributes to the observed synergism. Furthermore, while TSA was shown to activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, MC1864 induced a dose-dependent increase in ROS and AIF levels. Moreover, the treatment with the radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine determined a significant inhibition of MC1864- but not TSA-mediated synergistic effects. Hence, our findings are consistent with a possible role of HDAC inhibitor mediated-ROS induction in RR inhibition and in the potentiation of RR inhibitor-mediated apoptosis.","['Meli, Maria', 'Tolomeo, Manlio', 'Grifantini, Mario', 'Mai, Antonello', 'Cappellacci, Loredana', 'Petrelli, Riccardo', 'Rotili, Dante', 'Ferro, Arianna', 'Saiko, Philipp', 'Szekeres, Thomas', 'Dusonchet, Luisa']","['Meli M', 'Tolomeo M', 'Grifantini M', 'Mai A', 'Cappellacci L', 'Petrelli R', 'Rotili D', 'Ferro A', 'Saiko P', 'Szekeres T', 'Dusonchet L']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze per Promozione della Salute G.

HDIs promote or enhance several different anticancer mechanisms, such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and cellular differentiation and, therefore, are in evidence as promising treatment for children and adolescents with acute leukemia, in monotherapy or in association with other anticancer drugs. Here we review the main preclinical and clinical studies regarding the use of HDIs in treating childhood and adolescence leukemia.","['Masetti, Riccardo', 'Serravalle, Salvatore', 'Biagi, Carlotta', 'Pession, Andrea']","['Masetti R', 'Serravalle S', 'Biagi C', 'Pession A']","['Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Lalla Seragnoli Unit, Department of Pediatrics, University of Bologna, 40137 Bologna, Italy. riccardo.masetti@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Biomed Biotechnol,Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology,101135740,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/148046 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Biotechnol. 2011;2011:148046. doi: 10.1155/2011/148046.

Proof of the existence of CSC comes from clinical experience with germ-cell cancers, where the elimination of a subset of undifferentiated cells can cure patients (Horwich et al., 2006), and from the study of leukemic cells (Bonnet and Dick, 1997; Lapidot et al., 1994; and Yilmaz et al., 2006). The discovery of CSC in leukemias as well as in many solid malignancies, including breast carcinoma (Al-Hajj et al. 2003; Fang et al., 2005; Hemmati et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2005; Lawson et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007; Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2003; and Xin et al., 2005), has suggested a unifying CSC theory of cancer development. The reported general insensitivity of CSC to chemotherapy and radiation treatment (Bao et al., 2006) has suggested that current anticancer drugs, which inhibit bulk replicating cancer cells, may not effectively inhibit CSC. The clinical relevance of targeting CSC-associated genes is supported by several recent studies, including CD44 targeting for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (Jin et al., 2006), CD24 targeting for treatment of colon and pancreatic cancer (Sagiv et al., 2008), and CD133 targeting for hepatocellular and gastric cancer (Smith et al., 2008). One promising approach is to target CSC survival signaling pathways, where leukemia stem cell research has already made some progress (Mikkola et al., 2010).","['Lorico, Aurelio', 'Rappa, Germana']","['Lorico A', 'Rappa G']","['Division of Translational Science, Nevada Cancer Institute, One Breakthrough Way, Las Vegas, NV 89135, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,2011/02/15 06:00,2011/02/15 06:01,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/135039 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol. 2011;2011:135039. doi: 10.1155/2011/135039.

In this study, we immunohistochemically investigated nuclear ERG expression using a new monoclonal antibody, CPDR ERG-MAb, that is highly specific for detecting ERG protein and ERG-expressing prostate carcinomas. A broad range of vascular endothelial (n = 250), other mesenchymal (n = 973), and epithelial tumors (n = 657) was examined to determine the use of ERG immunohistochemistry in surgical pathology. Only immunostains with ERG-positive normal endothelia (internal control) were considered valid, and only nuclear staining was considered to be positive. In adult tissues, ERG was restricted to endothelial cells and to a subset of bone marrow precursors, but early fetal mesenchyme and subpopulations of fetal cartilage were also positive. In vascular tumors, ERG was expressed in endothelia of all hemangiomas and lymphangiomas, and typically extensively expressed in 96 of 100 angiosarcomas, 42 of 43 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas, and all 26 Kaposi sarcomas. Among nonvascular mesenchymal tumors, only blastic extramedullary myeloid tumors (7 of 10) and rare Ewing sarcomas (2 of 29) were positive. Among epithelial tumors, 30 of 66 prostatic adenocarcinomas showed focal-to-extensive ERG positivity, with no immunoreactivity in the normal prostate. Other carcinomas and epithelial tumors (n = 643) were ERG negative, with the exception of 1 of 42 large cell undifferentiated pulmonary carcinomas and 1 of 27 mesotheliomas, each of which showed focal nuclear ERG positivity. On the basis of the above observations, ERG is a highly specific new marker for benign and malignant vascular tumors. Among epithelial tumors, ERG shows a great promise as a marker to identify prostatic carcinoma in both primary and metastatic settings.","['Miettinen, Markku', 'Wang, Zeng-Feng', 'Paetau, Anders', 'Tan, Shyh-Han', 'Dobi, Albert', 'Srivastava, Shiv', 'Sesterhenn, Isabell']","['Miettinen M', 'Wang ZF', 'Paetau A', 'Tan SH', 'Dobi A', 'Srivastava S', 'Sesterhenn I']","['Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC 20306-6000, USA. miettinen@afip.osd.mil']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*chemistry', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Endothelial Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*chemistry', 'Trans-Activators/*analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Vascular Neoplasms/*chemistry']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/03/29 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PAS.0b013e318206b67b [doi]', '00000478-201103000-00014 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2011 Mar;35(3):432-41. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e318206b67b.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",PMC6880747,,,"['R01 CA162383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK065977/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS273146'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, histology and immunohistology may reveal dysplasia in megakaryocytes or other bone marrow lineages and/or the presence of clusters of CD34-positive precursor cells. In other cases, histology may reveal an unrelated or co-existing hematopoietic neoplasm, or may support the conclusion the patient is suffering from acute myeloid leukemia rather than MDS. Moreover, histologic investigations and immunohistology may reveal an increase in tryptase-positive cells, a coexisting systemic mastocytosis, or bone marrow fibrosis, which is of prognostic significance. To discuss diagnostic algorithms, terminologies, parameters, and specific issues in the hematopathologic evaluation of MDS, a Working Conference involving a consortium of US and EU experts, was organized in June 2010.

By integrating the genome occupancy data with whole genome expression profiling data, we identified a Myb-regulated transcriptional program. Gene signatures for leukemia stem cells, normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and myeloid development were overrepresented in 2368 Myb regulated genes. Of these, Myb bound directly near or within 793 genes. Myb directly activates some genes known critical in maintaining hematopoietic stem cells, such as Gfi1 and Cited2. Importantly, we also show that, despite being usually considered as a transactivator, Myb also functions to repress approximately half of its direct targets, including several key regulators of myeloid differentiation, such as Sfpi1 (also known as Pu.1), Runx1, Junb and Cebpb. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that interaction with p300, an established coactivator for Myb, is unexpectedly required for Myb-mediated transcriptional repression. We propose that the repression of the above mentioned key pro-differentiation factors may contribute essentially to Myb's ability to suppress differentiation and promote self-renewal, thus maintaining progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state and promoting leukemic transformation.","['Zhao, Liang', 'Glazov, Evgeny A', 'Pattabiraman, Diwakar R', 'Al-Owaidi, Faisal', 'Zhang, Ping', 'Brown, Matthew A', 'Leo, Paul J', 'Gonda, Thomas J']","['Zhao L', 'Glazov EA', 'Pattabiraman DR', 'Al-Owaidi F', 'Zhang P', 'Brown MA', 'Leo PJ', 'Gonda TJ']","['The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Brisbane, Queensland 4102, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genomics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Myelopoiesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['gkr024 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkr024 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Jun;39(11):4664-79. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkr024.

A prophylactic transfusion strategy is now generally accepted in developed countries. Some clinical data, however, support the use of a therapeutic transfusion strategy at least for certain subsets of these patients. Several methodological approaches can then be used to evaluate the outcome of platelet transfusions, including peripheral blood platelet increments and bleeding assessments. Several factors will influence the efficiency of platelet transfusions; fever and ongoing hemorrhage are among the most important patient-dependent factors, but the number and quality of the transfused platelets are also important. The quality of transfused platelets can be evaluated by analyzing platelet activation, metabolism or senescence/apoptosis. Only evaluation of metabolism is included in international guidelines, but high-throughput methods for evaluation of activation and senescence/apoptosis are available and should be incorporated into routine clinical practice if future studies demonstrate that they reflect clinically relevant platelet characteristics. Finally, platelet transfusions have additional biological effects that may cause immunomodulation or altered angioregulation; at present it is not known whether these effects will influence the long-time prognosis of cancer patients. Thus, several questions with regard to the optimal use of platelet transfusions in cancer patients still need to be answered.","['Apelseth, Torunn O', 'Hervig, Tor', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Apelseth TO', 'Hervig T', 'Bruserud O']","['Department of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Norway. torunn.oveland.apelseth@helse-bergen.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,IM,"['Humans', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Transfusion/adverse effects/*methods', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/etiology/prevention & control/*therapy']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/07/20 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0268-960X(11)00007-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2011.01.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2011 May;25(3):113-22. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2011.01.006.

Nevertheless, information regarding tolerability and responses in advanced-age patients, a subgroup in which co-morbidities and other factors may influence outcome, is scarce, since they were excluded from most clinical trials. In this observational study (ELDERGLI), information regarding demographics, concomitant medication, physical examination, performance status, hemogram, biochemistry, hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses, time to progression, adverse events (AE) and severe adverse events (SAE) were prospectively recorded in a series of 36 elderly patients with CML, with a median age of 76.6 years. Most patients had cardiovascular co-morbidities, especially hypertension. Regarding IM toxicity, around one third of patients required treatment interruptions because of adverse events, especially hematologic toxicity (66% of cases that needed dose interruptions). When analyzing non hematologic adverse events, the most frequent ones were superficial edemas and GI symptoms. Of note, 9 of patients experienced an infection episode during the follow-up, and 4 were diagnosed during the study period of another type of cancer. Finally, cardiovascular events were reported in 7 patients, most of them with prior cardiovascular risk factors. Regarding responses, after 12 months of imatinib therapy, the rate of complete hematologic response (CHR), complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMolR) were 89%, 72% and 55% respectively. In summary, IM display, in advanced-age patients with chronic phase CML, an efficacy and safety profile comparable to younger patients.","['Sanchez-Guijo, Fermin M', 'Duran, Soledad', 'Galende, Josefina', 'Boque, Concepcion', 'Nieto, Jose B', 'Balanzat, Josep', 'Gracia, Antonio', 'Garcia, Isabel', 'Avellaneda-Molina, Carmen', 'Moreno, Maria-Victoria', 'Luno-Fernandez, Elisa', 'Hermosilla, Mar', 'Sanchez-Varela, Jose Manuel', 'Dios, Ana', 'Lopez-Garrido, Pilar', 'Giraldo, Pilar', 'Bargay, Joan', 'Domingo, Jose Maria', 'Soler, Alfonso', 'Salinas, Ramon', 'del Canizo, Maria-Consuelo']","['Sanchez-Guijo FM', 'Duran S', 'Galende J', 'Boque C', 'Nieto JB', 'Balanzat J', 'Gracia A', 'Garcia I', 'Avellaneda-Molina C', 'Moreno MV', 'Luno-Fernandez E', 'Hermosilla M', 'Sanchez-Varela JM', 'Dios A', 'Lopez-Garrido P', 'Giraldo P', 'Bargay J', 'Domingo JM', 'Soler A', 'Salinas R', 'del Canizo MC']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['*Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00027-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.01.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Sep;35(9):1184-7. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.01.017.

The results showed that significant high expression of p110 was detected in leukemias, especially in B-ALL, whereas a slight increase of p150 could be observed. Furthermore, the decrease of p110 expression was observed in B-ALL patients achieving complete remission. Moreover, among prognostic risk groups in ALL, the highest expressions of p110 and p150 were detected in standard-risk group, whereas their lowest expressions were in high-risk group. This observation was further confirmed in comparisons between good and poor prognostic groups based on prognostic related clinical features.

Biophysical and structural studies of the full-length intact Bcl-2 have been hampered due to difficulties in expression and severe solubility problems, precluding isolation of this hydrophobic membrane protein. Therefore, previous work has so far mainly been carried out using structurally modified Bcl-2 variants, lacking the transmembrane region. Thus, biophysical information regarding the full-length protein is still missing. Here, a protocol is presented for expression and purification of preparative amounts of the full-length human isoform 2 of Bcl-2 (Bcl-2(2)). A batch-based cell-free expression system, using extract isolated from Escherichia coli (E. coli) was employed to produce recombinant protein encoded by an optimized gene sequence.

Degradation of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a crucial process in invasion of tumors and metastasis. MMP-7 (or matrilysin), is a ""minimal domain MMP"" with proteolytic activity against components of the extracellular matrix. To determine the involvement of MMP-7 in visceral spread in ATL, this study investigated MMP-7 expression in ATL. MMP-7 expression was identified in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, peripheral blood ATL cells and ATL cells in lymph nodes, but not in uninfected T-cell lines or normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MMP-7 expression was induced following infection of a human T-cell line with HTLV-1, and specifically by the viral protein Tax. Functionally, MMP-7 promoted cell migration of HTLV-1-infected T cells. The MMP-7 promoter activity was increased by Tax and reduced by deletion of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed high levels of AP-1 binding proteins, including JunD, in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells, and Tax elicited JunD binding to the MMP-7 AP-1 element. Tax-induced MMP-7 activation was inhibited by dominant negative JunD and augmented by JunD/JunD homodimers. Short interfering RNA against JunD inhibited MMP-7 mRNA expression in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. These results suggest that the induction of MMP-7 by Tax is regulated by JunD and that MMP-7 could facilitate visceral invasion in ATL.

The release of LIF protein from LIF-PH was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Maintenance of undifferentiated state of mouse ES and iPS cells cultured with LIF-PH was determined by the detection of pluripotency-related biomarkers Oct3/4 and stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) through immunostaining and measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity.

In addition, in animal models, Fas-associated death domain protein phosphorylation at serine 194 has been shown to affect cell proliferation, especially in T lymphocytes. The importance of Fas-associated death domain protein phosphorylation at serine 194 for the proliferation of B lymphocytes, however, is uncertain. Here we show in reactive lymph nodes that serine 194 phosphorylated Fas-associated death domain protein is expressed predominantly in the dark (proliferative) zone of germinal centers. In B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines, serine 194 phosphorylated Fas-associated death domain protein levels are substantially higher in highly proliferating cells and lower in serum-starved cells. We also used immunohistochemical analysis to assess Fas-associated death domain protein phosphorylation at serine 194 expression in 122 B-cell non-Hodgkin-type lymphomas. The mean percentage of serine 194 phosphorylated Fas-associated death domain protein positive tumor cells was 81% in Burkitt lymphoma, 41% in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 18% in follicular lymphoma, 18% in plasma cell myeloma, 12% in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, 11% in mantle cell lymphoma, and 2% in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (P < .0001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Furthermore, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, serine 194 phosphorylated Fas-associated death domain protein was detected predominantly in proliferation centers. In the entire study group, the percentage of cells positive for serine 194 phosphorylated Fas-associated death domain protein correlated significantly with the proliferation index Ki-67 (Spearman R = 0.9, P < .0001). These data provide evidence that serine 194 phosphorylated Fas-associated death domain protein is involved in the proliferation of normal and neoplastic B cells and has features of a novel proliferation marker.","['Drakos, Elias', 'Leventaki, Vasiliki', 'Atsaves, Vasileios', 'Schlette, Ellen J', 'Lin, Pei', 'Vega, Francisco', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Claret, Francois-Xavier', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Rassidakis, George Z']","['Drakos E', 'Leventaki V', 'Atsaves V', 'Schlette EJ', 'Lin P', 'Vega F', 'Miranda RN', 'Claret FX', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Rassidakis GZ']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/*metabolism', 'Germinal Center/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphadenitis/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Serine/*metabolism', 'Tonsillitis/metabolism/pathology']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0046-8177(10)00419-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2010.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2011 Aug;42(8):1117-24. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2010.11.002.

However, the existing methods lack selectivity, efficacy and safety when heterogeneous cell systems must be treated. We report a new method that employs plasmonic nanobubbles (PNBs) for delivery and transfection. A PNB is a novel, tunable cellular agent with a dual mechanical and optical action due to the formation of the vapor nanobubble around a transiently heated gold nanoparticle upon its exposure to a laser pulse. PNBs enabled the mechanical injection of the extracellular cDNA plasmid into the cytoplasm of individual target living cells, cultured leukemia cells and human CD34+ CD117+ stem cells and expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) in those cells. PNB generation and lifetime correlated with the expression of green fluorescent protein in PNB-treated cells. Optical scattering by PNBs additionally provided the detection of the target cells and the guidance of cDNA injection at single cell level. In both cell models PNBs demonstrated a gene transfection effect in a single pulse treatment with high selectivity, efficacy and safety. Thus, PNBs provided targeted gene delivery at the single cell level in a single pulse procedure that can be used for safe and effective gene therapy.","['Lukianova-Hleb, Ekaterina Y', 'Samaniego, Adam P', 'Wen, Jianguo', 'Metelitsa, Leonid S', 'Chang, Chung-Che', 'Lapotko, Dmitri O']","['Lukianova-Hleb EY', 'Samaniego AP', 'Wen J', 'Metelitsa LS', 'Chang CC', 'Lapotko DO']","['Joint American, Belarussian Laboratory for Fundamental and Biomedical Nanophotonics, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Circular/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Gene Expression', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Lasers', '*Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Plasmids/*administration & dosage/genetics', '*Transfection/methods']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(11)00090-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.02.006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2011 Jun 10;152(2):286-93. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.02.006.

We report what we believe to be the first published case of a subacute course of herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis in a patient with asymptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia who subsequently developed multiple sclerosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of fever blisters presented to the emergency department with a history of left temporal headache for four weeks, and numbness of the left face and leg for two weeks. A complete blood count revealed white blood cell count of 11,820 cells/mL, with an absolute lymphocyte count of 7304 cells/mL. The cerebrospinal fluid contained 6 white blood cells/muL, 63 red blood cells/muL, 54 mg glucose/dL, and 49 mg total protein/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed meningoencephalitis and bilateral ventriculitis. Cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus type 1 was positive, and the patient's symptoms resolved after ten days of treatment with parenteral aciclovir. Incidental findings on peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry testing confirmed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. One month later, she developed bilateral numbness of the hands and feet; a repeat cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus type 1 at this time was negative. A repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an expansion of the peri-ventricular lesions, and the cerebrospinal fluid contained elevated oligoclonal bands and myelin basic protein. A brain biopsy revealed gliosis consistent with multiple sclerosis, and the patient responded to treatment with high-dose parenteral steroids. CONCLUSION: Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis is a rare presentation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Our patient had an atypical, subacute course, presumably due to immunosuppression from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This unusual case of herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis emphasizes the importance of T cell function in diseases of immune dysregulation and autoimmunity such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple sclerosis. It raises the question of whether atypical presentations of herpes simplex virus encephalitis warrant deliberations on immunocompetence. The development of multiple sclerosis in our patient so soon after she received treatment for herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis raises the possibility that herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis in an immunosuppressed patient may trigger multiple sclerosis.","['Singhal, Rashi L', 'Corman, Lourdes C']","['Singhal RL', 'Corman LC']","['The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Huntsville, Alabama, USA. rashi.l.singhal@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,2011/02/15 06:00,2011/02/15 06:01,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2009/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/15 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-5-59 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-5-59 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2011 Feb 11;5:59. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-5-59.,20110211,,PMC3062610,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advancements in supportive care and regimen intensification have resulted in improvements in clinical outcomes for younger AML patients, but analogous improvements in older patients have not been realized. While outcomes are compromised by increased comorbidities and susceptibility to toxicity from therapy, it is now recognized that elderly AML represents a biologically distinct disease that is more aggressive and less responsive to therapy. Some patients tolerate and benefit from intensive remission-induction approaches, while others are best managed with less aggressive strategies. The challenge is to differentiate these groups based on host-related and biological features, in order to maximize the therapeutic benefit and minimize toxicity. As more is understood about the complicated pathogenesis and molecular basis of AML, there are more opportunities to develop and test targeted therapies. Elderly patients, with their narrow therapeutic window, are well positioned to derive a benefit from these novel agents, and therefore, despite a difficult past, there are reasons to be optimistic about the future of elderly AML.","['Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Kohrt, Holbrook E', 'Medeiros, Bruno C']","['Pollyea DA', 'Kohrt HE', 'Medeiros BC']","['Divisions of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Cancer Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, 875 Blake Wilbur Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. dpollyea@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/05/13 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08470.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Mar;152(5):524-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08470.x.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although many studies indicated a key role of the viral protein Tax in the control of viral transcription, the mechanisms controlling HTLV-1 expression and its persistence in vivo are still poorly understood. To assess Tax effects on viral kinetics, we developed a HTLV-1 model. Two parameters that capture both its deterministic and stochastic behavior were quantified: Tax signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which measures the effect of stochastic phenomena on Tax expression as the ratio between the protein steady-state level and the variance of the noise causing fluctuations around this value; t(1/2), a parameter representative of the duration of Tax transient expression pulses, that is, of Tax bursts due to stochastic phenomena. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the major determinant of Tax SNR is the transactivation constant, the system parameter weighting the enhancement of retrovirus transcription due to transactivation. In contrast, t(1/2) is strongly influenced by the degradation rate of the mRNA. In addition to shedding light into the mechanism of Tax transactivation, the obtained results are of potential interest for novel drug development strategies since the two parameters most affecting Tax transactivation can be experimentally tuned, e.g. by perturbing protein phosphorylation and by RNA interference.","['Corradin, Alberto', 'Di Camillo, Barbara', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo', 'Toffolo, Gianna', 'Cobelli, Claudio']","['Corradin A', 'Di Camillo B', 'Ciminale V', 'Toffolo G', 'Cobelli C']","['Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Comput Biol,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,9433358,IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cmb.2010.0219 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Biol. 2011 Feb;18(2):183-93. doi: 10.1089/cmb.2010.0219.,,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most studies have been concerned with the Vdelta2 subset in blood, for which several expansion protocols exist. We have developed a protocol to expand Vdelta1 and Vdelta2 preferentially from human blood. We have characterized these subsets and their specificities for leukemic targets. METHODS: GDTC were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy donors via positive magnetic cell sorting; their proliferation in vitro was induced by exposure to the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A). CD107 and cytotoxicity (Cr(51)-release and flow cytometric) assays were performed. GDTC clones and target cells were immunophenotyped via flow cytometry. RESULTS: Longer initial exposure to Con A typically resulted in higher Vdelta1 prevalence. Vdelta1 were activated by and cytotoxic to B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)-derived MEC1 cells, whereas Vdelta2 also responded to MEC1 but more so to the Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph+] leukemia cell line EM-enhanced green fluorescent protein (2eGFPluc). Vdelta2 clone cytotoxicity against EM-2eGFPluc correlated with Vdelta2 T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and receptor found on Natural Killer cells and many T-cells (NKG2D), whereas Vdelta1 clone cytotoxicity versus MEC1 correlated with Vdelta1 TCR, CD56 and CD95 expression. Vdelta1 also killed Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-negative B-CLL-derived TMD2 cells. Immunophenotyping revealed reduced HLA-ABC expression on EM-2eGFPluc, whereas MEC1 and TMD2 exhibited higher Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAILR1). CONCLUSIONS: Our ability to expand peripheral Vdelta1 cells and show their cytotoxicity to B-CLL-derived cell lines suggests that this novel approach to the cellular treatment of B-CLL may be feasible.","['Siegers, Gabrielle M', 'Dhamko, Helena', 'Wang, Xing-Hua', 'Mathieson, A Mark', 'Kosaka, Yoko', 'Felizardo, Tania C', 'Medin, Jeffrey A', 'Tohda, Shuji', 'Schueler, Julia', 'Fisch, Paul', 'Keating, Armand']","['Siegers GM', 'Dhamko H', 'Wang XH', 'Mathieson AM', 'Kosaka Y', 'Felizardo TC', 'Medin JA', 'Tohda S', 'Schueler J', 'Fisch P', 'Keating A']","['Cell Therapy Program, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. gsiegers@imaging.robarts.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,IM,"['Annexin A5', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism']",2011/02/15 06:00,2011/10/18 06:00,['2011/02/15 06:00'],"['2011/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/14653249.2011.553595 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(11)70555-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2011 Jul;13(6):753-64. doi: 10.3109/14653249.2011.553595.

Our study assessed the predictive value of a flow cytometric platelet cross match test for the outcome of HLA matched and unmatched platelet transfusions in patients with acute leukemia. Thirty nine patients (26 adults and 13 children) received 60 ABO compatible apheresis platelet unites ranging from 1 to 4 per patient (mean = 1.54; median = 2). We performed flowcytometric platelet cross-matching, HLA Class I typing by sequence-specific primer (SSP) for patients and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) for donors and screening of HLA Class I antibodies by ELISA. Effectiveness of platelet transfusion was evaluated using the corrected count increment which was calculated at 60 min and 18- to 24-h posttransfusion. Multivariate analysis was performed to detect which variable can predict transfusion response more than others. Cross-matched platelet transfusions associated with good response in 51.4% of transfusion events in adults and 73.3% in children. The noncrossmatched platelet transfusions associated with poor response in 83.3% in adults and 100% in children (P-values 0.143, 0.041, respectively).

Because of the difficulties to find frequent HLA matched donors for acute leukemia patients; flow cytometric platelet cross-matching may provide the most useful way for selecting donors. It is useful even in the presence of alloimunization in children.","['Sayed, Douaa', 'Bakry, Rania', 'El-Sharkawy, Nahla', 'Zahran, Asmaa', 'Khalaf, Muhammed R']","['Sayed D', 'Bakry R', 'El-Sharkawy N', 'Zahran A', 'Khalaf MR']","['Clinical Pathology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Egypt.

In some instances, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) in multiple myeloma, there is evidence for a central role in maintaining malignant growth (1). The relationship between IL-6 and multiple myeloma is probably more complex, involving other cytokines that signal through receptors, which share the gp130 chain with the IL-6 receptor. Another strong association is that of IL-2 with acute T-cell lymphoma/leukemia, which express and release large amounts of the IL-2 receptor-alpha chain (CD25, Tac) (2). In other hematopoietic malignancies there is no strong evidence for the involvement of cytokines in the malignant process. Nevertheless, if a malignant clone expresses receptors for a cytokine and that cytokine is available, the end result may be accelerated proliferation or enhanced survival of the malignant cells. Conversely, expression of receptor for cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which tend to inhibit proliferation, or molecules like Fas, which induce apoptosis, may control the malignant clone. Thus cytokine receptor expression may provide valuable information on the behavior of the malignant clone (3). These considerations make a case for screening of cytokine receptor expression as a part of routine diagnostic evaluation of patients with hematopoietic malignancy. It is emphasized, however, that at present cytokine receptor expression is a research tool, with the possible exception of the determination of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha chain (Tac, CD25). Measurement of soluble Tac has been widely reviewed (4) and will not be described here.","['Zola, H']",['Zola H'],"[""Child Health Research Institute, Women's and Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Med,Methods in molecular medicine,101123138,,,2001/01/01 00:00,2001/01/01 00:01,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2001/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1385/1-59259-074-8:339 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Med. 2001;55:339-51. doi: 10.1385/1-59259-074-8:339.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We introduce these methodologies in both general terms and within the context of a differential diagnosis of leukemia/lymphoma. The long-term goal of the molecular hematologist/oncologist is to describe all mutations that occur within a given type or subtype of leukemia/lymphoma. This involves the discovery of new somatic and possibly hereditary mutations that contribute to the genesis of these hematologic malignancies. However, for this information to be useful in treatment regimens, therapies that target or affect these growth-dysregulating mutations must be found.

The elucidation of the Philadelphia translocation emphasizes the importance of cytogenetic analysis of hematologic malignancies. Clarification of this chromosomal aberration as a reciprocal translocation became only possible after the development of cytogenetic banding techniques by Caspersson et al. in 1970 (6). Chromosome banding analysis revealed numerous nonrandom chromosomal aberrations, particularly balanced translocations in leukemias and lymphomas, e.g., the translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) first described by Rowley et al. in 1973 (7). These balanced translocations were shown to be of etiologic as well as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic importance. They result in an altered gene function by two main mechanisms: (1) sequences of, in most instances, a transcription factor or receptor tyrosine kinase gene are fused to a normally unrelated gene, creating specific fusion proteins with oncogenic properties, and (2) protooncogenes are repositioned to the vicinity of promoter/enhancer elements of the immunoglobulin- or T-cell receptor genes, thereby initiating their activation (8).","['Hilgenfeld, E', 'Padilla-Nash, H', 'Schrock, E', 'Ried, T', 'Haas, O A', 'Serve, H']","['Hilgenfeld E', 'Padilla-Nash H', 'Schrock E', 'Ried T', 'Haas OA', 'Serve H']","['Genetics Department, Division of Clinical Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Med,Methods in molecular medicine,101123138,,,2001/01/01 00:00,2001/01/01 00:01,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2001/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1385/1-59259-074-8:65 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Med. 2001;55:65-79. doi: 10.1385/1-59259-074-8:65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only is the marrow often not affected by the lymphoma, but also when it is, the number of abnormal cells is relatively small and/or the abnormal cells are not in division and, hence, do not yield a sufficient number of metaphases for cytogenetic analysis.

Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by a population pharmacokinetic analysis based on 622 plasma samples from 34 patients at steady state. Approximately 4.6-fold variability in individual clearance was observed (range, 3.4-15.5 L/hr). The individual estimated clearance was significantly increased in patients with the SLCO1B3 334GG genotype (median value +/- standard deviation, 9.5 +/- 3.1 L/hr; n = 19) compared with SLCO1B3 334TT and TG genotypes (7.0 +/- 3.1 L/hr; n = 15) (P = 0.019). Patients with the ABCB1 3435CC genotype had significantly higher imatinib clearance (12.7 +/- 3.0 L/hr; n = 7) compared with patients with ABCB1 3435CT and TT genotypes (7.9 +/- 2.7 L/hr; n = 27) (P = 0.035). In conclusion, the present study suggests that single nucleotide polymorphisms of the influx transporter SLCO1B3 and the efflux transporter ABCB1 were functionally associated with individual variability of imatinib pharmacokinetics in Japanese patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Yamakawa, Yuji', 'Hamada, Akinobu', 'Nakashima, Reiko', 'Yuki, Misato', 'Hirayama, Chie', 'Kawaguchi, Tatsuya', 'Saito, Hideyuki']","['Yamakawa Y', 'Hamada A', 'Nakashima R', 'Yuki M', 'Hirayama C', 'Kawaguchi T', 'Saito H']","['Department of Pharmacy, Kumamoto University Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Organic Anion Transporters/genetics', 'Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent/*genetics', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/genetics', 'Piperazines/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B3', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/10/18 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FTD.0b013e31820beb02 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2011 Apr;33(2):244-50. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31820beb02.,,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SLCO1B1 protein, human)', '0 (SLCO1B3 protein, human)', '0 (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B3)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)', '0 (cytochrome P-450 CYP2C subfamily)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have identified two direct transcriptional targets of PLZF, REDD1 and smooth muscle alpha-actin. REDD1 is activated by PLZF. It mediates the PLZF-dependent downregulation of TORC1 and is responsible for the maintenance of pluripotency in cultures of spermatogonial progenitor cells. This activity may extend to other stem-like cell types. The effect of REDD1 on TORC1 also raises the possibility that REDD1 controls cell growth, tumorigenicity and senescence. The regulatory loop extending from PLZF via REDD1 to TORC1 identifies REDD1 as a critical determinant of TOR activity. The transcription of smooth muscle alpha-actin is repressed by PLZF. In fibroblasts, this downregulation is accompanied by a change of cell shape and a dramatic reorganization of the cytoskeleton. It is also correlated with the acquisition of cellular resistance to oncogenic transformation. The resistance is selective, it works against some oncoproteins but not against others. The molecular mechanisms underlying the changes in the cytoskeleton and in the susceptibility to oncogenic transformation are unknown. However these changes are dependent on the activity of RAS and thus probably involve the RAC/RHO family of proteins.","['Kolesnichenko, Marina', 'Vogt, Peter K']","['Kolesnichenko M', 'Vogt PK']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA. marinak@scripps.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Actins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Smooth/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spermatogonia/cytology/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/06/28 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['14829 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.5.14829 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Mar 1;10(5):771-5. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.5.14829.

A higher viral load in individuals with HTLV-1 infection increases their risk of developing HAM/TSP and ATL. Moreover, the high proviral load is associated with the clinical progression of HAM/TSP. Reduction of the number of HTLV-1-infected cells is therefore crucial for preventing and treating HTLV-1-associated diseases. Recently, fucoidan, a complex sulphated polysaccharide derived from marine seaweed, has been demonstrated to exert inhibitory effects on HTLV-1 infection in vitro. In this study, we examined the in vivo effects of fucoidan on HTLV-1 infection. METHODS: In this single-centre open-label trial, 13 patients with HAM/TSP were treated with 6 g fucoidan daily for 6-13 months. The HTLV-1 proviral DNA load and frequencies of HTLV-1-specific CD8(+) T-cells, natural killer cells, invariant natural killer T-cells and dendritic cells in the peripheral blood were analysed. Furthermore, the in vitro inhibitory effect of fucoidan on cell-to-cell HTLV-1 infection was examined by using luciferase reporter cell assays. RESULTS: Fucoidan inhibited the cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV-1 in vitro. Furthermore, fucoidan therapy resulted in a 42.4% decrease in the HTLV-1 proviral load without affecting the host immune cells. During the treatment, no exacerbation was observed. Four patients with HAM/TSP developed diarrhoea, which improved immediately after stopping fucoidan administration. CONCLUSIONS: Fucoidan is a new potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Araya, Natsumi', 'Takahashi, Katsunori', 'Sato, Tomoo', 'Nakamura, Tatsufumi', 'Sawa, Chika', 'Hasegawa, Daisuke', 'Ando, Hitoshi', 'Aratani, Satoko', 'Yagishita, Naoko', 'Fujii, Ryoji', 'Oka, Hiroshi', 'Nishioka, Kusuki', 'Nakajima, Toshihiro', 'Mori, Naoki', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa']","['Araya N', 'Takahashi K', 'Sato T', 'Nakamura T', 'Sawa C', 'Hasegawa D', 'Ando H', 'Aratani S', 'Yagishita N', 'Fujii R', 'Oka H', 'Nishioka K', 'Nakajima T', 'Mori N', 'Yamano Y']","['Department of Molecular Medical Science, Institute of Medical Science, St Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Antivir Ther,Antiviral therapy,9815705,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Count', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/prevention & control/virology', 'Luciferases/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/immunology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/prevention & control/virology', 'Polysaccharides/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Proviruses/genetics/immunology', 'Seaweed/chemistry', 'Viral Load/*drug effects']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/07/23 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3851/IMP1699 [doi]'],ppublish,Antivir Ther. 2011;16(1):89-98. doi: 10.3851/IMP1699.,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '9072-19-9 (fucoidan)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, depletion of Kdm2b/Jhdm1b in hematopoietic progenitors significantly impairs Hoxa9/Meis1-induced leukemic transformation. In leukemic stem cells, knockdown of Kdm2b/Jhdm1b impairs their self-renewing capability in vitro and in vivo. The functions of Kdm2b/Jhdm1b are mediated by its silencing of p15(Ink4b) expression through active demethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 dimethyl. Thus, our study suggests that Kdm2b/Jhdm1b functions as an oncogene and plays a critical role in leukemia development and maintenance.","['He, Jin', 'Nguyen, Anh Tram', 'Zhang, Yi']","['He J', 'Nguyen AT', 'Zhang Y']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Substrate Specificity/genetics', 'Transfection']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45312-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-10-312736 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 7;117(14):3869-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-10-312736.

However, little is known about the normal function of LDOC1, its contribution to the pathophysiology of CLL, or its prognostic significance. In this study, we have investigated LDOC1 mRNA expression in a large cohort of untreated CLL patients, as well as in normal peripheral blood B-cell (NBC) subsets and primary B-cell lymphoma samples. We have confirmed that LDOC1 is dramatically down-regulated in mutated CLL cases compared with unmutated cases, and have identified a new splice variant, LDOC1S. We show that LDOC1 is expressed in NBC subsets (naive > memory), suggesting that it may play a role in normal B-cell development. It is also expressed in primary B-cell lymphoma samples, in which its expression is associated with somatic mutation status. In CLL, we show that high levels of LDOC1 correlate with biomarkers of poor prognosis, including cytogenetic markers, unmutated somatic mutation status, and ZAP70 expression.

It is characterized by severe hemorrhagic complications due in part to excessive fibrinolysis, resulting from the excessive generation of the fibrinolytic enzyme, plasmin, at the cell surface of the PML cells. The treatment of patients with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) effectively ameliorates the disease by promoting the destruction of the PML-RAR-alpha oncoprotein. In the present study we show for the first time that the plasminogen receptor, S100A10, is present on the extracellular surface of APL cells and is rapidly down-regulated in response to all-trans retinoic acid. The loss of S100A10 is concomitant with a loss in fibrinolytic activity. Furthermore, the induced expression of the PML-RAR-alpha oncoprotein increased the expression of cell surface S100A10 and also caused a dramatic increase in fibrinolytic activity. Depletion of S100A10 by RNA interference effectively blocked the enhanced fibrinolytic activity observed after induction of the PML-RAR-alpha oncoprotein. These experiments show that S100A10 plays a crucial role in the generation of plasmin leading to fibrinolysis, thus providing a link to the clinical hemorrhagic phenotype of APL.","[""O'Connell, Paul A"", 'Madureira, Patricia A', 'Berman, Jason N', 'Liwski, Robert S', 'Waisman, David M']","[""O'Connell PA"", 'Madureira PA', 'Berman JN', 'Liwski RS', 'Waisman DM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Annexin A2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Fibrinolysin/metabolism', 'Fibrinolysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Plasminogen/metabolism', 'S100 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45279-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-07-298851 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 14;117(15):4095-105. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-07-298851.

Multiple defects in HLA class I antigen presentation exist in cancer that may contribute to immune escape, but less is known about roles for HLA class II antigen presentation. On class II(+) leukemic blasts, the presence of class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) is known to be correlated with poor survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we evaluated the functional significance of CLIP expression on leukemic blasts of AML patients. CD4(+) T cells from patients were cocultured with autologous CLIP(-) and CLIP(+) primary leukemic blasts and analyzed for several functional parameters by flow cytometry. Increased HLA-DR and IFN-gamma expression was observed for CD4(+) T cells stimulated with CLIP(-) leukemic blasts, in contrast to CLIP(+) leukemic blasts, which indicated an activation and polarization of the CD4(+) T cells toward T-helper 1 cells. In addition, CLIP(-) leukemic blasts induced greater outgrowth of effector memory CD4(+) T cells (with HLA-DR-restricted T-cell receptor Vbeta repertoires) that were associated with better leukemia-specific reactivity than with CLIP(+) leukemic blasts. Our findings offer a clinical rationale to downmodulate CLIP on leukemic blasts as a strategy to degrade immune escape and improve leukemia-specific T-cell immunity in AML patients.","['van Luijn, Marvin M', 'van den Ancker, Willemijn', 'Chamuleau, Martine E D', 'Zevenbergen, Adri', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'van Ham, S Marieke', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['van Luijn MM', 'van den Ancker W', 'Chamuleau ME', 'Zevenbergen A', 'Westers TM', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van Ham SM', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam and VU Institute for Cancer and Immunology, VU University Medical Center, The Netherlands. m.luijn@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology/pathology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/07/12 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-3689 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3689 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Apr 1;71(7):2507-17. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3689.

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: England and Wales. PARTICIPANTS: 2690 childhood cancer cases and 4858 age, sex, and region matched controls from the United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study (UKCCS), born 1976-96. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of all childhood cancer, leukaemia, lymphoma, and central nervous system tumours, measured by odds ratios. RESULTS: Logistic regression models conditioned on matching factors, with adjustment for maternal age and child's birth weight, showed no evidence of increased risk of childhood cancer with in utero exposure to ultrasound scans. Some indication existed of a slight increase in risk after in utero exposure to x rays for all cancers (odds ratio 1.l4, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 1.45) and leukaemia (1.36, 0.91 to 2.02), but this was not statistically significant. Exposure to diagnostic x rays in early infancy (0-100 days) was associated with small, non-significant excess risks for all cancers and leukaemia, as well as increased risk of lymphoma (odds ratio 5.14, 1.27 to 20.78) on the basis of small numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results for lymphoma need to be replicated, all of the findings indicate possible risks of cancer from radiation at doses lower than those associated with commonly used procedures such as computed tomography scans, suggesting the need for cautious use of diagnostic radiation imaging procedures to the abdomen/pelvis of the mother during pregnancy and in children at very young ages.","['Rajaraman, Preetha', 'Simpson, Jill', 'Neta, Gila', 'Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy', 'Ansell, Pat', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Ron, Elaine', 'Roman, Eve']","['Rajaraman P', 'Simpson J', 'Neta G', 'Berrington de Gonzalez A', 'Ansell P', 'Linet MS', 'Ron E', 'Roman E']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD 20892-7238, USA. rajarama@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Diagnosis/*adverse effects', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/epidemiology', 'Radiography/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Ultrasonography/*adverse effects', 'Wales/epidemiology']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/03/15 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1136/bmj.d472 [doi]'],epublish,BMJ. 2011 Feb 10;342:d472. doi: 10.1136/bmj.d472.,20110210,,PMC3037470,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['BMJ. 2011;342:d1486.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred five CML patients on imatinib therapy were enrolled. Creatinine, urea, uric acid, and potassium measurements from imatinib treatment onset until the end of follow-up (median 4.5 years) were included in the analysis. GFR was estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. RESULTS: During follow-up, 7% of patients developed acute kidney injury; creatinine levels returned to baseline in only one of them. According to the regression equation, the mean baseline value of the estimated GFR was 88.9 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Estimated GFR decreased significantly with imatinib treatment duration; the mean decrease per year was 2.77 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (P < 0.001); 12% of patients developed chronic renal failure. Age, hypertension, and a history of chronic renal failure or interferon usage were not significantly related to the mean decrease in the estimated GFR over time. CONCLUSION: The introduction of imatinib therapy in nonclinical trial CML patients is associated with potentially irreversible acute renal injury, and the long-term treatment may cause a clinically relevant decrease in the estimated GFR.","['Marcolino, M S', 'Boersma, E', 'Clementino, N C D', 'Macedo, A V', 'Marx-Neto, A D', 'Silva, M H C R', 'van Gelder, T', 'Akkerhuis, K M', 'Ribeiro, A L']","['Marcolino MS', 'Boersma E', 'Clementino NCD', 'Macedo AV', 'Marx-Neto AD', 'Silva MHCR', 'van Gelder T', 'Akkerhuis KM', 'Ribeiro AL']","['School of Medicine, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

However, the mechanisms underlying its anti-cancer mechanisms are not yet understood. In this study, the apoptotic effects of cordycepin were investigated in human leukemia cells. Treatment with cordycepin significantly inhibited cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis but not necrosis. This induction was associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of caspases, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase protein. However, apoptosis induced by cordycepin was attenuated by caspase inhibitors, indicating an important role for caspases in cordycepin responses. Administration of N-acetyl-l-cysteine, a scavenger of ROS, also significantly inhibited cordycepin-induced apoptosis and activation of caspases. These results support a mechanism whereby cordycepin induces apoptosis of human leukemia cells through a signaling cascade involving a ROS-mediated caspase pathway.","['Jeong, Jin-Woo', 'Jin, Cheng-Yun', 'Park, Cheol', 'Hong, Su Hyun', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Jeong, Yong Kee', 'Lee, Jae-Dong', 'Yoo, Young Hyun', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Jeong JW', 'Jin CY', 'Park C', 'Hong SH', 'Kim GY', 'Jeong YK', 'Lee JD', 'Yoo YH', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Biochemistry and Research Institute of Oriental Medicine, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cordyceps/chemistry', 'Deoxyadenosines/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2010/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(11)00030-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2011.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2011 Jun;25(4):817-24. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2011.02.001.

Bone marrow examination may be required for precise differentiation. The study was conducted to evaluate the role of mean platelet volume (MPV) to discriminate between pancytopenia due to megaloblastic anaemia or non-megaloblastic causes. METHODS: A total of 268 cases of pancytopenia were divided into megaloblastic and non- megaloblastic group depending on clinical, laboratory and bone marrow examination. Mean MPV was statistically analyzed in both the groups along with comparison with healthy controls. RESULTS: The mean MPV in 88 cases of megaloblastic group (7.97 fl) was although statistically significantly higher than mean MPV in 180 cases of non-megaloblastic group (7.04 fl) with P value <0.05 but had limited sensitivity and specificity to discriminate megaloblastic and non-megaloblastic pancytopenia (cut off of 7.45 fl was 63.6% sensitive and 67.3% specific as observed by receptor operating characteristic curve analysis).The mean MPV in aplastic/hypocellular marrow and acute leukaemia category of non-megaloblastic group was significantly lower than megaloblastic group of pancytopenia (P value <0.05). MPV was also significantly lower in non-megaloblastic pancytopenia as compared to controls (P < 0.001) while there was no statistical difference in MPV between megaloblastic pancytopenia and controls (P < 0.057). CONCLUSION: MPV has limited sensitivity and specificity to discriminate between megaloblastic and non-megaloblastic pancytopenia. Pancytopenia due to aplastic/hypocellular marrow and acute leukaemia has significantly lower MPV than megaloblastic group while other pancytopenic cases do not show any statistical difference in MPV from megaloblastic pancytopenia.","['Chandra, H', 'Chandra, S', 'Rawat, A', 'Verma, S K']","['Chandra H', 'Chandra S', 'Rawat A', 'Verma SK']","['Department of Pathology, Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences, Swami Ram Nagar, Doiwala, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. drharishbudakoti31@yahoo.co.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Anemia, Megaloblastic/*diagnosis', 'Blood Platelets/*cytology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Size', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Pancytopenia/diagnosis/*etiology', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01296.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2011 Aug;33(4):409-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2011.01296.x.

The benefit of screening for occult cancers in this population is still not clear. AIM: To evaluate a systematic screening programme for cancer in elderly patients with VTE. METHODS: This was a prospective study with a 12-month follow-up period. It was conducted in a single centre in consecutive patients over the age of 70 years who had a confirmed diagnosis of VTE. Predefined non-invasive screening techniques for cancer with clinical, laboratory (including tumour markers) and radiological investigations (abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray and a thoraco-abdominopelvic computed tomography scan) were evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty patients with a median age of 80 years (range: 70 to 94 years) were included. One patient was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia at inclusion and cancers were found in three other patients during the follow-up period (rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma with hepatic metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric adenocarcinoma). Only one of the four cancers could have been treated at an earlier stage. The mortality rate of the entire cohort after 12 months was 28%. Two patients died as a direct consequence of cancer. DISCUSSION: In this study of elderly patients, a non-invasive screening strategy did not detect several cancers that were subsequently overt clinically. A full history, clinical examination and routine laboratory investigations might be the optimal first-line strategy to detect cancer after the diagnosis of VTE in elderly patients, but regular clinical examinations during follow up are warranted.","['Rieu, V', 'Chanier, S', 'Philippe, P', 'Ruivard, M']","['Rieu V', 'Chanier S', 'Philippe P', 'Ruivard M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, CHU Estaing, Clermont-Ferrand Department of Medicine, Centre Hospitalier, Riom, France. vrieu@chu-clermontferrand.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Early Detection of Cancer/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Venous Thromboembolism/*epidemiology']",2011/02/12 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02448.x [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2011 Nov;41(11):769-75. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02448.x.,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Herein, we describe the experience generated during this period (January 1, 2005-December 31, 2009). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Good manufacturing practices and standard operating procedures were used to address donor selection, as well as umbilical cord blood (UCB) collection, processing, and cryopreservation. Based mainly on HLA and nucleated cell content, specific UCB units were thawed, processed, and released for transplantation. RESULTS: A total of 589 UCB units were stored, representing 54% of the total number of units collected. Forty-eight units (8.14% of the stored units) were released for transplantation of 36 patients. Twenty-six patients (72% of cases) corresponded to patients with acute leukemia, five (14%) to patients with marrow failure, and the rest (five; 14%) to patients with hemoglobinopathies and other syndromes. The median number of nucleated cells infused per patient was 6.71 x 10(7) /kg and the median number of CD34+ cells was 4.8 x 10(5) /kg. Current engraftment data indicate that engraftment occurred in 56%, and no engraftment in 44%, of cases. Engraftment was more frequent (59%) in patients that received more than 3 x 10(7) total nucleated cells (TNCs)/kg body weight, than in those receiving fewer than 3 x 10(7) TNCs/kg (40%). Myeloid engraftment was observed 7 to 54 days posttransplant (median, 23 days), whereas platelet engraftment was detected on Days 12 to 87 posttransplant (median, 38 days). To date, the disease-free survival rate was 41% and the overall survival was 47%, with survival periods of 126 to 1654 days. CONCLUSION: Although the experience presented herein is still limited and the period of analysis is still short, the results obtained during these 5 years are encouraging.","['Guerra-Marquez, Angel', 'Novelo-Garza, Barbara', 'Malagon-Martinez, Araceli', 'Limon-Flores, Alejandro', 'Luna-Bautista, Fernando', 'Juan-Shum, Luis', 'Montero-Ponce, Ines', 'Sanchez-Valle, Elizabeth', 'Penaflor, Karina', 'Velez-Ruelas, Maria Antonieta', 'Romero-Juarez, Yanin', 'Mayani, Hector']","['Guerra-Marquez A', 'Novelo-Garza B', 'Malagon-Martinez A', 'Limon-Flores A', 'Luna-Bautista F', 'Juan-Shum L', 'Montero-Ponce I', 'Sanchez-Valle E', 'Penaflor K', 'Velez-Ruelas MA', 'Romero-Juarez Y', 'Mayani H']","['Umbilical Cord Blood Bank and Department of Pediatric Hematology, La Raza Medical Center, Mexican Institute of Social Security, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Blood Banks/*statistics & numerical data', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Fetal Blood', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/ultrastructure', 'Hemoglobinopathies/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Mexico', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Social Security', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02875.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2011 Feb;51(2):328-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02875.x.

It is a potent anti-apoptotic protein and plays a critical role in tumour cell survival, tumour progression and angiogenesis, metastasis and resistance to therapy. Recent evidence shows that GRP78 can also exist outside the ER. The finding that GRP78 is present on the surface of cancer but not normal cells in vivo represents a paradigm shift on how GRP78 controls cell homoeostasis and provides an opportunity for cancer-specific targeting. Cell-surface GRP78 has emerged as an important regulator of tumour cell signalling and viability as it forms complexes with a rapidly expanding repertoire of cell-surface protein partners, regulating proliferation, PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt signalling and cell viability. Evidence is also emerging that GRP78 serves as a receptor for viral entry into host cells. Additionally, a novel cytosolic form of GRP78 has been discovered prominently in leukaemia cells. These, coupled with reports of nucleus- and mitochondria-localized forms of GRP78, point to the previously unanticipated role of GRP78 beyond the ER that may be critical for cell viability and therapeutic targeting.","['Ni, Min', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Lee, Amy S']","['Ni M', 'Zhang Y', 'Lee AS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1441 Eastlake Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90089-9176, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', '*Signal Transduction']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/04/20 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20101569 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20101569 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2011 Mar 1;434(2):181-8. doi: 10.1042/BJ20101569.,,"['0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)']",PMC3353658,,,"['CA111700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK079999/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA027607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA027607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK079999/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS373948'],,['(c) The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2011 Biochemical Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In pivotal head-to-head trials, posaconazole was significantly more effective in preventing IFD than standard azole therapy (i.e. oral fluconazole or itraconazole) in chemotherapy-induced neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and was noninferior to treatment with fluconazole in patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who were receiving intensive immunosuppressive therapy following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In both indications, prophylactic posaconazole was associated with significantly lower rates of IFD-related mortality. The overall tolerability profile of posaconazole was generally similar to that of the other prophylactic treatments. The large body of modelled cost-effectiveness analyses from a healthcare payer perspective on the use of prophylactic posaconazole suggest that it is a dominant or cost-effective option relative to prophylaxis with standard azole therapy in neutropenic patients with AML/MDS, and fluconazole in patients with GVHD. Based on clinical trial data in these patient groups, antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole was predicted to be a dominant or cost-effective option relative to prophylaxis with standard oral azoles, with regard to the incremental cost per QALY gained, life-year (LY) gained and/or other outcomes in cost-effectiveness analyses in numerous countries. In those analyses in which posaconazole did not dominate the comparator, posaconazole was considered cost effective, as the incremental cost per QALY or LY gained with posaconazole was lower than assumed willingness-to-pay thresholds. Sensitivity analyses consistently demonstrated that these results were robust to plausible changes in key model assumptions. In conclusion, prophylactic treatment with posaconazole is clinically effective in preventing IFD in neutropenic patients with AML/MDS and patients with GVHD. Available pharmacoeconomic data from several countries, despite some inherent limitations, support the use of posaconazole as a dominant or cost-effective prophylactic antifungal treatment relative to prophylaxis with standard oral azoles in these patient populations at high risk of developing IFD.","['Lyseng-Williamson, Katherine A']",['Lyseng-Williamson KA'],"['Adis, a Wolters Kluwer Business, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,,"['Antifungal Agents/adverse effects/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Fungal Infections/*economics/prevention & control', 'Drug Costs', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*economics/prevention & control', 'Triazoles/adverse effects/*economics/therapeutic use']",2011/02/12 06:00,2011/06/08 06:00,['2011/02/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['3 [pii]', '10.2165/11206800-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2011 Mar;29(3):251-68. doi: 10.2165/11206800-000000000-00000.,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The small-cell carcinoma represents the most frequent histologic variant described. Small-cell carcinoma is an epithelial tumor associated with a more aggressive behavior and poorer prognosis than transitional cell bladder carcinoma. The overall survival rate at 5 years does not exceed 8%. At the time of presentation 59% of patients have clinical stage >T2 and 56% show metastatic disease. In 50% of the patients, fatal progression occurs within 6 months. Local recurrence after radical surgery occurred in 50-70% of cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report three cases of pure neuroendocrine small-cell bladder cancer. Hematuria was the most common presenting symptom. Local advanced disease was present in all the cases with stage >T2, metastatic disease in 1 case, lymph node involvement and ureteral bilateral obstruction in 2. Two patients were treated by radical cystectomy, bilateral pelvic limph node resections and urinary derivation. Platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy was proposed but only two patients received the treatment. One patient with liver metastasis was managed only by extensive TUR and support regimen. RESULTS: In 2 patients residual or relapsed cancer reappered within 2 months after surgery. All of the three patients died of metastatic disease at 5, 7, and 13 months. Median overall survival was 7 months. The most common site of relapse and spread of disease was the peritoneum and intestinal tract, and the reason of death was uncontrolled acute hemorrhage from gastro-intestinal district. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of a prospective study, and because of the rarity of the disease, the best treatment for small-cell bladder cancer remains uncertain. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with platinum regimen plus aggressive surgical approach will be the treatment of choice. The association of chemotherapy and radiotherapy should also be considered.","['Ruoppolo, M', 'Pezzica, E', 'Milesi, R', 'Corti, D', 'Mercurio, P', 'Fragapane, G']","['Ruoppolo M', 'Pezzica E', 'Milesi R', 'Corti D', 'Mercurio P', 'Fragapane G']","['UO Urologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Ospedale Treviglio Caravaggio (Bergamo), Italy. micheleruoppolo@tiscalinet.it']",['ita'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Urologia,Urologia,0417372,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine/complications/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology/secondary/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/complications/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology/secondary/surgery', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cystectomy', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Hematuria/etiology', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/complications/secondary', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Liver Neoplasms/secondary', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Peritoneal Neoplasms/secondary', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Stomach Neoplasms', 'Survival Rate', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology/surgery']",2011/02/16 06:00,2011/06/18 06:00,['2011/02/11 06:00'],"['2010/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['F53692FD-E7C7-4C59-993C-434667F3D1B8 [pii]'],ppublish,Urologia. 2010 Oct-Dec;77 Suppl 17:64-71.,,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",,,,,,,,,Carcinoma neuroendocrino a piccole cellule della vescica; nostra esperienza.,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this review is to outline the most recent discoveries of the genetic alterations found in patients with MPNs. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to the JAK2V617F mutation, additional mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway have been discovered including a series of mutations in exon 12 of JAK2, the thrombopoietic receptor gene MPL, and in the gene encoding the JAK-STAT inhibitory adaptor protein LNK. Additionally, mutations in genes which appear to affect the epigenome of MPN patients have been discovered including mutations in TET2, IDH1/ 2, EZH2, and ASXL1. Lastly, some insights into the genetic events which contribute to transformation of a chronic MPN phenotype to acute myeloid leukemia have been elucidated, including deletion of the transcription factor Ikaros. SUMMARY: The spectrum of genetic abnormalities found in the classic MPNs has increased over the last 6 years and somatic mutations in JAK2, MPL, LNK, TET2, EZH2, ASXL1, and IDH1/2 have all been described. Despite this, the initiating genetic events responsible for the development of MPNs is still not totally understood.","['Abdel-Wahab, Omar']",['Abdel-Wahab O'],"['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA. abdelwao@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2011/02/11 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/02/11 06:00'],"['2011/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328343998e [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Mar;18(2):117-23. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328343998e.,,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

We previously showed that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1/Hsp32) underlies resistance of AML to TNF-induced apoptosis. Here we show for the first time that the modulatory protein, FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) indirectly regulates induction of HO-1 in response to TNF in human AML blasts, but not non-cancerous control cells. In AML cells, TNF-induced FLIP expression was an NF-kappaB-dependent event, and silencing of FLIP isoforms (FLIPL, FLIPS and FLIPR) induced pro-apoptotic responses to TNF, with FLIPL knock-down providing the greatest apoptotic switch. However, FLIPL knock-down consequently increased expression of HO-1; a response that occurred in AML (but not non-cancerous) cells to protect a proportion of them from apoptotic death. Our results show that increases in HO-1 induced an apoptotic-resistant form in AML cells in the absence of FLIPL. This is the first time that FLIPL has been shown to regulate the expression of HO-1. These data reveal unique regulatory networks in cancerous AML cells whereby FLIP regulation of HO-1 provides AML cells with secondary anti-apoptotic protection against extrinsic factors (eg TNF/chemotherapies) that try to switch on death signals in these highly death-resistant cells. Future AML therapies should target these mechanisms.","['Rushworth, Stuart A', 'Zaitseva, Lyubov', 'Langa, Susana', 'Bowles, Kristian M', 'MacEwan, David J']","['Rushworth SA', 'Zaitseva L', 'Langa S', 'Bowles KM', 'MacEwan DJ']","['School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2011/02/11 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2011/02/11 06:00'],"['2011/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['168 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.100909 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2010 Sep;1(5):359-66. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.100909.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",PMC3157730,,,['09-0014/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],,,,['Oncotarget. 2010 Sep;1(5):317-9.

Among the barriers to pig-to-human xenotransplantation are porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) since functional representatives of the two polytropic classes, PERV-A and PERV-B, are able to infect human embryonic kidney cells in vitro, suggesting that a xenozoonosis in vivo could occur. To assess the capacity of human and porcine cells to counteract PERV infections, we analyzed human and porcine APOBEC3 (A3) proteins. This multigene family of cytidine deaminases contributes to the cellular intrinsic immunity and act as potent inhibitors of retroviruses and retrotransposons. Our data show that the porcine A3 gene locus on chromosome 5 consists of the two single-domain genes A3Z2 and A3Z3. The evolutionary relationships of the A3Z3 genes reflect the evolutionary history of mammals. The two A3 genes encode at least four different mRNAs: A3Z2, A3Z3, A3Z2-Z3, and A3Z2-Z3 splice variant A (SVA). Porcine and human A3s have been tested toward their antiretroviral activity against PERV and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) using novel single-round reporter viruses. The porcine A3Z2, A3Z3 and A3Z2-Z3 were packaged into PERV particles and inhibited PERV replication in a dose-dependent manner. The antiretroviral effect correlated with editing by the porcine A3s with a trinucleotide preference for 5' TGC for A3Z2 and A3Z2-Z3 and 5' CAC for A3Z3. These results strongly imply that human and porcine A3s could inhibit PERV replication in vivo, thereby reducing the risk of infection of human cells by PERV in the context of pig-to-human xenotransplantation.","['Dorrschuck, Eva', 'Fischer, Nicole', 'Bravo, Ignacio G', 'Hanschmann, Kay-Martin', 'Kuiper, Heidi', 'Spotter, Andreas', 'Moller, Ronny', 'Cichutek, Klaus', 'Munk, Carsten', 'Tonjes, Ralf R']","['Dorrschuck E', 'Fischer N', 'Bravo IG', 'Hanschmann KM', 'Kuiper H', 'Spotter A', 'Moller R', 'Cichutek K', 'Munk C', 'Tonjes RR']","['Division of Medical Biotechnology, Paul Ehrlich Institut, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*veterinary/virology', 'Swine', 'Swine Diseases/*immunology/*virology', 'Virus Replication']",2011/02/11 06:00,2011/05/19 06:00,['2011/02/11 06:00'],"['2011/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01880-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01880-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Apr;85(8):3842-57. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01880-10.

Furthermore, only one patient in each study progressed to accelerated or blastic phase. In the phase 3 ENESTnd study, molecular and cytogenetic responses to nilotinib were superior to imatinib, and more patients achieved undetectable levels of disease with nilotinib. Nilotinib also demonstrated significantly lower progression than did imatinib.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have employed integrated genomic profiling approaches on CLL cases with and without del11q to identify 11q-relevant genes. RESULTS: We have identified differential expression of the insulin receptor (INSR) in CLL, including high-level INSR expression in the majority of CLL with del11q. High INSR mRNA expression in 11q CLL ( approximately 10-fold higher mean levels than other genomic categories) was confirmed by quantitative PCR in 247 CLL cases. INSR protein measurements in 257 CLL cases through flow cytometry, compared with measurements in normal CD19(+) B cells and monocytes, confirmed that a subset of CLL aberrantly expresses high INSR levels. INSR stimulation by insulin in CLL cells ex vivo resulted in the activation of canonical INSR signaling pathways, including the AKT-mTOR and Ras/Raf/Erk pathways, and INSR activation partially abrogated spontaneous CLL cell apoptosis ex vivo. Higher INSR levels correlated with shorter time to first therapy and shorter overall survival (OS). In bivariate analysis, INSR expression predicted for rapid initial disease progression and shorter OS in ZAP-70-low/negative CLL. Finally, in multivariate analysis (ZAP-70 status, IgV(H) status, and INSR expression), we detected elevated HRs and trends for short OS for CLL cases with high INSR expression (analyzed inclusive or exclusive of cases with del11q). CONCLUSIONS: Our aggregate biochemical and clinical outcome data suggest biologically meaningful elevated INSR expression in a substantial subset of all CLL cases, including many cases with del11q.","['Saiya-Cork, Kamlai', 'Collins, Roxane', 'Parkin, Brian', 'Ouillette, Peter', 'Kuizon, Erlene', 'Kujawski, Lisa', 'Erba, Harry', 'Campagnaro, Erica', 'Shedden, Kerby', 'Kaminski, Mark', 'Malek, Sami N']","['Saiya-Cork K', 'Collins R', 'Parkin B', 'Ouillette P', 'Kuizon E', 'Kujawski L', 'Erba H', 'Campagnaro E', 'Shedden K', 'Kaminski M', 'Malek SN']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0936, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Receptor, Insulin/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Validation Studies as Topic']",2011/02/11 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/02/11 06:00'],"['2011/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-2058 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2058 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 May 1;17(9):2679-92. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2058.

We developed and used a novel automation platform, the Cell(maker), to screen a library of metabolites on two ESC-based phenotypic assays (i.e. proliferation and colony phenotype) and identified two metabolically related amino acids, namely l-proline (l-Pro) and l-ornithine (l-Orn), as key regulators of ESC metastability. Both compounds, but mainly l-Pro, force ESCs toward a novel epiblast stem cell (EpiSC)-like state, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Unlike EpiSCs, l-Pro-induced cells (PiCs) contribute to chimeric embryos and rely on leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) to self-renew. Furthermore, PiCs revert to ESCs or differentiate randomly upon removal of either l-Pro or LIF, respectively. Remarkably, PiC generation depends on both l-Pro metabolism (uptake and oxidation) and Fgf5 induction, and is strongly counteracted by antioxidants, mainly l-ascorbic acid (vitamin C, Vc). ESCs <--> PiCs phenotypic transition thus represents a previously undefined dynamic equilibrium between pluripotent states, which can be unbalanced either toward an EpiSC-like or an ESC phenotype by l-Pro/l-Orn or Vc treatments, respectively.

The objective of this work was to describe a MMC by presenting a case report. CASE REPORT: A 16-year old man suffering from chronic anaemia had to be transfused with two units of red blood cells in an outpatient unit. Although the transfusion went well for the first unit, the patient presented haemolysis during the transfusion of the second unit because the nurse administered the wrong unit. The incident was analysed during a mortality and morbidity conference with the attendance of the hemovigilance local correspondent. Immediate causes of the event were the failure to respect the transfusion procedure: in advance compatibility testing, failure to check the patient and blood component identification just before the transfusion. Factors contributing to the event were the deviation of transfusion practices, poor working conditions of nurses, linked to inadequate staff in relation to the activity. The discussion of the incident led to develop an action plan. DISCUSSION: This case shows the interest for staff members to discuss an adverse event. However, a well-defined methodology for conducting mortality and morbidity conferences is lacking and leads to a wide heterogeneity between teams. Major differences refer to criteria for case selection and quality of participants. This heterogeneity is likely to have an impact of the efficacy of mortality and morbidity conferences regarding the quality and safety of care.","['Francois, P', 'Sellier, E', 'Pouzol, P', 'Bal, G', 'Labarere, J']","['Francois P', 'Sellier E', 'Pouzol P', 'Bal G', 'Labarere J']","[""Unite d'evaluation medicale, pole de sante publique, pavillon Taillefer, CHU de Grenoble, BP 217, 38043 Grenoble cedex 09, France. pfrancois@chu-grenoble.fr""]",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Transfus Clin Biol,Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine,9423846,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia/etiology/therapy', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/blood', 'Blood Safety', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Congresses as Topic/organization & administration/trends', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects/nursing', 'Hemolysis', 'Hospitals, University/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medical Errors/adverse effects/*prevention & control', 'Patient Identification Systems', 'Postoperative Complications/blood/etiology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/surgery', 'Quality Improvement/*organization & administration', 'Risk Management/*organization & administration', 'Safety Management/*organization & administration']",2011/02/11 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/02/11 06:00'],"['2010/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1246-7820(10)00314-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tracli.2010.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Clin Biol. 2011 Feb;18(1):43-8. doi: 10.1016/j.tracli.2010.10.003.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Human tumor cells lines cultured in vitro, were used as model to study the effect of a photosensitizer synthesized from riboflavin, the 2',3',4',5'-riboflavin-tetrabutyrate (RTB), to increase the flavin concentration in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and the human epithelial cervical cancer cell line HeLa. We demonstrate that this compound, alone or with Trp, has a toxic dose-response effect evidenced by abnormal cell morphology and a decrease in the cell proliferation rate. The mechanism of cell death was investigated and the experimental evidence indicates that it proceeds primarily via apoptosis; however, autophagy cannot be discarded. Nuclear fluorescent staining with Hoechst 33258 and transmission electron microscopy of the cells showed condensed chromatin margination at the nuclear periphery and the formation of apoptotic bodies. Furthermore, Caspase-3 activity was demonstrated in both cell lines. In addition, the characteristic apoptotic DNA ladder was observed in HL-60 cells. On the other hand, a high cytoplasmic vacuolization was observed by electron transmission and confocal microscopy. LysoTraker-red localization in the vacuoles was observed by fluorescence microscopy, and a significant decrease in the number of vacuoles and in the cell proliferation rate diminution was observed when irradiation was performed in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. Considering that both cell death mechanisms have a dual role in the killing of tumor cells in vivo, a harmful effect that does not cause inflammation leading to tumor prophylaxis, we conclude that RTB could have potential clinical applications.","['Munoz, Marcelo A', 'Pacheco, Ariadna', 'Becker, Maria Ines', 'Silva, Eduardo', 'Ebensperger, Roberto', 'Garcia, Angelica M', 'De Ioannes, Alfredo E', 'Edwards, Ana M']","['Munoz MA', 'Pacheco A', 'Becker MI', 'Silva E', 'Ebensperger R', 'Garcia AM', 'De Ioannes AE', 'Edwards AM']","['Facultad de Quimica, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Casilla 306, Santiago 6094411, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

However, this signaling control does not function in neither mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) nor human ESCs (hESCs) or human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). To date, the underlying molecular mechanisms that determine this differential LIF-responsiveness have not been clarified. Here, we show that the cell surface glycan LacdiNAc (GalNAcbeta1-4GlcNAc) is required for LIF/STAT3 signaling. Undifferentiated state mESCs expressed LacdiNAc at a higher level than differentiated state cells. Knockdown of beta4GalNAc-T3 reduced LacdiNAc expression and caused a decrease in LIF/STAT3 signaling that lessened the rate of self-renewal of mESCs. A biochemical analysis showed that LacdiNAc expression on LIF receptor (LIFR) and gp130 was required for the stable localization of the receptors with lipid raft/caveolar components, such as caveolin-1. This localization is required for transduction of a sufficiently strong LIF/STAT3 signal. In primed state pluripotent stem cells, such as hiPSCs and mEpiSC-like cells produced from mESCs, LacdiNAc expression on LIFR and gp130 was extremely weak and the level of localization of these receptors on rafts/caveolae was also low. Furthermore, knockdown of beta4GalNAc-T3 decreased LacdiNAc expression and reduced the efficiency of reversion of primed state mEpiSC-like cells into naive state mESCs. These findings show that the different LIF-responsiveness of naive state (mESCs) and primed state (mEpiSCs, hESCs, and hiPSCs) cells is dependent on the expression of LacdiNAc on LIFR and gp130 and that this expression is required for the induction and maintenance of the naive state.","['Sasaki, Norihiko', 'Shinomi, Masahito', 'Hirano, Kazumi', 'Ui-Tei, Kumiko', 'Nishihara, Shoko']","['Sasaki N', 'Shinomi M', 'Hirano K', 'Ui-Tei K', 'Nishihara S']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Department of Bioinformatics, Faculty of Engineering, Soka University, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Animals', 'Caveolin 1', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lactose/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases/genetics', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.615 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2011 Apr;29(4):641-50. doi: 10.1002/stem.615.,,"['0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '136198-41-9 (N-acetylgalactosaminyl-1-4-N-acetylglucosamine)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases)', 'J2B2A4N98G (Lactose)']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assembled a comprehensive database of published fusion genes, including those reported only in individual studies and samples, and fusion genes resulting from deep sequencing of cancer genomes and transcriptomes. From the total set of 548 fusion genes, we designed 599,839 oligonucleotides, targeting both chimeric transcript junctions as well as sequences internal to each of the fusion gene partners. We investigated the presence of fusion genes in a series of 67 cell lines representing 15 different cancer types. Data from ten leukemia cell lines with known fusion gene status were used to develop an automated scoring algorithm, and in five cell lines the correct fusion gene was the top scoring hit, and one came second. Two additional fusion genes, BCAS4-BCAS3 in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line and CCDC6-RET in the TPC-1 thyroid cancer cell line were validated as true positive fusion transcripts. However, these fusion genes were not new to these cancer types, and none of 548 fusion genes were identified from a novel cancer type.

Here, we use a novel bioinformatic based integrative genomic profiling approach to elucidate conserved mechanisms of lymphomagenesis in the three commonest non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) entities: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. By integrating genome-wide DNA copy number analysis and transcriptome profiling of tumor cohorts, we identified genetic lesions present in each entity and highlighted their likely target genes. This revealed a significant enrichment of components of both the apoptosis pathway and the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, including amplification of the MAP3K12 locus in all three entities, within the set of genes targeted by genetic alterations in these diseases. Furthermore, amplification of 12p13.33 was identified in all three entities and found to target the FOXM1 oncogene. Amplification of FOXM1 was subsequently found to be associated with an increased MYC oncogenic signaling signature, and siRNA-mediated knock-down of FOXM1 resulted in decreased MYC expression and induced G2 arrest. Together, these findings underscore genetic alteration of the MAPK and apoptosis pathways, and genetic amplification of FOXM1 as conserved mechanisms of lymphomagenesis in common NHL entities. Integrative genomic profiling identifies common central survival mechanisms and highlights them as attractive targets for directed therapy.","['Green, Michael R', 'Aya-Bonilla, Carlos', 'Gandhi, Maher K', 'Lea, Rod A', 'Wellwood, Jeremy', 'Wood, Peter', 'Marlton, Paula', 'Griffiths, Lyn R']","['Green MR', 'Aya-Bonilla C', 'Gandhi MK', 'Lea RA', 'Wellwood J', 'Wood P', 'Marlton P', 'Griffiths LR']","['Genomics Research Centre, Griffith Health Institute, Griffith University, QLD, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'G2 Phase/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Genes, myc', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'S Phase/genetics']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/07/01 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2010/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20856 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 May;50(5):313-26. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20856.

Recently, several groups, including ours, have reported induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from swine by reprogramming somatic cells with a combination of four factors, OCT4 (POU5F1)/SOX2/KLF4/c-MYC delivered by retroviral transduction. The porcine (p) iPSC resembled human (h) ESC and the mouse ""Epiblast stem cells"" (EpiSC) in their colony morphology and expression of pluripotent genes, and are likely dependent on FGF2/ACTIVIN/NODAL signaling, therefore representing a primed ESC state. These cells are likely to advance swine as a model in biomedical research, since grafts could potentially be matched to the animal that donated the cells for re-programming. The objective of the present work has been to develop naive piPSC. Employing a combination of seven reprogramming factors assembled on episomal vectors, we successfully reprogrammed porcine embryonic fibroblasts on a modified LIF-medium supplemented with two kinase inhibitors; CHIR99021, which inhibits GSK-3beta, and PD0325901, a MEK inhibitor. The derived piPSC bear a striking resemblance to naive mESC in colony morphology, are dependent on LIF to maintain an undifferentiated phenotype, and express markers consistent with pluripotency. They exhibit high telomerase activity, a short cell cycle interval, and a normal karyotype, and are able to generate teratomas. Currently, the competence of these lines for contributing to germ-line chimeras is being tested.","['Telugu, Bhanu Prakash V L', 'Ezashi, Toshihiko', 'Roberts, R Michael']","['Telugu BP', 'Ezashi T', 'Roberts RM']","['Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA.

Inhalation of beryllium aerosols can cause chronic beryllium disease, a progressive, granulomatous fibrosis of the lung. Studies in laboratory animals and cultured animal cells indicate that alveolar macrophages take up beryllium compounds and participate in a hypersensitivity immune response to a beryllium-containing antigen. In the present work, human monocyte cell line THP-1 was induced with phorbol myristate acetate to differentiate into a macrophage. This cell with characteristics of human alveolar macrophages was employed to study cellular beryllium uptake and related biological effects. Morphological changes, phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads, and cell surface CD14 expression were used to verify the successful differentiation of THP-1 monocytes into macrophages. An improved mass spectrometry method for quantitative analysis of intracellular beryllium as opposed to the traditional radioisotopic approach was developed using ICP-MS. The influence of the solubility of beryllium compounds, exposure duration, and beryllium concentration on the incorporation of beryllium was studied. Our data indicated that the uptake of particulate BeO was much more significant than that of soluble BeSO(4), suggesting the major cellular uptake pathway is phagocytosis. Nevertheless, subsequent DAPI nuclear staining and PARP cleavage study indicated that beryllium uptake had a negligible effect on the apoptosis of THP-1 macrophages compared to the unstimulated macrophage control. Meanwhile, no substantial variation of tumour necrosis factor-alpha production was observed for THP-1 macrophages upon beryllium exposure. These data imply alveolar macrophages could have some level of tolerance to beryllium and this may explain why most Be-exposed individuals remain healthy throughout life.","['Ding, Jian', 'Lin, Lin', 'Hang, Wei', 'Yan, Xiaomei']","['Ding J', 'Lin L', 'Hang W', 'Yan X']","['Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, The Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, Key Laboratory of Analytical Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,IM,"['Beryllium/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2009/11/01 00:00,2011/06/01 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/b913265a [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2009 Nov;1(6):471-8. doi: 10.1039/b913265a.

The sscMap method has been shown to provide enhanced sensitivity in mapping meaningful connections leading to testable biological hypotheses and in identifying drug candidates with particular pharmacological and/or toxicological properties. Challenges remain, however, as to how to prioritise the large number of discovered connections in an unbiased manner such that the success rate of any following-up investigation can be maximised. We introduce a new concept, gene-signature perturbation, which aims to test whether an identified connection is stable enough against systematic minor changes (perturbation) to the gene-signature. We applied the perturbation method to three independent datasets obtained from the GEO database: acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cervical cancer, and breast cancer treated with letrozole. We demonstrate that the perturbation approach helps to identify meaningful biological connections which suggest the most relevant candidate drugs. In the case of AML, we found that the prevalent compounds were retinoic acids and PPAR activators. For cervical cancer, our results suggested that potential drugs are likely to involve the EGFR pathway; and with the breast cancer dataset, we identified candidates that are involved in prostaglandin inhibition. Thus the gene-signature perturbation approach added real values to the whole connectivity mapping process, allowing for increased specificity in the identification of possible therapeutic candidates.","['McArt, Darragh G', 'Zhang, Shu-Dong']","['McArt DG', 'Zhang SD']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Systems Biology/methods', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2010/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0016382 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Jan 31;6(1):e16382. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0016382.,20110131,,PMC3031567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ubiquitin specific protease USP7 (also called HAUSP) is known to associate with PML-NBs and to be a tight binding partner of two herpesvirus proteins that disrupt PML NBs. Here we investigated whether USP7 itself regulates PML-NBs. Silencing of USP7 was found to increase the number of PML-NBs, to increase the levels of PML protein and to inhibit PML polyubiquitylation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. This effect of USP7 was independent of p53 as PML loss was observed in p53-null cells. PML-NBs disruption was induced by USP7 overexpression independently of its catalytic activity and was induced by either of the protein interaction domains of USP7, each of which localized to PML-NBs. USP7 also disrupted NBs formed from some single PML isoforms, most notably isoforms I and IV. CK2alpha and RNF4, which are known regulators of PML, were dispensable for USP7-associated PML-NB disruption. The results are consistent with a novel model of PML regulation where a deubiquitylase disrupts PML-NBs through recruitment of another cellular protein(s) to PML NBs, independently of its catalytic activity.","['Sarkari, Feroz', 'Wang, Xueqi', 'Nguyen, Tin', 'Frappier, Lori']","['Sarkari F', 'Wang X', 'Nguyen T', 'Frappier L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Carcinoma', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endopeptidases/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Herpesviridae', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics', 'Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pathology/virology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2010/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0016598 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Jan 31;6(1):e16598. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0016598.,20110131,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases)']",PMC3031599,,,['93652/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subnuclear domains known as promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), or ND10 bodies, have been implicated in restricting early herpesviral gene expression. These viruses have evolved countermeasures to disperse PML-NBs, as shown in cells infected in vitro, but information about the fate of PML-NBs and their functions in herpesvirus infected cells in vivo is limited. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an alphaherpesvirus with tropism for skin, lymphocytes and sensory ganglia, where it establishes latency. Here, we identify large PML-NBs that sequester newly assembled nucleocapsids (NC) in neurons and satellite cells of human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and skin cells infected with VZV in vivo. Quantitative immuno-electron microscopy revealed that these distinctive nuclear bodies consisted of PML fibers forming spherical cages that enclosed mature and immature VZV NCs. Of six PML isoforms, only PML IV promoted the sequestration of NCs. PML IV significantly inhibited viral infection and interacted with the ORF23 capsid surface protein, which was identified as a target for PML-mediated NC sequestration. The unique PML IV C-terminal domain was required for both capsid entrapment and antiviral activity. Similar large PML-NBs, termed clastosomes, sequester aberrant polyglutamine (polyQ) proteins, such as Huntingtin (Htt), in several neurodegenerative disorders. We found that PML IV cages co-sequester HttQ72 and ORF23 protein in VZV infected cells. Our data show that PML cages contribute to the intrinsic antiviral defense by sensing and entrapping VZV nucleocapsids, thereby preventing their nuclear egress and inhibiting formation of infectious virus particles.

Here we present the structure of the bovine leukaemia virus transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) and identify a group of asparagine residues at the membrane-distal end of the trimer-of-hairpins that is strikingly conserved among divergent viruses. These asparagines are not essential for surface display of pre-fusogenic envelope. Instead, substitution of these residues dramatically disrupts membrane fusion. Our data indicate that, through electrostatic interactions with a chloride ion, the asparagine residues promote assembly and profoundly stabilize the fusion-active structures that are required for viral envelope-mediated membrane fusion. Moreover, the BLV TM structure also reveals a charge-surrounded hydrophobic pocket on the central coiled coil and interactions with basic residues that cluster around this pocket are critical to membrane fusion and form a target for peptide inhibitors of envelope function. Charge-surrounded pockets and electrostatic interactions with small ions are common among class-1 fusion proteins, suggesting that small molecules that specifically target such motifs should prevent assembly of the trimer-of-hairpins and be of value as therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry.","['Lamb, Daniel', 'Schuttelkopf, Alexander W', 'van Aalten, Daan M F', 'Brighty, David W']","['Lamb D', 'Schuttelkopf AW', 'van Aalten DM', 'Brighty DW']","['The Biomedical Research Institute, College of Medicine, Ninewells Hospital, The University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Catalytic Domain/drug effects', 'Cattle', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Ions/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/physiology', 'Retroviridae/metabolism/physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', '*Static Electricity', 'Surface Properties', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/06/11 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2010/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1001268 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2011 Feb 3;7(2):e1001268. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001268.,20110203,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Ions)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",PMC3033372,,,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '087590/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0900138/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900138(90614)/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, they represent prime candidates for anti-cancer therapy and specific antisense oligonucleotides or small molecule inhibitors have shown broad anti-cancer activities in pre-clinical models and are currently tested in clinical trials. In addition, immune-mediated tumor destruction is emerging as an interesting modality to treat cancer patients. Notably, spontaneous cellular immune responses against the Bcl-2 family proteins have been identified as frequent features in cancer patients underscoring that these proteins are natural targets for the immune system. Thus, Bcl-2 family may serve as an important and widely applicable target for anti-cancer immunotherapeutic strategies, alone or in the combination with conventional therapy.

BKV replication relies on the interactions of BKV with many nuclear components, and subnuclear structures such as promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) are known to play regulatory roles during a number of DNA virus infections. In this study, we investigated the relationship between PML-NBs and BKV during infection of primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial (RPTE) cells. While the levels of the major PML-NB protein components remained unchanged, BKV infection of RPTE cells resulted in dramatic alterations in both the number and the size of PML-NBs. Furthermore, two normally constitutive components of PML-NBs, Sp100 and hDaxx, became dispersed from PML-NBs. To define the viral factors responsible for this reorganization, we examined the cellular localization of the BKV large tumor antigen (TAg) and viral DNA. TAg colocalized with PML-NBs during early infection, while a number of BKV chromosomes were adjacent to PML-NBs during late infection. We demonstrated that TAg alone was not sufficient to reorganize PML-NBs and that active viral DNA replication is required. Knockdown of PML protein did not dramatically affect BKV growth in culture. BKV infection, however, was able to rescue the growth of an ICP0-null herpes simplex virus 1 mutant whose growth defect was partially due to its inability to disrupt PML-NBs. We hypothesize that the antiviral functions of PML-NBs are inactivated through reorganization during normal BKV infection.","['Jiang, Mengxi', 'Entezami, Pouya', 'Gamez, Monica', 'Stamminger, Thomas', 'Imperiale, Michael J']","['Jiang M', 'Entezami P', 'Gamez M', 'Stamminger T', 'Imperiale MJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,IM,"['BK Virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/metabolism/*virology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polyomavirus Infections/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Transport', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Virus Replication']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/08/31 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.00281-11 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.00281-10 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2011 Feb 8;2(1):e00281-10. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00281-10.

We investigated whether IL-15 expression is sufficient for leukemic transformation using a human IL-15-transgenic (IL-15Tg) mouse model. We noted that 100% of the mice observed over a 2-year period (n > 150) developed fatal expansions of CD8 T cells with NK markers, and determined that these cells expressed IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ralpha). The expression of IL-15Ralpha on CD8 T cells appears to be required for uncontrolled aggressive lymphoproliferation, because none of the IL-15Ralpha(-/-)-IL-15Tg mice that we followed for more than 2 years developed the fatal disease despite controlled expansion of CD8 T cells. In addition, in contrast to IL-15Tg mice, in which leukemia-like CD8 T cells expressed IL-15Ralpha persistently, acutely activated normal CD8 T cells only transiently expressed IL-15Ralpha. Inhibition of DNA methylation enabled sustained IL-15Ralpha expression induced by activation. We present a scenario for IL-15Tg mice in which CD8 T cells that acquire constitutive persistent IL-15Ralpha expression are at a selective advantage and become founder cells, outgrow other lymphocytes, and lead to the establishment of a leukemia-like condition.","['Sato, Noriko', 'Sabzevari, Helen', 'Fu, Song', 'Ju, Wei', 'Petrus, Michael N', 'Bamford, Richard N', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'Tagaya, Yutaka']","['Sato N', 'Sabzevari H', 'Fu S', 'Ju W', 'Petrus MN', 'Bamford RN', 'Waldmann TA', 'Tagaya Y']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Autocrine Communication/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/physiology', 'Gene Silencing/physiology', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Homeostasis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/*genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-15 Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', '*Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45272-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-09-307504 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 14;117(15):4032-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-09-307504.

The remaining two family members, MTG8 (RUNX1T1) and MTG16 (CBFA2T3) are identified as targets of chromosomal translocations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mtgr1(-/-) mice have defects in intestinal lineage allocation and wound healing. Moreover, these mice show signs of impaired intestinal stem cell function. Based on these phenotypes, we hypothesized that MTGR1 may influence tumorigenesis arising in an inflammatory background. We report that Mtgr1(-/-) mice were protected from tumorigenesis when injected with azoxymethane (AOM) and then subjected to repeated cycles of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Tumor cell proliferation was comparable, but Mtgr1(-/-) tumors had significantly higher apoptosis rates. These phenotypes were dependent on epithelial injury, the resultant inflammation, or a combination of both as there was no difference in aberrant crypt foci (ACF) or tumor burden when animals were treated with AOM as the sole agent. Gene expression analysis indicated that Mtgr1(-/-) tumors had significant upregulation of inflammatory networks, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for immune cell subsets revealed a marked multilineage increase in infiltrates, consisting predominately of CD3(+) and natural killer T (NKT) cells as well as macrophages.

T315I mutation, as one of the most frequent KD mutations, has been shown to be strongly associated with TKI resistance and subsequent therapeutic failure. A simple and sensitive method is thus required to detect T315I mutation at the earliest stage. METHODS: A single-tube allele specific-polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) method was developed to detect T315I mutation in a mixture of normal and mutant alleles of varying dilutions. Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct sequencing were performed as a comparison to AS-PCR. RESULTS: T315I mutant bands were observed in the mixtures containing as low as 0.5-1% of mutant alleles by AS-PCR. The detection sensitivity of DHPLC was around 1.5-3% dilution whereas sequencing analysis was unable to detect below 6.25% dilution. CONCLUSION: A single-tube AS-PCR is a rapid and sensitive screening method for T315I mutation. Detection of the most resistant leukemic clone in CML patients undergoing TKI therapy should be feasible with this simple and inexpensive method.","['Wongboonma, Wanwisa', 'Thongnoppakhun, Wanna', 'Auewarakul, Chirayu U']","['Wongboonma W', 'Thongnoppakhun W', 'Auewarakul CU']","['Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Alleles', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-4-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-4-7 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2011 Feb 8;4:7. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-4-7.,20110208,,PMC3045387,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes the results of a retrospective study of clinical outcomes and prognostic factors of AML in patients aged 75 years and older. In addition, we aimed to elucidate the situation of patients with AML accompanied by dementia, which has been largely ignored in previous studies. METHODS: The subjects consisted of 31 patients with untreated AML (including previous myelodysplastic syndrome: AML/MDS). All patients underwent chemotherapy, with 25 undergoing conventional therapy and six undergoing low-intensity therapy. RESULTS: Complete remission was obtained in 16 of the 31 cases (51.6%), with a 3-year survival rate of 11.5%. However, in seven cases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) was observed. Although we were able to perform induction therapy in each of these cases, consolidation therapy was difficult in cases of moderate AD. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that even very elderly patients can benefit from chemotherapy. However, it is thought that the treatment selection for cases which are complicated by moderate to severe dementia should be determined carefully while considering the patient's quality of life.","['Abe, Shine', 'Kanaya, Kiyoshi', 'Kikukawa, Masayuki', 'Sakai, Minoru', 'Akai, Tomotaka', 'Takata, Yusuke', 'Sakurai, Hirofumi', 'Shin, Kouichi', 'Mori, Mayumi', 'Iwamoto, Toshihiko']","['Abe S', 'Kanaya K', 'Kikukawa M', 'Sakai M', 'Akai T', 'Takata Y', 'Sakurai H', 'Shin K', 'Mori M', 'Iwamoto T']","['Department of Geriatric Medicine, Hachioji Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan. umegaki@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Geriatr Gerontol Int,Geriatrics & gerontology international,101135738,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dementia/complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1447-0594.2010.00682.x [doi]'],ppublish,Geriatr Gerontol Int. 2011 Jul;11(3):290-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1447-0594.2010.00682.x.

So far, DCs for clinical use are obtained from leukemic blasts or from monocytes, after 6 to 10 days of ex vivo culture. However, DC precursors are easily driven to DCs in short-term culture. We tested if DC precursors contained in peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) products obtained from AML patients can be used to induce antileukemia responses. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PBSCs obtained from 30 consecutive AML patients were tested. Myeloid DCs (MDCs) were purified by immunomagnetic selection and screened for cytogenetic and/or molecular abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. MDCs were matured and pulsed with autologous blast lysates and tested for stimulatory capability against AML cells. RESULTS: A median of 0.62 x 10(6) MDCs (range, 0.04-3.25)/mL were quantified in PBSC products. Isolated MDC expressed Class I and II HLA but CD86, CD54, and CCR5 partially. By FISH or PCR assay, these MDCs lacked cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities detected in leukemia cells at diagnosis. MDCs achieved a maturated stage (mature-MDCs) after 24-hour ex vivo culture with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and autologous blast lysates. These mature-MDCs were capable of stimulating autologous peripheral blood effectors to exert cytotoxicity against autologous leukemia cells and HL-60 cell line. CONCLUSION: We conclude that PBSCs obtained for autologous stem cell transplantation can constitute a novel source of MDCs to design feasible vaccination trials.","['Serrano-Lopez, Juana', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Joaquin', 'Serrano, Josefina', 'Alvarez-Rivas, Miguel A', 'Garcia-Castellano, Jose M', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'de la Rosa, Olga', 'Herrera-Arroyo, Concepcion', 'Torres-Gomez, Antonio']","['Serrano-Lopez J', 'Sanchez-Garcia J', 'Serrano J', 'Alvarez-Rivas MA', 'Garcia-Castellano JM', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'de la Rosa O', 'Herrera-Arroyo C', 'Torres-Gomez A']","['Department of Hematology and Laboratory for Cellular Therapy, Instituto Maimonides Investigacion Biomedica, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/*transplantation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/09/20 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.03042.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2011 Jul;51(7):1546-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.03042.x.

Previous studies have shown that in response to UV irradiation, Akt2 is sensitized to counteract the induced apoptosis. However, in response to oxidative stress such as hydrogen peroxide, it remains to be elucidated what member of the Akt family would be activated to initiate the signaling cascades leading to resistance of the induced apoptosis. In the present study, we present the first evidence that knockdown of Akt1 enhances cell survival under exposure to 50 muM H(2)O(2). This survival is derived from selective upregulation and activation of Akt2 but not Akt3, which initiates 3 major signaling cascades. First, murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is hyperphosphorylated, which promotes p53 degradation and attenuates its Ser-15 phosphorylation, significantly attenuating Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer (Bak) upregulation. Second, Akt2 activation inactivates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3beta) to promote stability of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1 (MCL-1). Finally, Akt2 activation promotes phosphorylation of FOXO3A toward cytosolic export and thus downregulates Bim expression. Overexpression of Bim enhances H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Together, our results demonstrate that among the Akt family members, Akt2 is an essential kinase in counteracting oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis through multiple signaling pathways.","['Zhang, Lan', 'Sun, Shuming', 'Zhou, Jie', 'Liu, Jiao', 'Lv, Jia-Han', 'Yu, Xiang-Qiang', 'Li, Chi', 'Gong, Lili', 'Yan, Qin', 'Deng, Mi', 'Xiao, Ling', 'Ma, Haili', 'Liu, Jin-Ping', 'Peng, Yun-Lei', 'Wang, Dao', 'Liao, Gao-Peng', 'Zou, Li-Jun', 'Liu, Wen-Bin', 'Xiao, Ya-Mei', 'Li, David Wan-Cheng']","['Zhang L', 'Sun S', 'Zhou J', 'Liu J', 'Lv JH', 'Yu XQ', 'Li C', 'Gong L', 'Yan Q', 'Deng M', 'Xiao L', 'Ma H', 'Liu JP', 'Peng YL', 'Wang D', 'Liao GP', 'Zou LJ', 'Liu WB', 'Xiao YM', 'Li DW']","['University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, 68198-5870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/ars.2010.3560 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2011 Jul 1;15(1):1-17. doi: 10.1089/ars.2010.3560.

Whole-cell binding assays have been developed to screen OBOC combinatorial libraries for ligands that bind to specific cell surface receptors. While very powerful, this screening method does not address the downstream cell signaling properties of the binding ligand. We have modified the OBOC technology by introducing a fixed known cell adhesion ligand to the outer layer of each bead. This one-bead-two-compound (OB2C) library configuration allows the bound cells to interact with the random immobilized chemical molecules on each bead. The bound cells can then be probed for specific cellular responses such as apoptosis and activation or inhibition of a specific cell signaling pathway. To validate this concept, an OB2C combinatorial library was created such that a random hexapeptide plus a high affinity lymphoma targeting ligand LLP2A were displayed on each bead.

Despite data obtained in animals or cell lines models, the mechanisms underlying the predominant eosinophil lineage targeting and the cytotoxicity of eosinophils in this leukemia remain unclear. To define more precisely intrinsic molecular events associated with F/P gene, we performed a proteomic analysis comparing F/P+ eosinophils (F/P-Eos) and eosinophils from healthy donors (C-Eos). Using 2D-DIGE and mass spectrometry techniques, we identified 41 proteins significantly overexpressed between F/P-Eos and C-Eos. Among them, 17.8% belonged to the oxidoreductase family. We further observed a down-expression of peroxiredoxin-2 (PRX-2) and an overexpression of src-homology-2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-1), enzymes regulating PDGFR downstream pathways, and especially intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This profile, confirmed in immunoblot analysis, appears specific to F/P-Eos compared to controls and patients with idiopathic HES.

The TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway usually participates in a wide range of cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Upon binding on TGF-beta1, the dimerized TGF-beta type II receptors recruit and phosphorylate the TGF-beta type I receptors, which phosphorylate the receptor-regulated SMAD (SMAD2 and SMAD3) presented by the SMAD anchor for receptor activation. The phosphorylated receptor-regulated SMAD form heterologous complexes with the common-mediator SMAD (SMAD4) and subsequently translocate into the nucleus, where they interact with other transcription factors to regulate the expression of target genes. This multi-functional signaling pathway modulated by various elements with complex mechanisms at different levels is also inevitably involved in cancer. We herein present data on the role of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway in human chronic myeloid leukemia and explain the potent biological effects of TGF-beta1 on leukemia cells. The paper is based on a review of articles selected from Cancerline and Medline data bases. The constitutively active tyrosine kinase produced by the specific Bcr-Abl fusion gene on the Philadelphia chromosome can enhance the resistance of malignant cells to TGF-beta1-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis, which contributes to enhancement of proteasomal degradation of p27. However, overexpression of the EVI1 gene, which is also caused by Bcr-Abl, can recruit the C-terminal binding protein and histone deacetylase to prevent the MH2 domain on SMAD3. The later is essential for transcription activation on target genes and leads to blockage of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway. Some studies have indicated that certain therapeutic agents applied in clinical treatment can inhibit proliferation and promote differentiation of leukemia cells by way of modulation of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signal pathway. For example, arsenic trioxide can promote specific degradation of the AML1/MDS1/EVI1 oncoprotein and inhibit the proliferation of leukemia cells. However, specific histone deacetylase inhibitors can interrupt the effect of histone deacetylase to alleviate EVI1-mediated suppression of TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor in the target therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia can effectively inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl and induce suppression on the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway. The TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway plays an important role in chronic myeloid leukemia cells and leads the leukemia cells to growth inhibition, differentiation and apoptosis. The positive influence of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway in chronic myeloid leukemia is fairly significant, and its potential effects in clinical treatment will bring about definite benefits. Since it is a complex signaling pathway widely involved in many aspects of cellular activities, further study and comprehensive analysis of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway are imperative and will have a guiding significance in research and clinical applications. It is an exciting area for future research.","['Su, Enyu', 'Han, Xiao', 'Jiang, Guosheng']","['Su E', 'Han X', 'Jiang G']","['Key Laboratory for Modern Medicine and Technology of Shandong Province, Institute of Basic Medicine, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Smad Proteins/metabolism', 'Smad1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism']",2011/02/10 06:00,2011/03/18 06:00,['2011/02/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 2010 Sep-Oct;96(5):659-66.,,"['0 (SMAD1 protein, human)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Smad1 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some questions were unresolved, such as the extent to which specific genetic or molecular alterations define certain tumors, and the status of provisional entities, categories for which the World Health Organization working groups felt there was insufficient evidence to recognize as distinct diseases at this time.

JNK1 has been shown to regulate BCL2 expression, thereby altering leukemogenesis, but the impact of c-JUN remained unclear. In this study, we show that JNK1 and c-JUN promote leukemogenesis via separate pathways, because lack of c-JUN impairs proliferation of p185(BCR-ABL)-transformed cells without affecting their viability. The decreased proliferation of c-Jun(Delta/Delta) cells is associated with the loss of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) expression. In c-Jun(Delta/Delta) cells, CDK6 expression becomes down-regulated upon BCR-ABL-induced transformation, which correlates with CpG island methylation within the 5' region of Cdk6. We verified the impact of Cdk6 deficiency using Cdk6(-/-) mice that developed BCR-ABL-induced B-lymphoid leukemia with significantly increased latency and an attenuated disease phenotype. In addition, we show that reexpression of CDK6 in BCR-ABL-transformed c-Jun(Delta/Delta) cells reconstitutes proliferation and tumor formation in Nu/Nu mice. In summary, our study reveals a novel function for the activating protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor c-JUN in leukemogenesis by antagonizing promoter methylation. Moreover, we identify CDK6 as relevant and critical target of AP-1-regulated DNA methylation on BCR-ABL-induced transformation, thereby accelerating leukemogenesis.","['Kollmann, Karoline', 'Heller, Gerwin', 'Ott, Rene Georg', 'Scheicher, Ruth', 'Zebedin-Brandl, Eva', 'Schneckenleithner, Christine', 'Simma, Olivia', 'Warsch, Wolfgang', 'Eckelhart, Eva', 'Hoelbl, Andrea', 'Bilban, Martin', 'Zochbauer-Muller, Sabine', 'Malumbres, Marcos', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Kollmann K', 'Heller G', 'Ott RG', 'Scheicher R', 'Zebedin-Brandl E', 'Schneckenleithner C', 'Simma O', 'Warsch W', 'Eckelhart E', 'Hoelbl A', 'Bilban M', 'Zochbauer-Muller S', 'Malumbres M', 'Sexl V']","['Institute of Pharmacology, Center of Biomolecular Medicine and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/physiology"", 'Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', '*Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Liver/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45276-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-07-299644 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 14;117(15):4065-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-07-299644.

Nuclear factor-kappaB signals were important for Tax-mediated transcriptional regulation of Fascin in T cells. This suggests that Fascin up-regulation by Tax contributes to the development of HTLV-1-associated pathogenesis.","['Kress, Andrea K', 'Kalmer, Martina', 'Rowan, Aileen G', 'Grassmann, Ralph', 'Fleckenstein, Bernhard']","['Kress AK', 'Kalmer M', 'Rowan AG', 'Grassmann R', 'Fleckenstein B']","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, Erlangen, Germany. andrea.kress@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Microfilament Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/06/03 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49399-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-09-305805 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Mar 31;117(13):3609-12. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-09-305805.

This study describes the spectrum of plasma cytokine abnormalities in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and examines their phenotypic correlates and prognostic significance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients included in this study were required to have archived plasma, bone marrow biopsy, and cytogenetic information available at the time of first referral to the Mayo Clinic. Multiplex biometric sandwich immunoassay was used to measure plasma levels of 30 cytokines. RESULTS: In total, 127 PMF patients were studied; comparison with normal controls (n = 35) revealed significantly increased interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-1RA, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon alfa (IFN-alpha), macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monokine induced by IFN-gamma (MIG), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and decreased IFN-gamma levels. In treatment-naive patients (n = 90), increased levels of IL-8 (P < .001), IL-2R (P < .001), IL-12 (P < .001), IL-15 (P = .001), and IP-10 (P = .003) were independently predictive of inferior survival. A similar multivariable analysis that included all 127 study patients confirmed the prognostic value of these five cytokines, and IL-8, IL-2R, IL-12, and IL-15 remained significant when risk stratification, according to the recently revised Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS plus), was added to the multivariable model. Leukemia-free survival was predicted by IL-8, which was also the only cytokine associated with >/= 1% circulating blasts. Other cytokine-phenotype associations included increased IL-8 and constitutional symptoms; IL-2R, IL-12, and transfusion need; IL-2R, IL-8, and leukocytosis; IP-10 and thrombocytopenia; HGF, MIG, IL-1RA, and marked splenomegaly; and IL-1RA, IL-2R, IP-10, MIP-1beta, and JAK2V617F. A two-cytokine (IL-8/IL-2R) -based risk categorization delineated prognostically different groups within specific DIPSS plus risk categories. CONCLUSION: This study signifies the presence of specific cytokine-phenotype associations in PMF and a prognostically relevant plasma cytokine signature that might prove useful as a laboratory tool for predicting and monitoring treatment response.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Vaidya, Rakhee', 'Caramazza, Domenica', 'Finke, Christy', 'Lasho, Terra', 'Pardanani, Animesh']","['Tefferi A', 'Vaidya R', 'Caramazza D', 'Finke C', 'Lasho T', 'Pardanani A']","['Mayo Clinic, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/*blood', 'Interleukin-15/*blood', 'Interleukin-8/*blood', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Protein Array Analysis/methods', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*blood', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/05/28 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.32.9490 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.32.9490 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Apr 1;29(10):1356-63. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.9490.

The quality of life (QoL) substudy tested whether capecitabine treatment would be associated with a better QoL than standard chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: QoL was assessed in 350 patients randomly assigned to either standard chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil [CMF] or doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [AC]; n = 182) or capecitabine (n = 168). Patients were interviewed by telephone before treatment (baseline), midtreatment, within 1 month post-treatment, and at 12, 18, and 24 months postbaseline by using questionnaires from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), a breast systemic adverse effects scale (EORTC BR23), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: Compared with patients who were treated with standard chemotherapy, patients who were treated with capecitabine had significantly better QoL, role function, and social function, fewer systemic adverse effects, less psychological distress, and less fatigue during and at the completion of treatment (P </= .005). Capecitabine treatment was associated with less nausea, vomiting, and constipation and with better appetite than standard treatment (P </= .004), but worse hand-foot syndrome and diarrhea (P < .005). These differences all resolved by 12 months. CONCLUSION: Standard chemotherapy was superior to capecitabine in improving relapse-free and overall survival for older women with early-stage breast cancer. Although capecitabine was associated with better QoL during treatment, QoL was similar for both groups at 1 year. The brief period of poorer QoL with standard treatment is a modest price to pay for a chance at improved survival.","['Kornblith, Alice B', 'Lan, Lan', 'Archer, Laura', 'Partridge, Ann', 'Kimmick, Gretchen', 'Hudis, Clifford', 'Winer, Eric', 'Casey, Rebecca', 'Bennett, Samantha', 'Cohen, Harvey Jay', 'Muss, Hyman B']","['Kornblith AB', 'Lan L', 'Archer L', 'Partridge A', 'Kimmick G', 'Hudis C', 'Winer E', 'Casey R', 'Bennett S', 'Cohen HJ', 'Muss HB']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA. akornblith@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/psychology/surgery', 'Capecitabine', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Quality of Life', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/05/10 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.29.9859 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.29.9859 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Mar 10;29(8):1022-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.29.9859.

In melanoma, breast, and lung cancer patients, this anti-idiotypic Ab was able to induce a specific Ab response against N-glycosylated gangliosides, attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy as these glycolipids are not naturally expressed in humans. A clinical study with nonsmall cell lung cancer patients showed encouraging clinical benefits. Immunological studies performed in 20 of these patients suggested a correlation between the induction of Abs against NeuGcGM3 and longer survival times. The induced anti-NeuGcGM3 Abs recognized and directly killed tumor cells expressing the Ag, by a mechanism independent of complement activation. In the present work, we show that this cytotoxicity differs from apoptosis because it is temperature independent, no chromatin condensation or caspase 3 induction are detected, and the DNA fragmentation induced has a different pattern than the one characteristic for apoptosis. It is a very quick process and involves cytosqeleton reorganization. The Abs induce cellular swelling and the formation of big membrane lesions that allow the leakage of cytoplasm and the loss of the cell membrane integrity. All of these characteristics resemble a process of oncotic necrosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the active induction in cancer patients of NeuGcGM3-specific Abs able to induce complement independent oncotic necrosis to tumor cells. These results contribute to reinforcing the therapeutic potential of anti-idiotypic vaccines and the importance of NeuGcGM3 ganglioside as antitumor target.","['Hernandez, Ana Maria', 'Rodriguez, Nely', 'Gonzalez, Jorge E', 'Reyes, Emma', 'Rondon, Teresa', 'Grinan, Tania', 'Macias, Amparo', 'Alfonso, Sailyn', 'Vazquez, Ana Maria', 'Perez, Rolando']","['Hernandez AM', 'Rodriguez N', 'Gonzalez JE', 'Reyes E', 'Rondon T', 'Grinan T', 'Macias A', 'Alfonso S', 'Vazquez AM', 'Perez R']","['Department of Antibody Engineering, Center of Molecular Immunology, Havana 11600, Cuba. anita@cim.sld.cu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/immunology/therapy/ultrastructure', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/immunology/*therapy/ultrastructure', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dogs', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/*analogs & derivatives/*immunology', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/administration & dosage/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology/pathology/therapy']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1000609 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1000609 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Mar 15;186(6):3735-44. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1000609.

The aim of this study was to explore the new strategy to early diagnose the MDR by electrochemical sensor based on carbon nanotubes-drug supramolecular interaction. The carbon nanotubes modified glassy carbon electrodes (CNTs/GCE) were directly immersed into the cells suspension of the sensitive leukemia cells K562 and/or its MDR cells K562/A02 to detect the response of the electrochemical probe of daunorubicin (DNR) residues after incubated with cells for 1h. The fresh evidence from the electrochemical studies based on CNTs/GCE demonstrated that the homogeneous, label-free strategy could directly measure the function of cell membrane transporters in MDR cancer cells, identify the cell phenotype (sensitive or MDR). When the different ratios of the sensitive leukemia cells K562 and its MDR ones K562/A02 were applied as a model of MDR levels to simulate the MDR occurrence in cancer, the cathodic peak current showed good linear response to the fraction of MDR with a correlation coefficient of 0.995. Therefore, the MDR fraction can be easily predicted based on the calibration curve of the cathodic peak current versus the fraction of MDR. These results indicated that the sensing strategy could provide a powerful tool for assessment of MDR in cancer. The new electrochemical sensor based on carbon nanotubes-drug supramolecular nanocomposites could represent promising approach in the rapid diagnosis of MDR in cancer.","['Zhang, Haijun', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Sun, Feifei', 'Wang, Huangping', 'Zhao, Juan', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Wang, Xuemei']","['Zhang H', 'Jiang H', 'Sun F', 'Wang H', 'Zhao J', 'Chen B', 'Wang X']","['Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biosens Bioelectron,Biosensors & bioelectronics,9001289,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrochemical Techniques/*methods', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Nanocomposites/chemistry', 'Nanotubes, Carbon/*chemistry']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2010/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0956-5663(11)00044-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bios.2011.01.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosens Bioelectron. 2011 Mar 15;26(7):3361-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bios.2011.01.020.

RESULT(S): Qualitative analysis revealed that histologic characteristics of spermatogonia and Sertoli cells were preserved, as were cell-cell cohesion and cell adhesion to the basement membrane, in vitrified tissue as well as in frozen and fresh control samples. Survival of spermatogonia and their ability to proliferate as evidenced by IHC was also confirmed in cultured fresh, slow-frozen, and vitrified tissue. CONCLUSION(S): Vitrification, having the advantage of being a faster and more convenient method, shows promise as an alternative strategy to slow-freezing in the emerging field of immature testicular tissue cryopreservation.","['Curaba, Mara', 'Poels, Jonathan', 'van Langendonckt, Anne', 'Donnez, Jacques', 'Wyns, Christine']","['Curaba M', 'Poels J', 'van Langendonckt A', 'Donnez J', 'Wyns C']","['Department of Gynecology, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Cryopreservation/*methods', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Puberty/physiology', 'Semen Analysis', '*Testis', '*Vitrification']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/06/22 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2010/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/24 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0015-0282(11)00024-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.01.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2011 May;95(6):2123.e9-12. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.01.014.

This study elucidated the mechanism of oxidative stress and DNA damage mediated by AAI in human cells. Treatment of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) and human renal proximal tubular cells (HK-2) with AAI led to a dose-dependent increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). AAI also elevated the levels of DNA strand breaks and 8-hydroxy guanosine in HL-60 and HK-2 cells. Antioxidants, including Tiron, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH), effectively suppressed the AAI-induced ROS and AAI-elicited genotoxicity, indicating that AAI induced the DNA damage through oxidative stress. GSH depletion was also found in AAI-treated cultures and proceeded prior to ROS formation. Exposure of HL-60 cells with AAI activated both ERK1/2 and p38 kinase phosphorylation, while only MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, significantly decreased AAI-mediated ROS. Preincubation of cells with thiol-containing compounds (NAC and GSH) inhibited the caspase 3 activity triggered by AAI, but non-thiol Tiron did not show a similar effect. This study demonstrated that AAI treatment results in oxidative stress-related DNA damage through GSH depletion and ERK1/2 activation; AAI-induced apoptosis is associated with GSH loss, but is independent of ROS generation.","['Yu, Feng-Yih', 'Wu, Ting-Shuan', 'Chen, Ting-Wei', 'Liu, Biing-Hui']","['Yu FY', 'Wu TS', 'Chen TW', 'Liu BH']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aristolochic Acids/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal/cytology/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(11)00029-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2011.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2011 Jun;25(4):810-6. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2011.01.016.

The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has fundamentally changed the treatment of CML. However, TKI are not equally effective for treating ALL. Furthermore, de novo or secondary TKI-resistance is a significant problem in CML. We screened a panel of BCR-ABL1 positive ALL and CML cell lines to find models for imatinib-resistance. RESULTS: Five of 19 BCR-ABL1 positive cell lines were resistant to imatinib-induced apoptosis (KCL-22, MHH-TALL1, NALM-1, SD-1, SUP-B15). None of the resistant cell lines carried mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 and all showed resistance to second generation TKI, nilotinib or dasatinib. STAT5, ERK1/2 and the ribosomal S6 protein (RPS6) are BCR-ABL1 downstream effectors, and all three proteins are dephosphorylated by imatinib in sensitive cell lines. TKI-resistant phosphorylation of RPS6, but responsiveness as regards JAK/STAT5 and ERK1/2 signalling were characteristic for resistant cell lines. PI3K pathway inhibitors effected dephosphorylation of RPS6 in imatinib-resistant cell lines suggesting that an oncogene other than BCR-ABL1 might be responsible for activation of the PI3K/AKT1/mTOR pathway, which would explain the TKI resistance of these cells. We show that the TKI-resistant cell line KCL-22 carries a PI3Kalpha E545G mutation, a site critical for the constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT1 pathway. Apoptosis in TKI-resistant cells could be induced by inhibition of AKT1, but not of mTOR. CONCLUSION: We introduce five Philadelphia-chromosome positive cell lines as TKI-resistance models. None of these cell lines carries mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 or other molecular aberrations previously indicted in the context of imatinib-resistance. These cell lines are unique as they dephosphorylate ERK1/2 and STAT5 after treatment with imatinib, while PI3K/AKT1/mTOR activity remains unaffected. Inhibition of AKT1 leads to apoptosis in the imatinib-resistant cell lines. In conclusion, Ph+ cell lines show a form of imatinib-resistance attributable to constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT1 pathway. Mutations in PIK3CA, as observed in cell line KCL-22, or PI3K activating oncogenes may undelie TKI-resistance in these cell lines.","['Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Eberth, Sonja', 'Romani, Julia', 'Zaborski, Margarete', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Eberth S', 'Romani J', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG']","['Leibniz-Institute DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. hqu@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2010/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-4-6 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-4-6 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2011 Feb 7;4:6. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-4-6.,20110207,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC3041785,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with myelodysplasia between 1 January 2002 and 1 September 2007 were identified. Their bone marrow biopsy, clinical record, cytogenetic analysis and transfusion record were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventy myelodysplastic patients were identified yielding an incidence of 2.75 per 100,000 per year. Median survival was 23 months, and transformation to acute leukaemia occurred in five patients (7.1%). Three patients (4.3%) received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and five patients (7.1%) received disease modifying treatment. Fifty-six of 70 patients (80%) received a blood transfusion, a mean of 32.9 red blood cell (RBC) units were transfused to each transfusion recipient during the study period of 68 months. One of 70 patients developed a clinical syndrome of iron overload. CONCLUSION: The incidence of myelodysplasia in Wellington, NZ is similar to incidence figures from previously published studies. The treatment these patients received was predominantly supportive through RBC transfusion. Effective iron chelation therapy measures were not used although there appeared to be a low incidence of clinical iron overload in the study population. The data in this study will be available for comparison with future studies to assess trends in incidence, treatment and outcome in myelodysplastic patients in NZ.","['Irwin, J', ""D'Souza, A"", 'Johnson, L', 'Carter, J']","['Irwin J', ""D'Souza A"", 'Johnson L', 'Carter J']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Middlemore Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand. jazirwin@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Ethnicity/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Ferritins/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology/ethnology/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Pyridoxine/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02443.x [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2011 May;41(5):399-407. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02443.x.,,"['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'KV2JZ1BI6Z (Pyridoxine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Effective control of disease may also set the stage for eventual 'cure' of this leukemia. However, the existence of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemic cells that are unaffected by BCR-ABL inhibition represents a major barrier that may delay or prevent curative therapy with the current approaches. The most commonly reported mechanism of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based therapies involves BCR-ABL gene mutations and amplification, but these changes may not be solely responsible for disease relapse when inhibitor-based therapies are curtailed. Therefore new targets may need to be defined before significant advancement in curative therapies is possible. Emerging evidence suggests that persistence of chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells or acquisition of stem cell-like characteristics prevents complete elimination of chronic myeloid leukemia by tyrosine kinase inhibition alone. This review focuses on several recently emerging concepts regarding the existence and characteristics of chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells. Definitions based on human primary cells and animal model studies are highlighted as are the potential signaling pathways associated with disease repopulating cells. Finally, several recently defined therapeutic targets and active compounds that have emerged from stem cell studies are described.

However, the so-called 'tinib' TKIs (e.g. imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib) are both ineffective in patients who undergo blastic transformation and unable to eradicate CML at the stem cell level. This raises a few important questions. Is BCR-ABL1 expression and/or activity essential for blastic transformation? Is blastic transformation the result of genetic or epigenetic events that occur at the stem cell level which only become apparent in the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) cell pool, or does it arise directly at the GMP level? As altered mRNA metabolism contributes to the phenotype of blast crisis CML progenitors (decreased translation of tumor suppressor genes and transcription factors essential for terminal differentiation and increased translation of anti-apoptotic genes), one attractive concept is to restore levels of these essential molecules to their normal levels. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which mRNA processing, translation, and degradation are deregulated in BCR-ABL1 myeloid blast crisis CML progenitors, and present encouraging results from studies with pharmacologic inhibitors which support their inclusion in the clinic.","['Perrotti, Danilo', 'Harb, Jason G']","['Perrotti D', 'Harb JG']","['Human Cancer Genetics Program, Depatment of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center and Center for RNA Biology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210-2207, USA. danilo.perrotti@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/04/27 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.546914 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Feb;52 Suppl 1:30-44. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.546914.

In most patients TKIs reduce the leukemia cell load substantially, but some leukemia cells, for example leukemia stem cells (LSCs), are intrinsically refractory to TKIs. In addition, some patients who respond initially may later become resistant to TKIs due to accumulation of point mutations in BCR-ABL1 kinase. LSCs or their progeny, leukemia progenitor cells (LPCs), at some stage may acquire additional genetic changes that cause the leukemia to transform further to a more advanced blast phase (CML-BP), which responds poorly to treatment and is usually fatal. We postulate that LSCs and/or LPCs refractory or resistant to TKIs may be 'ticking time-bombs' accumulating additional genetic aberrations and eventually 'exploding' to generate additional TKI-resistant clones and CML-BP clones with complex karyotypes.","['Skorski, Tomasz']",['Skorski T'],"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA. tskorski@temple.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['DNA Repair', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Recurrence']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/04/27 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.546912 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Feb;52 Suppl 1:23-9. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.546912.,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC4684553,,,"['R01 CA123014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA133646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA123014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA133646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS737406'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 77 patients treated with intensive chemotherapy for haematological malignancy at Kuopio University Hospital were candidates for study entry. Eleven of these patients did not fulfil the criteria for neutropenic fever, and 66 patients were finally included. Nineteen patients had acute myeloid leukaemia and 47 had received high-dose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cell transplant. Ninety neutropenic fever episodes in these 66 patients fulfilled the study entry criteria, with microbiological cultures, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein measurements available. Serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein were analyzed at the onset of each neutropenic fever episode on day 0, and then daily from days 1 to 4. RESULTS: Bacteraemia was observed in 21 episodes (23%) and the criteria for severe sepsis were fulfilled in 13 episodes (14%). Half of the bacteraemic episodes were caused by Gram-negative bacteria. The kinetics of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein were similar, with increasing levels for 2 to 4 days after the onset of fever. The procalcitonin level on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 was associated with bacteraemia and Gram-negative bacteraemia, but not with the development of severe sepsis. On day 1, a procalcitonin level above 0.5 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 57% and 70% and specificity of 81% and 77% to predict bacteraemia and Gram-negative bacteraemia, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated level of procalcitonin within 24 h after the onset of neutropenic fever predicts bacteraemia and Gram-negative bacteraemia in haematological patients.","['Koivula, Irma', 'Hamalainen, Sari', 'Jantunen, Esa', 'Pulkki, Kari', 'Kuittinen, Taru', 'Nousiainen, Tapio', 'Juutilainen, Auni']","['Koivula I', 'Hamalainen S', 'Jantunen E', 'Pulkki K', 'Kuittinen T', 'Nousiainen T', 'Juutilainen A']","['Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. irma.koivula@kuh.fi']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Infect Dis,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,0215333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Calcitonin/*blood', 'Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/complications/*diagnosis', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/complications/*diagnosis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications/*diagnosis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Protein Precursors/*blood', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/00365548.2011.554855 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Infect Dis. 2011 Jul;43(6-7):471-8. doi: 10.3109/00365548.2011.554855.

However, only cotylenin A induces the differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells. Since the cotylenin A producer lost its ability to proliferate during preservation, a study on the relationship between structure and activity was carried out and a modified fusicoccin A with hydroxyl group at the 3-position showed a similar biological activity with that of cotylenin A. We then searched for an enzyme source that catalyzes the introduction of a hydroxyl group into the 3-position and found that brassicicene C, which is structurally related to fusicoccin A with hydroxyl group at the 3-position, was produced by Alternaria brassicicola ATCC96836. We recently cloned a brassicicene C biosynthetic gene cluster including the genes encoding fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene synthase and two cytochrome P450s, which were responsible for the formation of fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene-8beta,16-diol. In this study, we report that a alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, the gene coding for which was located in the cluster, catalyzed a hydroxylation at the 3-position of fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene-8beta,16-diol. On the other hand, a alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, which had been identified in a fusicoccin A biosynthetic gene cluster, catalyzed the 16-oxidation of fusicocca-2,10(14)-diene-8beta,16-diol to yield an aldehyde (8beta-hydroxyfusicocca-1,10(14)-dien-16-al), although both dioxygenases had 51% amino acid sequence identity. These findings suggested that the dioxygenases played critical roles for the formation of the fusicoccin A-type and cotylenin A-/brassicicene C-type aglycons. Moreover, we showed that short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase located in the fusicoccin A biosynthetic gene cluster catalyzed the reduction of the aldehyde to yield fusicocca-1,10(14)-diene-8beta,16-diol.","['Ono, Yusuke', 'Minami, Atsushi', 'Noike, Motoyoshi', 'Higuchi, Yusuke', 'Toyomasu, Tomonobu', 'Sassa, Takeshi', 'Kato, Nobuo', 'Dairi, Tohru']","['Ono Y', 'Minami A', 'Noike M', 'Higuchi Y', 'Toyomasu T', 'Sassa T', 'Kato N', 'Dairi T']","['Graduate School of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,IM,"['Alternaria/enzymology/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ascomycota/enzymology/metabolism', 'Biocatalysis', 'Dioxygenases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Diterpenes/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Glycosides/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Alignment']",2011/02/09 06:00,2011/06/11 06:00,['2011/02/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja107785u [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2011 Mar 2;133(8):2548-55. doi: 10.1021/ja107785u.

Antibodies used in flow cytometry are costly, and the expenses are not always reimbursed. Having observed that AML and ALL have distinct patterns in the CD45/SSC panel, we set to analyze more leukemia cases and establish an algorithm for the efficient diagnosis of acute leukemia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 127 consecutive cases of acute leukemia within the last 2 years and correlated the blast distribution patterns in the CD45/SSC panel, with the morphology and the detailed immunophenotype. RESULTS: Our results show that all the acute leukemias can be initially triaged into AML, ALL, and Indeterminate provisional groups based on the blast distribution patterns in the CD45/SSC panel and morphology. Each group was then further analyzed with tailored AML, ALL, and Indeterminate flow panels. Using this approach, we have efficiently and correctly diagnosed almost all the acute leukemias. Our analysis also determined the minimal numbers of immunological markers needed for the lineage assignment of acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: The algorithmic approach with tailored subsequent antibody selection could maintain diagnostic accuracy while significantly reducing reagent use, labor, and time. With a shrinking reimbursement for flow cytometric studies, an increase in laboratory efficiency without compromising diagnostic accuracy or turnaround time will contribute to preserving revenue and optimizing clinical service.","['Haycocks, Neil G', 'Lawrence, Lenore', 'Cain, Joseph W', 'Zhao, X Frank']","['Haycocks NG', 'Lawrence L', 'Cain JW', 'Zhao XF']","['Department of Pathology, University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

However no studies of cardiotoxicity in children treated with THP have been reported. This study was performed to assess the THP-induced cardiotoxicity for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study comprised 61 asymptomatic patients aged from 7.6 to 25.7 years old. Median follow-up time after completion of anthracycline treatment was 8.1 years (range: 1.7-12.5). The cumulative dose of THP ranged from 120 to 740 mg/m(2) with a median of 180 mg/m(2) . Patients underwent electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, the 6-min walk test (6MWT), and measurements of serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) before and after exercise. RESULTS: All subjects showed normal left ventricular function assessed by echocardiography. Ventricular premature contraction in Holter ECG and reduced exercise tolerance in the 6MWT were detected in 2/46 (3.3%) and 5/41(12.2%), respectively. Abnormal BNP levels were detected in 6/60 (10%) both before and after exercise. The cumulative dose of THP was significantly correlated with BNP levels after exercise (r = 0.27, P = 0.03), but not with any other cardiac measurements. Further analysis revealed that subjects with a high cumulative dose >==300 mg/m(2) had significantly higher BNP levels after exercise compared with subjects with a low cumulative dose <300 mg/m(2) (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: No significant cardiac dysfunction was detected in long-term survivors who received THP treatment. The use of post-exercise BNP level to indicate high cardiotoxicity risk should be verified by further study.","['Shimomura, Yasuto', 'Baba, Reizo', 'Watanabe, Arata', 'Horikoshi, Yasuo', 'Asami, Keiko', 'Hyakuna, Nobuyuki', 'Iwai, Asayuki', 'Matsushita, Takeshi', 'Yamaji, Kazutaka', 'Hori, Toshinori', 'Tsurusawa, Masahito']","['Shimomura Y', 'Baba R', 'Watanabe A', 'Horikoshi Y', 'Asami K', 'Hyakuna N', 'Iwai A', 'Matsushita T', 'Yamaji K', 'Hori T', 'Tsurusawa M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Aichi-gun, Aichi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Child', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Electrocardiography', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Heart Function Tests', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2010/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23012 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Sep;57(3):461-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23012.

Several molecularly targeted therapies are under development for the treatment of brain tumors, and high-grade gliomas in adults are a particular area of study. PROCEDURE: To better understand if these new therapies can be used in pediatric populations, we examined the expression of the following seven marker genes involved in signaling pathways targeted by new therapies: beta-catenin, suppressor of fused (SUFU), erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ERBB) 2, platelet-derived growth factor receptoralpha (PDGFRalpha), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), secreted protein acid and rich in cysteine (SPARC), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR). Samples from 27 patients with the primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)/medulloblastomas (MBs) (n = 8), ependymomas (n = 5), or gliomas (n = 14) were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. [Correction made here after initial online publication]. We assigned an EXP score to compare across samples and determined the levels of gene expression among tumor cell types. RESULTS: Gene expression varied among the different tumors, but, within a tumor type, clear expression patterns were seen. The expression of SUFU, ERBB2, and PCNA in metastatic MBs were greater than that seen in non-metastatic MBs. Most glioma cases highly expressed PDGFRalpha and G-CSFR. Additionally, the expression patterns of gliomas and ependymomas were similar (r = 0.77, P = 0.04), but PNET/MBs substantially differed from gliomas (r = -0.37, P = 0.41) or ependymomas (r = 0.23, P = 0.62). CONCLUSIONS: The development of new drugs targeting up-regulated pathways may be useful for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors. As new drugs are developed, gliomas and ependymomas may be treated with similar compounds.","['Tsuruta, Toshihisa', 'Aihara, Yasuo', 'Kanno, Hitoshi', 'Funase, Masakazu', 'Murayama, Toshihiko', 'Osawa, Makiko', 'Fujii, Hisaichi', 'Kubo, Osami', 'Okada, Yoshikazu']","['Tsuruta T', 'Aihara Y', 'Kanno H', 'Funase M', 'Murayama T', 'Osawa M', 'Fujii H', 'Kubo O', 'Okada Y']","['Department of Clinical Examination, National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan. ttsuruta@kumamoto2.hosp.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Ependymoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glioma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2011/02/08 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2010/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23009 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Dec 15;57(7):1117-23. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23009.

Children with malignancy may be at higher risk of H1N1-associated ARF because of underlying primary disease or immunosuppression associated with chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: We describe the clinical course and outcome of critically ill pediatric oncology/hematology patients with H1N1-associated ARF. RESULTS: Five patients were admitted to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) ICU with H1N1 infection during the 2009-2010 influenza season. Underlying diagnoses included 2 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one each with neuroblastoma, brainstem glioma, and hemolytic anemia secondary to pyruvate kinase deficiency. All patients were mechanically ventilated secondary to ARF following unsuccessful trials of non-invasive ventilatory support. The majority of patients (4/5) required inotropic support, and none required dialysis. Further measures to support their ARF included high frequency oscillatory ventilation in 2 patients, nitric oxide in 3 patients, and surfactant in 1 patient. Three patients had bronchopleural air leak. All patients received oseltamivir; however, 2 were switched to intravenous zanamivir once resistance to oseltamivir was documented. Mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 24 +/- 6.8 days and mean duration of ICU admission was 37 +/- 12 days. All patients survived to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: Our series suggests an overall favorable outcome in immunocompromised children with H1N1-related ARF. Our experience underscores the value of aggressive support during H1N1-related ARF, and early detection and management of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 infection in this high-risk population.","['Elbahlawan, Lama', 'Gaur, Aditya H', 'Furman, Wayne', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Woods, Tina', 'Norris, Angela', 'Morrison, R Ray']","['Elbahlawan L', 'Gaur AH', 'Furman W', 'Jeha S', 'Woods T', 'Norris A', 'Morrison RR']","[""Division of Critical Care Medicine, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Tennessee 38105-3678, USA. lama.elbahlawan@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic/complications', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', '*Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza, Human/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Pulmonary Surfactants/therapeutic use', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/immunology/*therapy/*virology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2010/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22973 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Oct;57(4):625-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22973.

PROCEDURE: Prevalence and predictors of cardiotoxicity were retrospectively reviewed in 124 children treated on the MRC AML 10 and AML 12 trials in a single, large centre from November 1987 to September 2004. Subclinical cardiotoxicity was defined as a shortening fraction of less than 28% and clinical cardiomyopathy as evidence of heart failure, and both were classified as late cardiotoxicity 1 year after completing first line therapy. RESULTS: Cumulative survival was 61% at 10 years. The prevalence of early and late cardiotoxicity was 13.7% (95%-CI: 8.2-22.0%) and 17.4% (95%-CI: 10.9-26.8%), respectively. Early cardiotoxicity was a strong predictor (OR = 9.18; 95%-CI: 2.10-40.11; P < 0.005) and children who received salvage therapy following relapse showed a trend towards increased late cardiotoxicity (OR = 3.53; 95%-CI: 0.86-14.48; P < 0.08). Subclinical cardiotoxicity resolved spontaneously in all but one case, but clinical cardiomyopathy always required continuing therapy. Two children died of cardiomyopathy and six remained on medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Anthracycline cardiotoxicity remains a major concern for survivors of childhood AML and correlates with early cardiotoxicity and treatment intensity. Long-term follow-up is required to fully determine the outcome for children with subclinical cardiotoxicity.","['Temming, Petra', 'Qureshi, Amrana', 'Hardt, Juliane', 'Leiper, Alison D', 'Levitt, Gillian', 'Ancliff, Phillip J', 'Webb, David K H']","['Temming P', 'Qureshi A', 'Hardt J', 'Leiper AD', 'Levitt G', 'Ancliff PJ', 'Webb DK']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK. temmingp@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cardiomyopathies/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Survival Rate']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/03/25 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22908 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Apr;56(4):625-30. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22908.,,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Apr;56(4):513-4.

In the present study, we proposed to identify and investigate the role of molecules critically involved in leukemia--microenvironment crosstalk. PROCEDURE: Gene expression profiling analyses of BM mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSC) were performed following stimulation by ALL cells. CCL2 and IL-8 plasma levels were evaluated from ALL patients and controls. Expression of the CCL2 and IL-8 receptors in ALL was determined by RT-PCR. The biological effects of CCL2, IL-8 or its neutralizing antibodies in primary precursor-B ALL and BMMSC cells were evaluated using in vitro assays. RESULTS: Leukemia stimulation of BMMSC upregulated the expression of several inflammatory chemokines, including CCL2 and IL-8. The BM plasma levels of CCL2 and IL-8 in children at diagnosis were significantly higher than in healthy controls (P < 0.001). Functional studies revealed that CCL2 and IL-8 enhanced the capacity of BMMSC to support adhesion of ALL cells. CCL2 and IL-8 were also found to enhance BMMSC survival and to increase their proliferation. ALL cells were not directly affected by CCL2 or IL-8. CONCLUSIONS: The leukemic BM microenvironment had increased levels of CCL2 and IL-8. These chemokines are known to have suppressive effects in normal hematopoiesis. Our data indicate that CCL2 and IL-8 have a positive impact on BMMSC survival, proliferation, and adhesiveness to ALL cells. Leukemia-associated CCL2 and IL-8 upregulation may represent one possible mechanism of microenvironment perversion in favor of ALL cells.","['de Vasconcellos, Jaira Ferreira', 'Laranjeira, Angelo Brunelli Albertoni', 'Zanchin, Nilson Ivo Tonin', 'Otubo, Rosemary', 'Vaz, Thais Haline', 'Cardoso, Angelo Almeida', 'Brandalise, Silvia Regina', 'Yunes, Jose Andres']","['de Vasconcellos JF', 'Laranjeira AB', 'Zanchin NI', 'Otubo R', 'Vaz TH', 'Cardoso AA', 'Brandalise SR', 'Yunes JA']","['Molecular Biology Laboratory, Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/03/25 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2010/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22941 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Apr;56(4):568-77. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22941.

PROCEDURE: We investigated the pattern of treatment related deaths (TRDs) and possible risk factors in the NOPHO ALL-92 and ALL-2000 protocols. Fifty-five TRDs were identified among the 1,645 ALL-92 patients and 33 among the 1,090 ALL-2000 patients. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the incidence of TRDs between the two protocols (3.4% vs. 3.2%). Five patients died before initiation of therapy (0.2%), and the overall subsequent risk of induction death and death in first complete remission (CR1) was 1.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Infections were the major cause of death comprising 72% of all cases including 9 deaths from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 11 deaths from fungal infections. Other causes of death included bleeding or thrombosis (eight patients), tumour burden related toxicities (seven patients) and organ toxicity (seven patients). Female gender (hazard ratio (HR): 2.2, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.4-3.4), high white blood cell count (>/= 200 x 10(9) /L) at diagnosis (HR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.7-7.1), T-cell disease (HR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.01-3.7), Down syndrome (HR: 7.3, 95% CI: 3.6-14.9) and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in CR1 (HR: 8.0, 95% CI: 3.3-19.5) were identified as independent risk factors for TRD.

Commonly, it is treated in the clinical trials for Burkitt lymphoma, of which it represents the leukemic counterpart. PROCEDURE: Children with B-ALL diagnosed between 1988 and 1999 were enrolled in the AIEOP-8805 protocol. Treatment included six high-dose chemotherapy courses. No prophylactic CNS irradiation was administered. RESULTS: Sixty-five consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. L3 morphology was observed in 57 of 65 patients (88%). Twenty-five children (38%) had tumor mass in addition to massive bone marrow infiltration; 11 children (17%) had CNS disease at diagnosis. Sixty-two patients obtained complete morphological remission of which 13 suffered a relapse, including 3 with initial CNS involvement. Ten-year overall survival and event-free survival were 77% and 75%, respectively. Neither relevant long-term toxicity nor second malignancies were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The AIEOP-8805 confirmed that short high-dose chemotherapy is highly effective for the treatment of B-ALL without significant long-term adverse sequelae. Therapy modifications to reduce relapse rate, such as the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and more effective CNS treatment, are being tested.","['Pillon, Marta', 'Arico, Maurizio', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Citterio, Marco', 'Micalizzi, Concetta', 'Testi, Anna Maria', 'Barisone, Elena', 'Nardi, Margherita', 'Lombardi, Alessandra', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Rosolen, Angelo']","['Pillon M', 'Arico M', 'Basso G', 'Locatelli F', 'Citterio M', 'Micalizzi C', 'Testi AM', 'Barisone E', 'Nardi M', 'Lombardi A', 'Rondelli R', 'Rosolen A']","['Pediatric Onco-Hematology Unit, University Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/03/25 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2010/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22787 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Apr;56(4):544-50. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22787.

Given their widespread distribution in aquatic systems and their ability to undergo chemical transformation, their environmental impacts at sublethal concentrations in nontarget organisms have become an important question. We conducted a number of mammalian-cell genotoxic and gene expression assays and examined cellular biochemical changes that followed low-dose exposure of MCF-7 cells to fenitrothion, diazinon, and the aqueous degradate of diazinon, 2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol (IMP). After exposure to the OPPs at low concentrations (10(-12) M to 10(-8) M), greater than twofold elevations in micronucleus formation were noted in MCF-7 cell cultures that went on to exhibit greater than 75% clonogenic survival; these levels of chromosomal damage were comparable to those induced by 10(-6) M benzo[a]pyrene, a known genotoxic agent. At this low concentration range, a fenitrothion-induced twofold elevation in B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) and cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP1A1) gene expressions was observed. Principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) of derived infrared (IR) spectra of vehicle control (nonexposed) and OPP-exposed cells highlighted that both fenitrothion and diazinon induced marked biochemical alterations in the lipid, protein, and DNA/RNA absorbance regions. Our findings demonstrate that the two OPP parent chemicals and IMP degradate can mediate a number of toxic effects or cellular alterations at very low concentrations. These are independent of just selective inhibition of AChE, with potential consequences for nontarget organisms exposed at environmentally relevant concentrations. Further assays on relevant aquatic organism cell lines are now recommended to understand the mechanistic low-dose toxicity of these chemicals present in aquatic systems.","['Ukpebor, Justina', 'Llabjani, Valon', 'Martin, Francis L', 'Halsall, Crispin J']","['Ukpebor J', 'Llabjani V', 'Martin FL', 'Halsall CJ']","['Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Toxicol Chem,Environmental toxicology and chemistry,8308958,IM,"['Aquatic Organisms/drug effects', 'Benzo(a)pyrene/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors/chemistry/toxicity', 'Diazinon/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Fenitrothion/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Insecticides/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical/toxicity']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/04/16 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2010/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/etc.417 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Toxicol Chem. 2011 Mar;30(3):632-9. doi: 10.1002/etc.417.

As immunotherapeutic intervention is considered to be more effective before the cytomorphologic manifestation of relapse, post-transplant monitoring gains increasing attention in stem cell recipients with a previous diagnosis of AML. Different methods for detection of chimerism (e.g., microsatellite analysis or quantitative real-time PCR) are available to quantify the ratio of donor and recipient cells in the post-transplant period. Various studies demonstrated the potential use of mixed chimerism kinetics to predict relapse of the AML. CD34+-specific chimerism is associated with a higher specificity of chimerism analysis. Nevertheless, a decrease of donor cells can have other causes as well. Therefore, efforts continue to introduce minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring based on molecular mutations in the post-transplant period. The NPM1 (nucleophosmin) mutations can be monitored by sensitive quantitative real-time PCR in subsets of stem cell recipients with AML, but for approximately 20% of patients, suitable molecular mutations for post-transplant MRD monitoring are not available so far. This emphasizes the need for an expansion of the panel of MRD markers in the transplant setting.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Fehse, Boris', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Bacher U', 'Haferlach T', 'Fehse B', 'Schnittger S', 'Kroger N']","['Department for Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. u.bacher@uke.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,IM,"['Chimerism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/04/20 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1100/tsw.2011.16 [doi]'],epublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2011 Feb 3;11:310-9. doi: 10.1100/tsw.2011.16.,20110203,,PMC5595266,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms underlying large-scale transcriptional reprogramming remain largely unknown. Here we investigated transcriptional reprogramming at genome-scale in mouse retroviral transplant models of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) using both gene-expression profiling and ChIP-sequencing. We identified several thousand candidate regulatory regions with altered levels of histone acetylation that were characterised by differential distribution of consensus motifs for key haematopoietic transcription factors including Gata2, Gfi1 and Sfpi1/Pu.1. In particular, downregulation of Gata2 expression was mirrored by abundant GATA motifs in regions of reduced histone acetylation suggesting an important role in leukaemogenic transcriptional reprogramming. Forced re-expression of Gata2 was not compatible with sustained growth of leukaemic cells thus suggesting a previously unrecognised role for Gata2 in downregulation during the development of AML. Additionally, large scale human AML datasets revealed significantly higher expression of GATA2 in CD34+ cells from healthy controls compared with AML blast cells. The integrated genome-scale analysis applied in this study represents a valuable and widely applicable approach to study the transcriptional control of both normal and aberrant haematopoiesis and to identify critical factors responsible for transcriptional reprogramming in human cancer.","['Bonadies, Nicolas', 'Foster, Samuel D', 'Chan, Wai-In', 'Kvinlaug, Brynn T', 'Spensberger, Dominik', 'Dawson, Mark A', 'Spooncer, Elaine', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Bannister, Andrew J', 'Huntly, Brian J', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Bonadies N', 'Foster SD', 'Chan WI', 'Kvinlaug BT', 'Spensberger D', 'Dawson MA', 'Spooncer E', 'Whetton AD', 'Bannister AJ', 'Huntly BJ', 'Gottgens B']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2010/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0016330 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Jan 28;6(1):e16330. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0016330.,20110128,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",PMC3030562,,,"['G0800784/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900729/1/NC3RS_/National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction', 'of Animals in Research/United Kingdom', 'G116/187/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on our previous results in vivo suggesting carbon monoxide serves as an inhibitor of cystathionine beta-synthase that rate-limits transsulfuration pathway for generation of hydrogen sulfide, we have herein hypothesized that the gas might serve as a regulator of protein methylation through accelerating turnover of remethylation cycle residing at the upstream of the enzyme. Metabolomic analysis in human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells in culture revealed that application of carbon monoxide-releasing molecules caused increases in methionine and S-adenosylmethionine and a decrease in cystathionine in the cells, suggesting the cystathionine beta-synthase inhibition by carbon monoxide. Under these circumstances, the cells exhibited global protein arginine methylation: this event was also reproduced by the cell treatment with hemin, a heme oxygenase-1 inducer. The protein arginine methylation elicited by carbon monoxide was attenuated by knocking down cystathionine beta-synthase with its small interfering RNA or by blocking S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase with adenosine dialdehyde, suggesting remethylation cycling is necessary to trigger the methylation processing. Furthermore, proteins undergoing the carbon monoxide-induced arginine methylation involved histone H3 proteins, suggesting chromatin modification by the gas. Collectively with our studies in vivo showing its inhibitory action on endogenous hydrogen sulfide production, the current results suggest that not only inhibition of transsulfuration pathway for H(2)S generation but also activation of protein methylation accounts for notable biological actions of carbon monoxide via the cystathionine beta-synthase inhibition.","['Yamamoto, Takehiro', 'Takano, Naoharu', 'Ishiwata, Kyoko', 'Suematsu, Makoto']","['Yamamoto T', 'Takano N', 'Ishiwata K', 'Suematsu M']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Keio University, JST, ERATO Suematsu Gas Biology Project, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Clin Biochem Nutr,Journal of clinical biochemistry and nutrition,8700907,,,2011/02/08 06:00,2011/02/08 06:01,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2010/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3164/jcbn.11-011FR [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Biochem Nutr. 2011 Jan;48(1):96-100. doi: 10.3164/jcbn.11-011FR.

Functional enhancement of the Pten pathway provides a therapeutic strategy for targeting LSCs.","['Peng, Cong', 'Chen, Yaoyu', 'Li, Dongguang', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Peng C', 'Chen Y', 'Li D', 'Li S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 364 Plantation Street, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['119 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.100603 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2010 Jun;1(2):156-60. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.100603.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",PMC3157706,,,"['R01 CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA122142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA122142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a novel T-cell receptor (TCR)-like immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) antibody (8F4) with high specific binding affinity (dissociation constant [K(D)] = 9.9nM) for a combined epitope of the PR1/HLA-A2 complex. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy of 8F4-labeled cells showed significantly higher PR1/HLA-A2 expression on AML blasts compared with normal leukocytes (P = .046). 8F4 mediated complement-dependent cytolysis of AML blasts and Lin(-)CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia stem cells (LSCs) but not normal leukocytes (P < .005). Although PR1 expression was similar on LSCs and hematopoietic stem cells, 8F4 inhibited AML progenitor cell growth, but not normal colony-forming units from healthy donors (P < .05). This study shows that 8F4, a novel TCR-like antibody, binds to a conformational epitope of the PR1/HLA-A2 complex on the cell surface and mediates specific lysis of AML, including LSCs. Therefore, this antibody warrants further study as a novel approach to targeting leukemia-initiating cells in patients with AML.","['Sergeeva, Anna', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'He, Hong', 'Ruisaard, Kathryn', 'Lu, Sijie', 'Wygant, James', 'McIntyre, Bradley W', 'Ma, Qing', 'Li, Dan', 'St John, Lisa', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J']","['Sergeeva A', 'Alatrash G', 'He H', 'Ruisaard K', 'Lu S', 'Wygant J', 'McIntyre BW', 'Ma Q', 'Li D', 'St John L', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Molldrem JJ']","['Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation & Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

However, the well-known limitations of current reprogramming technologies include low efficiency, slow kinetics, and transgene integration and residual expression. In the present study, we have demonstrated that iPSCs free of transgene and vector sequences could be generated from human BM and CB mononuclear cells using non-integrating episomal vectors. The reprogramming described here is up to 100 times more efficient, occurs 1-3 weeks faster compared with the reprogramming of fibroblasts, and does not require isolation of progenitors or multiple rounds of transfection. Blood-derived iPSC lines lacked rearrangements of IGH and TCR, indicating that their origin is non-B- or non-T-lymphoid cells. When cocultured on OP9, blood-derived iPSCs could be differentiated back to the blood cells, albeit with lower efficiency compared to fibroblast-derived iPSCs. We also generated transgene-free iPSCs from the BM of a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CML iPSCs showed a unique complex chromosomal translocation identified in marrow sample while displaying typical embryonic stem cell phenotype and pluripotent differentiation potential. This approach provides an opportunity to explore banked normal and diseased CB and BM samples without the limitations associated with virus-based methods.","['Hu, Kejin', 'Yu, Junying', 'Suknuntha, Kran', 'Tian, Shulan', 'Montgomery, Karen', 'Choi, Kyung-Dal', 'Stewart, Ron', 'Thomson, James A', 'Slukvin, Igor I']","['Hu K', 'Yu J', 'Suknuntha K', 'Tian S', 'Montgomery K', 'Choi KD', 'Stewart R', 'Thomson JA', 'Slukvin II']","['Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, 1220 Capitol Court, Madison, WI 53715, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Dedifferentiation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Reprogramming/genetics/*physiology', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'Efficiency', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Transgenes/physiology']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45321-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-07-298331 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 7;117(14):e109-19. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-07-298331.

Whole blood samples were treated with Abs, and death of CD19(+) B-CLL was measured by flow cytometry. Alemtuzumab efficiently lysed B-CLL targets with maximal lysis at 1-4 h (62%). In contrast, rituximab induced a more limited cell death (21%) that was maximal only at 24 h. GA101 killed B-CLL targets to a similar extent but more rapidly than rituximab, with 19.2 and 23.5% cell death at 4 and 24 h, respectively, compared with 7.9 and 21.4% for rituximab. Lysis by both rituximab and GA101 correlated directly with CD20 expression levels (r(2) = 0.88 and 0.85, respectively). Interestingly, lysis by all three Abs at high concentrations was mostly complement dependent, because it was blocked by the anti-C5 Ab eculizumab by 90% in the case of alemtuzumab and rituximab and by 64% in the case of GA101. Although GA101 caused homotypic adhesion, it induced only limited (3%) direct cell death of purified B-CLL cells. Both rituximab and GA101 showed the same efficiency in phagocytosis assays, but phagocytosis was not significant in whole blood due to excess Igs. Finally, GA101 at 1-100 mug/ml induced 2- to 3-fold more efficient NK cell degranulation than rituximab in isolated B-CLL or normal PBMCs. GA101, but not rituximab, also mediated significant NK cell degranulation in whole blood samples. Thus, complement and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity are believed to be the major effector mechanisms of GA101 in whole blood assays.","['Bologna, Luca', 'Gotti, Elisa', 'Manganini, Massimiliano', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Introna, Martino', 'Golay, Josee']","['Bologna L', 'Gotti E', 'Manganini M', 'Rambaldi A', 'Intermesoli T', 'Introna M', 'Golay J']","['Laboratory of Cellular Therapy G.

Batf expression is regulated following stimulation of both lymphoid and myeloid cells. When treated with leukemia inhibitory factor, mouse M1 myeloid leukemia cells commit to a macrophage differentiation program that is dependent on Stat3 and involves the induction of Batf gene transcription via the binding of Stat3 to the Batf promoter. RNA interference was employed to block Batf induction in this system and the cells failed to growth arrest or to terminally differentiate. Restoring Batf expression not only reversed the differentiation-defective phenotype but also caused the cells to display signs of spontaneous differentiation in the absence of stimulation. Efforts to define genetic targets of the Batf transcription factor in M1 cells led to the identification of c-myb, a proto-oncogene known to promote blood cell proliferation and to inhibit the differentiation of M1 cells. These results provide strong evidence that Batf mediates the differentiation-inducing effects of Stat3 signaling in M1 cells and suggest that Batf may play a similar role in other blood cell lineages where alterations to the Jak-Stat pathway are hallmarks of disrupted development and disease.","['Liao, Juan', 'Humphrey, Sean E', 'Poston, Stacie', 'Taparowsky, Elizabeth J']","['Liao J', 'Humphrey SE', 'Poston S', 'Taparowsky EJ']","['Department of Biological Sciences, 201 South University Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907-2064, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, myb/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/07/12 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-10-0375 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0375 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2011 Mar;9(3):350-63. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0375.

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms in HR repair genes RAD51 and XRCC3 on the risk and treatment outcomes of inv(16)/t(16;16)/CBFbeta-MYH11(+) AML. The distribution of polymorphisms in RAD51-G135C and XRCC3-Thr241Met were studied by PCR-RFLP analysis in 625 cases of de novo AML, including 105 cases with inv(16)/t(16;16)/CBFbeta-MYH11, 806 family controls and 704 volunteer controls. It was found that the XRCC3-241Met variant significantly increased the risk of the development of the AML with inv(16)/t(16;16) as compared with both the volunteer control (OR=7.22; 95% CI, 4.37-11.91) and the family control (OR=7.99; 95% CI, 5.03-12.69). A retrospective study conducted in 103 inv(16)/t(16;16) AML patients. In multivariate analysis for the potential prognostic factors, the XRCC3-241Met variant significantly reduced disease-free survival (DFS) in complete remission (CR) achieved patients (HR=2.34, 95% CI, 1.32-4.16). These data indicate that the XRCC3-241Met variant may not be only a susceptibility factor to the AML with inv(16)/t(16;16), but also an independent poor-prognostic factor for this AML subtype.","['Liu, Liang', 'Yang, Lin', 'Mi, Yingchang', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Li, Jianyong', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Ma, Xiaotang', 'Qin, Tiejun', 'Xu, Zefeng', 'Xiao, Zhijian']","['Liu L', 'Yang L', 'Mi Y', 'Wang J', 'Li J', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma X', 'Qin T', 'Xu Z', 'Xiao Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Rad51 Recombinase/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2010/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00024-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.01.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Aug;35(8):1020-6. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.01.014.

However, the drug is difficult to formulate for parenteral administration because of its low water solubility and Cremophor EL, the expient used for its formulation, has been shown to cause serious side effects. The present study reports an alternative administration vehicle involving a lipophilic paclitaxel prodrug, paclitaxel oleate, incorporated in the core of a nanoparticle-based dosage form. A hydrophobic poly (beta-amino ester) (PbAE) was used to formulate the nanoparticles, which were stabilized with a mixture of phosphatidylcholine, Synperonic(R) F 108, and poly(ethylene glycol)-dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine. PbAE undergoes rapid dissolution when the pH of the medium is less than 6.5 and is expected to rapidly release its content within the acidic tumor microenvironment and endo/lysosome compartments of cancer cells. PbAE nanoparticles were prepared by an ultrasonication method and characterized for particle size and physical stability. The nanoparticles obtained had a diameter of about 70 nm and a good physical stability when stored at 4 degrees C. In vitro cellular uptake and release of paclitaxel oleate PbAE nanoparticles were studied in Jurkat acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The results were compared with pclitaxel oleate in poly(varepsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) particles, that do not display pH-sensitive release behavior, and paclitaxel in PbAE particles. Both uptake and release of the prodrug were faster when administered in PbAE than in PCL, but much slower than those of the free drug in PbAE. Cytotoxicity assay was performed on the formulations at different doses. Paclitaxel and paclitaxel oleate showed almost identical activity, IC50 123 and 128 nM, respectively, while that of the prodrug in PCL was much lower with IC50 at 2.5 muM. Thus, PbAE nanoparticles with the incorporated paclitaxel prodrug paclitaxel oleate may prove useful for replacement of the toxic Cremophor EL and also by improving the distribution of the drug to the tumor.","['Lundberg, B B']",['Lundberg BB'],"['Department of Biosciences, Abo Akademi University, Artillerigatan 6, FI-20520, Abo, Finland. bolundbe@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Paclitaxel/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Particle Size', 'Polymers/*chemistry', 'Prodrugs/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Ultrasonics']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2010/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-5173(11)00092-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.01.061 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2011 Apr 15;408(1-2):208-12. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.01.061.

Thus, there is an increasing demand for sensitive biomarkers for the early detection of myelosuppressive anemia during toxicological studies. We applied a toxicogenomic approach to identify useful biomarker genes reflecting myelosuppressive anemia in the rat liver. Expression of the hemoglobin beta chain complex (Hbb), aminolevulinic acid synthase 2 (Alas2), and cell division cycle 25 homolog B (Cdc25b) genes changed as a result of anemia induced by the myelosuppressive agents linezolid, cisplatin, and carboplatin, suggesting that these genes may be suitable biomarkers. Moreover, evaluation of perfused and unperfused livers indicated that changes in the expression of these genes originate in circulating reticulocytes in the liver. Erythroid differentiation-associated changes in expression of the Hbb, Alas2, and Cdc25b genes were confirmed in vitro using Friend leukemia cells. In conclusion, our current research provides novel evidence that gene expression in circulating reticulocytes contained in the liver changes dramatically under myelosuppressive conditions. While further large-scale validation studies are needed, our results indicate that the genes we identified might be useful biomarkers for the sensitive detection of myelosuppressive anemia in rats.","['Uehara, Takeki', 'Kondo, Chiaki', 'Yamate, Jyoji', 'Torii, Mikinori', 'Maruyama, Toshiyuki']","['Uehara T', 'Kondo C', 'Yamate J', 'Torii M', 'Maruyama T']","['Drug Developmental Research Laboratories, Shionogi & Co.

Time to leukemia (TTL) was determined for each patient sample engrafted as weeks from transplant to overt leukemia. Short TTL was strongly associated with high risk for early relapse, identifying an independent prognostic factor. This high-risk phenotype is reflected by a gene signature that upon validation in an independent patient cohort (n = 197) identified a high-risk cluster of patients with early relapse. Furthermore, the signature points to independent pathways, including mTOR, involved in cell growth and apoptosis. The pathways identified can directly be targeted, thereby offering additional treatment approaches for these high-risk patients.","['Meyer, Luder Hinrich', 'Eckhoff, Sarah Mirjam', 'Queudeville, Manon', 'Kraus, Johann Michael', 'Giordan, Marco', 'Stursberg, Jana', 'Zangrando, Andrea', 'Vendramini, Elena', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Lahr, Georgia', 'Holzmann, Karlheinz', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Stahnke, Karsten', 'Kestler, Hans Armin', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael']","['Meyer LH', 'Eckhoff SM', 'Queudeville M', 'Kraus JM', 'Giordan M', 'Stursberg J', 'Zangrando A', 'Vendramini E', 'Moricke A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Schrauder A', 'Lahr G', 'Holzmann K', 'Schrappe M', 'Basso G', 'Stahnke K', 'Kestler HA', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Debatin KM']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Ulm, 89075 Ulm, Germany. lueder-hinrich.meyer@uniklinik-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/03/24 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2009/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(10)00482-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2010.11.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2011 Feb 15;19(2):206-17. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2010.11.014.

PCL can either originate de novo (primary PCL) or as a secondary leukemic transformation of MM (secondary PCL). Presenting signs and symptoms are similar to those seen in MM such as renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, but can also include hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected PCL should include a review of the peripheral blood smear, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with immunofixation, and protein electrophoresis of an aliquot from a 24h urine collection (UPEP). The diagnosis is made when a monoclonal population of PCs is present in the peripheral blood with an absolute PC count exceeding 2000/muL and PC comprising 20% or more of the peripheral blood white cells. The prognosis of PCL is poor with a median survival of 7 to 11 months. Survival is even shorter (2 to 7 months) when PCL occurs in the context of refractory or relapsing MM. There have been no prospective randomized trials investigating the treatment of PCL. Recommendations are primarily based upon data from small retrospective series, case reports, and extrapolation of data from patients with MM. In general, patients are treated with induction therapy followed by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in those who are appropriate candidates for this approach. The best induction regimen for PCL is not known and there is great variability in clinical practice. Newer agents that are being incorporated into frontline and salvage therapy for MM have also demonstrated activity in PCL such as Immunomodulatory agents and the use of bortezomib with different combinations.","['Albarracin, Flavio', 'Fonseca, Rafael']","['Albarracin F', 'Fonseca R']","['Hematology Division, Hospital Central, Mendoza, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/blood/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Survival Analysis']",2011/02/08 06:00,2011/07/20 06:00,['2011/02/08 06:00'],"['2011/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0268-960X(11)00006-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2011.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2011 May;25(3):107-12. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2011.01.005.

We demonstrated that this effect depends on the disease risk; for standard risk cases, this effect was significantly associated with poor outcome (for OS, P = 0.021), while for high risk cases, it had no effect on the results (for OS, P = 0.26). We further showed that FtoM mismatch was associated with nonrelapse mortality (P = 0.019) and most of them were GVHD-related in standard risk cases.

PROCEDURE: Adult survivors of childhood cancers (n = 6,047) and siblings (n = 2,326), all 25 years of age and older, completed a long-term follow-up questionnaire that assessed adaptive, neurocognitive, and psychological functioning, as well as demographic and health status. Multivariable logistic regression analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to identify predictors of independent living. RESULTS: Compared to siblings (n = 206, 8.7%), survivors (n = 1063; 17.7%) were more than twice as likely to live dependently (OR 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.77-2.42). Survivors diagnosed with CNS tumors (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.10-0.18) or leukemia (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.23-0.27) were significantly less likely to live independently compared to those diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma.

However, there is little data available regarding whether mutations in this gene also contribute to pediatric leukemia, especially in childhood myeloid malignancies. Therefore we made a decision to screen patients with pediatric myeloid neoplasias for the presence of RUNX1 mutations in their samples. PROCEDURES: Patients (n = 238) with diagnoses of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 198), de novo myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 16), therapy-related AML (n = 9), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (n = 15) were included in this study. All patients were Belarusians between the ages of 0 and 18 years. RESULTS: The frequency of RUNX1 point mutations in the total group of patients with de novo AML was 3% and de novo MDS was 15%. Cooperation of point mutations in the RUNX1 and NRAS genes, and the cytogenetic abnormality, -7/7q-, was demonstrated in children with therapy-related AML. RUNX1 point mutations predominate in those de novo AML and MDS patients with a normal karyotype in leukemic cells. Frequency of RUNX1 point mutations was about 4% in a group of children with de novo AML aged 0-14 years diagnosed during the period of 1998-2009. CONCLUSION: During the course of this investigation, valuable data were obtained concerning RUNX1 gene mutation frequencies in different clinical, morphological, and cytogenetic groups of patients with myeloid malignancies, and its cooperation with other molecular aberrations.","['Migas, Alexandr', 'Savva, Natallia', 'Mishkova, Olga', 'Aleinikova, Olga V']","['Migas A', 'Savva N', 'Mishkova O', 'Aleinikova OV']","['Belarusian Research Center for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Minsk, Belarus. migas@cancer.org.by']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",2011/02/05 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/02/05 06:00'],"['2010/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22980 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Oct;57(4):583-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22980.

However, the relevance and significance of XMRV to human disease remain unclear, since the association has not been confirmed in other studies. XMRV is the first gammaretrovirus to be found in humans. XMRV and murine leukaemia viruses share similar structures and genomic organisation. Human restriction factors such as APOBEC3 or tetherin inhibit XMRV replication. Although XMRV induces low rates of transformation in cell culture, it might be able to induce cancer by low-frequency insertional activation of oncogenes or through the generation of highly active transforming viruses. A preference for regulatory regions of transcriptional active genes has been observed after a genomic-wide analysis of XMRV integration sites. Genes related to carcinogenesis and androgen signalling have been identified in the vicinity of integration sites. The XMRV genome contains a glucocorticoid responsive element, and androgens could modulate viral replication in the prostate. Evidence supporting the involvement of XMRV in chronic fatigue syndrome is still very weak, and needs further confirmation and validation. Currently approved anti-retroviral drugs such as zidovudine, tenofovir and raltegravir are efficient inhibitors of XMRV replication in vitro. These drugs might be useful to treat XMRV infection in humans. The identification of XMRV has potentially serious health implications for the implementation of novel techniques including gene therapy or xenotransplantation, while raising concerns on the need for screening donated blood to prevent transmission through transfusion.","['Menendez-Arias, Luis']",['Menendez-Arias L'],"['Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas and Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain. lmenendez@cbm.uam.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Rev Med Virol,Reviews in medical virology,9112448,IM,"['Animals', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/*physiology']",2011/02/05 06:00,2011/05/19 06:00,['2011/02/05 06:00'],"['2010/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/rmv.673 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Med Virol. 2011 Jan;21(1):3-17. doi: 10.1002/rmv.673.

Mutations in the genes encoding IDH1 and IDH2 were first reported in human gliomas in 2008 and later on also identified in a minority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The mutations universally affect codons 132 in IDH1 and 172 in IDH2 and result in decreased enzymatic activity. The oncogenic pathway triggered by IDH mutations may involve the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor pathway as well as the acquisition of a novel (gain of enzymatic) function consuming NADPH and generating alpha-hydroxyglutarate. Most intriguingly, IDH mutations are observed in approximately 70-80% of grade II/III gliomas and the majority of secondary glioblastomas, but only 10% of primary glioblastomas, suggesting a different cellular origin of the gliomas, which had previously been viewed as a multistep process of malignant progression.

The median follow-up was 5.46 years. At 5 years, the overall survival (OS) rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate were 94.4 and 92.0%, respectively. The estimated rate of the CCyRe and MMR were 81.7 and 67.1%, respectively. 106 patients achieving the CCyRe had significantly better OS and PFS than 27 patients without achieving the CCyRe. Patients with MMR had significantly better survival free from death, progression, imatinib withdrawal and a loss of the CCyRe, than patients whose response level remained in the CCyRe without achieving MMR until 18 months.

Here, we provide evidence that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib induces apoptosis in primary CLL cells. This strong pro-apoptotic effect is not restricted to any subgroup of patients, based on Binet stage and the expression of ZAP70 or CD38. Mechanistically, sorafenib-induced cell death is preceded by a rapid downregulation of Mcl-1 through the inhibition of protein translation. Subsequently, the cell intrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated, indicated by destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3 and -9. In contrast to sorafenib, the monoclonal vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF)-antibody bevacizumab failed to induce apoptosis in CLL cells, suggesting that sorafenib induces cell death irrespectively of VEGF signalling. Notably, although sorafenib inhibits phosphorylation of the Scr-kinase Lck, knock-down of Lck did not induce apoptosis in CLL cells. Of note, the pro-apoptotic effect of sorafenib is not restricted to cell-cycle arrested cells, but is also maintained in proliferating CLL cells. In addition, we provide evidence that sorafenib can overcome drug resistance in CLL cells protected by microenvironmental signals from stromal cells. Conclusively, sorafenib is highly active in CLL and may compose a new therapeutic option for patients who relapse after immunochemotherapy.","['Huber, S', 'Oelsner, M', 'Decker, T', 'zum Buschenfelde, C Meyer', 'Wagner, M', 'Lutzny, G', 'Kuhnt, T', 'Schmidt, B', 'Oostendorp, R A J', 'Peschel, C', 'Ringshausen, I']","['Huber S', 'Oelsner M', 'Decker T', 'zum Buschenfelde CM', 'Wagner M', 'Lutzny G', 'Kuhnt T', 'Schmidt B', 'Oostendorp RA', 'Peschel C', 'Ringshausen I']","['Third Department of Medicine, Technical University, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Sorafenib', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/02/05 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/02/05 06:00'],"['2011/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20112 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 May;25(5):838-47. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.2.

MCs may be identified by cytomorphology (CM), enzyme cytochemical staining with nonspecific esterases, flow cytometric analysis (FCA), and immunohistochemical analysis (IHCA); their aberrancy, by FCA or IHCA. As aberrant antigen expression on MCs is not detected by CM or enzyme cytochemical staining and as there may be instances of ""dry tap"" or a fresh bone marrow aspirate is not available for further analysis, the primary and specific purpose of this study is to globally compare the detection of MCs and their aberrancy by the 2 methods of FCA and IHCA. PROCEDURES: Forty bone marrow (aspirate, clot, and biopsy) samples (7 CMMLs; 33 AMMLs and AMoLs) are evaluated by CM, FCA (complete immunophenotypic panel), and retrospective IHCA (CD2, CD3, CD14, CD33, CD56, CD68, CD123, and CD163). RESULTS: Forty-five percent showed a higher percentage of MCs by FCA than by CM. In addition, CD14, CD2, and CD56 detections on MCs showed greater sensitivity by FCA than by IHCA. By IHCA, CD14 showed the highest specificity for MCs (CD163, less specificity; CD68 and CD33, low specificity). CD123 did not correlate with CD14 or CD163, stained a subset of AMMLs/AMoLs, and stained no CMMLs. By comparing IHCA in clot versus biopsy sections, CD56 showed highest correlation (93%), followed by CD14 (85%) and CD33 (70%). CD68, CD163, and CD123 showed greater reactivities in clots (48%, 44%, and 35%, respectively), likely because of decalcification. CONCLUSIONS: FCA is most sensitive in detecting MCs and their aberrancy. By IHCA, CD14 is most specific. CD123 inconsistently marks AMMLs/AMoLs. Further evaluation of CD123 may determine the usefulness of CD123 in AML subtyping and possible prognostic implications and targeted therapy.","['Dunphy, Cherie H']",['Dunphy CH'],"['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7525, USA. cdunphy@unch.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2011/02/05 06:00,2011/10/20 06:00,['2011/02/05 06:00'],"['2011/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAI.0b013e3182052805 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2011 Jul;19(4):336-40. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0b013e3182052805.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment consisted of six cycles of AZA and VPA for 7 days, followed by ATRA for 21 days. Sixty-five patients were enrolled (median age, 72 years; 55 AML including 13 relapsed/refractory patients, 10 MDS; 30 unfavorable karyotypes). Best responses included 14 CR and 3 PR (26%), 75% of the responders and 36% of the non-responders achieving an erythroid response. Median overall survival (OS) was 12.4 months. Untreated patients had a longer OS than relapsed/refractory patients. In patients who fulfilled the 6 planned cycles, OS did not appear to depend on CR/PR achievement, suggesting that stable disease while on-treatment would be a surrogate for survival with this approach. During therapy, early platelet response and demethylation of the FZD9, ALOX12, HPN, and CALCA genes were associated with clinical response. Finally, there was no evidence for the restoration of an ATRA-induced differentiation during therapy.

Through the combined activation of the p53-p21 and p16-Rb suppressor pathways, OIS leads to the transcriptional repression of proliferative genes. Although this protective mechanism has been essentially described in primary cells, we surprisingly observed in this study that the OIS program is conserved in established colorectal cell lines. In response to the RAS oncogene and despite the inactivation of p53 and p16(INK4), HT29 cells enter senescence, up-regulate p21(WAF1), and induce senescence-associated heterochromatin foci formation. The same effect was observed in response to B-RAF(v600E) in LS174T cells. We also observed that p21(WAF1) prevents the expression of the CDC25A and PLK1 genes to induce cell cycle arrest. Using ChIP and luciferase experiments, we have observed that p21(WAF1) binds to the PLK1 promoter to induce its down-regulation during OIS induction. Following 4-5 weeks, several clones were able to resume proliferation and escape this tumor suppressor pathway. Tumor progression was associated with p21(WAF1) down-regulation and CDC25A and PLK1 reexpression. In addition, OIS and p21(WAF1) escape was associated with an increase in DNA damage, an induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition program, and an increase in the proportion of cells expressing the CD24(low)/CD44(high) phenotype. Results also indicate that malignant cells having escaped OIS rely on survival pathways induced by Bcl-xL/MCL1 signaling. In light of these observations, it appears that the transcriptional functions of p21(WAF1) are active during OIS and that the inactivation of this protein is associated with cell dedifferentiation and enhanced survival.","['de Carne Trecesson, Sophie', 'Guillemin, Yannis', 'Belanger, Audrey', 'Bernard, Anne-Charlotte', 'Preisser, Laurence', 'Ravon, Elisa', 'Gamelin, Erick', 'Juin, Philippe', 'Barre, Benjamin', 'Coqueret, Olivier']","['de Carne Trecesson S', 'Guillemin Y', 'Belanger A', 'Bernard AC', 'Preisser L', 'Ravon E', 'Gamelin E', 'Juin P', 'Barre B', 'Coqueret O']","['Cancer Center Paul Papin, INSERM U892, 49033 Angers, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Dedifferentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', 'Heterochromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/genetics/metabolism']",2011/02/05 06:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2011/02/05 06:00'],"['2011/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)51664-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.186437 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Apr 15;286(15):12825-38. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.186437.

The medical files were reviewed for pertinent clinical data, and the EEGs were evaluated for changes in brain activity. Abnormal background activity was noted in 52.2% of the EEGs done at 1-10 days of therapy, in 43.5% of those done at 10-60 days, and only 4.3% of those done at later stages (p=0.037). These findings, together with earlier reports, suggest that early-stage ALL, even before treatment, may be associated with excessive slow EEG activity, which improves over time.

Most studies emphasize the role of lymphoma-infiltrating T-cells and macrophages, with few studies on natural killer cells. Natural killer cells include a less mature (CD56(bright)/CD16-) subset that is more common in lymph nodes and a more mature (CD56(dim)/CD16+) subset that is more numerous in peripheral blood. Therefore, the proportions of natural killer cells, natural killer subsets, and natural killer-like T-cells (CD3+, CD56+, and/or CD16/57+) were determined by flow cytometry in 150 cases of tissue-based B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 89 nonneoplastic tissue biopsies. Results were correlated with the clinicopathologic findings. A higher percentage of natural killer cells was found in nonneoplastic spleen versus other nonneoplastic tissue (P < .001), in splenic-based B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma versus other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P < .01), and in stage II to IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma versus stage I diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 19, P = .02). The more mature natural killer subset was increased in benign spleen (P < .001) and nonsplenic B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P < .01) versus nonsplenic, nonneoplastic tissue; in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma versus other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P < .001); and in follicular lymphoma with an intermediate follicular lymphoma international prognostic index score (n = 17, P = .04). A higher proportion of natural killer-like T-cells was seen in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma versus other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P = .001), whereas chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma contained fewer natural killer-like T-cells (P < .001). The proportions of natural killer cells, natural killer subsets, and natural killer-like T-cells vary with tissue site, type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and clinical stage in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. A higher proportion of CD56(dim)/CD16/57+ natural killer cells is found in spleen, in more aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and in follicular lymphoma with an intermediate follicular lymphoma international prognostic index score.

Chronic myeloid leukemia cells with t(9;22)(q34;q11) express the Bcr/Abl fusion protein, which interacts with Grb2 and Gab2 signaling, thereby triggering hematopoietic cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to examine in detail the total and subcellular Gab2 protein expression in myeloid cells in bone marrow biopsies of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in different disease stages. The study included 50 fixed bone marrow biopsies of controls (unaffected hematopoiesis, n = 11) and Bcr/Abl-positive chronic myeloid leukemia cases (n = 39) of different stages (chronic phase, n = 13; accelerated phase, n = 4; blast crisis, n = 11; complete remission, n = 11). Immunohistochemistry and quantitative evaluation of Gab2 staining in 600 myeloid cells/bone marrow biopsy were performed before statistical analyses. Immunohistochemistry revealed Gab2 expression in hematopoietic cells. Gab2-positive myeloid cells occurred significantly more frequent in chronic myeloid leukemia cases than in controls (P < .001) and appeared to markedly increase from chronic phase to accelerated phase to blast crisis. Importantly, within the distinct stages of chronic myeloid leukemia, a significant switch of Gab2-positive myeloid cells with cytoplasmic or nuclear/perinuclear Gab2 staining occurred: Nuclear/perinuclear Gab2-positive myeloid cells significantly increased from chronic phase to accelerated phase (P = .001) and from chronic phase to blast crisis (P < .001). Still, an overlap and, hence, a wider range of Gab2 staining patterns were seen between and within chronic myeloid leukemia stages, most likely reflecting a high plasticity of Grb2-associated binder 2 functions in the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia. In summary, the present study, for the first time, analyzed Grb2-associated binder 2 protein expression in bone marrow biopsies of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in detail, demonstrating a novel and distinct Grb2-associated binder 2 staining pattern in normal and chronic myeloid leukemia bone marrow biopsies as well as in distinct chronic myeloid leukemia stages. Grb2-associated binder 2 immunohistochemistry may provide a valuable supplementary tool to routine histopathology and standard immunohistochemistry for classification and staging of (borderline) chronic myeloid leukemia bone marrow biopsies and hence improved therapeutic disease management.","['Aumann, Konrad', 'Lassmann, Silke', 'Schopflin, Anja', 'May, Annette M', 'Wohrle, Franziska U', 'Zeiser, Robert', 'Waller, Cornelius F', 'Hauschke, Dieter', 'Werner, Martin', 'Brummer, Tilman']","['Aumann K', 'Lassmann S', 'Schopflin A', 'May AM', 'Wohrle FU', 'Zeiser R', 'Waller CF', 'Hauschke D', 'Werner M', 'Brummer T']","['Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Staining and Labeling']",2011/02/05 06:00,2011/06/17 06:00,['2011/02/05 06:00'],"['2010/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0046-8177(10)00370-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2010.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2011 May;42(5):719-26. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2010.09.012.

AIM: Methanol extracts from thirty-four spices and plants, with related ethnobotanical use were investigated for their in vitro cytotoxicity on the human pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa-2, leukemia CCRF-CEM cells and their multidrug resistant (MDR) subline CEM/ADR5000, and the normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In addition the anti-angiogenic properties of the most active extracts were investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium] assay was used for cytotoxic studies and the CAM-assay (chicken-chorioallantoic-membrane-assay) for anti-angiogenesis test. RESULTS: The results of the cytotoxicity tests indicated that, when tested at 20 mug/ml, extracts from Xylopia aethiopica, Echinops giganteus, Imperata cylindrica, Dorstenia psilirus and Piper capense were able to inhibit more that 50% the proliferation of the three tested cancer cells (MiaPaCa-2, CEM/ADR5000 CCRF-CEM). The lowest IC(50) values of 6.86 mug/ml on MiaPaCa-2 and 3.91 mug/ml on CCRF-CEM cells were obtained with X. aethiopica, while the corresponding value of 6.56 mug/ml was obtained with P. capense on CEM/ADR5000 cells. Against leukemia cells, no cross-resistance was observed with I. cylindrica, P. capense and Zinziber officinalis. Extracts from D. psilirus and E. giganteus were able to inhibit angiogenesis by more than 50% in quail embryo. CONCLUSION: The overall results of the present study provide supportive data on the use of some Cameroonian plants for cancer treatment.","['Kuete, Victor', 'Krusche, Benjamin', 'Youns, Mahmoud', 'Voukeng, Igor', 'Fankam, Aime G', 'Tankeo, Simplice', 'Lacmata, Stephen', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Krusche B', 'Youns M', 'Voukeng I', 'Fankam AG', 'Tankeo S', 'Lacmata S', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Cameroon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cameroon', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry', '*Spices']",2011/02/05 06:00,2011/08/30 06:00,['2011/02/05 06:00'],"['2010/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(11)00049-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2011.01.035 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2011 Apr 12;134(3):803-12. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2011.01.035.

Analysis of the leukemia lymphoma molecular profiling project (LLMPP) database indicates Aurora over-expression correlates with poor prognosis. A tissue microarray (TMA) composed of 20 paired mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients demonstrated >75% of patients had high levels Aurora expression. Aurora A and B were also found elevated in 13 aggressive B-NHL cell lines. MLN8237, an Aurora inhibitor induced G2/M arrest with polyploidy and abrogated Aurora A and histone-H3 phosphorylation. MLN8237 inhibited aggressive B-NHL cell proliferation at an IC(50) of 10-50 nM and induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Low dose combinations of MLN8237+docetaxel enhanced apoptosis by ~3-4-fold in cell culture compared to single agents respectively. A mouse xenograft model of MCL demonstrated that MLN8237 (10 or 30 mg/kg) or docetaxel (10mg/kg) alone had modest anti-tumor activity. However, MLN8237 plus docetaxel demonstrated a statistically significant tumor growth inhibition and enhanced survival compared to single agent therapy.

Cytogenetic findings play an integral role in defining the prognostic significance and treatment for individual patients. RESULTS: We have evaluated 25 clinical cases from a tertiary cancer center that have an established diagnosis of CLL and for which there was prior cytogenetic and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data. We performed microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based microarray designed for the detection of known constitutional genetic syndromes. In 15 of the 25 cases, aCGH detected all copy number imbalances identified by prior cytogenetic and/or FISH studies. For the majority of those not detected, the aberrations were present at low levels of mosaicism. Furthermore, for 15 of the 25 cases, additional abnormalities were detected. Four of those cases had deletions that mapped to intervals implicated in inherited predisposition to CLL. For most cases, aCGH was able to detect abnormalities present in as few as 10% of cells. Although changes in ploidy are not easily discernable by aCGH, results for two cases illustrate the detection of additional copy gains and losses present within a mosaic tetraploid cell population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the successful evaluation of CLL using a microarray optimized for the interrogation of inherited disorders and the identification of alterations with possible relevance to CLL susceptibility.","['Schultz, Roger A', 'Delioukina, Maria', 'Gaal, Karl', 'Bedell, Victoria', 'Smith, David D', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'McDaniel, Lisa D', 'Ballif, Blake C', 'Shaffer, Lisa G', 'Slovak, Marilyn L']","['Schultz RA', 'Delioukina M', 'Gaal K', 'Bedell V', 'Smith DD', 'Forman SJ', 'McDaniel LD', 'Ballif BC', 'Shaffer LG', 'Slovak ML']","['Signature Genomics, 2820 N, Astor St,, Spokane, WA, 99207, USA. lisa.shaffer@perkinelmer.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,2011/02/05 06:00,2011/02/05 06:01,['2011/02/05 06:00'],"['2010/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/05 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-8166-4-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-4-4 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2011 Feb 3;4(1):4. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-4-4.,20110203,,PMC3045370,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

H. sabdariffa aqueous extracts (HSE) were prepared from the dried flowers of H. sabdariffa L., which are rich in phenolic acids, flavonoids and anthocyanins. In this review, we discuss the chemopreventive properties and possible mechanisms of various H. sabdariffa extracts. It has been demonstrated that HSE, H. sabdariffa polyphenol-rich extracts (HPE), H. sabdariffa anthocyanins (HAs), and H. sabdariffa protocatechuic acid (PCA) exert many biologic effects. PCA and HAs protected against oxidative damage induced by tert-butyl droperoxide (t-BHP) in rat primary hepatocytes. In rabbits fed cholesterol and human experimental studies, these studies imply HSE could be pursued as atherosclerosis chemopreventive agents as they inhibit LDL oxidation, foam cell formation, as well as smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. The extracts also offer hepatoprotection by influencing the levels of lipid peroxidation products and liver marker enzymes in experimental hyperammonemia. PCA has also been shown to inhibit the carcinogenic action of various chemicals in different tissues of the rat. HAs and HPE were demonstrated to cause cancer cell apoptosis, especially in leukemia and gastric cancer. More recent studies investigated the protective effect of HSE and HPE in streptozotocin induced diabetic nephropathy. From all these studies, it is clear that various H. sabdariffa extracts exhibit activities against atherosclerosis, liver disease, cancer, diabetes and other metabolic syndromes. These results indicate that naturally occurring agents such as the bioactive compounds in H. sabdariffa could be developed as potent chemopreventive agents and natural healthy foods.","['Lin, Hui-Hsuan', 'Chen, Jing-Hsien', 'Wang, Chau-Jong']","['Lin HH', 'Chen JH', 'Wang CJ']","['School of Medical Laboratory and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, and Department of Medical Research, ChungShan Medical University Hospital, No. 110, Section 1, Chien Kuo N.

Undifferentiated ES cells (EB3) were cultured without leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) for 0, 4 and 7 days and are referred to as ES-D0, ES-D4 and ES-D7, respectively. These three cell lines were treated with 300 muM hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for 48 and 72 h. After treatment, the amounts of 8-OH-Gua in the cells were determined by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrochemical detector (ECD) method. The levels of 8-OH-Gua in ES-D7 treated with H(2)O(2) were higher than those in ES-D0 and ES-D4, suggesting that the DNA in the undifferentiated cells was protected against gene impairment, as compared to that in the differentiated cells. To examine the repair capacity for 8-OH-Gua, this study analysed the expression of 8-OH-Gua repair-associated genes, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), MutY homolog (MUTYH) and Mut T homolog 1 (MTH1), in ES-D0, ES-D4 and ES-D7. The mRNA levels of MUTYH and MTH1 showed no significant change, whereas OGG1 mRNA was significantly decreased in ES-D7 treated with H(2)O(2). Moreover, it was observed that ES-D7 treated with H(2)O(2) readily underwent apoptosis, in comparison to its undifferentiated counterparts, ES-D0 and ES-D4. Taken together, ES cells are more resistant to DNA oxidative stresses than differentiated cells.","['Kuboyama, Ayumi', 'Tanaka, Shoichi', 'Kawai, Kazuaki', 'Kasai, Hiroshi', 'Morii, Haruki', 'Tamae, Kazuyoshi', 'Nakashima, Tamiji', 'Hirano, Takeshi']","['Kuboyama A', 'Tanaka S', 'Kawai K', 'Kasai H', 'Morii H', 'Tamae K', 'Nakashima T', 'Hirano T']","['Department of Chemical Processes and Environments, Faculty of Environmental Engineering, The University of Kitakyushu, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, 808-0135, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Glycosylases/metabolism', '*DNA Repair', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2011/02/05 06:00,2011/07/12 06:00,['2011/02/05 06:00'],"['2011/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10715762.2011.555481 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2011 May;45(5):527-33. doi: 10.3109/10715762.2011.555481.

Diffusible and membrane bound lipid electrophiles are known to modify DNA and protein substrates and modulate cellular pathways including ER stress, antioxidant response, DNA damage, heat shock, and apoptosis. Herein we report on a structure-activity relationship for several electrophilic analogues of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and 4-oxononenal (ONE) with regard to toxicity and anti-inflammatory activity. The analogues studied were the oxidation products of HNE and ONE, HNEA/ONEA, the in vivo hydrolysis products of oxidized phosphatidylcholine, COOH-HNE/COOH-ONE, and their methyl esters, COOMe-HNE/ONE. The reactivity of each compound toward N-acetylcysteine was determined and compared to the toxicity toward a human colorectal carcinoma cell line (RKO) and a human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). Further analysis was performed in differentiated THP-1 macrophages to assess changes in macrophage activation and pro-inflammatory signaling in response to each lipid electrophile. HNE/ONE analogues inhibited THP-1 macrophage production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNFalpha, after lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/IFNgamma activation. Inhibition of cytokine production was observed at submicromolar concentrations of several analogues with as little as 30 min of exposure. Phagocytosis of fluorescent beads was also inhibited by lipid electrophile treatment. Lipid electrophiles related to HNE/ONE are both toxic and anti-inflammatory, but the anti-inflammatory effects in human macrophages are observed at nontoxic concentrations. Neither toxicity nor anti-inflammatory activity are strongly correlated to the reactivity of the model nucleophile, N-acetylcysteine.","['McGrath, Colleen E', 'Tallman, Keri A', 'Porter, Ned A', 'Marnett, Lawrence J']","['McGrath CE', 'Tallman KA', 'Porter NA', 'Marnett LJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0146, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,IM,"['Aldehydes/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diffusion', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphatidylcholines/chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2011/02/05 06:00,2011/07/12 06:00,['2011/02/05 06:00'],"['2011/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/tx100323m [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2011 Mar 21;24(3):357-70. doi: 10.1021/tx100323m.

The establishment and maintenance of these diverse transcriptional programs rely on changes of chromatin state, mainly through histone modifications. Polycomb and Trithorax complexes participate in setting apart active and inactive genes by respectively repressing and activating key developmental regulators in different cell types. Over the last decade, our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying their activities has greatly improved, but the signals targeting these proteins to specific regions of the genome are still poorly understood, particularly in vertebrates. Recent findings highlight the highly dynamic activities of Polycomb and Trithorax complexes in vivo.

MDM2 is the endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis that downregulates the functional activity of p53 protein. This study is aimed to evaluate changes in MDM2 and p53 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from children with ALL prior to and after 6 and 12 h of prednisone administration in relation to early treatment response. The study comprised 35 children with newly diagnosed ALL, subdivided into good (n = 24) and poor (n = 11) early treatment responders. MDM2 - associated APC fluorescence and p53 - associated FITC fluorescence were measured by the laser scanning cytometer. In the group of poor responders, p53 and MDM2 fluorescence were significantly higher than in the group of good responders. In the group of good early treatment responders, a statistically significant rise of p53 fluorescence measured in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm 12 h after prednisone administration as well as increase in MDM2 fluorescence measured in the cytoplasm 6 and 12 h after prednisone administration were seen. These data suggest that pretreatment overexpression of MDM2 protein may contribute to poor early treatment response.","['Ociepa, Tomasz', 'Maloney, Eliza', 'Kamienska, Elzbieta', 'Wysocki, Mariusz', 'Kurylak, Andrzej', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Urasinski, Tomasz', 'Urasinska, Elzbieta', 'Domagala, Wenancjusz']","['Ociepa T', 'Maloney E', 'Kamienska E', 'Wysocki M', 'Kurylak A', 'Matysiak M', 'Urasinski T', 'Urasinska E', 'Domagala W']","['Department of Paediatrics, Haematology and Oncology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin. elzura@ams.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Pol J Pathol,Polish journal of pathology : official journal of the Polish Society of Pathologists,9437432,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2011/02/04 06:00,2011/06/17 06:00,['2011/02/04 06:00'],"['2011/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['16128 [pii]'],ppublish,Pol J Pathol. 2010;61(4):199-205.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, it is part of a small set of proteins that are used to generate pluripotent embryonic stem cells from differentiated tissues. Herein, we describe that a Klf4 zinc-finger domain mutant induces self-renewal and block of maturation, while wild-type Klf4 induces terminal macrophage differentiation. Moreover, we present the crystal structure of the zinc-finger domain of Klf4 bound to its target DNA, revealing that primarily the two C-terminal zinc-finger motifs are required for site specificity. Lack of those two zinc fingers leads to deficiency of Klf4 to induce macrophage differentiation. The first zinc finger, on the other hand, inhibits the otherwise cryptic self-renewal and block of differentiation activity of Klf4. Our data show that impairing the DNA binding could potentially contribute to a monocytic leukemia.","['Schuetz, Anja', 'Nana, Didier', 'Rose, Charlotte', 'Zocher, Georg', 'Milanovic, Maja', 'Koenigsmann, Jessica', 'Blasig, Rosel', 'Heinemann, Udo', 'Carstanjen, Dirk']","['Schuetz A', 'Nana D', 'Rose C', 'Zocher G', 'Milanovic M', 'Koenigsmann J', 'Blasig R', 'Heinemann U', 'Carstanjen D']","['Protein Sample Production Facility, Max-Delbruck-Centrum fur Molekulare Medizin, Robert-Rossle-Str. 10, 13125 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Crystallization', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/etiology', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Plasmids/genetics', '*Protein Binding', 'Retroviridae', 'X-Ray Diffraction', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",2011/02/04 06:00,2011/11/05 06:00,['2011/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00018-010-0618-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2011 Sep;68(18):3121-31. doi: 10.1007/s00018-010-0618-x.

Since intracellular cytarabine triphosphate (ara-CTP) is an active metabolite of ara-C, factors that reduce the amount of ara-CTP are known to induce drug resistance. However, these factors do not fully explain the development of resistance to ara-C. The present study was conducted to search for new candidate ara-C resistance factors, including those that are unrelated to ara-CTP production. For this purpose, we newly established five ara-C-resistant leukemic clones from different blood cell lineage leukemic cell lines (HL-60, K562, CEM, THP1 and U937). The resistant subclones were 5-58-fold more ara-C-resistant than their parental counterparts. All of the ara-C-resistant subclones, except for ara-C-resistant CEM cells, displayed alteration of ara-CTP-related factors such as ara-C membrane transport capacity, deoxycytidine kinase activity or cytosolic nucleotidase II activity. To identify new candidate factors, we used two comprehensive approaches: DNA microarray and proteome analyses. The DNA microarray analysis revealed eight genes (C19orf2, HSPA8, LGALS1, POU4F3, PSAP, AKT1, MBC2 and CACNA2D3) that were altered in all five ara-C-resistant lines compared to parental cells. Both proteome and DNA microarray analyses further detected a reduced protein level of stathmin1 in the ara-C-resistant CEM subclone compared to its parental line. Thus, the present findings suggested the involvement of novel multiple mechanisms in mediating the ara-C resistance of leukemic cells. The role of some of these molecules in resistance is still unclear.","['Negoro, Eiju', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Urasaki, Yoshimasa', 'Nishi, Rie', 'Hori, Hiroki', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Negoro E', 'Yamauchi T', 'Urasaki Y', 'Nishi R', 'Hori H', 'Ueda T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, 23-3 Shimoaizuki, Matsuoka, Eiheiji, Fukui 910-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/metabolism"", 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Enzyme Assays', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proteome/*metabolism']",2011/02/04 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2011.933 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2011 Apr;38(4):911-9. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2011.933.

Rituximab has limited clinical activity when used as a single agent. The combination of the monoclonal antibody with fludarabine-based regimens clearly demonstrated, in Phase II and randomized trials, an increase in clinical efficacy in previously untreated and pretreated patients. Furthermore the addition of rituximab enabled the eradication of minimal residual disease, which is correlated with the prognosis in a high proportion of patients. Although the combination of rituximab with fludarabine-based regimens increased myelosuppression and immunosuppression, incidence of infections did not increase. The benefit of adding rituximab to other purine analogs or other chemotherapeutic combination regimens has also been explored. Moreover there could be a role for achieving better quality of responses with the combination of different monoclonal antibodies, considering that they target different antigens and exert different mechanism of action. Although the role of rituximab as maintenance therapy in low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas has been determined, the benefit and optimal schedule in chronic lymphocytic leukemia are still under investigation.

Adjuvant systemic therapies have been shown to have a significant impact on reducing the risk for breast cancer recurrence and overall mortality. Chemotherapy remains an important and frequently used treatment option in the adjuvant setting, and the associated short-term adverse events are very well described. However, there is insufficient information regarding the long-term sequelae of most chemotherapeutic agents. In this review, we describe different potential long-term adverse events associated with adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer, with a particular focus on long-term cardiac toxicity, secondary leukemia, cognitive function, and neurotoxicity. In addition, we discuss the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on fertility and sexual function of young breast cancer patients. These adverse events are frequently overshadowed by the well-demonstrated clinical efficacy and/or reassuring short-term safety profiles of the different chemotherapy regimens commonly used today. We believe that a proper understanding and appreciation of these adverse events will enable us to refine our strategies for managing breast cancer. The fact that adjuvant chemotherapy is often given to patients who might not really need it urges us to consider the whole spectrum of chemotherapy risks versus benefits to maximize benefit without compromising quality of life.","['Azim, H A Jr', 'de Azambuja, E', 'Colozza, M', 'Bines, J', 'Piccart, M J']","['Azim HA Jr', 'de Azambuja E', 'Colozza M', 'Bines J', 'Piccart MJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Oncology, Terni Hospital, Terni, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, University Hospital of Clementino Fraga Filho, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.

Particularly, high Evi1 expression defines one of the largest clusters in acute myeloid leukemia and is significantly associated with extremely poor prognosis. However, mechanistic basis of Evi1-mediated leukemogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that Evi1 directly represses phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) transcription in the murine bone marrow, which leads to activation of AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In a murine bone marrow transplantation model, Evi1 leukemia showed modestly increased sensitivity to an mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, we found that Evi1 binds to several polycomb group proteins and recruits polycomb repressive complexes for PTEN down-regulation, which shows a novel epigenetic mechanism of AKT/mTOR activation in leukemia. Expression analyses and ChIPassays with human samples indicate that our findings in mice models are recapitulated in human leukemic cells. Dependence of Evi1-expressing leukemic cells on AKT/mTOR signaling provides the first example of targeted therapeutic modalities that suppress the leukemogenic activity of Evi1. The PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and the Evi1-polycomb interaction can be promising therapeutic targets for leukemia with activated Evi1.","['Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Goyama, Susumu', 'Watanabe-Okochi, Naoko', 'Yoshiki, Yumiko', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Nitta, Eriko', 'Arai, Shunya', 'Sato, Tomohiko', 'Shimabe, Munetake', 'Nakagawa, Masahiro', 'Imai, Yoichi', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Yoshimi A', 'Goyama S', 'Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Yoshiki Y', 'Nannya Y', 'Nitta E', 'Arai S', 'Sato T', 'Shimabe M', 'Nakagawa M', 'Imai Y', 'Kitamura T', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/04 06:00,2011/06/03 06:00,['2011/02/04 06:00'],"['2011/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49401-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-12-261602 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Mar 31;117(13):3617-28. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-12-261602.

Glomerular injury concurrent with direct infiltration of the kidney by lymphoplasmacytic neoplasms has been reported but is not extensively characterized. We identified 18 patients, all presenting with elevated serum creatinine and many with proteinuria, whose renal biopsies showed direct involvement of kidney by a variety of neoplasms, including chronic leukocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 7), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 6), multiple myeloma (n = 4), or B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 1). In 10 cases (55%), there was coexistent glomerular pathology: 5 of these cases, including glomerulonephritis with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis-like pattern of injury (n = 4) and membranous nephropathy (n = 1), featured deposition of immune complexes; 2 demonstrated deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin components: lambda light chain amyloidosis (n = 1) and light chain deposition disease (n = 1); 2 showed minimal change disease; and, in 1 case, there was focal crescentic pauci-immune-type glomerulonephritis. In addition, 1 biopsy revealed diabetic nephropathy and 3 showed nonspecific ischemic changes. In the remaining 4 cases, there were no significant glomerular abnormalities. In 11 cases (61%), the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disease was established following the kidney biopsy. Our study indicates that lymphoplasmacytic neoplasms may be first diagnosed in renal biopsies performed for evaluation of renal dysfunction with or without proteinuria. Concurrent glomerular injury may be a direct result of the lymphoplasmacytic disorder through a paraprotein deposition process resulting in amyloid or monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease, or may be caused indirectly through immune-mediated mechanisms, as in the cases of glomerulonephritis with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis-like pattern of injury, membranous nephropathy, and possibly minimal change disease.","['Kowalewska, Jolanta', 'Nicosia, Roberto F', 'Smith, Kelly D', 'Kats, Alexander', 'Alpers, Charles E']","['Kowalewska J', 'Nicosia RF', 'Smith KD', 'Kats A', 'Alpers CE']","['Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. jkowal@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Glomerulus/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology']",2011/02/04 06:00,2011/07/13 06:00,['2011/02/04 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0046-8177(10)00367-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2010.09.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2011 Jun;42(6):896-903. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2010.09.009.

As AML is treated with cytarabine (Ara-C) and an anthracycline, we sought to determine the effects of the Flt3-ITD on response to these agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A genetically defined mouse model of AML was used to examine the effects of the Flt3-ITD on response to cytarabine and doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro, the Flt3-ITD conferred resistance to doxorubicin and doxorubicin plus Ara-C, but sensitivity to Ara-C alone. This resistance was reversible by the Flt3-ITD inhibitor sorafenib. The Flt3-ITD did not affect DNA damage levels after treatment, but was associated with increased levels of p53. The p53 response was critical to the observed changes as the Flt3-ITD had no effect on chemotherapy response in the setting of p53 null AML. In vivo, the Flt3-ITD accelerated engraftment that was partially reversible by Ara-C but not doxorubicin. Additionally, Ara-C provided a significant reduction in disease burden and a survival advantage that was not increased by the addition of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin alone led to only minimal disease reduction and no survival benefit. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the Flt3-ITD confers sensitivity to Ara-C, but resistance to doxorubicin in a manner that depends on p53. Thus, patients with Flt3-ITD positive AML may not benefit from treatment with an anthracycline.","['Pardee, Timothy S', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Lowe, Scott W']","['Pardee TS', 'Zuber J', 'Lowe SW']","['Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Department of Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA. tspardee@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzenesulfonates/administration & dosage', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Damage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sorafenib', 'Survival Analysis', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2011/02/04 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/02/04 06:00'],"['2010/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00018-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.01.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Apr;39(4):473-485.e4. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.01.009.

Nowadays the scientists are looking for food materials which can potentially prevent the cancer occurrence. The purpose of this research is to examine anti-mutagenic and apoptotic effects of apigenin in human lymphoma cells. In present study human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Eheb cell line) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin, L-glutamine and incubated at 37 masculineC for 2 days. In addition cancer cell line was treated by and apigenin and cellular vital capacity was determined by MTT assay. Then effect of apigenin in human lymphoma B cells was examined by flow cytometry techniques. The apigenin was subsequently evaluated in terms of anti-mutagenic properties by a standard reverse mutation assay (Ames test). This was performed with histidine auxotroph strain of Salmonella typhimurium (TA100). Thus, it requires histidine from a foreign supply to ensure its growth. The aforementioned strain gives rise to reverted colonies when exposed to sodium azide as a carcinogen substance. During MTT assay, human chronic lymphocytic leukemia revealed to have a meaningful cell death when compared with controls (P<0.01) Apoptosis was induced suitably after 48 hours by flow cytometry assay. In Ames test apigenin prevented the reverted mutations and the hindrance percent of apigenin was 98.17%.These results have revealed apigenin induced apoptosis in human lymphoma B cells in vitro.","['Hashemi, Mehrdad', 'Nouri Long, Mehdi', 'Entezari, Maliheh', 'Nafisi, Shohreh', 'Nowroozii, Hossein']","['Hashemi M', 'Nouri Long M', 'Entezari M', 'Nafisi S', 'Nowroozii H']","['Department of Genetics, Islamic Azad University, Tehran Medical Branch, Tehran, Iran. mhashemi@iautmu.ac.ir']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Acta Med Iran,Acta medica Iranica,14540050R,IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antimutagenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apigenin/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Mutagenesis/*drug effects', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Salmonella typhimurium/*drug effects/genetics/growth & development', 'Time Factors']",2011/02/03 06:00,2011/07/26 06:00,['2011/02/03 06:00'],"['2011/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [medline]']",['16811 [pii]'],ppublish,Acta Med Iran. 2010 Sep-Oct;48(5):283-8.,,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the 37 children (</=14 years) with newly diagnosed APL, we applied treatments that consisted of ATRA alone or in combination with As(2)O(3) in induction followed by consolidation and maintenance treatment. Overall, 35 (94.6%) of 37 children achieved complete remission (CR). Two patients died of intracerebral hemorrhage on days 1 and 2.

METHODS: GATA1 gene was screened in DNA samples from neonates presenting with TMD during their leukemic and remission status. RESULTS: Six neonates (2 phenotypically normal and 4 DS) born in the past 6 years had presented with TMD; all had trisomy 21 during leukemic status. Two DS infants died during early infancy, one of hepatic failure and one of cardiac complication. One non-DS infant evolved into myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia since 14 months old. Three other patients have not developed true leukemia after follow-up of 8, 9, and 70 months, respectively. The authors detected mutations within exon 2 of GATA1 gene in 3 DS and 2 non-DS infants. All these mutations disappeared after remission of TMD, but an identical mutation was detected in one non-DS patient when evolving into MDS.

Our analyses have focused on Treg-mediated suppression of CD8(+) T cells, and in particular Tregs induced by viral infection. One of the unique characteristics of virus-induced Tregs is that they can suppress CD8(+) T cell function in vitro without the requirement for additional stimulation. This ability correlates with their suppressive capacity and activated status in vivo. Interestingly, while virus-induced Tregs suppress CD8(+) T cell function in vitro and in vivo, they do not suppress proliferation unless they are further activated in vitro.","['Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Myers, Lara M']","['Hasenkrug KJ', 'Myers LM']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT, USA. khasenkrug@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Liver/cytology/immunology', 'Lung/cytology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*cytology/*immunology']",2011/02/03 06:00,2011/05/03 06:00,['2011/02/03 06:00'],"['2011/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-61737-979-6_4 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2011;707:45-54. doi: 10.1007/978-1-61737-979-6_4.,,,PMC3761880,,,['Z01 AI000753-12/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS489829'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 27H2 mAb was developed from a mouse alternatively immunized with human acute leukemia cell lines, KG1 and Molm-1. Using flow cytometric analysis of various leukemic cell lines and peripheral blood, immunohistochemical study of frozen tonsil, we characterized 27H2 mAb. Antigen immunoprecipitated with 27H2 mAb immunobloted with anti-CD34 mAb. A case of bone marrow sample of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient was obtained at CBNU Hospital. For epitope identification enzyme treatment with neuraminidase and O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (OSGE) and blocking assay with known classIII mAb (HPCA-2) were done. RESULTS: Only KG1 and Molm-1 revealed positive immunoreactivity. Immunohistochemical staining disclosed strong membranous immunoreactivity on high endothelial venules. Antigen immunoprecipitated by 27H2 mAb showed approximately 100 kDa sized band immunoblotted with anti-CD34 under non-reducing conditions.

Eosinophilia is frequently paraclonal (because of cytokines and not part of the malignant clone), but in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), it may also be clonal. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 80 pediatric AML patients treated from June 2004 to December 2008 at our cancer center for PBE and BME at diagnosis and postinduction. RESULTS: At diagnosis, PBE was present in 18.8% patients whereas at postinduction it was observed in 7.7% patients. No patient had abnormal eosinophils. At diagnosis, PBE correlated with the absence of gum hypertrophy whereas BME correlated with the French-American-British-M2 subtype and absence of gum hypertrophy. PBE/BME did not have a significant correlation with event-free survival. After completion of therapy, on follow-up up to 2 years every 3 months, one-third of the patients had eosinophilia; however, it did not correlate with disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the impact of eosinophilia at presentation, postinduction, and on follow-up with outcome in pediatric AML. Although eosinophilia was observed in one-fifth of the patients at diagnosis and in one-third of the patients on follow-up, it seems to be reactive in nature with no impact on outcome and thus it should not be a cause of alarm.","['Agarwal, Rishu', 'Vishnubhatla, Sreenivas', 'Gupta, Ritu', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Agarwal R', 'Vishnubhatla S', 'Gupta R', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Laboratory Oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Eosinophilia/etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/02/03 06:00,2011/04/09 06:00,['2011/02/03 06:00'],"['2011/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181f46a91 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Mar;33(2):e51-3. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181f46a91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report on an 18-year-old man diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with p16 deletion (9p21). He was treated with induction chemotherapy using the Spanish PETHEMA group protocol and achieved complete remission. Three months after the diagnosis of B-ALL, he developed a severe multiorgan histiocytosis that is clinically suggestive of LCH but lacked typical immunohistochemical features of LCH and indeterminate cell histiocytosis: CD1a was strongly positive, CD68 and S-100 protein were moderately positive, and langerin was negative. The drugs of the first-line treatment recommended for LCH had been part of the chemotherapy of B-ALL that the patient had received. Therefore, we prescribed the second-line treatment for LCH (cytarabine and 2'-chlorodeoxyadenosine), and he achieved partial remission. The patient died during the aplasia induced by the third cycle of chemotherapy from pneumonia. We could not demonstrate the transdifferentiation of tumoral lymphocytes into histiocytes, using p16 deletion (9p21) as a marker, because these cells did not share the mutation. Neither could we study immunoglobulin-H rearrangement as we had exhausted all the tissue samples. In the medical literature, there are a few reported cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia followed by disseminated LCH and just 1 case of B-ALL followed by localized LCH affecting the bones.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and related cancers share recurrent chromosomal defects and molecular lesions that predict outcomes. We hypothesized that combining SNP-A and MC could improve diagnosis/prognosis and further the molecular characterization of myeloid malignancies. We analyzed MC/SNP-A results from 430 patients (MDS = 250, MDS/myeloproliferative overlap neoplasm = 95, acute myeloid leukemia from MDS = 85). The frequency and clinical significance of genomic aberrations was compared between MC and MC plus SNP-A. Combined MC/SNP-A karyotyping lead to higher diagnostic yield of chromosomal defects (74% vs 44%, P < .0001), compared with MC alone, often through detection of novel lesions in patients with normal/noninformative (54%) and abnormal (62%) MC results. Newly detected SNP-A defects contributed to poorer prognosis for patients stratified by current morphologic and clinical risk schemes. The presence and number of new SNP-A detected lesions are independent predictors of overall and event-free survival. The significant diagnostic and prognostic contributions of SNP-A-detected defects in MDS and related diseases underscore the utility of SNP-A when combined with MC in hematologic malignancies.","['Tiu, Ramon V', 'Gondek, Lukasz P', ""O'Keefe, Christine L"", 'Elson, Paul', 'Huh, Jungwon', 'Mohamedali, Azim', 'Kulasekararaj, Austin', 'Advani, Anjali S', 'Paquette, Ronald', 'List, Alan F', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Tiu RV', 'Gondek LP', ""O'Keefe CL"", 'Elson P', 'Huh J', 'Mohamedali A', 'Kulasekararaj A', 'Advani AS', 'Paquette R', 'List AF', 'Sekeres MA', 'McDevitt MA', 'Mufti GJ', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/03 06:00,2011/07/01 06:00,['2011/02/03 06:00'],"['2011/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45208-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-07-295857 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 28;117(17):4552-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-07-295857.

As their presence is not specific to the onset of SCT-related thrombotic microangiopathy, we evaluated the interest of schistocyte measurement twice a week during the entire follow-up of 195 patients undergoing SCT, particularly focussing on the 125 allogeneic SCT. METHODS: Schistocytes were strickly defined as triangular-, crescent- or helmet-shaped red blood cells according to consensus standards and were checked blindly under the microscope and with computer image analysis. RESULTS: Mean schistocyte percentage was 0.7% (+/-0.5%, reference value </=0.5). High schistocyte percentage was observed after allografts (0.79%) when compared to autologous SCT (0.47, P < 0.001). All but one patients undergoing allogenic SCT had schistocytes >/=0.6%. Conversely, significant schistocytosis was observed in 20% of the autologous SCT. Initial diagnosis [chronic myelocytic leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)], high-risk status, unrelated transplant and conditioning regimen including total body irradiation influenced higher schistocyte percentage ( approximately 0.9%). Significant rise in the schistocyte percentage was observed during acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease, veno-occlusive disease (VOD), cholestatic hepatitis, haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) and pulmonary complications. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association between thrombotic microangiopathy (TM), renal impairment and delayed thrombopaenia after day 50, and schistocyte >1.2%. SCT-TM grade >/=2 occurred in nine patients. A marked rise in schistocyte >4.5% was observed, which was not reached during the other SCT-related complications. Children with ALL, undergoing unrelated allogeneic SCT, with early acute graft-versus-host disease refractory to steroids were prone to present SCT-TM, associated with VOD, interstitial pneumopathy and HC, resulting in a high mortality rate (six of seven patients). Our data confirmed that schistocytosis was common after SCT. Mild percentages were likely concomitant with extensive endothelial damage but higher percentage should have prompted to a close monitoring with SCT-TM investigation. CONCLUSION: In our experience, systematic schistocyte count after HSCT proved to be useful: the occurrence of an increased percentage was a surrogate marker for complications even if unspecific for TM.","['Lesesve, J-F', 'Alla, F', 'Dugue, F', 'Salignac, S', 'Clement, L', 'Lecompte, T', 'Bordigoni, P']","['Lesesve JF', 'Alla F', 'Dugue F', 'Salignac S', 'Clement L', 'Lecompte T', 'Bordigoni P']","['Department of Laboratory Hematology, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France. jf.lesesve@chu-nancy.fr']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Count', 'Erythrocytes, Abnormal/*pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/blood', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Thrombotic Microangiopathies/etiology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2011/02/03 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/02/03 06:00'],"['2011/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01292.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2011 Aug;33(4):343-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01292.x.

PRDX4 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it locally controls oxidative stress by reducing H(2)O(2) levels. We recently provided evidence for a regulatory function of PRDX4 in signal transduction from a myeloid growth factor receptor, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR). Upon activation, the ligand-induced G-CSFR undergoes endocytosis and routes via the early endosomes where it physically interacts with ER-resident PRDX4. PRDX4 negatively regulates G-CSFR mediated signaling. Here, we investigated whether PRDX4 is affected in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); genomic alterations and expression levels of PRDX4 were investigated. We show that genomic abnormalities involving PRDX4 are rare in AML. However, we find a strong reduction in PRDX4 expression levels in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) compared to normal promyelocytes and different molecular subtypes of AML. Subsequently, the possible role of DNA methylation and histone modifications in silencing of PRDX4 in APLs was investigated. We show that the reduced expression is not due to methylation of the CpG island in the promoter region of PRDX4 but correlates with increased trimethylation of histone 3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27me3) and lysine residue 4 (H3K4me3) at the transcriptional start site (TSS) of PRDX4, indicative of a bivalent histone code involved in transcriptional silencing. These findings suggest that the control of G-CSF responses by the antioxidant protein PRDX4 may be perturbed in APL.","['Palande, Karishma K', 'Beekman, Renee', 'van der Meeren, Lotte E', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Touw, Ivo P']","['Palande KK', 'Beekman R', 'van der Meeren LE', 'Beverloo HB', 'Valk PJ', 'Touw IP']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antioxidants', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Peroxiredoxins/*genetics', 'Transcription Initiation Site']",2011/02/02 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0016340 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Jan 20;6(1):e16340. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0016340.,20110120,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Histones)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (PRDX4 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",PMC3024432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of these derivatives were determined in human leukemia HL-60, NB4, K562 and HP100-1 cells. DX1, DX2 and DX5, which contain a secondary amino moiety, were more active in inhibiting cell growth and in inducing apoptosis than DX3 and DX4. The apoptosis induction ability of DX1 was associated with the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and the activation of caspase-8. Pretreatment with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and catalase completely blocked DX1-induced H(2)O(2) production, but only partially its activation of caspase-8 and induction of apoptosis. HL-60 cells were more sensitive than its H(2)O(2)-resistant subclone HP100-1 cells to DX1-induced apoptosis. The activation of caspase-8 by these compounds was correlated with the decrease in the levels of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP). The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 augmented the decrease in c-FLIP levels and apoptosis induced by these derivatives. FADD- and caspase-8-deficient Jurkat subclones have a decreased response to DX1-induced apoptosis. Our data indicate that these novel beta-elemene piperazine derivatives induce apoptosis through the decrease in c-FLIP levels and the production of H(2)O(2) which leads to activation of both death receptor- and mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathways.","['Yu, Zhiying', 'Wang, Rui', 'Xu, Liying', 'Xie, Siwei', 'Dong, Jinhua', 'Jing, Yongkui']","['Yu Z', 'Wang R', 'Xu L', 'Xie S', 'Dong J', 'Jing Y']","['School of Life Science and Biopharmaceutics, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Piperazine', 'Piperazines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Death Domain/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2011/02/02 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0015843 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Jan 25;6(1):e15843. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0015843.,20110125,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (beta-elemene)', '1RTM4PAL0V (Piperazine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",PMC3026787,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous animal and cell-based studies have shown that the expression of members of the Forkhead family of tumor suppressors, including FoxO3, is suppressed in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. Furthermore, it has been reported that the proteasomal degradation pathway plays an important role in suppression of FoxO expression in BCR-ABL-transformed cells. In this study, a patient diagnosed with Ph+ALL and refractory to standard therapies was treated with a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib)-based chemotherapy regimen. This treatment resulted in complete hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular remission with excellent performance status for > 4 years since her initial diagnosis. FoxO3 was not detectable within the blasts of this patient at diagnosis and was 'rescued' following treatment with bortezomib therapy, leading to her recovery. As a next step, in the attempt to propose FoXO3 as a therapeutic target and a theranostic marker, we further validated FoxO3 expression in human bone marrow biopsy samples. Human core biopsy samples of Ph+ALL and Ph-negative-negative ALL, along with uninvolved controls, revealed that FoxO3 down-regulation was specific to Ph+ALL. This study provides support that FoxO3 is a good biomarker for BCR-ABL-mediated leukemogenesis. Additionally, proteasomal inhibition by bortezomib may be a promising therapeutic option in Philadelphia-positive ALL, where FoxO3 is downregulated.","['Dewar, Rajan', 'Chen, Sing-Tsung', 'Yeckes-Rodin, Heather', 'Miller, Kenneth', 'Khosravi-Far, Roya']","['Dewar R', 'Chen ST', 'Yeckes-Rodin H', 'Miller K', 'Khosravi-Far R']","['Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston MA, USA. rdewar@bidmc.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Pyrazines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/02 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2011/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['14675 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.11.6.14675 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2011 Mar 15;11(6):552-8. doi: 10.4161/cbt.11.6.14675.

Eating habits, processing, and the food matrix have been suggested to influence the allergenicity of a given food. Factors related to protein structure, such as stability to digestion, have also been suggested. 7S globulins from peanut, hazelnut, soy, and pea were studied to determine whether related proteins would induce a similar sensitization when removed from their 'normal' matrix. METHODS: Brown Norway rats (soy tolerant or nontolerant) were immunized i.p. 3 times with 100 mug purified peanut, hazelnut, soy, or pea 7S without adjuvant. Sera were analyzed for specific antibodies by different ELISAs (IgG1, IgG2a, and IgE), inhibition ELISA, and rat basophilic leukemia cell assay. RESULTS: The 4 related 7S globulins induced a response with an almost identical level of specific antibodies, but peanut 7S induced IgE of higher avidity than hazelnut and pea 7S which, again, had a higher avidity than IgE induced by soy 7S. Soy tolerance reduced the functionality of IgE without influencing antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: Although the 4 7S globulins are structurally related allergens, they induce antibodies with different antigen-binding characteristics. Peanut 7S induces IgE of a higher avidity than hazelnut and pea 7S which, again, has a higher avidity than IgE induced by soy 7S. We also show that soy tolerance influences the function of antibodies to peanut 7S. These findings may help explain how antibodies of different clinical significances can develop in different individuals sensitized to the same allergen.","['Kroghsbo, Stine', 'Bogh, Katrine L', 'Rigby, Neil M', 'Mills, E N Clare', 'Rogers, Adrian', 'Madsen, Charlotte B']","['Kroghsbo S', 'Bogh KL', 'Rigby NM', 'Mills EN', 'Rogers A', 'Madsen CB']","['National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Soborg, Denmark. skro@food.dtu.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Plant/*immunology', 'Arachis/*immunology', 'Corylus/*immunology', 'Female', 'Food Hypersensitivity/blood/*immunology', 'Globulins/*immunology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/immunology', 'Male', 'Peas/*immunology', 'Plant Proteins, Dietary/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Seed Storage Proteins/*immunology', 'Soybean Proteins/*immunology', 'Soybeans/*immunology']",2011/02/02 06:00,2011/08/23 06:00,['2011/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [medline]']","['000321200 [pii]', '10.1159/000321200 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2011;155(3):212-24. doi: 10.1159/000321200.

Presenting symptoms included seizures (100%), altered mental function (100%), headache (40%), and visual disturbance (60%). The mean systolic blood pressure at presentation was 158 mm Hg. Approximately 80% had typical radiological features of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. All showed complete recovery after the acute stage, but one subsequently developed epilepsy. Two patients ultimately died of refractory malignant disease. Two others were followed up for a mean of 6 years, and remained neurologically normal. This report was the first case review documenting reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome in Chinese cancer children. The clinico-radiological features and neurological outcomes were similar to those reported in western series. Early recognition of the syndrome is important to facilitate appropriate treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: CPX-351 induction was administered on days 1, 3, and 5 by 90-minute infusion to 48 relapsed or refractory patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplasia. Doses started at 3 units/m(2) with dose doublings in single-patient cohorts until a pharmacodynamic effect (treatment-related adverse events or reduction in bone marrow cellularity or blast count) was observed, followed by 33% escalations in three patient cohorts until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred. RESULTS: The maximum-tolerated dose was 101 units/m(2). DLTs consisted of hypertensive crisis, congestive heart failure, and prolonged cytopenias. Adverse events were consistent with cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment. Response occurred at doses as low as 32 units/m(2). Of 43 patients with AML, nine had complete response (CR) and one had CR with incomplete platelet recovery; of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, one of three had CR. Eight CRs were achieved among the 31 patients with prior cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment. CR in AML occurred in five of 26 patients age >/= 60 years and in five of 17 patients younger than age 60 years. Median half-life was 31.1 hours (cytarabine) and 21.9 hours (daunorubicin), with both drugs and their metabolites detectable > 7 days after the last dose. The targeted 5:1 molar ratio was maintained at all dose levels for up to 24 hours. CONCLUSION: The recommended dose of CPX-351 for phase II study is 101 units/m(2).

Hitherto, little attention has been given to the prognostic impact of pretransplantation minimal residual disease (MRD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 99 consecutive patients receiving myeloablative HCT for AML in first morphologic remission. Ten-color multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) was performed on bone marrow aspirates before HCT. MRD was identified as a cell population showing deviation from normal antigen expression patterns compared with normal or regenerating marrow. Any level of residual disease was considered MRD positive. RESULTS: Before HCT, 88 patients met morphologic criteria for complete remission (CR), whereas 11 had CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi). Twenty-four had MRD before HCT as determined by MFC. Two-year estimates of overall survival were 30.2% (range, 13.1% to 49.3%) and 76.6% (range, 64.4% to 85.1%) for MRD-positive and MRD-negative patients; 2-year estimates of relapse were 64.9% (range, 42.0% to 80.6%) and 17.6% (range, 9.5% to 27.9%). After adjustment for all or a subset of cytogenetic risk, secondary disease, incomplete blood count recovery, and abnormal karyotype pre-HCT, MRD-positive HCT was associated with increased overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 4.05; 95% CI, 1.90 to 8.62; P < .001) and relapse (HR, 8.49; 95% CI, 3.67 to 19.65; P < .001) relative to MRD-negative HCT. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that pre-HCT MRD is associated with increased risk of relapse and death after myeloablative HCT for AML in first morphologic CR, even after controlling for other risk factors.","['Walter, Roland B', 'Gooley, Ted A', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Milano, Filippo', 'Fang, Min', 'Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Salter, Alexander I', 'Lansverk, Emily', 'Chien, Jason W', 'Gopal, Ajay K', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Pagel, John M']","['Walter RB', 'Gooley TA', 'Wood BL', 'Milano F', 'Fang M', 'Sorror ML', 'Estey EH', 'Salter AI', 'Lansverk E', 'Chien JW', 'Gopal AK', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Pagel JM']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. rwalter@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/02 06:00,2011/05/20 06:00,['2011/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.31.8121 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.31.8121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Mar 20;29(9):1190-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.31.8121.

We have previously demonstrated that these Abs, which we termed TCR mimic mAbs (TCRm), reduce tumor growth in models of breast carcinoma. However, mechanisms of TCRm-mediated tumor growth reduction remain largely unknown. In this study, we report that these Abs, in contrast to several mAbs used currently in the clinic, destroy tumor cells independently of immune effector mechanisms such as Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). We found that TCRm-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells was associated with selective and specific binding of these Abs to peptide/HLA class I complexes, which triggered the activation of JNK and intrinsic caspase pathways. This signaling was accompanied by the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor. TCRm-induced apoptosis in tumor cells was completely inhibited by soluble MHC tetramers loaded with relevant peptide as well as with inhibitors for JNK and caspases. Furthermore, mAbs targeting MHC class I, independent of the peptide bound by HLA, did not stimulate apoptosis, suggesting that the Ab-binding site on the MHC/peptide complex determines cytotoxicity. This study suggests the existence of mechanisms, in addition to ADCC and CDC, through which these therapeutic Abs destroy tumor cells. These mechanisms would appear to be of particular importance in severely immunocompromised patients with advanced neoplastic disease, since immune cell-mediated killing of tumor cells through ADCC and CDC is substantially limited in these individuals.","['Verma, Bhavna', 'Jain, Rinki', 'Caseltine, Shannon', 'Rennels, Aaron', 'Bhattacharya, Raktima', 'Markiewski, Maciej M', 'Rawat, Amit', 'Neethling, Francisca', 'Bickel, Ulrich', 'Weidanz, Jon A']","['Verma B', 'Jain R', 'Caseltine S', 'Rennels A', 'Bhattacharya R', 'Markiewski MM', 'Rawat A', 'Neethling F', 'Bickel U', 'Weidanz JA']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Center for Immunotherapeutic Research, School of Pharmacy, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Abilene, TX 79601, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Mimicry/*immunology', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/*methods']",2011/02/02 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2011/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1002376 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1002376 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Mar 1;186(5):3265-76. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1002376.

The alphabeta TCR A6 recognizes the foreign Ag Tax from the human T cell leukemia virus-1 when presented by the class I MHC HLA-A2. In a possible link with the autoimmune disease human T cell leukemia virus-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, A6 also recognizes a self peptide from the neuronal protein HuD in the context of HLA-A2. We found in our study that the complexes of the HuD and Tax epitopes with HLA-A2 are close but imperfect structural mimics and that in contrast with other recent structures of TCRs with self Ags, A6 engages the HuD Ag with the same traditional binding mode used to engage Tax. Although peptide and MHC conformational changes are needed for recognition of HuD but not Tax and the difference of a single hydroxyl triggers an altered TCR loop conformation, TCR affinity toward HuD is still within the range believed to result in negative selection. Probing further, we found that the HuD-HLA-A2 complex is only weakly stable. Overall, these findings help clarify how molecular mimicry can drive self/nonself cross-reactivity and illustrate how low peptide-MHC stability can permit the survival of T cells expressing self-reactive TCRs that nonetheless bind with a traditional binding mode.","['Borbulevych, Oleg Y', 'Piepenbrink, Kurt H', 'Baker, Brian M']","['Borbulevych OY', 'Piepenbrink KH', 'Baker BM']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Autoantigens/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Conserved Sequence/*immunology', 'Cross Reactions/immunology', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'ELAV Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'ELAV-Like Protein 4', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Antigens/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Mimicry/*immunology', 'Neurons/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Stability', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/chemistry/*metabolism']",2011/02/02 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2011/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1003150 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1003150 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Mar 1;186(5):2950-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1003150.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether the expression of melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24) could be induced during leukemia differentiation and whether mda-7/IL-24 plays a role in leukemia differentiation. We showed that the expression of mda-7/IL-24 and IL-24 delE5, an mda-7/IL-24 splice variant, was induced in U937 and HL60 cells during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-mediated monocytic differentiation. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway was required for their induction. Knockdown of mda-7/IL-24 and IL-24 delE5 resulted in significant inhibition of the monocytic differentiation induced by TPA. More importantly, ectopic overexpression of mda-7/IL-24 and IL-24 delE5 significantly induced U937 cells, HL60 cells, and blast cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia-M5 to differentiate, whereas normal hematopoietic progenitors were not affected. Furthermore, the molecular effector associated with selective differentiation induction by mda-7/IL-24 and IL-24 delE5 may be reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the source of ROS generation was nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. Taken together, our results reveal the mechanism by which TPA induces monocytic differentiation and show for the first time the specific differentiation-inducing effects of mda-7/IL-24 and IL-24 delE5 on human myeloid leukemic cells.","['Yang, Bin-Xia', 'Duan, Yong-Juan', 'Dong, Cheng-Ya', 'Zhang, Fang', 'Gao, Wei-Feng', 'Cui, Xue-Ying', 'Lin, Yong-Min', 'Ma, Xiao-Tong']","['Yang BX', 'Duan YJ', 'Dong CY', 'Zhang F', 'Gao WF', 'Cui XY', 'Lin YM', 'Ma XT']","['State Key Laboratory for Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Burden', 'U937 Cells']",2011/02/02 06:00,2011/08/02 06:00,['2011/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0863 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0863 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2011 Apr;10(4):615-25. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0863.

Incorporation of deoxythioguanosine nucleotides (dG(s)) into the DNA of thiopurine-treated cells causes cell death, but there is also evidence that thiopurine metabolites, particularly the 6-MP metabolite methylthioinosine monophosphate (MeTIMP), inhibit de novo purine synthesis (DNPS). The toxicity of DNPS inhibitors is influenced by methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), a gene frequently deleted in cancers. Because the growth of MTAP-deleted tumor cells is dependent on DNPS or hypoxanthine salvage, we would predict such cells to show differential sensitivity to 6-MP and 6-TG. To test this hypothesis, sensitivity to 6-MP and 6-TG was compared in relation to MTAP status using cytotoxicity assays in two MTAP-deficient cell lines transfected to express MTAP: the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemic cell line, Jurkat, transfected with MTAP cDNA under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter, and a lung cancer cell line (A549-MTAP(-)) transfected to express MTAP constitutively (A549-MTAP(+)). Sensitivity to 6-MP or methyl mercaptopurine riboside, which is converted intracellularly to MeTIMP, was markedly higher in both cell lines under MTAP(-) conditions. Measurement of thiopurine metabolites support the hypothesis that DNPS inhibition is a major cause of cell death with 6-MP, whereas dG(s) incorporation is the main cause of cytotoxicity with 6-TG. These data suggest that thiopurines, particularly 6-MP, may be more effective in patients with deleted MTAP.","['Coulthard, Sally A', 'Redfern, Christopher P F', 'Vikingsson, Svante', 'Lindqvist-Appell, Malin', 'Skoglund, Karin', 'Jakobsen-Falk, Ingrid', 'Hall, Andrew G', 'Taylor, Gordon A', 'Hogarth, Linda A']","['Coulthard SA', 'Redfern CP', 'Vikingsson S', 'Lindqvist-Appell M', 'Skoglund K', 'Jakobsen-Falk I', 'Hall AG', 'Taylor GA', 'Hogarth LA']","[""Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Paul O'Gorman Building, Medical School, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, United Kingdom.

Four membrane-bound receptors have been identified. TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 contain a functional death domain; TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 lack a functional death domain and function as decoy receptors. Flow-cytometric analysis revealed that acute myeloid leukemic (AML) blasts expressed significantly more pro-apoptotic receptors compared to normal blasts. However, about 20% of AML patients highly expressed decoy receptor TRAIL-R3, which was strongly correlated to a shortened overall survival. TRAIL-R3 expression was also high on CD34+/CD38- cells, the compartment that harbors the leukemia initiating stem cell. Expression levels of pro-apoptotic TRAIL receptors were not correlated to the susceptibility for soluble TRAIL, which was generally low (mean level of cell death induction 14%). Cell death could be enhanced by down-modulation of TRAIL-R3, confirming its decoy function on AML blasts. Bypassing of TRAIL-R3 by treatment with antibodies directly targeting TRAIL-R2 resulted in higher rates of induced cell death (max. 80%). In conclusion, AML blasts do express pro-apoptotic TRAIL receptors. However, co-expression of decoy receptor TRAIL-R3 results in significant shortened overall survival. AML blasts could be targeted by anti-TRAIL-R2 antibodies, yielding a new therapeutic option for AML patients.","['Chamuleau, M E D', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'van Rhenen, A', 'van Dreunen, L', 'Jirka, S M G', 'Zevenbergen, A', 'Schuurhuis, G J', 'van de Loosdrecht, A A']","['Chamuleau ME', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van Rhenen A', 'van Dreunen L', 'Jirka SM', 'Zevenbergen A', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.chamuleau@vumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/biosynthesis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors/*biosynthesis', 'U937 Cells', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/02 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00002-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.12.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Jun;35(6):741-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.12.032.

The mechanisms by which lysosomal stability is regulated are not yet fully understood, but changes in the lysosomal membrane lipid composition have been suggested to be involved. Our aim was to investigate the importance of cholesterol in the regulation of lysosomal membrane permeability and its potential impact on apoptosis. Treatment of normal human fibroblasts with U18666A, an amphiphilic drug that inhibits cholesterol transport and causes accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes, rescued cells from lysosome-dependent cell death induced by the lysosomotropic detergent O-methyl-serine dodecylamide hydrochloride (MSDH), staurosporine (STS), or cisplatin. LMP was decreased by pretreating cells with U18666A, and there was a linear relationship between the cholesterol content of lysosomes and their resistance to permeabilization induced by MSDH. U18666A did not induce changes in expression or localization of 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70) or antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins known to protect the lysosomal membrane. Induction of autophagy also was excluded as a contributor to the protective mechanism. By using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with lysosomal cholesterol overload due to a mutation in the cholesterol transporting protein Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1), the relationship between lysosomal cholesterol accumulation and protection from lysosome-dependent cell death was confirmed. Cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes attenuates apoptosis by increasing lysosomal membrane stability.","['Appelqvist, Hanna', 'Nilsson, Cathrine', 'Garner, Brett', 'Brown, Andrew J', 'Kagedal, Katarina', 'Ollinger, Karin']","['Appelqvist H', 'Nilsson C', 'Garner B', 'Brown AJ', 'Kagedal K', 'Ollinger K']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden. hanna.appelqvist@liu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Amides/pharmacology', 'Androstenes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protective Agents/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Serine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2011/02/02 06:00,2011/05/24 06:00,['2011/02/02 06:00'],"['2010/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9440(10)00123-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ajpath.2010.10.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2011 Feb;178(2):629-39. doi: 10.1016/j.ajpath.2010.10.030.,,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Androstenes)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (O-methyl-serine dodecylamide hydrochloride)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '3039-71-2 (3-beta-(2-(diethylamino)ethoxy)androst-5-en-17-one)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",PMC3069902,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

While a number of factors have been described that affect MDR, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. In this study, the role of WAVE1 in MDR was investigated. Among 62 children with AML, high levels of WAVE1 were associated with poor patient outcomes. Proteomic techniques were used to identify novel WAVE1-interacting proteins from leukemia cells, one of which was the cytoskeleton regulator Ezrin. In leukemia cells, WAVE1 co-localized with both Ezrin and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a critical regulator of the MDR phenotype. Overexpression of WAVE1 in K562 leukemia cells up-regulated P-gp and Ezrin, and reduced K562 cells' sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug adriamycin. The opposite effect was seen when WAVE1 expression was reduced via RNA interference. Critically, overexpression of WAVE1 in the absence of Ezrin did not affect P-gp levels or MDR. These data suggest that WAVE1 affects P-gp and MDR of leukemia cells through Ezrin.","['Yang, Ming-Hua', 'Zhao, Ming-Yi', 'Wang, Zhuo', 'Kang, Rui', 'He, Yu-Lei', 'Yin, Xiao-Cheng', 'Liu, Li-Ying', 'Yang, Liang-Chun', 'Zhan, Cai-Xia', 'Wu, Xiu-Shan', 'Tang, Dao-Lin', 'Cao, Li-Zhi']","['Yang MH', 'Zhao MY', 'Wang Z', 'Kang R', 'He YL', 'Yin XC', 'Liu LY', 'Yang LC', 'Zhan CX', 'Wu XS', 'Tang DL', 'Cao LZ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein Family/*physiology']",2011/02/02 06:00,2011/05/25 06:00,['2011/02/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.538776 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Feb;52(2):298-309. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.538776.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WASF1 protein, human)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein Family)', '0 (ezrin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Long-term survivors of childhood ALL (n = 161) received a neurological examination, while parents completed rating scales to establish formal criteria for ADHD. Symptom profiles were generated and compared across demographic and treatment characteristics, as well as medical tests associated with brain pathology. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of ADHD were similar in survivors (10.5%) compared to those reported in the general population (7-10%). However, 25.5% of survivors reported symptoms that impair functioning in multiple settings, with attention problems being most common. These symptoms were associated with cranial radiation therapy (CRT) (mean inattentive symptoms [SD] = 3.6 [3.19] for group treated with CRT vs. 1.6 [2.40] for non-CRT group, P = 0.0006), and survivors who demonstrated impaired anti-saccades during the neurologic exam (mean inattentive symptoms [SD] = 3.4 [3.29] for those with impaired anti-saccades vs. 1.4 [2.41] for those with normal anti-saccades; P = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a neurologically-based phenotype of attention problems in survivors of leukemia that is not fully captured by the syndrome of ADHD suggests that treatments specific to childhood ALL should be explored.","['Krull, Kevin R', 'Khan, Raja B', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Ledet, Davonna', 'Zhu, Liang', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Sabin, Noah D', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Morris, E Brannon']","['Krull KR', 'Khan RB', 'Ness KK', 'Ledet D', 'Zhu L', 'Pui CH', 'Howard SC', 'Srivastava DK', 'Sabin ND', 'Hudson MM', 'Morris EB']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. kevin.krull@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Child', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Prevalence', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/01 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22994 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Dec 15;57(7):1191-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22994.

The purpose of our study is to review the patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics of patients who develop a treatment-related MEC. PROCEDURE: A PubMed search of English language articles was performed using the keywords and MeSH terms: mucoepidermoid, salivary gland, radiation-induced, second malignancy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. RESULTS: The search yielded 23 articles describing 58 patients who received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (RT) and subsequently developed MEC. The most common initial diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 18), acne (n = 9), and Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 6). Patients were divided into three groups according to chemotherapy and RT treatment: chemotherapy alone (n = 14), RT alone (n = 14), or chemotherapy and RT (n = 30). The parotid gland was the most common site for secondary MEC. Latent time (LT) to development of MEC from initial tumor treatment was significantly shorter in the patients treated with chemotherapy +/- RT versus RT alone (7.9 years vs. 27.2 years, P < 0.01). The most common treatment for MEC was surgery alone followed by surgery and postoperative RT. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 98% and 93.4% while the 2- and 5-year locoregional control rates were 97.7% and 92.5%, respectively. There was no difference in survival or locoregional control between groups exposed to RT alone, chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy with RT for the initial tumor. CONCLUSION: Radiation and chemotherapy-related MEC has an excellent prognosis.","['Verma, Jonathan', 'Teh, Bin S', 'Paulino, Arnold C']","['Verma J', 'Teh BS', 'Paulino AC']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid/etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/01 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22978 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Dec 15;57(7):1137-41. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22978.

We examined the relationship between three measures of early life exposure to infections-daycare attendance, birth order and common childhood infections in infancy-with the risk of ALL in non-Hispanic white and Hispanic children, two ethnicities that show sociodemographic differences. The analysis included 669 ALL cases (284 non-Hispanic whites and 385 Hispanics) and 977 controls (458 non-Hispanic whites and 519 Hispanics) ages 1-14 years enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS). When the three measures were evaluated separately, daycare attendance by the age of 6 months (odds ratio [OR] for each thousand child-hours of exposure = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82-1.00) and birth order (OR for having an older sibling = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.92) were associated with a reduced risk of ALL among non-Hispanic white children but not Hispanic children, whereas ear infection before age 6 months was protective in both ethnic groups. When the three measures were assessed simultaneously, the influence of daycare attendance (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.73-0.94) and having an older sibling (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43-0.83) became stronger for non-Hispanic white children. In Hispanic children, a strong reduction in risk associated with ear infections persisted (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.25-0.79). Evidence of a protective role for infection-related exposures early in life is supported by findings in both the non-Hispanic white and Hispanic populations within the NCCLS.","['Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Chokkalingam, Anand P', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Does, Monique', 'Chang, Jeffrey', 'Wong, Alan', 'Trachtenberg, Elizabeth', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Urayama KY', 'Ma X', 'Selvin S', 'Metayer C', 'Chokkalingam AP', 'Wiemels JL', 'Does M', 'Chang J', 'Wong A', 'Trachtenberg E', 'Buffler PA']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. urayamak@fellows.iarc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infections/complications/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Risk']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2010/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25752 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 Apr 1;128(7):1632-43. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25752.

A total of 1374 survivors diagnosed from 1981 to 1995 surviving at least 5-years postdiagnosis, and a matched sample of 13,740 BC residents, were identified from population registers, and linked to provincial hospitalization records from 1986 to 2000. Logistic regression was used to assess relative risk and effect of sociodemographic, clinical, and temporal factors on risk. Approximately 41% of survivors vs. 17% of the population sample had at least one type of hospitalization-related late morbidity in the observation period (adjusted RR 4.1, 95% CI 3.7-4.5). Those at highest risk were survivors of leukemia (RR 4.8, 95% CI 4.0-5.8), central nervous system tumors (RR 4.8, 95% CI 4.0-5.8), bone and soft tissue sarcomas (RR 4.9, 95% CI 3.8-6.2), and kidney cancer (RR 4.9, 95% CI 3.4-7.0). Adjusted relative risk was elevated for all types of morbidity except pregnancy and birth complications, and highest for neoplasms (including second primary cancers) (RR 21.7, 95% CI 16.3-28.7). Morbidity was elevated for all combinations of primary treatment and highest for those with previous radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery (RR 7.1, 95% CI 5.5-9.0). Over time, morbidity for late effects other than neoplasms became more prevalent. These results suggest that survivors are at increased ongoing risk of many types of hospital-related late morbidity, implying that long-term monitoring for multiple health problems is warranted.","['Lorenzi, Maria F', 'Xie, Lijing', 'Rogers, Paul C', 'Pritchard, Sheila', 'Goddard, Karen', 'McBride, Mary L']","['Lorenzi MF', 'Xie L', 'Rogers PC', 'Pritchard S', 'Goddard K', 'McBride ML']","['British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'British Columbia', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk', 'Survivors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/04/05 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25751 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2011 Apr 1;128(7):1624-31. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25751.

Both viruses code for a protease that is essential for replication and therefore represents a key target for drugs interfering with viral infection. The retroviral proteases from HIV-1 and HTLV-I share 31% sequence identity and high structural similarities. Yet, their substrate specificities and inhibition profiles differ substantially. In this study, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for both enzymes in their ligand-free states and in complex with model substrates in order to compare their dynamic behaviors and enhance our understanding of the correlation between sequence, structure, and dynamics in this protein family. We found extensive similarities in both local and overall protein dynamics, as well as in the energetics of their interactions with model substrates. Interestingly, those residues that are important for strong ligand binding are frequently not conserved in sequence, thereby offering an explanation for the differences in binding specificity. Moreover, we identified an interaction network of contacts between conserved residues that interconnects secondary structure elements and serves as a scaffold for the protein fold. This interaction network is conformationally stable over time and may provide an explanation for the highly similar dynamic behavior of the two retroviral proteases, even in the light of their rather low overall sequence identity.","['Rucker, Pia', 'Horn, Anselm H C', 'Meiselbach, Heike', 'Sticht, Heinrich']","['Rucker P', 'Horn AH', 'Meiselbach H', 'Sticht H']","['Bioinformatik, Institut fur Biochemie and Emil-Fischer-Zentrum, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Fahrstr. 17, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Mol Model,Journal of molecular modeling,9806569,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/*chemistry', '*Conserved Sequence', 'HIV Protease/*chemistry', 'HIV-1/enzymology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Substrate Specificity']",2011/02/01 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00894-011-0971-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Model. 2011 Oct;17(10):2693-705. doi: 10.1007/s00894-011-0971-1.

However, imatinib-resistant patients already harboring mutations have a higher likelihood of developing further mutations under the selective pressure of potent ABL TKIs. NVP-AUY922 (Novartis) is a novel 4,5-diaryloxazole adenosine triphosphate-binding site heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor, which has been shown to inhibit the chaperone function of HSP90 and deplete the levels of HSP90 client protein including BCR-ABL. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of AUY922 and nilotinib on random mutagenesis for BCR-ABL mutation (Blood, 109; 5011, 2007). Compared with single agents, combination with AUY922 and nilotinib was more effective at reducing the outgrowth of resistant cell clones. No outgrowth was observed in the presence of 2 muM of nilotinib and 20 nM of AUY922. The observed data from the isobologram indicated the synergistic effect of simultaneous exposure to AUY922 and nilotinib even in BaF3 cells expressing BCR-ABL mutants including T315I. In vivo studies also demonstrated that the combination of AUY922 and nilotinib prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with mixture of BaF3 cells expressing wild-type BCR-ABL and mutant forms. Taken together, this study shows that the combination of AUY922 and nilotinib exhibits a desirable therapeutic index that can reduce the in vivo growth of mutant forms of BCR-ABL-expressing cells.","['Tauchi, T', 'Okabe, S', 'Ashihara, E', 'Kimura, S', 'Maekawa, T', 'Ohyashiki, K']","['Tauchi T', 'Okabe S', 'Ashihara E', 'Kimura S', 'Maekawa T', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan. tauchi@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Isoxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Resorcinols/*pharmacology']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc20113 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.3 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Jun 16;30(24):2789-97. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.3.

During the years 2007 to 2008, assessment of MS was proposed to all adults included in the Leucemie de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent program, a French prospective multicentric cohort of leukemia survivors. Among 220 eligible patients, 184 (83.6%) had complete evaluation. Median age at evaluation and follow-up duration were 21.2 and 15.4 years. Overall prevalence of MS was 9.2% (95% confidence interval, 5.5-14.4). There was no association of MS with sex, age at diagnosis, leukemia subtype, steroid therapy, and central nervous system irradiation. Patients were stratified according to 4 therapeutic modalities: chemotherapy alone (n = 97), chemotherapy and central nervous system irradiation (n = 27), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) without (n = 17) or with (n = 43) total body irradiation (TBI). MS occurred in 5.2%, 11.1%, 5.9%, and 18.6% of them, respectively. The higher risk observed in the HSCT-TBI group was significant in univariate and in multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9, P = .03). HSCT with TBI was associated with a higher rate of hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 4.5, P = .004), low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR = 2.5, P = .02), and elevated fasting glucose (OR = 6.1, P = .04) So, TBI is a major risk factor for MS.

Because it is likely that an effective antitumor response will require high-avidity, PRAME-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we attempted to generate such CTLs using professional and artificial antigen-presenting cells loaded with a peptide library spanning the entire PRAME protein and consisting of 125 synthetic pentadecapeptides overlapping by 11 amino acids. We successfully generated polyclonal, PRAME-specific CTL lines and elicited high-avidity CTLs, with a high proportion of cells recognizing a previously uninvestigated HLA-A*02-restricted epitope, P435-9mer (NLTHVLYPV). These PRAME-CTLs could be generated both from normal donors and from subjects with PRAME(+) hematologic malignancies. The cytotoxic activity of our PRAME-specific CTLs was directed not only against leukemic blasts, but also against leukemic progenitor cells as assessed by colony-forming-inhibition assays, which have been implicated in leukemia relapse. These PRAME-directed CTLs did not affect normal hematopoietic progenitors, indicating that this approach may be of value for immunotherapy of PRAME(+) hematologic malignancies.","['Quintarelli, Concetta', 'Dotti, Gianpietro', 'Hasan, Sayyeda T', 'De Angelis, Biagio', 'Hoyos, Valentina', 'Errichiello, Santa', 'Mims, Martha', 'Luciano, Luigia', 'Shafer, Jessica', 'Leen, Ann M', 'Heslop, Helen E', 'Rooney, Cliona M', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Brenner, Malcolm K', 'Savoldo, Barbara']","['Quintarelli C', 'Dotti G', 'Hasan ST', 'De Angelis B', 'Hoyos V', 'Errichiello S', 'Mims M', 'Luciano L', 'Shafer J', 'Leen AM', 'Heslop HE', 'Rooney CM', 'Pane F', 'Brenner MK', 'Savoldo B']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Blood Donors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-A Antigens/metabolism', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/immunology', '*T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity/immunology/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*metabolism']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36500-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-300376 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Mar 24;117(12):3353-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-300376.

In our previous studies, we suggest that c-Jun might act as an adapter to regulate p21(WAF1/CIP1) (p21) expression in response to ATO. Therefore, how to regulate the c-Jun to bind to the p21 promoter was further elucidated. It has been reported that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) can phosphorylate the C-terminus (Ser243) of c-Jun to decrease its protein stability and DNA-binding ability and can also increase the degradation of p21 in resting condition or under ultraviolet irradiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that ATO-induced p21 expression might be through the inhibition of GSK-3beta. Using the DNA affinity precipitation assay, ATO could dephosphorylate the C-terminus (Ser243) of c-Jun to enhance its binding to the p21 promoter and resultant p21 expression. ATO, as well as LiCl (GSK-3beta inhibitor), could induce GSK-3beta(Ser9) phosphorylation and p21 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Constitutively active GSK-3beta, FlagGSKCA, and constitutively inactive GSK-3beta, FlagGSKCI, were constructed to further confirm the involvement of GSK-3beta in the ATO-induced p21 expression. However, the stability of p21 protein was increased by ATO, but not LiCl treatment using cycloheximide. Furthermore, ATO-induced GSK-3beta(Ser9) phosphorylation was through the ERK pathway, but not the PI3K/Akt pathway. We suggest that, taken together, ATO-induced ERK phosphorylation could inhibit GSK-3beta activity to dephosphorylate the C-terminus (Ser243) of c-Jun to increase p21 expression and resultant cell death.","['Huang, Huei-Sheng', 'Liu, Zi-Miao', 'Cheng, Ya-Ling']","['Huang HS', 'Liu ZM', 'Cheng YL']","['Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan. huanghs@mail.ncku.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/08/17 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['kfr023 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfr023 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2011 May;121(1):101-9. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfr023.

Clofarabine, a second-generation purine nucleoside analog, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2004 for the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia after at least two previous regimens. In addition, clinical studies have shown encouraging safety and efficacy results with clofarabine in the treatment of adult patients with various hematologic malignancies. Although most adult patients with leukemia receive the first course of clofarabine while hospitalized, many can be subsequently treated as outpatients with proper monitoring, support, and education. The most frequent side effects associated with clofarabine are gastrointestinal-related, myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, renal dysfunction, and anorexia. Careful patient monitoring is essential to ensure early identification and prompt intervention. Younger patients and those of any age with no comorbid health issues, good performance status, and an adequate support network are more likely to tolerate outpatient clofarabine administration. Early identification and proactive pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions may reduce the severity of these toxicities and prevent their progression.

Because mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an important signal integrator and a key translational regulator, we evaluated its potential involvement in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and whether mTOR blockade synergizes with chemotherapeutic agents or other signaling antagonists to inhibit primary leukemia T cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: mTOR signaling status was assessed using biochemical, immunostaining, and molecular regulation studies and functional assays performed to assess the impact of mTOR blockade on T-ALL proliferation, survival, and cell cycle. RESULTS: We observed that mTOR signaling is highly activated in all T-ALL patients tested, with phosphorylation of its downstream substrates eIF4G and S6 ribosomal protein. mTOR activation was detected in vivo and was further increased in vitro by stimulation with interleukin-7, a potentially leukemogenic cytokine normally produced by the bone marrow microenvironment. In T-ALL cells, mTOR blockade was associated with accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1), which preferentially adopted a nuclear localization. Functional studies using rapamycin or CCI-779 showed a dominant inhibitory effect of mTOR blockade on interleukin-7-induced proliferation, survival, and cell-cycle progression of T-ALL cells. Furthermore, mTOR blockade markedly potentiated the antileukemia effects of dexamethasone and doxorubicin, and showed highly synergistic interactions in combination with specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and Janus kinase 3 signaling. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows activation of mTOR signaling in primary T-ALL cells evolving in the leukemic bone marrow, and supports the inclusion of mTOR antagonists in current therapeutic regimens for this cancer.","['Batista, Ana', 'Barata, Joao T', 'Raderschall, Elke', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Carlesso, Nadia', 'Nadler, Lee M', 'Cardoso, Angelo A']","['Batista A', 'Barata JT', 'Raderschall E', 'Sallan SE', 'Carlesso N', 'Nadler LM', 'Cardoso AA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass., USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Janus Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Sirolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2010/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00013-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Apr;39(4):457-472.e3. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.01.005.

Our results suggest that resveratrol could inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of HL-60 cells through a GADD45alpha and annexin A1/caspase-3 pathway.","['Li, Guanwu', 'He, Shunhua', 'Chang, Lijun', 'Lu, Hong', 'Zhang, Hongwei', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Chiu, Jenfu']","['Li G', 'He S', 'Chang L', 'Lu H', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang H', 'Chiu J']","['Open Laboratory for Tumor Molecular Biology/Department of Biochemistry, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Phytomedicine,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,9438794,IM,"['Annexin A1/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2010/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0944-7113(10)00409-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phymed.2010.11.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Phytomedicine. 2011 Jun 15;18(8-9):704-9. doi: 10.1016/j.phymed.2010.11.015.

Published recent literature has reported only cases unresponsive to the usual treatment (steroids, transfusions, immunosuppressors and mechanical ventilation) as well as multiple secondary complications of these kinds of therapies. Recombinant activated factor VII (rF VIIa) is a new class of agent, which appears to be a successful adjunct therapy in the case of failure of conventional treatments. OBSERVATIONS: We describe two cases of alveolar haemorrhage treated with rF VIIa. The first patient had leukaemia and the second had ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis. Both were admitted to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation with persistent diffuse alveolar haemorrhage that responded only to a single dose of rF VIIa (90 mug/kg). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: rF VIIa is a promising treatment for diffuse, persistent alveolar haemorrhage, with only a small dose required to be effective. Future studies are needed in order to establish a clear protocol for the administration of this novel agent.","['Dabar, G', 'Harmouche, C', 'Jammal, M']","['Dabar G', 'Harmouche C', 'Jammal M']","['Service de Pneumologie et Reanimation Medicale, Hopital Hotel-Dieu de France, BP 16-6830, boulevard Alfred-Naccache, Achrafieh, Beyrouth, Liban. georges.dabar@hdf.usj.edu.lb']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Mal Respir,Revue des maladies respiratoires,8408032,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Factor VIIa/*therapeutic use', 'Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis/complications', 'Hemorrhage/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lung Diseases/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', '*Pulmonary Alveoli', 'Recombinant Proteins/*therapeutic use']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2009/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0761-8425(10)00557-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.rmr.2010.07.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Mal Respir. 2011 Jan;28(1):106-11. doi: 10.1016/j.rmr.2010.07.007.

Whenever possible, patients with Ph(+)ALL should undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after induction of remission. Although unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) has become a common treatment in adult patients who lack a sibling donor, data on the efficacy of CBT for Ph(+)ALL are limited. We analyzed the clinical outcomes of 20 Ph(+)ALL patients who underwent CBT (n = 8) or unrelated bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (n = 12). The median age was 41 years (range, 17-55 years). All but one of the patients were treated with an imatinib-based regimen before HSCT, and 19 patients were in first complete remission (CR) and 1 patient was in second CR at the time of HSCT. Seventeen patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen containing 12 Gy of total-body irradiation, and 3 received a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. After a median of 26 months of follow-up, estimated 3-year overall and leukemia-free survival rates were 100% and 85%, respectively, after CBT, and 49% and 38%, respectively, after unrelated BMT. The CBT group had significantly better overall survival than the BMT group (P = .02). Although BCR-ABL transcript was detected in 4 of 8 CBT patients at transplantation, 7 patients remained in molecular CR. Our findings suggest that CBT may be a viable option as postinduction therapy for Ph(+)ALL in patients lacking a sibling donor.","['Onishi, Yasushi', 'Sasaki, Osamu', 'Ichikawa, Satoshi', 'Inokura, Kyoko', 'Katsuoka, Yuna', 'Ohtsuka Ohba, Rie', 'Okitsu, Yoko', 'Kohata, Katsura', 'Ohguchi, Hiroto', 'Fukuhara, Noriko', 'Yokoyama, Hisayuki', 'Yamada, Minami Fujiwara', 'Yamamoto, Joji', 'Ishizawa, Kenichi', 'Kameoka, Junichi', 'Harigae, Hideo']","['Onishi Y', 'Sasaki O', 'Ichikawa S', 'Inokura K', 'Katsuoka Y', 'Ohtsuka Ohba R', 'Okitsu Y', 'Kohata K', 'Ohguchi H', 'Fukuhara N', 'Yokoyama H', 'Yamada MF', 'Yamamoto J', 'Ishizawa K', 'Kameoka J', 'Harigae H']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan. yonishi@med.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/pathology/*surgery', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2010/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00032-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.01.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Jul;17(7):1093-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.01.010.

SHP2 is also a bona fide oncogene; gain-of-function SHP2 mutations leading to increased phosphatase activity cause Noonan syndrome, as well as multiple forms of leukemia and solid tumors. We report that tautomycetin (TTN), an immunosuppressor in organ transplantation, and its engineered analog TTN D-1 are potent SHP2 inhibitors. TTN and TTN D-1 block T cell receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK activation and gain-of-function mutant SHP2-induced hematopoietic progenitor hyperproliferation and monocytic differentiation. Crystal structure of the SHP2TTN D-1 complex reveals that TTN D-1 occupies the SHP2 active site in a manner similar to that of a peptide substrate. Collectively, the data support the notion that SHP2 is a cellular target for TTN and provide a potential mechanism for the immunosuppressive activity of TTN.

STUDY DESIGN: A case series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Clinical and Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratories, University of California, Los Angeles, USA, from November 2007 to July 2008. METHODOLOGY: Analysis was made on 100 diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Cytogenetics and FISH technique were performed on blood or bone marrow samples. RESULTS: Nineteen out of 100 cases (19%) showed karyotype abnormalities; whereas 55 showed abnormalities using the CLL-specific FISH probes. The most frequent abnormality detected by standard cytogenetics was trisomy 12. The most common abnormality detected by FISH was a deletion of 13q14 (40 out of 55 cases; 72% of the abnormal). CONCLUSION: For prognostic grouping of CLL patients, FISH must always be requested which may even replace standard karyotyping. These chromosomal markers help in choosing the therapeutic options.","['Junaid, Ayesha', 'Rao, P Nagesh', 'Adil, Malik Muhammad']","['Junaid A', 'Rao PN', 'Adil MM']","['Department of Pathology, Shifa Inernational Hospital, Islamabad. ayesha_junaid497@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,9606447,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Trisomy']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/04/02 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['040579197 [pii]', '01.2011/JCPSP.1922 [doi]']",ppublish,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2011 Jan;21(1):19-22. doi: 01.2011/JCPSP.1922.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: Despite several previous studies on cancer and TB, no population-based investigation has been published. We performed a nationwide population-based study to investigate the incidence of active TB among cancer patients, and the cancer-type specific risk factors related to TB. DESIGNS: This nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study was based on data obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. A total of 16,487 cancer patients and 65,948 controls matched for age and sex were recruited. RESULTS: The incidence of TB per 100,000 person-years was 339 in the cancer patients and 202 in the controls, which gives a crude incidence rate ratio of 1.68 (95%CI 1.42-1.98). The hazard ratio (HR) was 1.67 (95%CI 1.42-1.96) after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidity. Cox regression showed that cancers of the aerodigestive tract, including oral, nasopharyngeal and oesophageal and lung cancer (HR 3.09, 95%CI 2.42-3.94) and haematological cancers, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukaemia (HR 3.22, 95%CI 1.98-5.22), were significant risk factors for TB. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients have a higher incidence of TB than controls.

A possible role of capsid in transportin-SR2-mediated nuclear import was recently suggested by the findings that a chimeric HIV virus, carrying the murine leukemia virus (MLV) capsid and matrix proteins, displayed a transportin-SR2 independent phenotype, and that the HIV-1 N74D capsid mutant proved insensitive to transportin-SR2 knockdown. RESULTS: Our present analysis of viral specificity reveals that TRN-SR2 is not used to the same extent by all lentiviruses. The DNA flap does not determine the TRN-SR2 requirement of HIV-1. We corroborate the TRN-SR2 independent phenotype of the chimeric HIV virus carrying the MLV capsid and matrix proteins. We reanalyzed the HIV-1 N74D capsid mutant in cells transiently or stably depleted of transportin-SR2 and confirm that the N74D capsid mutant is independent of TRN-SR2 when pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G). Remarkably, although somewhat less dependent on TRN-SR2 than wild type virus, the N74D capsid mutant carrying the wild type HIV-1 envelope required TRN-SR2 for efficient replication. By pseudotyping with envelopes that mediate pH-independent viral uptake including HIV-1, measles virus and amphotropic MLV envelopes, we demonstrate that HIV-1 N74D capsid mutant viruses retain partial dependency on TRN-SR2. However, this dependency on TRN-SR2 is lost when the HIV N74D capsid mutant is pseudotyped with envelopes mediating pH-dependent endocytosis, such as the VSV-G and Ebola virus envelopes. CONCLUSION: Here we discover a link between the viral entry of HIV and its interaction with TRN-SR2. Our data confirm the importance of TRN-SR2 in HIV-1 replication and argue for careful interpretation of experiments performed with VSV-G pseudotyped viruses in studies on early steps of HIV replication including the role of capsid therein.","['Thys, Wannes', 'De Houwer, Stephanie', 'Demeulemeester, Jonas', 'Taltynov, Oliver', 'Vancraenenbroeck, Renee', 'Gerard, Melanie', 'De Rijck, Jan', 'Gijsbers, Rik', 'Christ, Frauke', 'Debyser, Zeger']","['Thys W', 'De Houwer S', 'Demeulemeester J', 'Taltynov O', 'Vancraenenbroeck R', 'Gerard M', 'De Rijck J', 'Gijsbers R', 'Christ F', 'Debyser Z']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kapucijnenvoer 33, VCTB+5, B-3000 Leuven, Flanders, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Cell Line', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Virus Internalization', 'beta Karyopherins/*metabolism']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/04/30 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2010/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-8-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-8-7 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2011 Jan 30;8:7. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-8-7.,20110130,"['0 (beta Karyopherins)', '0 (transportin SR2)']",PMC3041740,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ectopic expression of Bmi-1 can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhance the motility and invasiveness of human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (NPECs), whereas silencing endogenous Bmi-1 expression can reverse EMT and reduce the metastatic potential of nasopharyngeal cancer cells (NPCs). Mouse xenograft studies indicate that coexpression of Bmi-1 and H-Ras in breast cancer cells can induce an aggressive and metastatic phenotype with an unusual occurrence of brain metastasis; although, Bmi-1 overexpression did not result in oncogenic transformation of MCF-10A cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of Bmi-1-mediated progression and the metastasis of breast cancer are not fully elucidated at this time. RESULTS: Bmi-1 expression is more pronouncedly increased in primary cancer tissues compared to matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues. High Bmi-1 expression is correlated with advanced clinicopathologic classifications (T, N, and M) and clinical stages. Furthermore, a high level of Bmi-1 indicates an unfavorable overall survival and serves as a high risk marker for breast cancer. In addition, inverse transcriptional expression levels of Bmi-1 and E-cadherin are detected between the primary cancer tissues and the matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Higher Bmi-1 levels are found in the cancer tissue, whereas the paired adjacent non-cancer tissue shows higher E-cadherin levels. Overexpression of Bmi-1 increases the motility and invasive properties of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells, which is concurrent with the increased expression of mesenchymal markers, the decreased expression of epithelial markers, the stabilization of Snail and the dysregulation of the Akt/GSK3beta pathway. Consistent with these observations, the repression of Bmi-1 in highly metastatic breast cancer cells remarkably reduces cellular motility, invasion and transformation, as well as tumorigenesis and lung metastases in nude mice. In addition, the repression of Bmi-1 reverses the expression of EMT markers and inhibits the Akt/GSK3beta/Snail pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Bmi-1 promotes the invasion and metastasis of human breast cancer and predicts poor survival.","['Guo, Bao-Hong', 'Feng, Yan', 'Zhang, Rong', 'Xu, Li-Hua', 'Li, Man-Zhi', 'Kung, Hsiang-Fu', 'Song, Li-Bing', 'Zeng, Mu-Sheng']","['Guo BH', 'Feng Y', 'Zhang R', 'Xu LH', 'Li MZ', 'Kung HF', 'Song LB', 'Zeng MS']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China and Department of Experimental Research, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Female', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/physiology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Tumor Burden', 'Up-Regulation']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/05/13 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-10-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-10-10 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2011 Jan 28;10(1):10. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-10-10.,20110128,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",PMC3038148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In rare cases of myeloid malignancies, the BCR-ABL1 fusion was reported to cooperate as class-I-mutation with class-II-mutations, but most cases had to be classified as blast phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). We identified five cases of Philadelphia positive subclones in AML occurring in coincidence with other genetic lesions: 1:220 patients with inv(16)/CBFB-MYH11 (0.5%), 2:272 AML cases with t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (0.7%), 1:1029 NPM1-mutated AML (0.1%), and one patient with s-AML following MDS with a 5q-deletion. Four patients had m-BCR (e1a2) BCR-ABL1 transcripts; one case only had an M-BCR (b3a2) breakpoint. These cases allow some interesting conclusions: The BCR-ABL1 rearrangement apparently can cooperate with the NPM1 mutation similar to other class-I-mutations. The identification of Philadelphia positive subclones in <1% of patients with CBF-leukaemias fits well with previous observations that most CBF-AML are accompanied by activating mutations in genes enhancing proliferation. Since we observed the occurrence of the Philadelphia positive subclones at diagnosis, at relapse, or throughout the disease, the time point of the emergence of Philadelphia subclones seems variable in AML.

However, many technical factors such as setting of the positivity threshold may significantly influence results.. Quantification using mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) may eliminate the subjective error which is inevitable in the isotype control method. The aim of the present project was therefore to assess the prognostic significance of ZAP-70 using three different methods. Between 2005 and 2010 we measured ZAP-70 expression in 157 patients with CLL (108 males, 49 females, median age 60 years [range, 31-82]; low/intermediate/high Rai risk in 41/48/11%). Expression of ZAP-70 was determined by flow cytometry using phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated monoclonal antibody, clone 1E7.2. Evaluation was performed by 1) percentage of positive cells compared to isotype control (cut-off 20%), 2) MFI ratio of T-cells/CLL cells (cut-off 3.0); 3) MFI ratio of ZAP-70/isotype control on CLL cells (cut-off 2.5). MFI method with T-cells/CLL cells ratio was the best in the identification of patients with unfavourable outcome: ZAP-70 positive patients had significantly shorter time to treatment (TTT, median 24 vs. 55 months, p=0.0001) and overall survival (OS, median 97 vs 174 months, p=0.0074). The differences in TTT a OS were not significant with the use of isotype percentage and MFI isotype methods. Combined analysis of ZAP-70 with CD38 expression or IgVH mutation status lead to identification of a subgroup with the longest TTT and OS (ZAP-70 and CD38 negative, p<0.0001 and p=0.012; ZAP-70 negative and mutated IgVH genes, p<0.0001 and p=0.0019). In conclusion, our results suggest that measurement of ZAP-70 expression in CLL by MFI using T-cells/CLL cells ratio might be the optimal method for accurate prediction of clinical course. Combined analysis of ZAP-70 with CD38 or IgVH mutation status further refined individual patient s prognosis.","['Smolej, L', 'Vroblova, V', 'Motyckova, M', 'Jankovicova, K', 'Schmitzova, D', 'Krejsek, J', 'Maly, J']","['Smolej L', 'Vroblova V', 'Motyckova M', 'Jankovicova K', 'Schmitzova D', 'Krejsek J', 'Maly J']","['Charles University in Prague, School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. smolej@fnhk.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*analysis']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2011_02_140 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2011;58(2):140-5. doi: 10.4149/neo_2011_02_140.,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most MDS patients eventually require transfusion of red blood cells for anaemia, placing them at risk of transfusional iron overload. In beta-thalassaemia major, transfusional iron overload leads to organ dysfunction and death; however, with iron chelation therapy, organ function is improved, and survival improved to near normal and correlated with the degree of compliance with chelation. In lower-risk MDS, several nonrandomized studies suggest an adverse effect of iron overload on survival and that lowering iron with chelation may minimize this impact. Emerging data indicate that chelation may improve organ function, particularly hepatic function, and a minority of patients may have improvement in cell counts and decreased transfusion requirements. While guidelines for MDS generally recommend chelation in selected lower-risk patients, data from nonrandomized trials suggest iron overload may impact adversely on the outcome of higher-risk MDS and stem cell transplantation (SCT). This effect may be due to increased transplant-related mortality, infection and AML progression, and preliminary data suggest that lowering iron may be beneficial in this patient group. Other areas of active and future investigation include optimizing the monitoring of iron overload using imaging such as T2* MRI and measures of labile iron and oxidative stress; correlating new methods of measuring iron to clinical outcomes; clarifying the contribution of different cellular and extracellular iron pools to iron toxicity; optimizing chelation by using agents that access the appropriate iron pools to minimize the relevant clinical consequences in individual patients; and incorporating measures of quality of life and co-morbidities into clinical trials of chelation in MDS. It should be noted that chelation is costly and potentially toxic, and in MDS should be initiated after weighing potential risks and benefits for each patient until more definitive data are available. In this review, data on the impact of iron overload in MDS and SCT are discussed; for example, several noncontrolled studies show inferior survival in patients with iron overload in these clinical settings, including an increase in transplant-related mortality and infection risk. Possible mechanisms of iron toxicity include oxidative stress, which can damage cellular components, and the documented impact of lowering iron on organ function with measures such as iron chelation therapy includes an improvement in elevated liver transaminases. Lowering iron also appears to improve survival in both lower-risk MDS and SCT in nonrandomized studies. Selected aspects of iron metabolism, transport, storage and distribution that may be amenable to future intervention and improved removal of iron from important cellular sites are discussed, as are attempts to quantify quality of life and the importance of co-morbidities in measures to treat MDS, including chelation therapy.","['Leitch, Heather A']",['Leitch HA'],"[""Division of Hematology, St Paul's Hospital and the University of British Columbia, 440-1144 Burrard Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada. hleitch@providencehematology.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Chelation Therapy/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Iron/*adverse effects/analysis/metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Iron Overload/*diagnosis/*mortality', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/epidemiology/mortality', 'Quality of Life', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transfusion Reaction']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/05/12 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['3 [pii]', '10.2165/11585280-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2011 Jan 22;71(2):155-77. doi: 10.2165/11585280-000000000-00000.,,"['0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, mouse cells lacking poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 are much more sensitive to C-1305 than their normal counterparts. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that the functional status of p53 in tumour cells might have an impact on the efficiency of C-1305 in experiments with both p53-deficient human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and human MCF-7 breast cancer cells harboring a functional p53 pathway. Exposure of both cancer cell lines to C-1305 reduced the number of viable cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Remarkably, however, HL-60 cells were much more strongly affected than MCF-7 cells. Measurements of DNA concentrations in single cells revealed that C-1305 arrested the tested cancer cells at the G/M transition. Analysis of the cell cycle and apoptosis regulators revealed that C-1305 strongly elevated phosphorylation of CDK1 at the inhibitory sites (Thr14/Tyr15) in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, C-1305 increased phosphorylation of pRb protein and CDK2 at Thr160 in HL60 cells, but not in MCF-7 cells. These observations suggest that C-1305 abrogates the restriction checkpoint and promotes G1/S transition in cells lacking functional p53.","['Maurer, Margarita', 'Komina, Oxana', 'Skladanowski, Andrzej', 'Wesierska-Gadek, Jozefa']","['Maurer M', 'Komina O', 'Skladanowski A', 'Wesierska-Gadek J']","['Cell Cycle Regulation Group, Institute of Cancer Research, Dept. of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Ther Oncol,Journal of experimental therapeutics & oncology,9604933,IM,"['Acridines/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Female', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/03/18 06:00,['2011/02/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Exp Ther Oncol. 2011;9(1):5-15.,,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (C 1305)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Empirical antibiotic regimes are based on the epidemiological characteristics of bacterial isolates globally and locally. METHOD: This study retrospectively reviewed all cases of febrile neutropaenia in patients with confirmed cancer admitted at the University Hospital of the West Indies in the four-year period between, January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2006 and who received chemotherapy. Cases were identified from blood culture records and hospital charts which were reviewed to determine the aetiological agents causing bacteraemia, their antimicrobial susceptibilities and clinicalfeatures. These cases were compared with non-neutropaenic cancer patients admitted with fever. RESULTS: A total of 197 febrile episodes in cancer patients were reviewed. Thirty-seven per cent had febrile neutropaenia while 62% were non-neutropaenic. Acute myeloid leukaemia was the most common haematological malignancy and the most common solid tumour was breast cancer. Twenty-six per cent of patients had a positive blood culture. In febrile neutropaenic patients, Escherichia coli was the most common organism isolated followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci while in non-neutropaenic patients, coagulase-negative staphylococci was most common. Acinetobacter infections was prominent in non-neutropaenic patients but absent in neutropaenic patients. More than one organism was cultured in 9 neutropaenic and 18 non-neutropaenic patients. Mortality was 10.8% in neutropaenic and 24.4% in non-neutropaenic patients. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative organisms are the predominant isolates in febrile neutropaenic episodes in this cohort of patients. Non-neutropaenic patients had an increased mortality with an increase in Acinetobacter infections and multiple isolates.","['Walwyn, M', 'Nicholson, A', 'Lee, M G', 'Wharfe, G', 'Frankson, M A']","['Walwyn M', 'Nicholson A', 'Lee MG', 'Wharfe G', 'Frankson MA']","['Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, The University of the West Indies, Kingston 7, Jamaica, West Indies.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Jamaica,West Indian Med J,The West Indian medical journal,0417410,IM,"['Acinetobacter Infections/epidemiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Escherichia coli Infections/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neutropenia/*etiology/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2011/02/01 06:00,2011/02/18 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['1200 [pii]'],ppublish,West Indian Med J. 2010 Mar;59(2):209-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with UDCA and atRA substantially improved animal growth rates, significantly reduced liver fibrosis and bile duct proliferation, and nearly eliminated liver necrosis after BDL. Reductions in the bile salt pool size and liver hydroxyproline content were also seen with treatment with atRA or atRA and UDCA versus PBS and UDCA. Furthermore, atRA and UDCA significantly reduced liver messenger RNA and/or protein expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (Tgf-beta1), collagen 1a1 (Col1A1), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2), cytokeratin 19, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), cytochrome P450 7A1 (Cyp7a1), tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-beta1. The molecular mechanisms of this treatment were also assessed in human hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and LX-2 cells. atRA alone or in combination with UDCA greatly repressed CYP7A1 expression in human hepatocytes and significantly inhibited COL1A1, MMP2, and alpha-SMA expression and/or activity in primary human hepatic stellate cells and LX-2 cells. Furthermore, atRA reduced TGF-beta1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in LX-2 cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the addition of RA to UDCA reduces the bile salt pool size and liver fibrosis and might be an effective supplemental therapy with UDCA for cholestatic diseases.","['He, Hongwei', 'Mennone, Albert', 'Boyer, James L', 'Cai, Shi-Ying']","['He H', 'Mennone A', 'Boyer JL', 'Cai SY']","['Yale Liver Center, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,IM,"['Animals', 'Bile Acids and Salts/metabolism', 'Bile Ducts/surgery', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholestasis, Intrahepatic/metabolism/*pathology/*prevention & control', 'Cholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylase/metabolism', 'Collagen Type I/metabolism', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hepatocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Ligation', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Smad2 Protein/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/03/19 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.24047 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2011 Feb;53(2):548-57. doi: 10.1002/hep.24047.

Together with beneficial responses observed in assays targeted at leukemia-associated antigens (LAA), this encouraged research on cancer vaccines and adoptive cellular therapies in AML. The receptor for hyaluronic acid-mediated motility (RHAMM, CD168) was identified as one of the most promising LAA in AML. Thus far, little is known about in situ expression in leukemic bone marrow blasts or the prognostic role of RHAMM and its interaction partners in AML. We immunohistochemically analyzed the expression and prognostic significance of RHAMM on trephine bone marrow biopsies from 71 AML cases that had been evaluated for cytogenetics and presence of FLT3-internal tandem duplications and NPM1 mutations. Fifty-five patients (77%) were treated with curative intent, while 16 (23%) received the most appropriate supportive care. Twenty of 71 (28%) AML cases were considered RHAMM+. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed significant discriminatory power considering overall survival (OS) in AML patients treated curatively for RHAMM (p = 0.015). Multivariable analysis revealed that expression of RHAMM in >5% of leukemic blasts identifies a subgroup of curatively treated cases with adverse OS independent of failures to achieve complete remission. RHAMM not only represents a promising LAA with specific T-cell responses in AML but, if assessed in situ on blasts, also a probable prognostic factor.","['Tzankov, Alexandar', 'Strasser, Ulrich', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan', 'Menter, Thomas', 'Arber, Caroline', 'Jotterand, Martine', 'Rovo, Alicia', 'Tichelli, Andre', 'Stauder, Reinhard', 'Gunthert, Ursula']","['Tzankov A', 'Strasser U', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Menter T', 'Arber C', 'Jotterand M', 'Rovo A', 'Tichelli A', 'Stauder R', 'Gunthert U']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. atzankov@uhbs.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/10/06 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2010/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1159-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Aug;90(8):901-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1159-6.

Furthermore, participation in research by AYAs is typically low. We conducted a study to examine the feasibility of recruiting a population-based sample of AYA survivors to examine issues of treatment and health outcomes. METHODS: Individuals diagnosed in 2007-08 and age 15-39 at the time of diagnosis with acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, germ cell cancer or sarcoma were identified by 7 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) cancer registries, mailed surveys within 14 months after diagnosis and again a year later, and had medical records reviewed. RESULTS: 525 (43%) of the eligible patients responded, 39% refused and 17% were lost to follow-up. Extensive efforts were required for most potential respondents (87%). 76% of respondents completed the paper rather than online survey version. In a multivariate model, age, cancer site, education and months from diagnosis to the first mailing of the survey were not associated with participation, although males (p < 0.01), Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks (p < 0.001) were less likely to participate. 91% of survivors completing the initial survey completed the subsequent survey. DISCUSSION: Despite the response rate, those who participated adequately reflected the population of AYA cancer survivors. The study demonstrates that cancer registries are valuable foundations for conducting observational, longitudinal population-based research on AYA cancer survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Achieving a reasonable response rate in this population is possible, but requires extensive resources.","['Harlan, Linda C', 'Lynch, Charles F', 'Keegan, Theresa H M', 'Hamilton, Ann S', 'Wu, Xiao-Cheng', 'Kato, Ikuko', 'West, Michele M', 'Cress, Rosemary D', 'Schwartz, Stephen M', 'Smith, Ashley W', 'Deapen, Dennis', 'Stringer, Sonja M', 'Potosky, Arnold L']","['Harlan LC', 'Lynch CF', 'Keegan TH', 'Hamilton AS', 'Wu XC', 'Kato I', 'West MM', 'Cress RD', 'Schwartz SM', 'Smith AW', 'Deapen D', 'Stringer SM', 'Potosky AL']","['National Cancer Institute, 6130 Executive Blvd, MSC 7344, Bethesda, MD 20892-7344, USA. lh50w@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data Collection/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/rehabilitation', 'Patient Participation', '*Patient Selection', 'Psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'SEER Program', '*Survivors/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/12/16 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2010/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-011-0173-y [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2011 Sep;5(3):305-14. doi: 10.1007/s11764-011-0173-y.

The availability of BAC clones has become a valuable tool for identifying cancer genes. We report here our experience in identifying genes located at breakpoints of chromosomal rearrangements and in defining the size and boundaries of deletions in hematological diseases. The methodology used in our laboratory consists of a three-step approach using conventional cytogenetics followed by FISH with commercial probes, then BAC clones. One limitation to the BAC system is that it can only accommodate inserts of up to 300 kb. As a consequence, analyzing the extent of deletions requires a large amount of material. Array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) using a BAC/PAC system can be an alternative. However, this technique has limitations also, and it cannot be used to identify candidate genes at breakpoints of chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations, insertions, and inversions.","['De Braekeleer, Etienne', 'Douet-Guilbert, Nathalie', 'Basinko, Audrey', 'Morel, Frederic', 'Le Bris, Marie-Josee', 'Ferec, Claude', 'De Braekeleer, Marc']","['De Braekeleer E', 'Douet-Guilbert N', 'Basinko A', 'Morel F', 'Le Bris MJ', 'Ferec C', 'De Braekeleer M']","['Faculte de Medecine et des Sciences de la Sante, Universite de Brest, 22, Avenue Camille Desmoulins, CS 93837, F-29238 Brest Cedex 3, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Biomed Biotechnol,Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology,101135740,IM,"['Biomedical Research', '*Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'France', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/06/01 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2010/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/329471 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Biotechnol. 2011;2011:329471. doi: 10.1155/2011/329471.

To advance the biological understanding and to find molecular prognostic markers, we performed a high-resolution oligonucleotide array study of 107 MDS patients (French American British) with a normal karyotype and clinical follow-up through the Duesseldorf MDS registry. Recurrent hidden deletions overlapping with known cytogenetic aberrations or sites of known tumor-associated genes were identified in 4q24 (TET2, 2x), 5q31.2 (2x), 7q22.1 (3x) and 21q22.12 (RUNX1, 2x). One patient with a 7q22.1 deletion had an additional 5q31.2 deletion of the acute myeloid leukemia/MDS region, the smallest deletion identified so far and including the putative tumor suppressor (ts) genes, EGR1 and CTNNA1. One TET2 deletion was homozygous and one heterozygous, with a missense mutation in the remaining allele, further supporting its role as a ts gene. Besides these recurrent alterations, additional individual imbalances were found in 34 cases; in total, 42/107 (39%) cases had genomic imbalances. These patients had an inferior survival as compared with the rest of the patients (P=0.002).

We investigated whether CD200 overexpression on AML cells could specifically compromise patient natural killer (NK) cell anti-tumor responses. We found that CD200(hi) patients showed a 50% reduction in the frequency of activated NK cells (CD56(dim)CD16(+)) compared with CD200(lo) patients. Additionally, NK receptor expression (NKp44 and NKp46) on these cells was also significantly downregulated in CD200(hi) patients. To assess whether NK cell activity was directly influenced by CD200 expression, we examined the effect of ectopic expression of CD200. These assays revealed that both NK cell cytolytic activity and interferon-gamma response were significantly reduced toward CD200(+) leukemic targets and that these targets showed increased survival compared with CD200(-) cells. Similarly, NK cells isolated from AML patients were less functionally active toward CD200(hi) autologous blasts from both cytolytic and immunoregulatory perspectives. Finally, blocking CD200 alone was sufficient to recover a significant proportion of NK cell cytolytic activity. Together, these findings provide the first evidence that CD200 has a direct and significant suppressive influence on NK cell activity in AML patients and may contribute to the increased relapse rate in CD200(+) patients.","['Coles, S J', 'Wang, E C Y', 'Man, S', 'Hills, R K', 'Burnett, A K', 'Tonks, A', 'Darley, R L']","['Coles SJ', 'Wang EC', 'Man S', 'Hills RK', 'Burnett AK', 'Tonks A', 'Darley RL']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Haematology and Pathology, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Blast Crisis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/08/10 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20111 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 May;25(5):792-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.1.

It is a chronic clonal myeloproliferative disorder, originating in a pluripotent stem cell common to all three hematopoietic lineages, characterized by overproduction of myeloid cells in all stages of maturation. Approval of the use of imatinib in the United States in 2001 and its introduction in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia changed the evolution and prognosis of the disease and began the era of molecular therapy for malignancies. Imatinib is highly effective and causes fewer adverse reactions than earlier treatments based on interferon and hydroxyurea. In Cuba, chronic myeloid leukemia has been treated with interferon since 1998. Starting in 2003, imatinib was gradually introduced for use in newly-diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia patients. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the use of imatinib as first-line therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia in a group of Cuban patients, based on hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response; overall and event-free survival rates; and most frequency and severity of adverse reactions. METHODS: During May 2003 to May 2008, 33 newly-diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia patients (25 adults, 8 children; <6 months from diagnosis) received a single daily oral dose of imatinib 400 mg from the time of study enrollment. Variables used: (1) to evaluate treatment efficacy: hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response; overall and event-free survival; and (2) to evaluate safety: presence of adverse reactions leading to definitive interruption of treatment or death. RESULTS: Complete hematologic response occurred in 100% of patients, major cytogenetic response in 90.9%, and complete cytogenetic response in 48.5%. Molecular response occurred in 36.4% of patients. With a mean follow-up of 39 months, overall survival was 96% and estimated five-year event-free survival was 85%. No adverse reactions occurred in 39.5% of patients. Adverse reactions most frequently observed were myelosuppression (24.2%) and digestive disorders (21.2%). These were followed, in decreasing order, by edema, primarily orbital (9.1%), skin depigmentation (3%), and cardiac arrhythmias (3%). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, imatinib was effective first-line therapy for patients with newly-diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia, as determined by overall and event-free survival rates. No severe adverse reactions were observed.","['Moran, Valia Pavon', 'Baute, Rafael Gomez', 'Facundo, Juan C Jaime', 'Ramirez, Porfirio Hernandez', 'Nunez, Alberto Arencibia', 'Martinez, Edgardo Espinosa', 'Cabrera, Onel M Avila', 'Padron, Carlos Hernandez', 'Otero, Alejandro Gonzalez', 'Uria, Jose Carnot', 'Estrada, Edgardo Espinosa', 'Diaz, Rosa M Lam', 'Virgil, Ana M Amor', 'Sanchez, Kalia Lavauth', 'Cabeza, Annia Hernandez']","['Moran VP', 'Baute RG', 'Facundo JC', 'Ramirez PH', 'Nunez AA', 'Martinez EE', 'Cabrera OM', 'Padron CH', 'Otero AG', 'Uria JC', 'Estrada EE', 'Diaz RM', 'Virgil AM', 'Sanchez KL', 'Cabeza AH']","['Hematology and Immunology Institute, Havana, Cuba. valia.pavon@infomed.sld.cu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,MEDICC Rev,MEDICC review,100964771,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Cuba', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/04/13 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.37757/MR2011V13.N1.9 [doi]'],ppublish,MEDICC Rev. 2011 Jan;13(1):35-40. doi: 10.37757/MR2011V13.N1.9.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anticancer and antimetastatic activities of renieramycin M were investigated in human non-small cell lung cancer cells. RESULTS: Renieramycin M treatment caused p53 activation, which subsequently down-regulated anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BCL-2 proteins, while the level of pro-apoptotic BAX protein was not altered. The subtoxic concentrations of renieramycin M significantly decreased invasion and migration abilities of cancer cells. In addition, this compound showed a strong inhibitory effect on anchorage-independent growth of the cells. CONCLUSION: These results reveal that renieramycin M induced lung cancer cells apoptosis through p53-dependent pathway and the compound may inhibit progression and metastasis of lung cancer cells.","['Halim, Hasseri', 'Chunhacha, Preedakorn', 'Suwanborirux, Khanit', 'Chanvorachote, Pithi']","['Halim H', 'Chunhacha P', 'Suwanborirux K', 'Chanvorachote P']","['Pharmaceutical Technology (International) Program, Organisms and Endophytic Fungi (BNPME), Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University, Pathumwan, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anoikis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Porifera/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Wound Healing/drug effects']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/03/18 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['31/1/193 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2011 Jan;31(1):193-201.,,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (renieramycin M)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed/refractory AML and older patients for whom there was a concern over toxicity from additional anthracyclines received 5 days of clofarabine, 40 mg/m(2) per day i.v. over 1 hour, followed 4 hours later by Ara-C, 1,000 mg/m(2) per day i.v. over 2 hours. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled. The median age was 67 years (range, 38-82 years) and 18 (60%) had received at least one prior therapy. Eleven (37%) patients had a history of cardiovascular disease and were considered to be at high risk for anthracycline toxicity. High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 14 (47%) patients. The overall response rate (complete remission [CR] plus partial remission) was 53%, including a CR in 14 patients (47%). Responses were observed in all cytogenetic risk groups and in patients who had received up to five prior therapies. The median disease-free survival interval was 9.5 months. The 30-day mortality rate was 20% (de novo AML, 8%; relapsed/refractory AML, 28%). Of the 14 patients achieving a CR, half were able to proceed to curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

From a histopathological point of view, blasts may be encountered in tissue biopsy and/or bone marrow (BM). In tissue sections, LBL is generally characterized by a diffuse or, as in lymph nodes and less commonly, paracortical pattern. Although histological features are usually sufficient to distinguish lymphoblastic from mature B- or T-cell neoplasms, a differential diagnosis with blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma or myeloid leukemia may arise in some cases. Of greater importance is the characterization of immunophenotype by flow cytometry. In B-LBL, tumour cells are virtually always positive for B cell markers CD19, CD79a and CD22. They are positive for CD10, CD 24, PAX5, and TdT in most cases, while the expression of CD20 and the lineage independent stem cell antigen CD34 is variable and CD45 may be absent. Surface immunoglobulin is usually absent. In T-LBL, neoplastic cells are usually TdT positive and variably express CD1a, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7 and CD8. The only reliable lineage-specific is surface CD3. Most B-LBL have clonal rearrangements of the Ig heavy chain or less frequently of light chain genes. T-cell receptor gamma or beta chain gene rearrangements may be seen in a significant number of cases, but rearrangements are not helpful for lineage assignment. LBL occurs more commonly in children than in adults, mostly in males. Although 80% of precursor B-cell neoplasms present as acute leukemias, with BM and peripheral blood (PB) involvement, a small proportion present with a mass lesion and have <25% blasts in the BM. Unlike precursor T-LBL, mediastinal masses and involvement of BM are rare, but lymph nodes and extranodal sites are more frequently involved. T-LBL patients, compared to those with B-LBL, show younger age, a higher rate of mediastinal tumours or BM involvement. Patients are usually males in their teens to twenties and present with lymphadenopathy in cervical, supraclavicular and axillary regions, or with a mediastinal mass. In most patients the mediastinal mass is anterior, bulky, and associated with pleural effusions, superior vena cava syndrome, tracheal obstruction, and pericardial effusions. They frequently present with advanced disease, B symptoms and elevated serum LDH levels. Abdominal involvement (liver and spleen) is unusual. LBL is highly aggressive, but frequently curable with current therapy. The prognosis in all age groups has dramatically improved with the use of intensive ALL-type chemotherapy regimes, with a disease-free survival of 73-90% in children and 45-72% in adults. Intensive intrathecal chemotherapy prophylaxis is required to reduce the CNS relapse incidence, while the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation is unclear. Consolidation mediastinal irradiation may decrease mediastinal relapse. Patients with adverse prognostic features should be considered for high-dose chemotherapy and SCT. Autologous SCT has been shown to produce similar good results as chemotherapy alone, and allogeneic SCT is likely to be a more appropriate option for patients who are beyond first remission or with more advanced disease.","['Cortelazzo, Sergio', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Ferreri, Andres J M', 'Hoelzer, Dieter']","['Cortelazzo S', 'Ponzoni M', 'Ferreri AJ', 'Hoelzer D']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera, Bolzano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S1040-8428(10)00283-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2010.12.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2011 Sep;79(3):330-43. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2010.12.003.

Mutations leading to constitutively active FLT3, including internal tandem duplications of the juxtamembrane domain (ITD), result in continuous cellular proliferation, resistance to apoptotic cell death, and a poorer prognosis. A better understanding of the molecular consequences of FLT3 activation would allow improved therapeutic strategies in these patients. Canine lymphoproliferative diseases, including lymphoma and acute leukemias, share evolutionarily conserved chromosomal aberrations and exhibit conserved mutations within key oncogenes when compared to their human counterparts. A small percentage of canine acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALL) also exhibit FLT3 ITD mutations. METHODS: We molecularly characterized FLT3 mutations in two dogs and one cell line, by DNA sequencing, gene expression analysis via quantitative real-time PCR, and sensitivity to the FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib via in vitro proliferation assays. FLT 3 and downstream mediators of FLT3 activation were assessed by Western blotting. RESULTS: The canine B-cell leukemia cell line, GL-1, and neoplastic cells from 2/7 dogs diagnosed cytologically with ALL were found to have FLT3 ITD mutations and FLT3 mRNA up-regulation. Lestaurtinib, a small molecule FLT3 inhibitor, significantly inhibited the growth of GL-1 cells, while not affecting the growth of two other canine lymphoid cell lines without the FLT3 mutation. Finally, western blots were used to confirm the conserved downstream mediators of FLT3 activating mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ALL and FLT3 biology is conserved between canine and human patients, supporting the notion that canine ALL, in conjunction with the GL-1 cell line, will be useful in the development of a relevant large animal model to aid in the study of human FLT3 mutant leukemias.","['Suter, Steven E', 'Small, George W', 'Seiser, Eric L', 'Thomas, Rachael', 'Breen, Matthew', 'Richards, Kristy L']","['Suter SE', 'Small GW', 'Seiser EL', 'Thomas R', 'Breen M', 'Richards KL']","['Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Furans', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/05/25 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2010/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-38 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-38 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Jan 27;11:38. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-38.,20110127,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",PMC3040160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the characteristics and frequency of the IgH deletion identified by interphase FISH were investigated in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: The study group included 29 patients with MM and eight patients with CLL. Interphase FISH was performed with the IgH dual color, break-apart rearrangement probe and the IgH/CCND1 dual color, dual fusion translocation probe. RESULTS: The IgH deletion was found in 14% (4/29) of patients with MM and 13% (1/8) of the patients with CLL. Four patients had deletions of the whole or variable region of IgH on the native chromosome 14, whereas one patient had a deletion of the IgH variable region on a der(11)t(11;14). In two patients, the IgH break-apart FISH showed both patterns with and without IgH deletions. In cases showing the same pattern by IgH break-apart FISH, the IgH/CCND1 FISH showed different patterns, and vice versa. CONCLUSION: A variety of patterns of the IgH deletion were identified by interphase FISH using IgH break-apart and IgH/CCND1 probes in patients with MM and CLL. The results of this study suggest that the integrated information obtained with IgH break-apart and IgH/CCND1 FISH was needed to interpret FISH results unambiguously.","['Hwang, Y', 'Lee, J Y', 'Mun, Y C', 'Seong, C M', 'Chung, W S', 'Huh, J']","['Hwang Y', 'Lee JY', 'Mun YC', 'Seong CM', 'Chung WS', 'Huh J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/07/30 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01290.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2011 Jun;33(3):299-304. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01290.x.

We measured the plasma ALA of uremic patients and examined the ALA-induced iron release from human ferritin. The participants consisted of 30 hemodialysis patients and 14 healthy subjects. Plasma malondialdehyde was measured as a surrogate marker of lipid peroxidation. The plasma exchange effluent from two patients who had undergone plasma exchange (for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and acute myeloblastic leukemia) was collected and treated to obtain the human ferritin-rich fraction. Iron release from ferritin was examined using bathophenanthroline sulfate. The influence of antioxidants and different pH levels on iron release were investigated. Plasma ALA and malondialdehyde concentration in the hemodialysis patient was significantly higher than that in healthy subjects. ALA was positively correlated with malondialdehyde. The abundance of iron release was dependent on the ALA concentration and incubation time. Iron release at the high pH of 7.6 was decreased compared with that at pH 7.4. Citrate increased iron release at pH 7.4, but citrate-stimulated iron release was totally abolished at pH 7.6. Our study suggests that ALA accumulation may have a role to play in certain complications in uremic patients, such as oxidative stress, by releasing iron from ferritin.","['Hasuike, Yukiko', 'Nonoguchi, Hiroshi', 'Tokuyama, Masanori', 'Hata, Reiko', 'Kitamura, Rie', 'Hori, Kahori', 'Nanami, Masayoshi', 'Otaki, Yoshinaga', 'Kuragano, Takahiro', 'Nakanishi, Takeshi']","['Hasuike Y', 'Nonoguchi H', 'Tokuyama M', 'Hata R', 'Kitamura R', 'Hori K', 'Nanami M', 'Otaki Y', 'Kuragano T', 'Nakanishi T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Kidney and Dialysis, Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan. cherry39@hyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Ther Apher Dial,"Therapeutic apheresis and dialysis : official peer-reviewed journal of the International Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy",101181252,IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/*blood', 'Antioxidants', 'Female', 'Ferritins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/blood/*metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Uremia']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/07/08 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1744-9987.2010.00824.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Apher Dial. 2011 Feb;15(1):28-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1744-9987.2010.00824.x.,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2010 The Authors.

AIMS: To describe underlying malignant conditions, potential aetiologies, clinical outcomes and healthcare utilization for an Australian population with FN, and to estimate the economic burden of this condition within the Australian healthcare sector. METHODS: Epidemiological features of FN were extracted from a population-based hospital morbidity dataset, the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset (VAED), for a 12-month period (2008). These were analysed according for a range of malignancy categories. Economic burden of hospitalizations was estimated according to data presented in the Round 12 National Hospital Cost Data Collection Report. RESULTS: A total of 2599 admitted episodes across 92 Victorian hospitals fulfilled inclusion criteria for FN. Metropolitan hospitalizations accounted for 79% episodes. FN illness comprised underlying solid tumours diagnoses (40%), followed by leukaemia (29.3%), lymphoma (22%) and myeloma (8.5%). Length of hospital stay was >15 days for approximately one-third of hospitalizations. intensive care unit admission rates were 5.9-11.7%. Weighted average costs of hospitalization (AUD) for solid tumours, lymphoma, myeloma and leukaemia were $8309 +/- $391, 18,145 +/- $1602, $21,764 +/- $1289 and $22,596 +/- $2618 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using VAED indices, epidemiological features of Australian patients with FN appear comparable with international reports. In contrast to US data, estimated healthcare costs are up to 50% lower in the Australian healthcare sector. These data offer important insights for prioritizing of research agendas and resource allocation.","['Lingaratnam, S', 'Thursky, K A', 'Slavin, M A', 'Kirsa, S W', 'Bennett, C A', 'Worth, L J']","['Lingaratnam S', 'Thursky KA', 'Slavin MA', 'Kirsa SW', 'Bennett CA', 'Worth LJ']","['Pharmacy Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Off-target kinase inhibition has been implicated in the appearance of unique adverse effects, such as colitis and pleural effusions. In addition, some patients present oligoclonal expansions of large granular lymphocytes (LGLs). We sought to further investigate this phenomenon in 64 patients treated with five different TKIs. Clonal expansions of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were identified in all TKI-treated patient groups, but only in dasatinib-treated patients were these expansions characterized as LGLs. Survival factors known to be important in LGL leukemia (interleukin-15 [IL-15] transpresentation, plasma platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF]-BB levels, nuclear factor-kappaB [NF-kappaB] and T-bet activation) were found to be associated with TKI-induced LGL expansions.

Protein kinase Cbeta (PKCbeta) is under active consideration as a rational therapeutic target in several B-cell malignancies, but studies of its possible utility in B-ALL are lacking. Expression of PKCbeta1 and PKCbeta2 isoforms was demonstrated in five B-ALL cell lines characterized by distinctive chromosomal translocations, and sensitivity to PKCbeta-selective inhibition was examined. Inhibitor treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in viability in all cell lines, although pro-B ALL with t(4;11)(q21;q23) was most sensitive. Apoptotic induction was evident after 24-48 h of treatment, and an inhibition of cell cycle progression was detected in one cell line. Treatment resulted in a rapid induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, indicating caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, and a rapid reduction in phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream target glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta).

Treatment and prognosis of these diseases are controversial, and data on children are limited. According to the literature, one of these distinct leukemias may be myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia (MNKPL), with the blasts being cytochemically myeloperoxidase negative (MPO(-)) and phenotypically CD56(+)CD3(-)CD7(+)CD34(+) and myeloid antigens(+). The other may be myeloid/NK cell acute leukemia (MNKL), in which the blasts were cytochemically MPO(dim) and phenotypically CD56(+)CD16(-)CD3(-)CD33(+)HLA-DR(-). Between 2005 and 2008, 4 MNKPL and 1 MNKL children aged 1.3 to 12.5 years were encountered in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. In those with MNKPL, remarkable extramedullary involvement usually occurring in adults was not observed; however, myelofibrosis was found in 2 children. The child with MNKL abandoned treatment. Those with MNKPL were treated with a protocol designed for childhood high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) containing cytarabine, mitoxantrone, etoposide, l-asparaginase, and methotrexate according to the myeloid and lymphoid characteristics of MNKPL. They responded slowly to chemotherapy and were in complete remission (CR) for 26 to 63 months, except 1 who died in CR from pneumonia. They had longer survival and seemed to have a better outcome than those reported previously. In conclusion, childhood leukemias with immature NK cell markers may have different characteristics from their adult counterparts. A protocol including agents used for acute myeloid leukemia combined with those for ALL is seemingly effective for treatment of MNKPL. However, a modified treatment strategy designed more specifically for MNKPL and longer observations are needed.","['Guan, Xiao-Qing', 'Xu, Ling', 'Ke, Zhi-Yong', 'Huang, Li-Bin', 'Zhang, Xiao-Li', 'Zhang, Ying-Chuan', 'Luo, Xue-Qun']","['Guan XQ', 'Xu L', 'Ke ZY', 'Huang LB', 'Zhang XL', 'Zhang YC', 'Luo XQ']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/07/08 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2010.535117 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Apr;28(3):187-93. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2010.535117.

The alternative splicing of nNOS mRNA generates 5 isoforms of nNOS, including nNOS-alpha, nNOS-beta, nNOS-micro, nNOS-gamma and nNOS-2. Monomer of nNOS is inactive, and dimer is the active form. Dimerization requires tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), heme and L-arginine binding. Regulation of nNOS expression relies largely on cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activity, and nNOS activity is regulated by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)/HSP70, calmodulin (CaM), phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser847 and Ser1412, and the protein inhibitor of nNOS (PIN). There are primarily 9 nNOS-interacting proteins, including post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), clathrin assembly lymphoid leukemia (CALM), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CAMKIIA), Disks large homolog 4 (DLG4), DLG2, 6-phosphofructokinase, muscle type (PFK-M), carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of nNOS (CAPON) protein, syntrophin and dynein light chain (LC). Among them, PSD95, CAPON and PFK-M are important nNOS adapter proteins in neurons. The interaction of PSD95 with nNOS controls synapse formation and is implicated in N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-induced neuronal death. nNOS-derived NO is implicated in synapse loss-mediated early cognitive/motor deficits in several neuropathological states, and negatively regulates neurogenesis under physiological and pathological conditions.","['Luo, Chun-Xia', 'Zhu, Dong-Ya']","['Luo CX', 'Zhu DY']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Cerebrovascular Disease, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Singapore,Neurosci Bull,Neuroscience bulletin,101256850,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurogenesis/*physiology', 'Neurons/*enzymology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I/*physiology']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/05/03 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12264-011-1038-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurosci Bull. 2011 Feb;27(1):23-35. doi: 10.1007/s12264-011-1038-0.,,['EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I)'],PMC5560277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cells sensitivity in vitro was determined with 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT). DNA-PKs and ATM expression in CLL cells was evaluated using Western blotting. Multidrug tansporter protein expression and function was assessed by flow cytometry. Pro- or anti-apoptotic genes (BAX, LICE BCL-2, BCL-XS FLICE, FAS, TRAIL) expression on mRNA level was evaluated. RESULTS: Caffeine, vanillin, NU7026 and CsA increased fludarabine cytotoxicity against fludarabine-resistant CLL cells samples in comparison with sensitive cell samples. However, fludarabine-sensitive CLL samples were sensitized with inhibitors to a greater extent compared with resistant CLL samples. ATM expression increased in fludarabine-resistant CLL samples, but no apparent correlation between DNA-PKs level and fludarabine sensitivity in vitro or sensitization effect of DNA-PK inhibitors were observed. Fludarabine-resistant CLL lymphocytes showed tendency for depressed MDR efflux and decreased level of mRNA of pro-apoptotic gene BCL-XS. CONCLUSION: Absence of any definite conformity between fludarabine-resistant cell susceptibility to combined action of fludarabine and inhibitors, and molecular pathways that might be involved in this process does not exclude drugs synergy in fludarabine-resistant cells that could be used for overcoming resistance to nucleoside analogs in CLL.","['Svirnovski, A I', 'Serhiyenka, T F', 'Kustanovich, A M', 'Khlebko, P V', 'Fedosenko, V V', 'Taras, I B', 'Bakun, A V']","['Svirnovski AI', 'Serhiyenka TF', 'Kustanovich AM', 'Khlebko PV', 'Fedosenko VV', 'Taras IB', 'Bakun AV']","['Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Hematology and Transfusiology, 160 Dolginovski Tract, Minsk 220053, Belarus. asvirnov@yandex.ru']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Benzaldehydes/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caffeine/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/04/29 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['47/881 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2010 Dec;32(4):258-62.,,"['0 (2-(morpholin-4-yl)benzo(h)chromen-4-one)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzaldehydes)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CHI530446X (vanillin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene expression profiling of in vitro-stimulated CD4(+) cells revealed an independent second alteration of T helper cell physiology, which was most pronounced in early CLL but also detectable in follicular lymphoma/extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. This pattern consisted of down-regulation of T-cell receptor signaling cascades and globally reduced cytokine secretion. Both types of T-cell dysfunction may contribute to significant immunodeficiency in nonleukemic indolent B-cell lymphomas as demonstrated by unresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccination. The precise definition of systemic T-cell dysfunction serves as the basis to study its prognostic impact, its relationship to the established influence of the lymphoma microenvironment, and its therapeutic manipulation.","['Christopoulos, Petros', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Bartholome, Kilian', 'Follo, Marie', 'Timmer, Jens', 'Fisch, Paul', 'Veelken, Hendrik']","['Christopoulos P', 'Pfeifer D', 'Bartholome K', 'Follo M', 'Timmer J', 'Fisch P', 'Veelken H']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*pathology']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45309-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-07-299321 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 7;117(14):3836-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-07-299321.

Endpoints included complete remission or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CR/CRp), overall survival, safety, and tolerability. Correlative studies included pharmacokinetics and analysis of in vivo FLT3 inhibition. There were 29 patients with CR/CRp in the lestaurtinib arm and 23 in the control arm (26% vs 21%; P = .35), and no difference in overall survival between the 2 arms. There was evidence of toxicity in the lestaurtinib-treated patients, particularly those with plasma levels in excess of 20 muM. In the lestaurtinib arm, FLT3 inhibition was highly correlated with remission rate, but target inhibition on day 15 was achieved in only 58% of patients receiving lestaurtinib. Given that such a small proportion of patients on this trial achieved sustained FLT3 inhibition in vivo, any conclusions regarding the efficacy of combining FLT3 inhibition with chemotherapy are limited. Overall, lestaurtinib treatment after chemotherapy did not increase response rates or prolong survival of patients with FLT3 mutant acute myeloid leukemia in first relapse.

To facilitate its budding, some virus hijacks the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway that is normally used to cargo and degrade ubiquitylated cellular proteins, through interaction between the late domain of Gag polyproteins and the components of MVB machinery. In this study, we demonstrated that TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) directly interacted with VPS37C, a subunit of endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I (ESCRT-I) in the MVB pathway, without affecting the ultrastructure or general function of MVB. Interestingly, overexpression of TBK1 attenuated, whereas short hairpin RNA interference of TBK1 enhanced HIV-1 pseudovirus release from Vero cells in type I IFN (IFN-I)-independent manner. Down-regulation of TBK1 by short hairpin RNA in TZM-bl cells also enhanced live HIV-1 NL4-3 or JR-CSF virus budding without involvement of IFN-I induction. Furthermore, infection of TBK1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells with a chimeric murine leukemia virus/p6, whose PPPY motif was replaced by PTAP motif of HIV-1, showed that lack of TBK1 significantly enhanced PTAP-dependent, but not PPPY-dependent retrovirus budding. Finally, phosphorylation of VPS37C by TBK1 might regulate the viral budding efficiency, because overexpression of the kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 (TBK1-K38A) in Vero cells accelerated HIV-1 pseudovirus budding. Therefore, through tethering to VPS37C of the ESCRT-I complex, TBK1 controlled the speed of PTAP-dependent retroviral budding through phosphorylation of VPS37C, which would serve as a novel mechanism of host cell defense independent of IFN-I signaling.","['Da, Qi', 'Yang, Xuanming', 'Xu, Youli', 'Gao, Guangxia', 'Cheng, Genhong', 'Tang, Hong']","['Da Q', 'Yang X', 'Xu Y', 'Gao G', 'Cheng G', 'Tang H']","['Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Biophysics, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV Infections/immunology/metabolism', 'HIV-1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/growth & development/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multivesicular Bodies/physiology/ultrastructure/virology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/metabolism', 'Vero Cells', 'Virus Replication/*immunology']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1000262 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1000262 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Mar 1;186(5):3023-30. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1000262.

Because recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have linked a region of the 3'-UTR of IKZF1 with C-ALL susceptibility, we tested whether IKZF1 is associated with the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: rs10272724 (T>C) near IKZF1 at 7p12 was genotyped in 8,333 individuals with type 1 diabetes, 9,947 control subjects, and 3,997 families of European ancestry. Association was tested using logistic regression in the case-control data and by the transmission disequilibrium test in the families. Expression data for IKZF1 by rs10272724 genotype were obtained using quantitative PCR of mRNA/cDNA generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 88 individuals, whereas expression data for five other neighboring genes were obtained from the online Genevar dataset. RESULTS: The minor allele of rs10272724 (C) was found to be protective from type 1 diabetes (odds ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.83-0.91]; P = 1.1 x 10(-11)). rs10272724 was not correlated with levels of two transcripts of IKZF1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: The major susceptibility genotype for C-ALL confers protection from type 1 diabetes. Our finding strengthens the link between autoimmunity and lymphoid cancers. Further investigation is warranted for the genetic effect marked by rs10272724, its impact on IKZF1, and the role of Ikaros and other family members, Ailios (IKZF3) and Eos (IKZF4), in autoimmunity.","['Swafford, Austin D-E', 'Howson, Joanna M M', 'Davison, Lucy J', 'Wallace, Chris', 'Smyth, Deborah J', 'Schuilenburg, Helen', 'Maisuria-Armer, Meeta', 'Mistry, Trupti', 'Lenardo, Michael J', 'Todd, John A']","['Swafford AD', 'Howson JM', 'Davison LJ', 'Wallace C', 'Smyth DJ', 'Schuilenburg H', 'Maisuria-Armer M', 'Mistry T', 'Lenardo MJ', 'Todd JA']","[""Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation/Wellcome Trust Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Diabetes,Diabetes,0372763,IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Whites/genetics']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/04/26 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['db10-0446 [pii]', '10.2337/db10-0446 [doi]']",ppublish,Diabetes. 2011 Mar;60(3):1041-4. doi: 10.2337/db10-0446.

We set out to determine the stage at which viral infection is blocked and whether this block is mediated by a dominant-negative factor or the absence of a requisite ancillary factor. BHK cells bind neither XMRV nor GALV envelope proteins. BHK cells expressing the appropriate receptors bind XMRV or GALV envelope proteins. BHK cells can be infected by NZB-XMV(New Zealand Black mouse xenotropic murine virus)-enveloped vectors, expressing an envelope derived from a xenotropic retrovirus that, like XMRV, employs Xpr1 as a receptor, and also by vectors bearing the envelope of 10A1 murine leukemia virus (MLV), a murine retrovirus that can use PiT1 as a receptor. The retroviral vectors used in these analyses differ solely in their viral envelope proteins, suggesting that the block to XMRV and GALV infection is mediated at the level of envelope-receptor interactions. N-linked glycosylation of the receptors was not found to mediate resistance of receptor-expressing BHK cells to GALV or XMRV, as shown by tunicamycin treatment and mutation of the specific glycosylation site of the PiT1 receptor. Hybrid cells produced by fusing BHKXpr1 or BHKPiT1 to XMRV- or GALV-resistant cells, respectively, can mediate efficient XMRV or GALV infection. These findings indicate that BHK cells lack a factor that is required for infection by primate xenotropic viruses.

Here we report that NF-kappaB activation can markedly increase XMRV production. The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), which activates NF-kappaB, significantly augmented viral Gag protein production in XMRV-infected cells. Reporter assays showed that TNF-alpha and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), an intrinsic NF-kappaB activator, increased long terminal repeat (LTR)-dependent XMRV transcription. We identified two NF-kappaB binding sites (designated kappaB-1 and kappaB-2) in the LTR U3 region of XMRV and demonstrated that both sites bind to the NF-kappaB component p65/RelA. Mutation of the kappaB-1 site, but not the kappaB-2 site, impaired responsiveness to TNF-alpha and LMP1 in reporter assays. A mutant XMRV with a mutation at the kappaB-1 site replicated significantly less efficiently than the wild-type XMRV in the prostate carcinoma LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 cell lines, HEK293 cells, the EBV-immortalized cell line IB4, and the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BJAB. These results demonstrate that TNF-alpha and EBV LMP1 enhance XMRV replication in prostate carcinoma and B-lineage cells through the kappaB-1 site in the XMRV LTR, suggesting that inflammation, EBV infection, and other conditions leading to NF-kappaB activation may promote XMRV spread in humans.","['Sakakibara, Shuhei', 'Sakakibara, Kaori', 'Tosato, Giovanna']","['Sakakibara S', 'Sakakibara K', 'Tosato G']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Building 37, Room 4134, Bethesda, MD 20892-1907, USA. sakakibs@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinoma/*virology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Products, gag/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*virology', 'Protein Binding', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', '*Virus Replication', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*physiology']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/05/14 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02333-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02333-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Apr;85(7):3179-86. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02333-10.

The purpose of this review is to summarize the methodologies of MRD assessment, its proven benefits and its further perspectives for optimizing the outcome of transplantation. Proven value of quantitative MRD monitoring by RQ-PCR or MRD-flow consists in using it as an indicator of long-term disease control and potential cure. As MRD kinetics correlates with GVL activity, its suitability for guiding GVL-inducing immunomodulation is currently under investigation.

In expanding our previous observations in this area, we studied the repertoire of T-cell receptor beta variable region (TRBV) and T-cell proliferative history in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. The expression and clonality analysis were performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and GeneScan technique in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of T cells. Nineteen CML cases in chronic phase were selected for this study and 17 healthy individuals served as controls. Marked restriction of TRBV repertoire was observed in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from CML. In most CML samples, clonally expanded T cells were identified in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, predominantly in TRBV19 and TRBV21 (5/19) subfamilies. In conclusion, the restricted expression of TRBV subfamilies indicates the T-cell immunodeficiency in CML patients; however, clonally expanded T cells suggest a specific immune response to leukemia associated antigens.","['Li, Yangqiu', 'Geng, Suxia', 'Du, Xin', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Li, Bo', 'Schmidt, Christian A', 'Przybylski, Grzegorz K']","['Li Y', 'Geng S', 'Du X', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Wu X', 'Li B', 'Schmidt CA', 'Przybylski GK']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/07/22 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453311X12902908411634 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2011 Jan;16(1):43-9. doi: 10.1179/102453311X12902908411634.,,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high Wt1 expression correlated with the presence of FLT3-ITD (P = 0.014) and lower rate of complete remission (P = 0.023). The cumulative survival in AML patients was affected significantly by the presence of FLT3-ITD, being lower in the FLT3-ITD (+) group (6.0+/-2.4 months) compared to the FLT3-ITD (-) patients (17.9+/-3.3; P = 0.04). The expression of FLT3-ITD could probably activate Wt1 expression in AML blast cells and thus might contribute to its oncogenic function to provide cells with survival advantages in vivo.

Cytotoxicity assays showed that either PDMP or Tet enhanced cytotoxic effect of DNR on K562/A02 cells, while cotreatment of these two drugs had a more significant effect on chemosensitization. Using flow cytometric analysis, we confirmed that the enhancement effect was accompanied by elevated cellular DNR accumulation and DNR-induced apoptosis. According to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot, the reversal effect of that composite might owe to the significant downregulation of mdr1 and GCS gene expressions. Importantly, PDMP diminished mdr1 gene expression and Tet also downregulated GCS gene expression. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between GCS and P-gp.

We previously identified BASP1 (brain acid-soluble protein 1) as a WT1 cofactor that suppresses the transcriptional activation function of WT1. In the present study we have analysed the dynamic between WT1 and BASP1 in the regulation of gene expression in myelogenous leukaemia K562 cells. Our findings reveal that BASP1 is a significant regulator of WT1 that is recruited to WT1-binding sites and suppresses WT1-mediated transcriptional activation at several WT1 target genes. We find that WT1 and BASP1 can divert the differentiation programme of K562 cells to a non-blood cell type following induction by the phorbol ester PMA. WT1 and BASP1 co-operate to induce the differentiation of K562 cells to a neuronal-like morphology that exhibits extensive arborization, and the expression of several genes involved in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Functional analysis revealed the relevance of the transcriptional reprogramming and morphological changes, in that the cells elicited a response to the neurotransmitter ATP. Taken together, the results of the present study reveal that WT1 and BASP1 can divert the lineage potential of an established blood cell line towards a cell with neuronal characteristics.","['Goodfellow, Sarah J', 'Rebello, Michelle R', 'Toska, Eneda', 'Zeef, Leo A H', 'Rudd, Sean G', 'Medler, Kathryn F', 'Roberts, Stefan G E']","['Goodfellow SJ', 'Rebello MR', 'Toska E', 'Zeef LA', 'Rudd SG', 'Medler KF', 'Roberts SG']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, The Michael Smith Building, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', '*Cellular Reprogramming/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Multigene Family/drug effects', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neurites/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neurogenesis/drug effects', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Synapses/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/05/19 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20101734 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20101734 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2011 Apr 1;435(1):113-25. doi: 10.1042/BJ20101734.,,"['0 (BASP1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '57716-89-9 (4-O-methyl-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",PMC3062854,,,"['C1356/A6630/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'WT061207/Z/00/A/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following recent improvements in non-relapse-related mortality rates, relapse has become the commonest cause of treatment failure. Infusion of donor lymphocytes can potentially enhance immune-mediated antitumor activity and offers a salvage option for some patients. This paper reviews the current literature on the efficacy of this therapeutic strategy. AREAS COVERED: The biology of adoptive cellular therapy with allogeneic immune cells to treat relapse across a spectrum of diseases in both the full intensity and reduced intensity hematopoietic SCT settings is explored. The review discusses the current limitations of the approach and reviews several new experimental strategies which aim to segregate the desired graft-versus-tumor effect from the deleterious effects of more widespread graft-versus-host reactivity. EXPERT OPINION: Durable responses to DLI have been noted in chronic myeloid leukemia and responses have also been described in acute leukemia, multiple myeloma and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. The new challenge in transplantation is to optimize DLI therapy in order to further improve patient outcomes.","['Roddie, Claire', 'Peggs, Karl S']","['Roddie C', 'Peggs KS']","[""UCL Cancer Institute, Department of Haematology, Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street, London, WC1E 6BT, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/history/immunology/surgery/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/history', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/adverse effects/history', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Secondary Prevention', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', '*Tissue Donors/history', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/01/29 06:00,2011/07/01 06:00,['2011/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712598.2011.554811 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2011 Apr;11(4):473-87. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2011.554811.

These findings can be roughly classified into two categories according to their association with leukemia. On the one hand, these histone modifiers are recruited to DNA by specific affinities of aberrantly expressed transcription factors or fusion proteins, and induce chromatin modifications to regulate target gene expression. Epigenetic regulators may function as oncogenes in this context. On the other hand, recent studies have identified inactivating mutations of some key histone modulators in myeloid malignancies and these results suggest that they act as tumor suppressors. Profound understanding of these findings in the two categories will help us consider clinical applications of epigenetic drugs. In this prospect we will review the leukemogenic mechanisms clarified by the epigenetic approach and the current findings on genetic aberrations in each methyltransferase or demethylase, and discuss the potential of medical intervention in leukemia or leukemia stem cells targeting histone modifiers.","['Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Yoshimi A', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology & Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Animals', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation']",2011/01/27 06:00,2011/05/04 06:00,['2011/01/27 06:00'],"['2011/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22972 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2011 Feb;112(2):415-24. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22972.,,"['EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice deficient in FL exhibit striking reductions in LHP and BCP. Currently, the mechanism by which Flt3 regulates lymphoid lineage/B-cell development is unknown. Here, we show that haploinsufficiency of FL (FL(+/) (-) ) reduced the numbers of LHP, common lymphoid progenitors, and pro-B cells, suggesting that FL levels set a threshold for B lymphopoiesis. Limiting dilution analysis confirmed reduced BCP frequency in FL(+/) (-) mice. Real-time PCR of LHP from FL(+/) (-) animals showed increased transcripts of the B lineage inhibitor id1. However, targeted deletion of id1 did not restore the lymphoid/B lineage deficiencies in FL(-/-) mice, supporting Id1-independent mechanisms. BrdU incorporation studies established that FL is not essential for the proliferation of Flt3(+) multipotential progenitors. Analysis of FL(-/-) progenitors expressing low levels of Flt3 revealed decreased levels of the pro-survival factor Mcl1. Consequently, the Flt3(+) LHP progeny of Flt3(low) LSK(+) cells exhibited increased Annexin V staining. Together, these data suggest that Flt3 signaling initiates a cascade of events in Flt3(low) precursors that promote the survival of LHP from which BCP are derived.","['Dolence, Joseph J', 'Gwin, Kimberly', 'Frank, Elena', 'Medina, Kay L']","['Dolence JJ', 'Gwin K', 'Frank E', 'Medina KL']","['Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Haploinsufficiency/immunology', 'Heterozygote', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/genetics', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Lymphopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*cytology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",2011/01/27 06:00,2011/04/06 06:00,['2011/01/27 06:00'],"['2011/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201040710 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2011 Feb;41(2):324-34. doi: 10.1002/eji.201040710.,,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Idb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",PMC3050551,,,"['R01 HL096108/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL096108-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL096108/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS275844'],,"['Copyright (c) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Gene rearrangements between EWS gene on chromosome 22q12 and members of the ETS gene family are common in and specific to ESFTs. Another defining characteristic of ESFTs is their membranous expression of the CD99. In contrast, such translocations and immunoreactivity are not found in central primitive neuroectodermal tumors (cPNETs). The aim of this study was to investigate the detection of EWS/FLI1 translocations and CD99 immunoreactivity in order to evaluate their clinicopathological features and their roles in the differential diagnosis of these tumors. In this study, we investigated CD99 immunoreactivity using immunohistochemistry and Ewing's sarcoma / Friend leukaemia virus integration 1 (EWS/FLI1) translocation using the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method in 23 cases. CD99 expression was detected in 10/11 (90%) ESFT cases and 2/7 cPNET cases. In 18 cases EWS/FLI1 translocation was examined using the FISH method. The EWS/FLI1 translocations were detected in 7/8 (87.5%) ESFTs cases, whereas non of 8 cPNET cases were detected with this translocation. One case could not be classified as either central or peripheral, showed EWS/FLI1 translocation. There was a statistically significant difference in CD99 expression (p = 0.0013) and EWS/FLI1 translocation (p = 0,002) between cPNETs and ESFTs cases. In conclusion, CD99 expression and EWS/FLI1 translocation are specific and sensitive markers in the diagnosis of ESFTs. However, these were often not found in cases of cPNET. Therefore, in the diagnosis of ESFTs, clinical, radiological, histopathological and immunohistochemical parameters should always be evaluated together.","['Vural, Cigdem', 'Uluoglu, Omer', 'Akyurek, Nalan', 'Oguz, Aynur', 'Karadeniz, Ceyda']","['Vural C', 'Uluoglu O', 'Akyurek N', 'Oguz A', 'Karadeniz C']","['Department of Pathology, Baskent University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. dr.cvural@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,IM,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive, Peripheral/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/27 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/01/27 06:00'],"['2010/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12253-010-9358-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2011 Sep;17(3):619-25. doi: 10.1007/s12253-010-9358-3.

Broadly neutralizing antibodies have been found in HIV infected individuals, including antibodies directed against a highly conserved region in the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of the transmembrane envelope (TM) protein gp41 of HIV-1. We successfully induced neutralizing antibodies against different gammaretroviruses by immunization with their respective TM proteins. These antibodies recognized epitopes not only in the MPER but also in the fusion peptide proximal region of the TM protein. In the case of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), these antibodies protected cats from antigenemia following challenge. To understand the mechanism of neutralization, the interactions between neutralizing antibodies and their corresponding epitopes in the TM protein of gammaretroviruses and HIV-1 were analysed.

Recently, aberrant expressions of LPA receptor genes due to DNA methylation have been detected in several tumor cells. In this study, we measured expression levels and DNA methylation status of LPA receptor genes in mouse tumor cells, LL/2 lung carcinoma, B16F0 melanoma, FM3A mammary carcinoma and L1210 leukemia cells, compared with normal tissues. METHODS: Total RNAs were extracted and RT-PCR analysis was performed. For DNA methylation status, bisulfite sequencing analysis was carried out, comparing outcomes with other tumor cells and normal tissues. RESULTS: The expressions of LPA1 gene were shown in LL/2, but not in B16F0, FM3A and L1210 cells. While the LPA2 gene was expressed in all 4 tumor cells, the LPA3 gene was unexpressed in them. The LPA1 and LPA3 unexpressed cells were highly methylated, although normal tissues were all unmethylated. The DNA methylation status was correlated with gene expression levels in cancer cells. CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate that DNA methylation patterns of LPA receptor genes are dependent on cancer cell types, suggesting that LPA receptors may be new molecular targets for therapeutic approaches and chemoprevention.","['Okabe, Kyoko', 'Hayashi, Mai', 'Wakabayashi, Naoko', 'Yamawaki, Yasuna', 'Teranishi, Miki', 'Fukushima, Nobuyuki', 'Tsujiuchi, Toshifumi']","['Okabe K', 'Hayashi M', 'Wakabayashi N', 'Yamawaki Y', 'Teranishi M', 'Fukushima N', 'Tsujiuchi T']","['Divisions of Cancer Biology and Bioinformatics, Faculty of Science and Technology, Kinki University, Higashiosaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/metabolism', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism', 'Melanoma, Experimental/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Neurologic Mutants', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid/classification/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2011/01/27 06:00,2011/04/28 06:00,['2011/01/27 06:00'],"['2010/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['000321898 [pii]', '10.1159/000321898 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2010;77(6):309-14. doi: 10.1159/000321898.

METHODS: We identified 51 cases (3%) of BAL from 1,693 newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients according to the EGIL scoring system. The immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, treatment, and outcome of 39 BAL patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 23 (59%) cases of the myeloid and B-lymphoid phenotype, 14 (36%) cases of the myeloid and T-lymphoid phenotype, and 1 case (3%) of the trilineage phenotype or B/T phenotype. Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 76% of the 37 validated patients and displayed a high degree of heterogeneity. Combined regimens for both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), as well as ALL type regimens, appeared to achieve a better complete remission rate than AML type regimens (71 and 64 vs. 33%, respectively). BAL patients with complex karyotypes or a rearrangement of chromosome 11 had a significantly reduced survival rate in comparison to patients with normal, t(8; 21), or t(9; 22) karyotypes. The probability of overall survival and disease-free survival at 2 years was 26 and 18%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that BAL shows a high incidence of abnormal karyotypes and a poor prognosis.

The scarcity of biologic information about RS has hampered the identification of molecular predictors of RS outcome. We addressed this issue by performing a comprehensive molecular characterization of 86 pathologically proven RS. TP53 disruption (47.1%) and c-MYC abnormalities (26.2%) were the most frequent alterations, whereas common genetic lesions of de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were rare or absent. By multivariate analysis, lack of TP53 disruption (hazard ratio, 0.43; P = .003) translated into significant survival advantage with 57% reduction in risk of death. An algorithm based on TP53 disruption, response to RS treatment, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status had 80.9% probability of correctly discriminating RS survival (c-index = .809). RS that were clonally unrelated to the paired chronic lymphocytic leukemia phase were clinically and biologically different from clonally related RS because of significantly longer survival (median, 62.5 months vs 14.2 months; P = .017) and lower prevalence of TP53 disruption (23.1% vs 60.0%; P = .018) and B-cell receptor stereotypy (7.6% vs 50.0%; P = .009).

This is particularly the case in rapidly growing solid tumors in which the demand for oxygen and nutrients can exceed the supply until new tumor-initiated blood vessels are formed. In contrast, the role of the UPR during leukemogenesis remains largely unknown. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous clonal disorder characterized by the accumulation of somatic mutations in hematopoietic progenitor cells that alter the physiological regulation of self-renewal, survival, proliferation, or differentiation. The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) gene is a key myeloid transcription factor and a frequent target for disruption in AML. In particular, translation of CEBPA mRNA can be specifically blocked by binding of the chaperone calreticulin (CALR), a well-established effector of the UPR, to a stem loop structure within the 5' region of the CEBPA mRNA. The relevance of this mechanism was first elucidated in certain AML subtypes carrying the gene rearrangements t(3;21) or inv(16). In our recent work, we could demonstrate the induction of key effectors of the UPR in leukemic cells of AML patients comprising all subtypes (according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification for human AML). The formation of the spliced variant of the X-box binding protein (XBP1s) was detectable in 17.4% (17 of 105) of AML patients. Consistent with an activated UPR, this group had significantly increased expression of the UPR target genes CALR, the 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Consistently, in vitro studies confirmed that calreticulin expression was upregulated via activation of the ATF6 pathway in myeloid leukemic cells. As a consequence, CEBPA protein expression was inhibited in vitro as well as in leukemic cells from patients with activated UPR. We therefore propose a model of the UPR being involved in leukemogenesis through induction of calreticulin along the ATF6 pathway, thereby ultimately suppressing CEBPA translation and contributing to the block in myeloid differentiation and cell-cycle deregulation which represent key features of the leukemic phenotype. From a more clinical point of view, the presence of activated UPR in AML patient samples was found to be associated with a favorable disease course.","['Schardt, Julian A', 'Mueller, Beatrice U', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Schardt JA', 'Mueller BU', 'Pabst T']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Enzymol,Methods in enzymology,0212271,IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 6/physiology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Calreticulin/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/physiology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Stress, Physiological', 'U937 Cells', '*Unfolded Protein Response']",2011/01/27 06:00,2011/05/06 06:00,['2011/01/27 06:00'],"['2011/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['B978-0-12-385116-1.00013-3 [pii]', '10.1016/B978-0-12-385116-1.00013-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Enzymol. 2011;489:227-43. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-385116-1.00013-3.,,"['0 (ATF6 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 6)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, we demonstrated that the incidence of thymic lymphoma was decreased when these mice were raised in a low-dose-rate gamma-irradiation facility. In contrast, mice irradiated at a high-dose rate developed severe thymic lymphoma and died much earlier. To understand the genetic changes occurred by low- versus high-dose-rate gamma-irradiation whole genome microarray was performed. Both groups of mice demonstrated up-regulation of Ifng, Igbp1, and IL7 in their thymuses, however, mice exposed to high-dose-rate gamma-irradiation exhibited marked down-regulation of Sp3, Il15, Traf6, IL2ra, Pik3r1, and Hells. In contrast, low-dose-rate irradiated mice demonstrated up-regulation of Il15 and Jag2. These gene expression profiles imply the impaired immune signaling pathways by high-dose-rate gamma-irradiation while the facilitation of anti-tumor immune responses by low-dose-rate gamma-irradiation.

Treatment with HBA caused a rapid loss of mitochondrial trans-membrane potential, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytosol. The levels of Bad and Bax were dramatically increased in cells treated with HBA. In addition, the results showed that HBA promoted the up-regulation of Fas prior to the processing and activation of pro-caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid, suggesting the involvement of a Fas-mediated pathway in HBA-induced cells. Moreover, the changes occurred after single breaks in DNA were detected, suggesting that HBA induced irreparable DNA damage, which in turn triggered the process of apoptosis. HBA markedly enhanced the growth arrest DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) protein in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. These findings suggest that HBA creates an oxidative cellular environment that induces DNA damage and GADD153 gene activation, which in turn triggers apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Our study identified the novel mechanisms of HBA-induced apoptosis and indicated that HBA may be used as a potential chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent.","['Liu, Cheng Bin', 'Chen, Li-Hua', 'Cheng, An-Chin', 'Chen, Wei-Jen', 'Tsai, Mei-Ling', 'Liu, Yumei', 'Ho, Chi-Tang', 'Pan, Min-Hsiung']","['Liu CB', 'Chen LH', 'Cheng AC', 'Chen WJ', 'Tsai ML', 'Liu Y', 'Ho CT', 'Pan MH']","['Department of Seafood Science, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,IM,"['Acids/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/*metabolism']",2011/01/27 06:00,2011/07/02 06:00,['2011/01/27 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(11)00025-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2011.01.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2011 Apr;49(4):1033-42. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2011.01.016.

We previously reported a common alternatively spliced BCR-ABL mRNA with a 35-nucleotide insertion (35INS). We report three novel alternative splicing mutants expressed as the dominant transcripts in patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia and resistance to kinase inhibitors. METHODS: We screened RNA from more than 200 patients with resistance to more than one of the three kinase inhibitors for ABL1 kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing. RESULTS: We found three not previously described splice mutants. All three showed >90% mutant transcript. The first resulted from the insertion of 79 nucleotides into the ABL1 exon 8-9 junction. The inserted sequence contained a sequence from regions of intron 8, located 120 bp apart: the 35-nucleotide sequence previously described, and an additional 44-nucleotide segment downstream from 35INS. The combined 79-nucleotide insertion splice mutant showed the same protein change as 35INS (p C475YfsX11). The second splice mutation comprised an 84-nucleotide sequence from intron 7 inserted into the ABL1 exon7-8 junction, also causing a frameshift and protein truncation (p A424EfsX18). The third splice derived from a 231-nucleotide sequence from intron 4 retained in the ABL1 exon 4-5 junction adding 40 intron-encoded amino acids and leading to a frameshift and early termination (p E275LfsX41). CONCLUSION: These findings, when combined with the data on 35INS, support the concept that loss of the C-terminus of BCR-ABL1 is associated with significant resistance to kinase inhibitors; this mechanism appears to be a major source of resistance to kinase inhibitors.","['Ma, W', 'Giles, F', 'Zhang, X', 'Wang, X', 'Zhang, Z', 'Lee, T-S', 'Yeh, C-H', 'Albitar, M']","['Ma W', 'Giles F', 'Zhang X', 'Wang X', 'Zhang Z', 'Lee TS', 'Yeh CH', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Sequence Alignment']",2011/01/27 06:00,2011/07/30 06:00,['2011/01/27 06:00'],"['2011/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01291.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2011 Jun;33(3):326-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2010.01291.x.

To investigate the capacity of a modified European group for blood and marrow transplantation (mEBMT) risk score to predict the outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants, we retrospectively analyzed 214 patients transplanted at our center between 1995 and 2008. Overall survival (OS) of the whole cohort at 1, 3, and 5 yr was 62%, 48%, and 45%, whereas the cumulative incidence of relapse or non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 26%, 33%, and 33% or 19%, 21%, and 22%. In univariate analysis, a higher mEBMT risk score was associated with an inferior OS ranging from 69% for patients with a score of 0/1 to 26% for patients with a score of 5/6 at 5 yr (P < 0.0001) and steadily increasing hazard ratios for each additional score point. Likewise, a higher mEBMT risk score was associated with an increased incidence of relapse (P = 0.049). Importantly, the prognostic value of the mEBMT risk score in terms of OS and relapse was maintained in multivariate analysis. Taken together, this indicates that a mEBMT risk score may be used to predict the outcome of patients with AML following alloSCT.","['Hemmati, Philipp G', 'Terwey, Theis H', 'le Coutre, Philipp', 'Vuong, Lam G', 'Massenkeil, Gero', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Arnold, Renate']","['Hemmati PG', 'Terwey TH', 'le Coutre P', 'Vuong LG', 'Massenkeil G', 'Dorken B', 'Arnold R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite- Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany. philipp.hemmati@charite.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/27 06:00,2011/05/24 06:00,['2011/01/27 06:00'],"['2011/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01580.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Apr;86(4):305-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01580.x.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten children (seven girls) aged 8.5 years (2.9-16) years with standard or medium-risk ALL received four 24-h i.v. infusions of high-dose MTX (HDMTX, 5 g/m2) with leucovorin (CAS 58-05-9) rescue according to the ALL-BFM-95 protocol. MTX and 7-OHMTX were assayed in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography. At the steady-state, the clearance (CL) of MTX (6.28 +/- 2.79 l h(-1)) was correlated with its CL(R) (r(s) = 0.79, p < 0.0001) which accounted for 61% (SD 26%) of the former. There were weak correlations between pretreatment values of creatinine clearance calculated using Schwartz's formula and the drug's CL (r(s) = 0.30, p < 0.05) or CLR (r(s) = 0.41, p < 0.02). In contrast, the CL(R) accounted for only 26% (SD 15%) of the metabolite's CL which was estimated assuming 10% conversion of MTX to 7-OHMTX. The CL values of both compounds were highly correlated (r(s) = 0.86, p < 0.0001). The CL(R) of the parent compound was on the average 9-fold higher (range: 3.5- to 17-fold) and was strongly correlated with the CL(R) of the metabolite (r(s) = 0.87, p < 0.0001). The ratio 7-OHMTX/MTX of urinary concentrations was between 2.4 and 9.8% with the mean value of 4.1%. This study suggests that during the 24-h i.v. infusions of HDMTX to children with ALL, the exposure of patients to 7-OHMTX can be reasonably well predicted from the knowledge of MTX concentrations. The steady-state renal CLs, total CLs as well as urinary concentrations of the parent compound and metabolite are highly correlated and the correlation of plasma concentrations is moderate. Therefore, it is unlikely that simultaneous evaluation of 7-OHMTX and MTX steady-state concentrations could improve the predictive performance of the latter towards the response or the risk of complications, although future larger studies should verify this conclusion.","['Chladkova, Jirina', 'Hak, Jiri', 'Martinkova, Jirina', 'Chladek, Jaroslav']","['Chladkova J', 'Hak J', 'Martinkova J', 'Chladek J']","['Department of Paediatrics, Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Medicine and Hospital, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arzneimittelforschung,Arzneimittel-Forschung,0372660,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*urine', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/urine', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism']",2011/01/27 06:00,2011/03/04 06:00,['2011/01/27 06:00'],"['2011/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0031-1296353 [doi]'],ppublish,Arzneimittelforschung. 2010;60(12):769-75. doi: 10.1055/s-0031-1296353.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'X019Z9S1DL (7-hydroxymethotrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors report on the combination of morphology and flow cytometry in the diagnosis of leptomeningeal disease in patients with radiological, clinical, or cytological findings suspicious for leukemia or lymphoma with spread into the cerebrospinal fluid. METHODS: The authors defined a set of antibodies for flow cytometric analysis, which is capable of distinguishing between malignant and nonmalignant hematopoietic cells. One hundred twenty-seven cases were analyzed with both methods. RESULTS: The additional application of flow cytometry resulted in an improvement of diagnostic reliability in 29 of 127 cases. Diagnostic sensitivity was raised from 73% (cytology) to 96% (flow cytometry), specificity from 94% to 97%, the positive predictive value from 88% to 96%, and the negative predictive value from 76% to 97%. CONCLUSIONS: Because the appropriate selection of markers is crucial to successful analysis, the authors suggested a highly selected panel of antibodies for flow cytometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid samples.

Microglia and astrocytes secreting proinflammatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors are reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of demyelinative diseases. Therefore, to clarify the role of microglial and astrocytic function in ODS, we examined the time-dependent changes in distribution, morphology, proliferation, and mRNA/protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines, neurotrophic factors, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in microglia and astrocytes 2 days (early phase) and 5 days (late phase) after the rapid correction of hyponatremia in ODS rats. The number of microglia time dependently increased at demyelinative lesion sites, proliferated, and expressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and MMP2, 9, and 12 at the early phase. Microglia also expressed leukemia inhibitory factor (a neurotrophic factor) and phagocytosed myelin debris at the late phase. The number of astrocytes time dependently increased around demyelinative lesions, extended processes to lesions, proliferated, and expressed nerve growth factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor at the late phase. Moreover, treatment with infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, significantly attenuated neurological impairments. Our results suggest that the role of microglia in ODS is time dependently shifted from detrimental to protective and that astrocytes play a protective role at the late phase. Modulation of excessive proinflammatory responses in microglia during the early phase after rapid correction may represent a therapeutic target for ODS.","['Iwama, Shintaro', 'Sugimura, Yoshihisa', 'Suzuki, Haruyuki', 'Suzuki, Hiromi', 'Murase, Takashi', 'Ozaki, Nobuaki', 'Nagasaki, Hiroshi', 'Arima, Hiroshi', 'Murata, Yoshiharu', 'Sawada, Makoto', 'Oiso, Yutaka']","['Iwama S', 'Sugimura Y', 'Suzuki H', 'Suzuki H', 'Murase T', 'Ozaki N', 'Nagasaki H', 'Arima H', 'Murata Y', 'Sawada M', 'Oiso Y']","['Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Demyelinating Diseases/*etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hyponatremia/*complications/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Microglia/pathology/*physiology', 'Osmosis/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Syndrome', 'Time Factors', 'Water-Electrolyte Imbalance/*complications/pathology']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/glia.21114 [doi]'],ppublish,Glia. 2011 Mar;59(3):452-62. doi: 10.1002/glia.21114.

A variety of autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome, have been reported in persons infected with HTLV-1, although the precise relationship between these disorders and HTLV-1 infection remains unknown. There is no report on the repertoire of HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells in HAM/TSP patients or carriers with autoimmune diseases, both characterized by an abnormal immune state. In this study, to characterize HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers, HAM/TSP patients and carriers with autoimmune diseases, we examined the frequency and diversity of HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T-cells using HTLV-1 tetramers. HTLV-1 Env-specific CD8+ T-cells were significantly more frequent in HAM/TSP and carriers with autoimmune diseases compared with asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers, while the frequency of HTLV-1 Tax-specific CD8+ T-cells was not significantly different among them. CD8+ cells binding to HTLV-1 Tax tetramers in carriers with autoimmune diseases were significantly reduced compared with HAM/TSP patients. This study demonstrates the importance of CD8+ T-cells recognizing HTLV-1 Env-tetramers in HAM/TSP patients and carriers with autoimmune diseases, thereby suggesting that the diversity, frequency and repertoire of HTLV-1 Env-specific CD8+ T-cell clones may be related to the hyperimmune response in HAM/TSP and carriers with autoimmune diseases, although different immunological mechanisms may mediate the hyperimmunity in these conditions.","['Kozako, Tomohiro', 'Akimoto, Masaki', 'Toji, Shingo', 'White, Yohann', 'Suzuki, Susumu', 'Arima, Takehiro', 'Suruga, Yukio', 'Matsushita, Kakushi', 'Shimeno, Hiroshi', 'Soeda, Shinji', 'Kubota, Ryuji', 'Izumo, Shuji', 'Uozumi, Kimiharu', 'Arima, Naomichi']","['Kozako T', 'Akimoto M', 'Toji S', 'White Y', 'Suzuki S', 'Arima T', 'Suruga Y', 'Matsushita K', 'Shimeno H', 'Soeda S', 'Kubota R', 'Izumo S', 'Uozumi K', 'Arima N']","['Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology', '*Epitopes/immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology/metabolism', 'Genetic Variation', 'HLA-A Antigens/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology', 'Protein Binding', '*T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/12/17 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jmv.21985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2011 Mar;83(3):501-9. doi: 10.1002/jmv.21985.,,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response to these findings, specific patient management tools for anemia (consisting in an algorithm and prescribing order set) were developed by a multidisciplinary team at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. METHODS: A retrospective study consisted of 7117 patients aged 18 years and older with cancer malignancies who had received an ESA between January 2006 and December 2008 at MD Anderson. Changes in utilization of ESAs and packed red blood cells (PRBCs) were evaluated. RESULTS: The number of ESA doses dispensed each month decreased by 83% from January 2006 to December 2008 (P < .01), and the number of patients who received ESAs decreased by 80% (P < .01). The number of dispensed ESA doses for hemoglobin (Hb) levels >/= 12 g/dL decreased significantly from 4% to 0% (P < .01), and the number for >/= 10 g/dL decreased from 44% to 12% (P < .01). The PRBC transfusion rate remained stable in solid tumor patients (P > .05) but increased from 7% to 9% (P < .05) in patients with hematologic malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: The authors summarized their experience with use of ESAs in a tertiary oncology center.

We first identified five mutant BCR-ABL clones: Y253H, G250E, F311L, F317L and K294RGG, which was generated by two-nucleotide mutations and six-nucleotide insertion, at the third BC during the imatinib treatment, and retrospectively found that three of them (Y253H, G250E, K294RGG) were already present at the second BC. The in vitro analysis using K294RGG mutant BCR-ABL-expressing 32D cells revealed that K294RGG mutation was imatinib resistant but dasatinib sensitive. Consistent with the in vitro data, the clone with K294RGG mutation was eliminated by the dasatinib treatment in this patient. During the imatinib treatment, several mutant clones emerged and expanded, while additional mutations on the same allele were not acquired. However, after the dasatinib treatment, wild-type BCR-ABL clone disappeared and T315I or F317L mutation was acquired in G250E and Y253H mutant clones on the same allele without the emergence of each sole mutant clone. Cytogenetic and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement analysis revealed that all mutant clones that appeared in this patient might be derived from the same CML clone.","['Sakai, Katsuya', 'Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Mori, Yumiko', 'Kobayashi, Miki', 'Iriyama, Chisako', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Suzuki, Tatsuya', 'Minami, Yosuke', 'Ishikawa, Kazuhiro', 'Kaneda, Norio', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi']","['Sakai K', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Mori Y', 'Kobayashi M', 'Iriyama C', 'Ozawa Y', 'Suzuki T', 'Minami Y', 'Ishikawa K', 'Kaneda N', 'Naoe T', 'Kiyoi H']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Tsurumai-cho 65, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8560, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Tsurumai-cho 65, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8560, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Tsurumai-cho 65, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8560, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Tsurumai-cho 65, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8560, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Tsurumai-cho 65, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8560, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Tsurumai-cho 65, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8560, Japan. kiyoi@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0766-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0766-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Feb;93(2):237-242. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0766-2.

To solve this shortcoming, prognostic parameters other than staging have become important in the recent years. Intracellular upregulation of Fc mu receptor (FCMR, FAIM3/TOSO) gene in the leukemic lymphocytes of the patients with CLL may be an important parameter in predicting the progression of the disease. In this study, FCMR mRNA expression levels were evaluated in 50 CLL patients and in 50 healthy controls. FCMR mRNA expression was found to be significantly higher in CLL patients than in healthy controls. We, then, evaluated FCMR mRNA levels according to the stages of CLL. Rai stage 0, I, II cases were compared with stage III and IV, and Binet A was compared with Binet B and C according to FCMR mRNA levels. In cases with higher risks, Rai stage III, IV and Binet stage B and C, FCMR mRNA levels were also significantly higher. In addition, overexpression of the FCMR seems to be promoting the chromosomal abnormalities. As a result, we found that the mRNA levels of FCMR in the CLL patients are 23-fold higher than that of the control group and this may suggest that it can be associated with the disease progression and survival. For this reason and because of the simplicity of analyzing with Q-PCR, it can be a useful clinical parameter, after its importance has been shown in larger and multi-variate studies.","['Hancer, Veysel Sabri', 'Diz-Kucukkaya, Reyhan', 'Aktan, Melih']","['Hancer VS', 'Diz-Kucukkaya R', 'Aktan M']","['Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Istanbul Bilim University, Buyukdere Cad No:120 Esentepe, 34394 Istanbul, Turkey. vshancer@istanbul.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,"['Aged', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Primers/chemistry/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2011/01/26 06:00,2012/09/19 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-9821-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Jun;29(2):1068-72. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-9821-3.

Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase by hydroxyurea (HU) has been previously used to treat cancers as well as HIV. However, the use of HU as an antiretroviral is limited by its associated toxicities such as myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity. In this study, we examined the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, gemcitabine, both in cell culture and in C57Bl/6 mice infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (LP-BM5 MuLV, a murine AIDS model). Gemcitabine decreased infectivity of MuLV in cell culture with an EC50 in the low nanomolar range with no detectable cytotoxicity. Similarly, gemcitabine significantly decreased disease progression in mice infected with LP-BM5. Specifically, gemcitabine treatment decreased spleen size, plasma IgM, and provirus levels compared to LP-BM5 MuLV infected, untreated mice. Gemcitabine efficacy was observed at doses as low as 1 mg/kg/day in the absence of toxicity. Higher doses of gemcitabine (3 mg/kg/day and higher) were associated with toxicity as determined by a loss in body mass. In summary, our findings demonstrate that gemcitabine has antiretroviral activity ex vivo and in vivo in the LP-BM5 MuLV model. These observations together with a recent ex vivo study with HIV-1, suggest that gemcitabine has broad antiretroviral activity and could be particularly useful in vivo when used in combination drug therapy.","['Clouser, Christine L', 'Holtz, Colleen M', 'Mullett, Mary', 'Crankshaw, Duane L', 'Briggs, Jacquie E', 'Chauhan, Jay', 'VanHoutan, Ilze Matise', 'Patterson, Steven E', 'Mansky, Louis M']","['Clouser CL', 'Holtz CM', 'Mullett M', 'Crankshaw DL', 'Briggs JE', 'Chauhan J', 'VanHoutan IM', 'Patterson SE', 'Mansky LM']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Viral Load/drug effects']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0015840 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Jan 14;6(1):e15840. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0015840.,20110114,"['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",PMC3021508,,,"['T32 DE07288/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 GM056615/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DE007288/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM56615/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM056615/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulated Notch3 signalling has also been shown to promote leukemogenesis in transgenic mice, but the targets of Notch3 in human T-ALL cells remain poorly characterized. Here, we show that Notch3 controls levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 1 (MKP-1). In a model of T-ALL cell dormancy, both Notch3 activation and MKP-1 expression were upregulated in aggressive compared with dormant tumors, and this inversely correlated with the levels of phosphorylated p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) MAPKs, two canonical MKP-1 targets. We demonstrate that MKP-1 protein levels are regulated by Notch3 in T-ALL cell lines because its silencing by RNA interference or treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitors induced strong MKP-1 reduction whereas activation of Notch3 signalling had the opposite effect. Furthermore, MKP-1 has an important role in T-ALL cell survival because its attenuation by short hairpin RNA significantly increased cell death under stress conditions. This protective function has a key role in vivo, as MKP-1-deficient cells showed impaired tumorigenicity. These results elucidate a novel mechanism downstream of Notch3 that controls the survival of T-ALL cells.","['Masiero, M', 'Minuzzo, S', 'Pusceddu, I', 'Moserle, L', 'Persano, L', 'Agnusdei, V', 'Tosello, V', 'Basso, G', 'Amadori, A', 'Indraccolo, S']","['Masiero M', 'Minuzzo S', 'Pusceddu I', 'Moserle L', 'Persano L', 'Agnusdei V', 'Tosello V', 'Basso G', 'Amadori A', 'Indraccolo S']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptors, Notch/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010323 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.323 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Apr;25(4):588-98. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.323.

These results show that PlagL2 expression activates expression of Mpl in hematopoietic progenitors, and that upregulation of wild-type Mpl provides an oncogenic signal in cooperation with CBFbeta-SMMHC in mice.","['Landrette, S F', 'Madera, D', 'He, F', 'Castilla, L H']","['Landrette SF', 'Madera D', 'He F', 'Castilla LH']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010301 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.301 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Apr;25(4):655-62. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.301.

Nine chalcones (1-9), 5 coumarins (10-14), and 4 flavanones (15-18), isolated from the EtOAc-soluble fraction, were examined for their cytotoxic activities in the 4 human tumor cell lines. Among the compounds tested, 4-hydroxyderricin (2), a major chalcone constituent, exhibited potent cytotoxic activities in all 4 tumor cell lines with IC(50) values of 5.5 microM (HL60), 4.8 microM (CRL1579), 10.2 microM (A549), and 4.2 microM (AZ521). 4-Hydroxyderricin induced early apoptosis in HL60 cells, observed as membrane phospholipid exposure in flow cytometry. Western blot analysis showed that 4-hydroxyderricin markedly reduced the levels of procaspases-3, -8, and -9, while increasing the levels of cleaved caspases-3, -8, and -9. In addition, 4-hydroxyderricin exhibited potent inhibitory activity on human DNA topoisomerase (Topo) II (IC(50) 21.9 microM).

Because we noted that in vivo FLT3 inhibition by lestaurtinib was less effective in the relapsed patients compared with the newly diagnosed patients, we investigated whether plasma FLT3 ligand (FL) levels could influence the efficacy of FLT3 inhibition in these patients. After intensive chemotherapy, FL levels rose to a mean of 488 pg/mL on day 15 of induction therapy for newly diagnosed patients, whereas they rose to a mean of 1148 pg/mL in the relapsed patients. FL levels rose even higher with successive courses of chemotherapy, to a mean of 3251 pg/mL after the fourth course. In vitro, exogenous FL at concentrations similar to those observed in patients mitigated FLT3 inhibition and cytotoxicity for each of 5 different FLT3 inhibitors (lestaurtinib, midostaurin, sorafenib, KW-2449, and AC220). The dramatic increase in FL level after chemotherapy represents a possible obstacle to inhibiting FLT3 in this clinical setting. These findings could have important implications regarding the design and outcome of trials of FLT3 inhibitors and furthermore suggest a rationale for targeting FL as a therapeutic strategy.","['Sato, Takashi', 'Yang, Xiaochuan', 'Knapper, Steven', 'White, Paul', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Galkin, Steven', 'Small, Donald', 'Burnett, Alan', 'Levis, Mark']","['Sato T', 'Yang X', 'Knapper S', 'White P', 'Smith BD', 'Galkin S', 'Small D', 'Burnett A', 'Levis M']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzenesulfonates/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/blood/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sorafenib', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36493-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-266742 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Mar 24;117(12):3286-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-266742.

We adapted this high-throughput Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) ALL animal model for in vivo luminescent imaging to investigate disease progression, targeted therapeutic response, and ALL relapse in living mice. Mice bearing high leukemic burdens (simulating human Ph(+) ALL at diagnosis) entered remission on maximally intensive, twice-daily dasatinib therapy, but invariably relapsed with disseminated and/or central nervous system disease. Although relapse was frequently accompanied by the eventual appearance of leukemic clones harboring BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutations that confer drug resistance, their clonal emergence required prolonged dasatinib exposure. KD P-loop mutations predominated in mice receiving less intensive therapy, whereas high-dose treatment selected for T315I ""gatekeeper"" mutations resistant to all 3 Food and Drug Administration-approved BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors. The addition of dexamethasone and/or L-asparaginase to reduced-intensity dasatinib therapy improved long-term survival of the majority of mice that received all 3 drugs.

Dasatinib was found to have selective activity in several tumor models in the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. PATIENTS AND METHODS A phase I study of dasatinib in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors or imatinib-refractory, Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia was performed. Dose levels of 50, 65, 85, and 110 mg/m(2)/dose, administered orally twice daily for 28 days, with courses repeated without interruption, were studied. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed with the initial dose. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients (solid tumors, n = 28; chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], n = 9; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n = 2) were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed at the 50, 65, and 85 mg/m(2) dose levels. At 110 mg/m(2), two of six patients experienced DLT including grade 2 diarrhea and headache. In children with leukemia, grade 4 hypokalemia (50 mg/m(2)), grade 3 diarrhea (85 mg/m(2)), and grade 2 creatinine elevation (50 mg/m(2)) were observed. DLT in later courses included pleural effusions, hemangiomatosis, and GI hemorrhage. There were three complete cytogenetic responses, three partial cytogenetic responses, and two partial/minimal cytogenetic responses observed in evaluable patients with CML.

Little is known about the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) affecting the signaling activity of FLT3. To identify such PTP, myeloid cells expressing wild type FLT3 were infected with a panel of lentiviral pseudotypes carrying shRNA expression cassettes targeting different PTP. Out of 20 PTP tested, expressed in hematopoietic cells, or presumed to be involved in oncogenesis or tumor suppression, DEP-1 (PTPRJ) was identified as a PTP negatively regulating FLT3 phosphorylation and signaling. Stable 32D myeloid cell lines with strongly reduced DEP-1 levels showed site-selective hyperphosphorylation of FLT3. In particular, the sites pTyr-589, pTyr-591, and pTyr-842 involved in the FLT3 ligand (FL)-mediated activation of FLT3 were hyperphosphorylated the most. Similarly, acute depletion of DEP-1 in the human AML cell line THP-1 caused elevated FLT3 phosphorylation. Direct interaction of DEP-1 and FLT3 was demonstrated by ""substrate trapping"" experiments showing association of DEP-1 D1205A or C1239S mutant proteins with FLT3 by co-immunoprecipitation. Moreover, activated FLT3 could be dephosphorylated by recombinant DEP-1 in vitro. Enhanced FLT3 phosphorylation in DEP-1-depleted cells was accompanied by enhanced FLT3-dependent activation of ERK and cell proliferation. Stable overexpression of DEP-1 in 32D cells and transient overexpression with FLT3 in HEK293 cells resulted in reduction of FL-mediated FLT3 signaling activity. Furthermore, FL-stimulated colony formation of 32D cells expressing FLT3 in methylcellulose was induced in response to shRNA-mediated DEP-1 knockdown. This transforming effect of DEP-1 knockdown was consistent with a moderately increased activation of STAT5 upon FL stimulation but did not translate into myeloproliferative disease formation in the 32D-C3H/HeJ mouse model. The data indicate that DEP-1 is negatively regulating FLT3 signaling activity and that its loss may contribute to but is not sufficient for leukemogenic cell transformation.","['Arora, Deepika', 'Stopp, Sabine', 'Bohmer, Sylvia-Annette', 'Schons, Julia', 'Godfrey, Rinesh', 'Masson, Kristina', 'Razumovskaya, Elena', 'Ronnstrand, Lars', 'Tanzer, Simone', 'Bauer, Reinhard', 'Bohmer, Frank-D', 'Muller, Jorg P']","['Arora D', 'Stopp S', 'Bohmer SA', 'Schons J', 'Godfrey R', 'Masson K', 'Razumovskaya E', 'Ronnstrand L', 'Tanzer S', 'Bauer R', 'Bohmer FD', 'Muller JP']","['Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/06/02 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)53714-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.205021 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Apr 1;286(13):10918-29. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.205021.

Our previous findings have shown that AICAr as a single agent induces dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines. In addition, the combination of AICAr with antifolates [methotrexate (MTX) or pemetrexed] has been shown to further potentiate AMPK activation and to lead to greater cytotoxicity and growth inhibition in leukemia and other malignant cell types. Our data presented herein show that sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is the predominant mechanism behind the synergistic induction of cell death by the combination of AICAr plus the inhibitor of one-carbon metabolism, MTX, in Bp- and T-ALL, as evidenced by induction of several unfolded protein response markers leading to apoptosis. We also show for the first time that AICAr in combination with MTX significantly induces Akt phosphorylation in ALL. Under these conditions, the concomitant inhibition of Akt, a cellular antagonist of AMPK, leads to further upregulation of AMPK activity and alleviates AICAr plus MTX-induced ER stress and apoptosis. Therefore, we also show that the concomitant activation of AMPK actually rescues the cells from AICAr plus MTX-induced ER stress and apoptosis. Our data suggest that the effects of AMPK activation on cell death or survival differ contextually depending on its signaling alterations with related oncogenic pathways and provide insight into the reported paradoxical proapoptotic versus prosurvival effects of AMPK activation.","['Kuznetsov, Jeffim N', 'Leclerc, Guy J', 'Leclerc, Gilles M', 'Barredo, Julio C']","['Kuznetsov JN', 'Leclerc GJ', 'Leclerc GM', 'Barredo JC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, 1580 NW 10 Ave, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carbon/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/09/22 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0777 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0777 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2011 Mar;10(3):437-47. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0777.

Strategies to enhance the anticancer effects of RA could deepen and broaden its beneficial therapeutic applications. In this study, we describe a receptor cross-talk system that addresses this issue. RA effects are mediated by RAR/RXR receptors that we show are modified by interactions with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a protein functioning both as a transcription factor and a ligand-dependent adaptor in an ubiquitin ligase complex. RAR/RXR and AhR pathways cross-talk at the levels of ligand-receptor and also receptor-promoter interactions. Here, we assessed the role of AhR during RA-induced differentiation and a hypothesized convergence at Oct4, a transcription factor believed to maintain stem cell characteristics. RA upregulated AhR and downregulated Oct4 during differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. AhR overexpression in stable transfectants downregulated Oct4 and also decreased ALDH1 activity, another stem cell-associated factor, enhancing RA-induced differentiation as indicated by cell differentiation markers associated with early (CD38 and CD11b) and late (neutrophilic respiratory burst) responses. AhR overexpression also increased levels of activated Raf1, which is known to help propel RA-induced differentiation. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Oct4 enhanced RA-induced differentiation and G(0) cell-cycle arrest relative to parental cells. Consistent with the hypothesized importance of Oct4 downregulation for differentiation, parental cells rendered resistant to RA by biweekly high RA exposure displayed elevated Oct4 levels that failed to be downregulated. Together, our results suggested that therapeutic effects of RA-induced leukemia differentiation depend on AhR and its ability to downregulate the stem cell factor Oct4.","['Bunaciu, Rodica P', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Bunaciu RP', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'raf Kinases/metabolism']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/07/26 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-2299 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2299 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Mar 15;71(6):2371-80. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2299.

We and others have identified activating mutations of C-KIT in nearly half of patients with t(8;21) AML. To test the hypothesis that activating C-KIT mutations cooperate with AE to cause overt AML, we generated a murine transduction and transplantation model with both mutated C-KIT and AE. To overcome the intracellular transport block of human C-KIT in murine cells, we engineered hybrid C-KIT (HyC-KIT) by fusing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the murine c-Kit in-frame to the intracellular signaling domain of human C-KIT. We showed that tyrosine kinase domain mutants HyC-KIT N822K and D816V, as well as juxtamembrane mutants HyC-KIT 571+14 and 557-558Del, could transform murine 32D cells to cytokine-independent growth. The protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib inhibited the proliferation of 32D cells expressing these C-KIT mutants, with potency in the low nanomolar range. In mice, HyC-KIT N822K induced a myeloproliferative disease, whereas HyC-KIT 571+14 induces both myeloproliferative disease and lymphocytic leukemia. Interestingly, coexpression of AE and HyC-KIT N822K led to fatal AML. Our data have further enriched the two-hit model that abnormalities of both transcription factor and membrane/cytosolic signaling molecule are required in AML pathogenesis. Furthermore, dasatinib prolonged lifespan of mice bearing AE and HyC-KIT N822K-coexpressing leukemic cells and exerted synergic effects while combined with cytarabine, thus providing a potential therapeutic for t(8;21) leukemia.","['Wang, Yue-Ying', 'Zhao, Li-Juan', 'Wu, Chuan-Feng', 'Liu, Ping', 'Shi, Lin', 'Liang, Yang', 'Xiong, Shu-Min', 'Mi, Jian-Qing', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Ren, Ruibao', 'Chen, Sai-Juan']","['Wang YY', 'Zhao LJ', 'Wu CF', 'Liu P', 'Shi L', 'Liang Y', 'Xiong SM', 'Mi JQ', 'Chen Z', 'Ren R', 'Chen SJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/metabolism', '*Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/03/31 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1019625108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1019625108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Feb 8;108(6):2450-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1019625108.

To achieve functional specificity, Hox proteins associate with PBC class proteins, Pre-B cell leukemia homeobox (Pbx) in vertebrates, and Extradenticle (Exd) in Drosophila, and were thought to use a unique hexapeptide-dependent generic mode of interaction. Recent findings, however, revealed the existence of an alternative, UbdA-dependent paralog-specific interaction mode providing diversity in Hox-PBC interactions. In this study, we investigated the basis for the selection of one of these two Hox-PBC interaction modes. Using naturally occurring variations and mutations in the Drosophila Ultrabithorax protein, we found that the linker region, a short domain separating the hexapeptide from the homeodomain, promotes an interaction mediated by the UbdA domain in a context-dependent manner. While using a UbdA-dependent interaction for the repression of the limb-promoting gene Distalless, interaction with Exd during segment-identity specification still relies on the hexapeptide motif. We further show that distinctly assembled Hox-PBC complexes display subtle but distinct repressive activities. These findings identify Hox-PBC interaction as a template for subtle regulation of Hox protein activity that may have played a major role in the diversification of Hox protein function in development and evolution.","['Saadaoui, Mehdi', 'Merabet, Samir', 'Litim-Mecheri, Isma', 'Arbeille, Elise', 'Sambrani, Nagraj', 'Damen, Wim', 'Brena, Carlo', 'Pradel, Jacques', 'Graba, Yacine']","['Saadaoui M', 'Merabet S', 'Litim-Mecheri I', 'Arbeille E', 'Sambrani N', 'Damen W', 'Brena C', 'Pradel J', 'Graba Y']","['Institut de Biologie du Developpement de Marseille Luminy, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universite de la Mediterranee, 13288 Marseille Cedex 09, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/03/31 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1006964108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1006964108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Feb 8;108(6):2276-81. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1006964108.

Here we highlight the synergism and the underlying novel mechanism between RA and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to restore differentiation of RA-refractory APL blasts. First, we show that in RA-refractory APL cells (UF-1 cell line), PML-RA receptor alpha (RARalpha) is not released from target promoters in response to RA, resulting in the maintenance of chromatin repression. Consequently, RARalpha cannot be recruited, and the RA target genes are not activated. We then deciphered how the combination of G-CSF and RA successfully restored the activation of RA target genes to levels achieved in RA-sensitive APL cells. We demonstrate that G-CSF restores RARalpha recruitment to target gene promoters through the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the subsequent derepression of chromatin. Thus, combinatorial activation of cytokines and RARs potentiates transcriptional activity through epigenetic modifications induced by specific signaling pathways.","['Cassinat, B', 'Zassadowski, F', 'Ferry, C', 'Llopis, L', 'Bruck, N', 'Lainey, E', 'Duong, V', 'Cras, A', 'Despouy, G', 'Chourbagi, O', 'Beinse, G', 'Fenaux, P', 'Rochette Egly, C', 'Chomienne, C']","['Cassinat B', 'Zassadowski F', 'Ferry C', 'Llopis L', 'Bruck N', 'Lainey E', 'Duong V', 'Cras A', 'Despouy G', 'Chourbagi O', 'Beinse G', 'Fenaux P', 'Rochette Egly C', 'Chomienne C']","['INSERM UMR-S-940, Universite Paris Diderot, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France. bruno.cassinat@sls.aphp.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/biosynthesis', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 6/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00756-10 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00756-10 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2011 Apr;31(7):1409-18. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00756-10.

Gli3 has a dynamic expression pattern during embryonic development. In the neural tube, Gli3 transcripts are patterned along the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes such that the initial broad expression in the posterior neural tube becomes dorsally restricted as neurogenesis takes place. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate this dynamic expression. Here, we report on a phylogenetic analysis of the Gli3 locus that uncovered a novel regulatory element, HCNE1. HCNE1 contains a compound Pbx/Meis binding site that binds Pbx and Meis/Prep proteins in vitro and in vivo. We show that HCNE1 recapitulates Gli3 expression in the developing neural tube and that mutations in the Pbx/Meis binding site affect the spatiotemporal control of HCNE1 transcriptional activity. Ectopic expression or loss of function of Pbx and Meis/Prep proteins in the chick and mouse embryo results in aberrant expression of endogenous Gli3 transcripts.

TLR4 specifically recognises and responds to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria and participates in both autoimmune reactions and tissue regeneration due to its ability to recognise endogenous ligands. In the present study we show that mitochondria extracts obtained from hydrogen peroxide-dysfunctionalised cells induce a pro-inflammatory response in human THP-1 myeloid leukaemia cells. This inflammatory response was similar to that caused by LPS and much stronger than that induced by the extracts of normal mitochondria. Such reactions include activation of stress-adaptation hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) and expression/release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Pre-treatment of THP-1 myeloid macrophages with TLR4-neutralising antibody before exposure to mitochondria extracts or LPS attenuated the inflammatory responses. Signalling pathways recruited by TLR4 in response to LPS and mitochondria-derived ligands were found to be the same. An in vitro ELISA-based TLR4-ligand binding assay, in which the ligand-binding domain of human TLR4 was immobilised, showed that mitochondria extracts contain endogenous TLR4 ligands. These results were verified in surface plasmon resonance experiments in which the affinity of the ligands derived from dysfunctional mitochondria was comparable with that of LPS and was much higher than that observed for normal mitochondria.","['Nicholas, Sally A', 'Coughlan, Karen', 'Yasinska, Inna', 'Lall, Gurprit S', 'Gibbs, Bernhard F', 'Calzolai, Luigi', 'Sumbayev, Vadim V']","['Nicholas SA', 'Coughlan K', 'Yasinska I', 'Lall GS', 'Gibbs BF', 'Calzolai L', 'Sumbayev VV']","['Medway School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*metabolism']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/06/04 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2010/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1357-2725(11)00029-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2011.01.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2011 Apr;43(4):674-81. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2011.01.012.

However, in population studies using high-sensitivity flow cytometry, MBL may be detectable in more than 10% of adults aged over 60 years, and clinical progression is rare. The majority of MBL cases have features that are characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but an increasing amount of information is becoming available about MBL with the features of other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. In addition to flow cytometry findings, the incidental detection of an occult B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder is also occurring in a significant proportion of tissue biopsy samples.

One promising possibility is to use dietary agents that sensitize tumors to the chemotherapeutics. In this review, we discuss that the use of resveratrol can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The tumors shown to be sensitized by resveratrol include lung carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, promyelocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, oral epidermoid carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. The chemotherapeutic agents include vincristine, adriamycin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cisplatin, gefitinib, 5-fluorouracil, velcade, and gemcitabine. The chemosensitization of tumor cells by resveratrol appears to be mediated through its ability to modulate multiple cell-signaling molecules, including drug transporters, cell survival proteins, cell proliferative proteins, and members of the NF-kappaB and STAT3 signaling pathways. Interestingly, this nutraceutical has also been reported to suppress apoptosis induced by paclitaxel, vincristine, and daunorubicin in some tumor cells. The potential mechanisms underlying this dual effect are discussed. Overall, studies suggest that resveratrol can be used to sensitize tumors to standard cancer chemotherapeutics.","['Gupta, Subash C', 'Kannappan, Ramaswamy', 'Reuter, Simone', 'Kim, Ji Hye', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Gupta SC', 'Kannappan R', 'Reuter S', 'Kim JH', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/diet therapy/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Vegetables']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/03/11 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05852.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2011 Jan;1215:150-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05852.x.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",PMC3060406,,,"['CA-124787-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA124787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA124787-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16 672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA124787-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA124787-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA124787-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA026582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS248745'],,['(c) 2011 New York Academy of Sciences.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies have convincingly demonstrated that MCs form a separate lineage within the myeloid cell family. A most intriguing finding was that in contrast to normal MCs, neoplastic MCs in systemic mastocytosis (SM) aberrantly express several lymphoid marker antigens such as CD2 and CD25. This phenomenon has now been topped by the unexpected observation that neoplastic MCs in aggressive variants of SM and MC leukemia (leukemic variant of SM) aberrantly express CD30, whereas this antigen, Ki-1, is not detectable or is expressed only weakly in MCs in most patients with indolent SM. These observations may have implications for the evolution of SM as well as for diagnostic evaluation and grading in these patients. Moreover, these observations suggest that advanced SM has to be considered as a differential diagnosis of CD30-positive lymphoid neoplasms. Finally, CD30 may be considered as a potential target of antibody-based therapeutic intervention in advanced mast cell disorders.","['Valent, Peter', 'Sotlar, Karl', 'Horny, Hans-Peter']","['Valent P', 'Sotlar K', 'Horny HP']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Ki-1 Antigen/analysis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*diagnosis']",2011/01/26 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/01/26 06:00'],"['2011/01/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2010.550072 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 May;52(5):740-4. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2010.550072.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation and overexpression analyses demonstrated direct activation by GFI1B and LYL1 and inhibition by STAT5. HOXA9/HOXA10 activated expression of NMYC which in turn mediated MEF2C repression, indicating an indirect mode of regulation via NMYC interactor (NMI) and STAT5.

In October of 2009, a Working Group (WG) of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) met in Lyon, France to evaluate the available evidence for site-specific cancer to humans for 33 chemical agents and related occupations previously categorized by IARC as human carcinogens. Generally, review and discussion of the epidemiological cancer literature related to benzene was limited due to the enormous amount of material needing to be covered since the last full monograph meeting on benzene in 1981, and because 32 other chemicals and occupations were also being evaluated. Moreover, among the 33 chemicals and occupations reviewed, there was some inconsistency in the use of studies for evaluating various cancers. In some situations, consideration could have been given to the inclusion of relevant unpublished, but readily available study results. Discussion and synthesis of the animal cancer studies and mechanistic data related to specific cancers also were limited. IARC's conclusion that there is sufficient evidence for benzene to cause acute non-lymphocytic leukemia only was based on an incomplete review. IARC should schedule another monographs meeting dedicated to a complete and full review and discussion of all potential cancers related to exposure to benzene and to benzene-containing mixtures.","['Infante, Peter F']",['Infante PF'],"['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, The George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia 20037, USA. pinfante@starpower.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/classification/*toxicity', 'Congresses as Topic', 'Humans', '*International Agencies', 'Internationality', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'United States/epidemiology']",2011/01/25 06:00,2011/05/06 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2010/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajim.20887 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2011 Feb;54(2):157-64. doi: 10.1002/ajim.20887.

Further mechanistic investigation demonstrated that bufalin was able to significantly decrease Mcl-1 expression and modestly decrease Bcl-XL expression level. Down-regulations of these anti-apoptotic proteins were well correlated with inhibition of transcription factor STAT3 activation. The important consequence of down-regulation Mcl-1 in the enhancement action by combining bufalin with TRAIL was confirmed by either knockdown or overexpression of Mcl-1 approach. Our findings for the first time provided strong evidences that bufadienolide compounds have excellent potential to be developed as a novel class of sensitizers of TRAIL.","['Dong, Yinhui', 'Yin, Shutao', 'Li, Jinghua', 'Jiang, Cheng', 'Ye, Min', 'Hu, Hongbo']","['Dong Y', 'Yin S', 'Li J', 'Jiang C', 'Ye M', 'Hu H']","['Division of Nutrition and Health, College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering, China Agricultural University, No. 17 Qinghua East Road, Haidian District, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Bufanolides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",2011/01/25 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-011-0573-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2011 Apr;16(4):394-403. doi: 10.1007/s10495-011-0573-5.,,"['0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NPM1 mutations commonly found in human leukaemia are not present in thyroid tumours. Immunofluorescence in cultured cell lines was utilized to discriminate between nucleolar and nuclear localization. We show that in thyroid cancer cell lines NPM localizes both in the nucleolus and in nucleus, while in non-tumorigenic thyroid cell lines localizes only in nucleolus.

After one course of induction therapy, the overall complete remission rate was similar between treatment arms (58.7%, P = .92). Among 161 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (non-M5 subtype), estimated median overall survival was 39, 29, and 37 months, respectively, in the daunorubicin, standard-dose homoharringtonine, and high-dose homoharringtonine treatment groups (P = .53).

The great heterogeneity in molecular structure is reflected in its various important functions: CD44 mediates (1) interaction between cell and extracellular matrix, (2) signal submission, e.g., by acting as co-receptor for membrane-spanning receptor tyrosine kinases or by association with intracellular molecules initiating several signaling pathways, and (3) anchor function connecting to the cytoskeleton via the ezrin-radixin-moesin protein family. The expression pattern of the different CD44 isoforms display strong variations dependent on cell type, state of activation, and differentiation stage. In hematopoietic cells, CD44 mediates interaction of progenitor cells and bone marrow stroma during hematopoiesis, regulates maturation, and activation-induced cell death in T cells, influences neutrophil and macrophage migration as well as cytokine production, and participates in lymphocyte extravasation and migration. CD44 is involved in development and progress of hematological neoplasias by enhancement of apoptotic resistance, invasiveness, as well as regulation of bone marrow homing, and mobilization of leukemia-initiating cells into the peripheral blood. Thereby altered CD44 expression functions as marker for worse prognosis in most hematological malignancies. Additionally, CD44 expression levels can be used to distinguish between different hematological neoplasias and subtypes. Concerning new treatment strategies, CD44 displays promising potential either by direct targeting of CD44 expressed on the malignant cells or reversing an acquired resistance to primary treatment mediated through altered CD44 expression. The former can be achieved by antibody or hyaluronan-based immunotherapy.","['Hertweck, Magdalena Katharina', 'Erdfelder, Felix', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Hertweck MK', 'Erdfelder F', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University at Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50937, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hyaluronic Acid/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2011/01/25 06:00,2011/06/04 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2010/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1161-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 May;90(5):493-508. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1161-z.

To compare the GVL effect between IL-21R(-/-) and wild-type cells, we titrated the number of splenocytes required for the elimination of leukemic cells and found that the threshold of GVL effect was obtained between 5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(6) with both types of splenocytes. Cotransplantation with CD8-depleted splenocytes but not with purified CD8 T-cells resulted in a significant reduction in anti-leukemic effect of IL-21R(-/-) cells compared with wild-type cells, suggesting that the lack of IL-21 signaling primarily impairs CD4 T-cell rather than CD8 T-cell function and the comparable GVL effect with IL-21R(-/-) bulk splenocytes results from cooperative compensation by CD8 T-cells.","['Meguro, A', 'Ozaki, K', 'Hatanaka, K', 'Oh, I', 'Sudo, K', 'Ohmori, T', 'Matsu, H', 'Tatara, R', 'Sato, K', 'Sakata, Y', 'Nakae, S', 'Leonard, W J', 'Ozawa, K']","['Meguro A', 'Ozaki K', 'Hatanaka K', 'Oh I', 'Sudo K', 'Ohmori T', 'Matsu H', 'Tatara R', 'Sato K', 'Sakata Y', 'Nakae S', 'Leonard WJ', 'Ozawa K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke-shi, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-21 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukins/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology']",2011/01/25 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2010342 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2010.342 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2011 Dec;46(12):1557-65. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2010.342.

In breast tumours, increased Mcl-1 expression correlates with high tumour grade and poor patient survival. We have previously demonstrated that Her-2 levels correspond to increased Mcl-1 expression in breast tumours. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signalling is frequently deregulated in breast cancer and leads to increased proliferation and survival. Herein, we determined the critical downstream signals responsible for the EGF mediated increase of Mcl-1 and their role in cell survival. We found that both Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels are rapidly induced upon stimulation with EGF. Promoter analysis revealed that an Elk-1 transcription factor-binding site is critical for EGF activation of the Mcl-1 promoter. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of Elk-1 or inhibition of the Erk signalling pathway was sufficient to block EGF upregulation of Mcl-1 and EGF mediated cell survival. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and biotin labelled probes of the Mcl-1 promoter, we found that Elk-1 and serum response factor are bound to the promoter after EGF stimulation. To determine whether Mcl-1 confers a survival advantage, we found that knockdown of Mcl-1 expression increased apoptosis whereas overexpression of Mcl-1 inhibited drug induced cell death. In human breast tumours, we found a correlation between phosphorylated Elk-1 and Mcl-1 protein levels. These results indicate that the EGF induced activation of Elk-1 is an important mediator of Mcl-1 expression and cell survival and therefore a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.","['Booy, E P', 'Henson, E S', 'Gibson, S B']","['Booy EP', 'Henson ES', 'Gibson SB']","['Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Serum Response Element', 'Signal Transduction', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2011/01/25 06:00,2011/07/23 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010616 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.616 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 May 19;30(20):2367-78. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.616.

METHODS: One hundred and fifteen children aged 0-15 years with diagnosed lymphadenopathy at the Pediatric Clinic in Sarajevo during 2008 were included in the study. It analyzed age, sex, etiology and distribution and prevalence of lymphadenopathy. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference (p > 0,05) according to gender and age of children with lymphadenopathy. Leading etiological causes of lymphadenopathy were infections in 95% (62,7 %) and malignancies in 20 (13,3 %) cases. The most frequent isolated microorganisms were viruses in 65 children (65 %) and bacteria in 26 (28%) of children. Most frequent causes of malignant lymphadenopathy were acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 11 children (55 %) and acute myeloid leukemia in two (10%) children.

We evaluated the correlation between PB and bone marrow (BM) WT1 mRNA levels in the follow-up period of the clinical course of 17 AML patients. The levels of fusion gene transcripts in PB were also monitored when detected before chemotherapy. Patients with sustained complete remission (CR) showed a trend toward a higher WT1 mRNA reduction rate by induction therapy than patients who relapsed after CR (p=0.09). Correlation between the WT1 levels of PB and BM samples obtained on the same day was relatively strong (R=0.87). Among the four fusion transcript-positive patients, the levels of fusion transcripts and WT1 showed a similar transition pattern. These findings suggest that WT1 mRNA is a useful marker to improve risk-stratification for post-induction therapy and to guide management of individual AML patients by monitoring minimal residual disease, especially for patients with no disease-specific marker. Since WT1 monitoring via PB sampling is simple and less invasive than BM sampling, the use of this marker also improves patient management.","['Kitamura, Kunio', 'Nakano, Yasuyuki', 'Watamoto, Koichi', 'Koga, Daisuke', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Kitamura K', 'Nakano Y', 'Watamoto K', 'Koga D', 'Naoe T']","['Division of Hematology, Ichinomiya Municipal Hospital, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/*blood', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2011/01/25 06:00,2011/08/05 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['JST.JSTAGE/rinketsu/51.1748 [pii]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2010 Dec;51(12):1748-55.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, we discuss how chromosomal translocations leading to fusion proteins can aberrantly regulate gene transcription through chromatin modifications within the hematopoietic system. PML-RARa, AML1-ETO and MLL-fusions are examples of fusion proteins that mis-regulate epigenetic modifications (either directly or indirectly), which can lead to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML).

The bubbles generated by hydrodynamic cavitation are highly destructive at the surfaces of the target medium on which they are carefully focused. The resulting destructive energy output could be effectively used for biomedical treatments, such as destroying kidney stones (renal calculi) or killing cancer cells. Motivated by this potential, the cavitation damage to cancerous cells and material removal from chalk pieces (which possess similar material properties as some kidney stones) was investigated. Our results showed that cavitation could induce damage both on chalk pieces and leukemia/lymphoma cells. We discovered that hydrodynamic cavitation exposure had early and delayed effects on cancer cell survival. Hence, the potential of hydrodynamic bubbly cavitation generated at the microscale for biomedical treatments was revealed using the microchannel configuration as a microorifice (with an inner diameter of 147 mum and a length of 1.52 cm), which acts as the source of bubbly cavitating flows.","['Kosar, Ali', 'Sesen, Muhsincan', 'Oral, Ozlem', 'Itah, Zeynep', 'Gozuacik, Devrim']","['Kosar A', 'Sesen M', 'Oral O', 'Itah Z', 'Gozuacik D']","['Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Orhanli, Istanbul, Tuzla 34956, Turkey. kosara@sabanciuniv.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,0012737,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Calcium Carbonate', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diagnostic Imaging/*methods', 'Equipment Design', 'Humans', 'Hydrodynamics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kidney Calculi/diagnosis/pathology', '*Microbubbles', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Models, Biological', 'Phantoms, Imaging']",2011/01/25 06:00,2011/08/17 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1109/TBME.2011.2107322 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 2011 May;58(5):1337-46. doi: 10.1109/TBME.2011.2107322.

The function of a subset of gammadelta T cells has now also been shown to be dependent upon expression of PLZF. Furthermore, IL-4 produced by PLZF-expressing cells causes some CD8 T cells to acquire innate-like features. Therefore, it is becoming clear that PLZF has a broad impact on the immune response.

These results suggested the possible cooperation of sWT1 and fWT1 in the pathophysiology of AML, while further analysis is required.","['Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Ishikawa Y', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/25 06:00,2011/06/23 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2010/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00008-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.01.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 May;35(5):685-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.01.002.

This study was undertaken to evaluate risk of non-lung solid cancers among uranium miners in Pribram region, Czech Republic. METHODS: A retrospective stratified case-cohort study in a cohort of 22,816 underground miners who were employed between 1949 and 1975. All incident non-lung solid cancers were ascertained among miners who worked underground for at least 12 months (n=1020). A subcohort of 1707 subjects was randomly drawn from the same population by random sampling stratified on age. The follow-up period lasted from 1977 to 1996. RESULTS: Relative risks comparing 180 WLM (90th percentile) of cumulative lifetime radon exposure to 3 WLM (10th percentile) were 0.88 for all non-lung solid cancers combined (95% CI 0.73-1.04, n=1020), 0.87 for all digestive cancers (95% CI 0.69-1.09, n=561), 2.39 for gallbladder cancer (95% CI 0.52-10.98, n=13), 0.79 for larynx cancer (95% CI 0.38-1.64, n=62), 2.92 for malignant melanoma (95% CI 0.91-9.42, n=23), 0.84 for bladder cancer (95% CI 0.43-1.65, n=73), and 1.13 for kidney cancer (95% CI 0.62-2.04, n=66). No cancer type was significantly associated with radon exposure; only malignant melanoma and gallbladder cancer showed elevated but non-significant association with radon. CONCLUSIONS: Radon was not significantly associated with incidence of any cancer of interest, although a positive association of radon with malignant melanoma and gallbladder cancer cannot be entirely ruled out.","['Kulich, M', 'Rericha, V', 'Rericha, R', 'Shore, D L', 'Sandler, D P']","['Kulich M', 'Rericha V', 'Rericha R', 'Shore DL', 'Sandler DP']","['Department of Statistics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Sokolovska 83, CZ-186 75 Praha 8, Czech Republic. kulich@karlin.mff.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Environ Res,Environmental research,0147621,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Czech Republic/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', '*Mining', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radon/*poisoning', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk']",2011/01/25 06:00,2011/06/15 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2010/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0013-9351(11)00023-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.envres.2011.01.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Res. 2011 Apr;111(3):400-5. doi: 10.1016/j.envres.2011.01.008.

However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. The produced TNF-alpha is primarily cleaved and released by TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE), and the surface expression of TACE is down-regulated by endocytosis. As hypertonicity inhibits endocytosis, we evaluated the mechanism of hypertonicity-induced TNF-alpha release from activated human monocytic THP-1 cells. METHODS: THP-1 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in the presence or absence of hypertonic agents (150 mM sucrose or 150-300 mM NaCl). The amount of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein, surface expression of TACE and activation of signaling pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinase, Akt and NF-kappaB) were assayed. RESULTS: Hypertonic sucrose and NaCl significantly enhanced TNF-alpha release from THP-1 cells upon LPS or PMA stimulation. Hypertonic sucrose and other endocytosis inhibitors increased surface expression of TACE, but their effects on TNF-alpha release were inconsistent. This enhancement effect by hypertonicity was not attenuated by inhibition of TACE or IkappaB kinase, but it was blocked by cycloheximide and a MAP/ERK kinase inhibitor. The LPS- or PMA-induced TNF-alpha mRNA expression was not increased; rather, it was inhibited by hypertonicity. ERK1/2 was re-activated after sucrose treatment in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertonicity-enhanced TNF-alpha protein synthesis from LPS- or PMA-activated THP-1 cells requires ERK activation and may proceed without TACE. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: A vast amount of TNF-alpha production was regulated by a crucial post-transcriptional manner in activated human monocytic leukemia cells, and it may possibly be contributed to the cachexia condition.","['Chou, Yung-Chen', 'Sheu, Joen-Rong', 'Chung, Chi-Li', 'Hsiao, Che-Jen', 'Hsueh, Po-Jen', 'Hsiao, George']","['Chou YC', 'Sheu JR', 'Chung CL', 'Hsiao CJ', 'Hsueh PJ', 'Hsiao G']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.

The function of these proteins has previously been characterised in cell lines, often by transfecting expression constructs, and primary cell systems capable of dynamically regulating Bcl-XL and Bcl-XS have not been described. Such a system is potentially important to allow testing of agents that promote apoptosis by increasing the amount of Bcl-XS at the expense of Bcl-XL. In this report we characterise Bcl-X gene products in primary human leukaemic B-cells in culture conditions associated with survival and apoptosis. We found that Bcl-XS was induced in spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and that apoptosis induced in cells cultured on mouse fibroblasts expressing CD40 ligand with IL-4 (CD154/IL-4), a condition mimicking the tissue microenvironment, additionally produced expression of cleavage products of Bcl-XL. Both Bcl-XS and Bcl-XL were produced in a caspase dependent manner. We tested emetine, an agent previously reported to increase Bcl-XS but found that it did not have this effect in primary human B-cells. Therefore, there are two mechanisms-cleavage of Bcl-XL and production of Bcl-XS-by which Bcl-X gene products could enhance apoptosis in CLL but neither appeared to have a primary role in inducing leukaemic cell death.","['Willimott, Shaun', 'Merriam, Thomas', 'Wagner, Simon D']","['Willimott S', 'Merriam T', 'Wagner SD']","['Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine, and MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Emetine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/01/25 06:00,2011/04/07 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)00087-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.01.057 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 Feb 18;405(3):480-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.01.057.

JAK2 V617F mutant induced constitutive activation of Akt when erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) was coexpressed; however, the physiological role of Akt activation in MPDs has not been elucidated. LY294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, inhibited Akt activation and induced apoptotic cell death in cells expressing JAK2 V617F mutant and EpoR. Previously, it has been shown that the phosphorylation at Y479 in EpoR is critical for the interaction with PI3K, an upstream molecule of Akt. Hence, EpoR mutant with a point mutation of Y479F, which fails to activate Akt, is useful for addressing the role of Akt activation in JAK2 V617F mutant-induced tumorigenesis. Interestingly, under the expression of EpoR Y479F mutant, JAK2 V617F mutant failed to exhibit potent anti-apoptotic activity. In addition, JAK2 V617F mutant-induced phosphorylation of CREB and GSK-3beta was significantly decreased in cells expressing EpoR Y479F mutant, resulting in the downregulation of Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 expression. Furthermore, compared with when nude mice were inoculated with cells expressing JAK2 V617F mutant and EpoR, the lifespan of nude mice inoculated with cells expressing JAK2 V617F mutant and EpoR Y479F mutant was effectively prolonged. Taken together, it was clarified that PI3K-Akt activation through the phosphorylation of EpoR at Y479 is required for oncogenic signaling of JAK2 V617F mutant and that targeted disruption of this pathway has therapeutic utility.","['Kamishimoto, Jun', 'Tago, Kenji', 'Kasahara, Tadashi', 'Funakoshi-Tago, Megumi']","['Kamishimoto J', 'Tago K', 'Kasahara T', 'Funakoshi-Tago M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, 1-5-30 Shibakoen, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8512, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'CREB-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2011/01/25 06:00,2011/06/18 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2010/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(11)00010-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.01.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2011 May;23(5):849-56. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.01.009.

GS has been associated with various cytogenetic abnormalities, particularly with the t(8;21) translocation and less frequently the inv(16) type. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a rare case of GS of the small bowel, greater omentum and peritoneum, which caused obstruction, in a patient with AML associated with a CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion gene and an inv(16) (p13q22). In this patient there was only mild myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow aspiration but molecular analysis identified a CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion and inv(16) (p13;q22). CONCLUSION: Because of its nonspecific clinical and radiologic findings, this entity can be misdiagnosed and can mimic other solid neoplasms, making it a diagnostic challenge. In a GS with no or minimal morphological changes in bone marrow aspiration it is very important to perform a cytogenetic analysis to benefit from the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy.","['Alvarez, Paloma', 'Navascues, Carmen A', 'Ordieres, Carlos', 'Pipa, Maria', 'Vega, Ivan F', 'Granero, Pablo', 'Alvarez, Jose A', 'Rodriguez, Manuel']","['Alvarez P', 'Navascues CA', 'Ordieres C', 'Pipa M', 'Vega IF', 'Granero P', 'Alvarez JA', 'Rodriguez M']","['Service of Digestive, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Asturias, Spain. dra.palialvarez@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int Arch Med,International archives of medicine,101317943,,,2011/01/25 06:00,2011/01/25 06:01,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2010/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/25 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-7682-4-3 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-7682-4-3 [doi]']",epublish,Int Arch Med. 2011 Jan 21;4(1):3. doi: 10.1186/1755-7682-4-3.,20110121,,PMC3032668,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study the administration of the chemopreventive agent lupulone over the course of 7 weeks postinitiation reduced the number of preneoplastic lesions in the colonic mucosa by 50%. At the molecular level we observed the downregulation of genes involved in the inflammatory response, including IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, and of matrix metalloproteinase-7 gene and protein expression. We also observed a substantial upregulation of components of the innate immune system, alpha-defensin-5 and lipocalin 2. Lupulone induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes and caused a reversal of the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2; antiapoptotic) to Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax; proapoptotic) transcript and protein ratios (Bcl-2/Bax > 1 in AOM controls and Bcl-2/Bax < 1 in lupulone-treated AOM rats).

This protein has been found to be inactivated or functionally down-regulated in several malignancies such as Li-Fraumeni syndrom, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, p53 represents an attractive target for therapeutic design and development of new anticancer agents. The most clinically used cytotoxic agents target stabilization of wt-p53 through DNA damage and are associated with several unwanted and life threatening side effects. There are a number of recently developed approaches that hold promise for non-genotoxic reactivation of p53. Earlier, we have reported various inhibitors of p53 and their importance to prevent unwanted death of normal cells in a variety of diseases [1]. To extend p53 protein as new target for anticancer agents, in this review we discussed the mechanisms of p53 inactivation. Subsequently, we described some of recently developed non-genotoxic activators of p53 and their significance in various neoplastic disorders.

It exposes them to the risk of infection--including potentially fatal infections--and also leads to delays in treatment and reductions in dose intensity, which can compromise the possibility of a favorable outcome. AREAS COVERED: The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) and antibiotics to prevent febrile neutropenia (FN) and to ameliorate cancer chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression is discussed, based on a systematic search of Pubmed for clinical trials, reviews and meta-analysis published in the last 20 years. We consider that the treatment of FN, with the emphasis on careful attention to the patient, prompts antibiotic therapy and good hospital care. EXPERT OPINION: We would argue that antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered routinely to patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute leukemia and for patients with solid tumors and lymphoma receiving high-dose chemotherapy. In patients undergoing cyclical standard-dose myelosuppressive chemotherapy, we believe that prophylaxis is indicated during the first cycle of chemotherapy in which there is an expectation of grade 4 neutropenia (< 500 neutrophils). However, although the use of antibiotics and haematopoietic growth factors may improve quality of life by reducing the risk and consequences of FN, further study of the magnitude of their effects is needed.","['Saloustros, Emmanouil', 'Tryfonidis, Kostas', 'Georgoulias, Vassilis']","['Saloustros E', 'Tryfonidis K', 'Georgoulias V']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University General Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Consensus', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Quality of Life']",2011/01/25 06:00,2011/06/29 06:00,['2011/01/25 06:00'],"['2011/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2011.541155 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2011 Apr;12(6):851-63. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2011.541155.

We determined the morbidity related to HZ in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: Medical records of 226 children diagnosed with ALL were reviewed. Of these, 160 were seropositive at the time of diagnosis. HZ eruptions during primary chemotherapy, during therapy for relapse and following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were registered. RESULTS: A total of 90 eruptions were recorded: 63 first-time attacks and 27 recurrent episodes among 14 children. All eruptions were treated with acyclovir (ACV) and in 60% it was given intravenously. Cutaneous dissemination occurred in 11 cases, post herpetic neuralgia in five, visceral dissemination in none. During primary chemotherapy 47 children (29%) had HZ. The eruption rate was significantly higher in children on high risk protocols compared to children on standard/intermediate risk protocols (0.36 vs. 0.07/0.09 per year) and was related to intensity of chemotherapy. During therapy for relapse 7 of 29 (24%) had a total of 13 eruptions. Following BMT 9 of 26 (35%) had a total of 10 eruptions. CONCLUSION: Almost one third of the seropositive children had HZ during primary chemotherapy. Of those treated on high risk protocols more than half had one or more eruptions during the course of treatment. The risk of complicated HZ is small, but prolonged intensive chemotherapy can lead to considerable morbidity from repeated eruptions. Attempts to improve immunity by vaccination after attaining remission seem warranted.","['Sorensen, Gitte Vrelits', 'Rosthoj, Steen', 'Wurtz, Morten', 'Danielsen, Tore Kristian', 'Schroder, Henrik']","['Sorensen GV', 'Rosthoj S', 'Wurtz M', 'Danielsen TK', 'Schroder H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Oncology Unit, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark. vrelits@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Herpes Zoster/*complications/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Recurrence']",2011/01/22 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22969 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Dec 1;57(6):993-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22969.

Based on the results from our previous study, we deferred the initial lumbar puncture until day 8 in remission induction therapy in order to reduce the frequency of cases with TLP+. PROCEDURE: The study was conducted as a prospective cohort study within the Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group (TCCSG) L99-15 study. Between April 1999 and June 2003, 754 children with newly diagnosed ALL enrolled. The patients received the initial intrathecal chemotherapy after 7 days of prednisolone treatment. The incidence of central nervous system (CNS)-positive (the presence of leukemic blasts in cerebrospinal fluid or cranial nerve palsy) including TLP+ cases and cumulative incidence of CNS relapse were examined. RESULTS: The incidence of CNS-positive and TLP+ was 2.9% (n = 22) and 0.8% (n = 6), respectively. These incidences were much lower than those in the representative study groups employing the initial IT on day 1. Of 22 patients with CNS-positive, only one patient relapsed in CNS, whereas 22 of the remaining CNS-negative 723 patients suffered from CNS relapse. Overall, event-free survival at 4 year was 78.2 +/- 1.6%.

METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional evaluation of 116 ALL survivors (median age: 23.0 years; range: 18-37; average time from treatment: 17.5 years), including fasting laboratory testing (adiponectin, leptin, insulin, and glucose), anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and waist circumference), DXA (total body fat and truncal-to-lower-body-fat ratio), and abdominal CT (visceral fat). We estimated insulin resistance using the homeostasis model for assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Analytic approaches included regression models and Wilcoxon rank sum testing. RESULTS: Mean leptin per kilogram fat mass was higher for females (0.7 ng/ml/kg) than males (0.4 ng/ml/kg, P < 0.01), and among subjects who had received CRT compared to those who had not received CRT (females CRT =0.9 ng/ml/kg, no CRT = 0.7 ng/ml/kg; P = 0.1; males CRT = 0.5 ng/ml/kg, no CRT = 0.3 ng/ml/kg; P < 0.01). Elevated HOMA-IR was nearly uniformly present, even among subjects with BMI < 25 kg/m(2), and was associated with higher leptin:adiponectin ratio (LA ratio; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among survivors of childhood leukemia, higher leptin levels were associated with measures of body fat and insulin resistance. Anthropomorphic and metabolic changes many years after ALL treatment remain a major health problem facing survivors and may be related to central leptin resistance.","['Tonorezos, Emily S', 'Vega, Gloria L', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Chou, Joanne F', 'Moskowitz, Chaya S', 'Mo, Qianxing', 'Church, Timothy S', 'Ross, Robert', 'Janiszewski, Peter M', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C']","['Tonorezos ES', 'Vega GL', 'Sklar CA', 'Chou JF', 'Moskowitz CS', 'Mo Q', 'Church TS', 'Ross R', 'Janiszewski PM', 'Oeffinger KC']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adipokines/*metabolism', '*Adipose Tissue', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chemoradiotherapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Male', 'Obesity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', '*Survivors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/22 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22964 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jan;58(1):31-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22964.

An earlier study showed that the outcome of adolescents highly differed on these protocols. PROCEDURE: In this retrospective study, we analyzed whether the outcome of older children 10-15 years of age at diagnosis differed between the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-based ALL-8 regimen and the ALL-9 regimen. Two hundred fifty-four older children who were treated according to protocol ALL-8 (n = 82) or ALL-9 (n = 172) were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A higher 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was found for patients treated according to ALL-8 compared to ALL-9 (79 +/- 5% vs. 65 +/- 4%, P = 0.02). Patient characteristics did not differ except for a slightly higher age in ALL-8. Therefore, additional analyses were done including only patients who were 12-15 years of age. In this age group there was also a difference in the 5-year EFS (82 +/- 5% vs. 61 +/- 5%, P = 0.00) as well as in the 5-year overall survival rate; 89 +/- 4% compared to 68 +/- 5%, respectively (P = 0.01). Major difference between protocols was the use of a consolidation and reinduction/intensification course and higher cumulative doses of asparaginase, methotrexate, and anthracyclines in ALL-8. CONCLUSIONS: Children 10-15 years of age have been undertreated with the ALL-9 regimen and benefit by intensive treatment components as used in ALL-8. We recommend using BFM-based protocols for these older children with ALL.","['Boudestein, Kris', 'Kamps, Willem A', 'Veerman, Anjo J P', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Boudestein K', 'Kamps WA', 'Veerman AJ', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Netherlands', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/01/22 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22962 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jan;58(1):17-22. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22962.

We have previously reported that rutin induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in murine leukemia WEHI-3 cells in vitro and in vivo. However, there are no data showing that rutin inhibits human leukemia HL-60 cells in vivo in a murine xenograft animal model. Human leukemia HL-60 cells were implanted into mice and treated with vehicle (1% DMSO), rutin (120 mg/kg of body weight) or vinblastine (120 mug/kg of body weight). Compounds and agents were injected once every four days intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 36 days. Treatment with 120 mg/kg of rutin or with 120 mug/kg of vinblastine resulted in a reduction of tumor weight and volume when compared with the control groups. Tumor size in xenograft mice treated with 120 mg/kg of rutin was significantly smaller than that in the untreated-control group. These novel findings indicate that rutin inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft animal model. Rutin may be useful in treating leukemia but certainly much more research is needed.

In healthy women, breastfeeding provides protection against many of these complications. Breastfeeding may be beneficial for mothers surviving childhood cancer by decreasing risks of, or ameliorating adverse late effects. Healthcare providers and survivors should be aware that successful lactation may be affected by previous cancer treatment. METHODS: The literature addressing lactation outcomes in cancer patients is reviewed, and processes that may disrupt breastfeeding are discussed. A summary of common late effects experienced by women is provided, and arguments are made for the potential amelioration of these complications by breastfeeding. RESULTS: Findings demonstrate that breastfeeding is beneficial for healthy mothers in regard to specific health conditions. There are limited data addressing breastfeeding outcomes among cancer survivors. Preliminary findings suggest that lactation is adversely affected among mothers treated for childhood cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Fundamental research is needed to determine rates of breastfeeding in childhood cancer survivors, identify specific cancer therapies and their effects on lactation, examine the efficacy of breastfeeding in risk reduction and/or amelioration of late effects, and develop interventions to increase breastfeeding among survivors of childhood cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: As female childhood cancer survivors transition into adult medical care, it is important each patient be aware of her past medical history and the impact of treatment on her ability to successfully lactate. If lactation is possible, these women can choose to breastfeed their children, thereby engaging in a health behavior that may help protect them against many late effects of cancer treatment.","['Ogg, Susan W', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Randolph, Mary E', 'Klosky, James L']","['Ogg SW', 'Hudson MM', 'Randolph ME', 'Klosky JL']","[""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,IM,"['Bone Density', '*Breast Feeding', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control', 'Counseling', 'Diabetes Mellitus/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/physiopathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Lactation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/physiopathology/therapy', 'Metabolic Syndrome/prevention & control', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/physiopathology/therapy', 'Obesity/prevention & control', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/physiopathology/therapy', '*Survivors']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-010-0169-z [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2011 Jun;5(2):175-81. doi: 10.1007/s11764-010-0169-z.

Pre-clinical and early phase clinical trials identify therapeutic activity using a combination of HDACi and demethylating agents which may be more efficacious than single agent treatment. Our studies aimed to determine the effects and molecular mechanisms of action of novel hydroxamate (MCT-3) and benzamide [MGCD0103 (MG)] HDACi's in the HL-60 cell line alone and in combination with the demethylating agent 5-aza-cytidine (AZA). MG, MCT-3 and AZA treatment significantly inhibited HL-60 cell growth in vitro with MG being the most potent agent. MG in combination with AZA demonstrated no significant increase in inhibition of cell growth over MG treatment alone whilst MCT-3 in combination with AZA demonstrated increased inhibition of cell growth over either agent alone although no more significant than MG alone. MG alone or MCT-3 in combination with AZA significantly increased p15 and caspase-3 expression. MG and MCT-3 significantly attenuated AZA-induced MMP-9 mRNA expression and proteolytic activity. Interestingly, MCT-3, MG and AZA alone and in combination increased expression of the novel tumour suppressor gene Nur77, important in leukemogenesis, with MG a more potent inducer as a single agent. These observations suggest the enhanced anti-leukemia activity of the combination of AZA and HDACi may only reside with certain HDACi classes and may be in-part explained by regulation of genes associated with cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and tumour suppression.","['Liu, H B', 'Mayes, P A', 'Perlmutter, P', 'McKendrick, J J', 'Dear, A E']","['Liu HB', 'Mayes PA', 'Perlmutter P', 'McKendrick JJ', 'Dear AE']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, 6th Floor Burnett Tower, 89 Commercial Road, Prahran 3181, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/genetics']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2011.914 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2011 May;38(5):1421-5. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2011.914.

The regulation of this process is therefore key to understanding and manipulating inflammation resolution. Previous data have suggested that the short-lived pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein, Mcl-1, is instrumental in determining neutrophil lifespan. However, Mcl-1 can be cleaved following caspase activity, and the possibility therefore remains that the observed fall in Mcl-1 levels is due to caspase activity downstream of caspase activation, rather than being a key event initiating apoptosis in human neutrophils.We demonstrate that apoptosis in highly purified neutrophils can be almost completely abrogated by caspase inhibition with the highly effective di-peptide caspase inhibitor, Q-VD.OPh, confirming the caspase dependence of neutrophil apoptosis. Effective caspase inhibition does not prevent the observed fall in Mcl-1 levels early in ultrapure neutrophil culture, suggesting that this fall in Mcl-1 levels is not a consequence of neutrophil apoptosis. However, at later timepoints, declines in Mcl-1 can be reversed with effective caspase inhibition, suggesting that Mcl-1 is both an upstream regulator and a downstream target of caspase activity in human neutrophils.","['Wardle, David J', 'Burgon, Joseph', 'Sabroe, Ian', 'Bingle, Colin D', 'Whyte, Moira K B', 'Renshaw, Stephen A']","['Wardle DJ', 'Burgon J', 'Sabroe I', 'Bingle CD', 'Whyte MK', 'Renshaw SA']","['Medical Research Council Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'Time Factors']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0015768 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Jan 6;6(1):e15768. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0015768.,20110106,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",PMC3017075,,,"['G108/595/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0700091/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0701932/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While antagonizing Survivin normalizes ITD-Flt3-induced acute leukemia, it also impairs hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function, indicating that identification of differences in signaling pathways downstream of Survivin between LSC and HSC are crucial to develop selective Survivin-based therapeutic strategies for AML. Using a Survivin-deletion model, we identified 1,096 genes regulated by Survivin in ITD-Flt3-transformed c-kit(+), Sca-1(+), and lineage(neg) (KSL) cells, of which 137 are deregulated in human LSC. Of the 137, 124 genes were regulated by Survivin exclusively in ITD-Flt3(+) KSL cells but not in normal CD34(neg) KSL cells. Survivin-regulated genes in LSC connect through a network associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway and falls into various functional categories independent of effects on apoptosis. Pathways downstream of Survivin in LSC that are distinct from HSC can be potentially targeted for selective anti-LSC therapy.","['Fukuda, Seiji', 'Abe, Mariko', 'Onishi, Chie', 'Taketani, Takeshi', 'Purevsuren, Jamiyan', 'Yamaguchi, Seiji', 'Conway, Edward M', 'Pelus, Louis M']","['Fukuda S', 'Abe M', 'Onishi C', 'Taketani T', 'Purevsuren J', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Conway EM', 'Pelus LM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, 89-1 Enya-Cho, Izumo, Shimane 693-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,2011/01/22 06:00,2011/01/22 06:01,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/946936 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol. 2011;2011:946936. doi: 10.1155/2011/946936.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 127 adult AA patients who had successful cytogenetic analysis at initial diagnosis. RESULTS: The patients were classified into 3 groups according to the initial and follow-up results of cytogenetic profiles. Group 1 included patients who had persistent AA with normal cytogenetic profiles (N=117); Group 2, those who had a normal cytogenetic profile at initial diagnosis but later acquired CA (N=4, 3.1%); and Group 3, those who had CA at the initial diagnosis, regardless of follow-up cytogenetic status (N=6,4.7%). In Group 2, 2 patients later developed CA without progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); the other 2 patients later progressed to AML. None of the patients in Group 3 progressed to AML or MDS. There was no significant difference in overall survival between Groups 1 and 3. CONCLUSION: AA patients with CA at initial diagnosis or follow-up may not be at greater risk for evolution to AML or MDS, or show shorter survival periods.

METHODS: In this study, we reviewed the outcome of pediatric APL patients treated using a modified AIDA protocol at our institution. RESULTS: Between May 1999 and December 2007, 23 patients were diagnosed with APL at the Department of Pediatrics, Saint Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea. Eleven patients were male (48%) (median age at diagnosis, 11 (range, 2-14) years). The treatment protocol consisted of remission induction (achieved by coadministration of ATRA and idarubicin), 3 courses of consolidation treatment, and 2 years of maintenance treatment during which ATRA was also administered. Three patients died early during remission induction due to CNS hemorrhage. The remaining 20 patients achieved complete remission (CR), with an overall CR rate of 87%. Two patients relapsed and died, and another patient died of pneumonia unrelated to APL. Four patients (17%) were diagnosed with ATRA syndrome, and all patients showed resolution of symptoms. The event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of the cohort were 78.3+/-8.6% and 76.3+/-9.5%, respectively. Initial WBC count at diagnosis was the only significant prognostic factor for the rate of CR (P=0.039) and OS (P=0.039). CONCLUSION: A modified AIDA protocol for the treatment of childhood APL leads to improved EFS and OS, with limited ATRA syndrome-associated toxicity. Active monitoring and treatment of patients with high initial WBC counts may help in reducing mortality.","['Kim, Myoung-Hyun', 'Choi, Cheol-Soon', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Jang, Pil-Sang', 'Chung, Nak-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Jeong, Dae-Chul', 'Kim, Hack-Ki']","['Kim MH', 'Choi CS', 'Lee JW', 'Jang PS', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Jeong DC', 'Kim HK']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,,,2011/01/22 06:00,2011/01/22 06:01,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2010.45.4.236 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2010 Dec;45(4):236-41. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2010.45.4.236.

To investigate the potential of PcG proteins as leukemia-associated antigens, and as targets for graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects, we studied cells obtained from 86 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 25 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201(+) sibling donors collected before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Although BMI-1 overexpression in CD34(+) cells of CML patients treated with pharmacotherapy is associated with poor prognosis, we found, conversely, that in CML patients treated with SCT, a higher expression of BMI-1, and correspondingly a lower expression of its target for repression, CDKN2A, is associated with improved leukemia-free survival. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses to the BMI-1 peptide were detected in 5 of 25 (20%) donors, and in 8 of 19 (42%) HLA-A*0201(+) CML patients. BMI-1 generated more total and high-avidity immune responses, and was more immunogenic than EZH2. PcG-specific CTLs had a memory phenotype, were readily expanded in short-term cultures and were detected after SCT in recipients of PcG-specific CTL-positive donors. A higher BMI-1 expression in CML CD34(+) progenitors was associated with native BMI-1 immune responses. These immune responses to PcG proteins may target leukemia stem cells and have relevance for disease control by GVL.","['Yong, A S M', 'Stephens, N', 'Weber, G', 'Li, Y', 'Savani, B N', 'Eniafe, R', 'Keyvanfar, K', 'Kurlander, R', 'Rezvani, K', 'Barrett, A J']","['Yong AS', 'Stephens N', 'Weber G', 'Li Y', 'Savani BN', 'Eniafe R', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Kurlander R', 'Rezvani K', 'Barrett AJ']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1202, USA. yonga@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'HLA-A Antigens', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010325 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.325 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Apr;25(4):629-37. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.325.

RECENT FINDINGS: Besides patients in hematology units, other immunosuppressed and critically ill patients are also at risk of IPA. Identification of patients who possess specific polymorphisms of Toll-like receptor 4 and dectin-1, both of which are involved in the immune sensing of Aspergillus spp., may facilitate risk-stratification. The use of the galactomannan assay in bronchoalveolar fluid to improve diagnosis of IPA is undergoing validation. Trending galactomannan and other biomarker results may prognosticate clinical outcomes. During intensive chemotherapy for leukemia, posaconazole and aerosolized liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) have demonstrated efficacy as prophylaxis against invasive fungal infection. However, fluconazole remains an effective prophylactic agent in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation despite availability of newer antifungal agents. Although voriconazole is still the drug of choice for IPA, both caspofungin and L-AMB are viable alternatives. SUMMARY: Despite increasing knowledge of IPA and availability of newer antifungal agents, clinical management remains a challenge in the setting of a compromised host defense system that is unable to mount an appropriate immune response against the pathogen.","['Chai, Louis Yi-Ann', 'Hsu, Li-Yang']","['Chai LY', 'Hsu LY']","['Department of Medicine, National University Health System Singapore, 1E Kent Ridge Road, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Pulm Med,Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,9503765,IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Mannans/blood', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/genetics', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/07/20 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MCP.0b013e328343eb49 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2011 May;17(3):160-6. doi: 10.1097/MCP.0b013e328343eb49.,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (dectin 1)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Encouraging outcome in this population has led to the question of whether RIC should replace standard myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens. This review will summarize the available outcomes data comparing RIC and MAC approaches to stem cell transplantation in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute lymphoid leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: There are currently no completed prospective randomized controlled studies comparing outcomes of RIC to MAC. The best insight into differences in outcome comes from large registry-based retrospective studies. These studies demonstrate that the use of RIC is associated with a reduction in transplant-related mortality but an increased risk of disease relapse. As a result, for patients undergoing stem cell transplantation in remission, disease free and overall survival are similar. SUMMARY: The current retrospective data provide justification for the use of RIC regimens in all adult stem cell transplant candidates with acute leukemia in remission and MDS. More definitive conclusions regarding differences between the MAC and RIC approach to stem cell transplantation await results of ongoing prospective randomized trials.","['Horwitz, Mitchell E']",['Horwitz ME'],"['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.

Here we review recent advances in knowledge of the risk factors, pathogenesis, and treatment of t-MDS. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have provided important new information regarding genetic risk factors that may predispose individual patients to develop t-MDS after exposure to cytotoxic therapeutic agents and that may be used to predict individuals at enhanced risk for this complication. The role of specific candidate genes associated with commonly involved genetic lesions in the pathogenesis of t-MDS has also been investigated. Finally, factors determining outcomes of transplantation treatment for this disorder have been elucidated. Hematopoietic cell transplantation provides potentially curative therapy for t-MDS, but additional improvements are necessary to improve outcomes. SUMMARY: Improved understanding of genetic risk factors is expected to facilitate early identification of patients at risk for t-MDS, guiding therapeutic decision making, and allowing early application of preventive or therapeutic strategies.","['Bhatia, Ravi', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Bhatia R', 'Deeg HJ']","['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA. rbhatia@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/*chemically induced', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*genetics/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328343997a [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Mar;18(2):77-82. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328343997a.,,,PMC3437333,,,"['P01HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL083050/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA107399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL083050/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA107399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS400631'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are currently three drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for front-line treatment of CML: imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. A fourth drug, bosutinib, may also win FDA approval in 2011. The goal of this review is to summarize the most recent information on initial treatment of CML and to aid clinicians in managing newly diagnosed CML patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Phase III studies comparing imatinib with nilotinib or dasatinib in newly diagnosed CML were published in June 2010, leading to accelerated FDA approval for both of these 'second-generation' TKIs for initial therapy of CML. There are significant differences between the agents in terms of frequency and rate of responses, progression-free survival, and side-effects. However, the follow-up period on these trials is short, and there are as yet no significant differences in overall survival. Guidelines for monitoring CML patients on TKI therapy have been recently revised. SUMMARY: Management of newly diagnosed CML patients in the coming decade will begin to resemble antibiotic treatment of infection, with therapy individualized based on patient risk factors, co-morbidities, and tolerability. In addition, the cost of therapy will emerge as an important consideration as generic imatinib becomes available in 2015. In this context, clinical trials to guide decision-making in newly diagnosed CML patients are needed.","['Okimoto, Ross A', 'Van Etten, Richard A']","['Okimoto RA', 'Van Etten RA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Aniline Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Nitriles/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834399a5 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Mar;18(2):89-97. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834399a5.,,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",PMC3496274,,,"['R01 CA090576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL089747/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA090576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS287518'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous work suggested that NF-YB may be a mediator of topoisomerase IIalpha (Top2alpha), working through the Top2alpha promoter. DNA topoisomerase II (Top2) is an essential nuclear enzyme and the primary target for several clinically important anticancer drugs. Our teniposide-resistant human lymphoblastic leukemia CEM cells (CEM/VM-1-5) express reduced Top2alpha protein compared with parental CEM cells. To study the regulation of Top2alpha during the development of drug resistance, we found that NF-YB protein expression is increased in CEM/VM-1-5 cells compared with parental CEM cells. This further suggests that increased NF-YB may be a negative regulator of Top2alpha in CEM/VM-1-5 cells. We asked what causes the up-regulation of NF-YB in CEM/VM-1-5 cells. We found by microRNA profiling that hsa-miR-485-3p is lower in CEM/VM-1-5 cells compared with CEM cells. MicroRNA target prediction programs revealed that the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of NF-YB harbors a putative hsa-miR-485-3p binding site. We thus hypothesized that hsa-miR-485-3p mediates drug responsiveness by decreasing NF-YB expression, which in turn negatively regulates Top2alpha expression. To test this, we overexpressed miR-485-3p in CEM/VM-1-5 cells and found that this led to reduced expression of NF-YB, a corresponding up-regulation of Top2alpha, and increased sensitivity to the Top2 inhibitors. Results in CEM cells were replicated in drug-sensitive and -resistant human rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 cells, suggesting that our findings represent a general phenomenon. Ours is the first study to show that miR-485-3p mediates Top2alpha down-regulation in part by altered regulation of NF-YB.","['Chen, Cheng-Fen', 'He, Xiaolong', 'Arslan, Ahmet Dirim', 'Mo, Yin-Yuan', 'Reinhold, William C', 'Pommier, Yves', 'Beck, William T']","['Chen CF', 'He X', 'Arslan AD', 'Mo YY', 'Reinhold WC', 'Pommier Y', 'Beck WT']","['Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Teniposide/toxicity', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/06/01 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.110.069633 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.110.069633 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2011 Apr;79(4):735-41. doi: 10.1124/mol.110.069633.

It binds to both human VEGF (hVEGF) and human PlGF (hPlGF) and to mouse VEGF (mVEGF) and mouse PlGF (mPlGF). In vitro, sFLT01 inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and pericytes stimulated by either hVEGF or hPlGF. In vivo, sFLT01 had robust and significant antitumor activity in numerous preclinical subcutaneous tumor models including H460 non-small cell lung carcinoma, HT29 colon carcinoma, Karpas 299 lymphoma, MOLM-13 AML (acute myeloid leukemia), 786-O, and RENCA renal cell carcinoma (RCC). sFLT01 also increased median survival in the orthotopic RENCA RCC model. sFLT01 had strong antiangiogenic activity and altered intratumoral microvessel density, blood vessel lumen size and perimeter, and vascular and vessel areas in RCC models. sFLT01 treatment resulted in fewer endothelial cells and pericytes within the tumor microenvironment. sFLT01 in combination with cyclophosphamide resulted in greater inhibition of tumor growth than either agent used alone as a monotherapy in the A673 Ewing's sarcoma model. Gene expression profiling indicated that the molecular changes in the A673 sarcoma tumors are similar to changes observed under hypoxic conditions. sFLT01 is an innovative fusion protein that possessed robust antitumor and antiangiogenic activities in preclinical cancer models. It is a dual targeting agent that neutralizes both VEGF and PlGF and, therefore, has potential as a next generation antiangiogenic therapeutic for oncology.","['Bagley, Rebecca G', 'Kurtzberg, Leslie', 'Weber, William', 'Nguyen, Tri-Hung', 'Roth, Stephanie', 'Krumbholz, Roy', 'Yao, Min', 'Richards, Brenda', 'Zhang, Mindy', 'Pechan, Peter', 'Schmid, Steve', 'Scaria, Abraham', 'Kaplan, Johanne', 'Teicher, Beverly A']","['Bagley RG', 'Kurtzberg L', 'Weber W', 'Nguyen TH', 'Roth S', 'Krumbholz R', 'Yao M', 'Richards B', 'Zhang M', 'Pechan P', 'Schmid S', 'Scaria A', 'Kaplan J', 'Teicher BA']","['Genzyme Corporation, 49 New York Ave., Framingham, MA 01701, USA.

Human CD59 (hCD59) is a key complement regulatory protein that restricts the formation of the membrane attack complex, thereby inhibiting induction of CDC. hCD59 is highly expressed in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and upregulation of hCD59 is an important determinant of the sensitivity of NHL cells to rituximab treatment. Here, we report that the potent hCD59 inhibitor rILYd4 enhances CDC in vitro and in vivo, thereby sensitizing rituximab-resistant lymphoma cells and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (CLL) to rituximab treatment. By defining pharmcokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles of rILYd4 in mice, we showed that by itself rILYd4 does not adversely mediate in vivo hemolysis of hCD59-expressing erythrocytes. Increasing expression levels of the complement regulators CD59 and CD55 in rituximab-resistant cells occur due to selection of preexisting clones rather than de novo induction of these proteins. Moreover, lymphoma cells overexpressing CD59 were directly responsible for the resistance to rituximab-mediated CDC therapy. Our results rationalize the use of rILYd4 as a therapeutic adjuvant for rituximab treatment of rituximab-resistant lymphoma and CLL. Furthermore, they suggest that preemptive elimination of CD59-overexpressing subpopulations along with rituximab treatment may be a useful approach to ablate or conquer rituximab resistance.","['Hu, Weiguo', 'Ge, Xiaowen', 'You, Tao', 'Xu, Ting', 'Zhang, Jinyan', 'Wu, Gongxiong', 'Peng, Zhihai', 'Chorev, Michael', 'Aktas, Bertal H', 'Halperin, Jose A', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Qin, Xuebin']","['Hu W', 'Ge X', 'You T', 'Xu T', 'Zhang J', 'Wu G', 'Peng Z', 'Chorev M', 'Aktas BH', 'Halperin JA', 'Brown JR', 'Qin X']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Laboratory for Translational Research, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA. weiguo_hu@hms.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacteriocins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'CD59 Antigens/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cytotoxins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Rituximab', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/07/26 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-3016 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3016 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Mar 15;71(6):2298-307. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3016.

This cohort study was designed to compare the outcomes of imatinib (n = 87) versus allo-HSCT (n = 45) for AP-CML. A multivariate analysis of the total population revealed that a CML duration >/= 12 months, hemoglobin < 100 g/L, and peripheral blood blasts >/= 5% were independent adverse prognostic factors for both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Both treatments resulted in similar survival in low-risk (no factor) patients, with 6-year event-free survival (EFS), OS, and PFS rates of more than 80.0%. Intermediate-risk (any factor) patients showed no difference in EFS and OS, but 6-year PFS rates were 55.7% versus 92.9% (P = .047) with imatinib versus allo-HSCT, respectively. Among high-risk (at least 2 factors) patients, imatinib was by far inferior to allo-HSCT, with 5-year EFS, OS, and PFS rates of 9.3% versus 66.7% (P = .034), 17.7% versus 100% (P = .008), and 18.8% versus 100% (P = .006), respectively. We conclude that allo-HSCT confers significant survival advantages for high- and intermediate-risk patients with AP-CML compared with imatinib treatment; however, the outcomes of the 2 therapies are equally good in low-risk patients.

The aims are to evaluate the clinical features, prognostic factors, and efficacy of treatments in pPCL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was carried out from January 2000 to December 2008 in 26 Italian hematology divisions. A total of 128 cases of plasma cell leukemia were collected, and 73 of them (57%) were classified as primary (male/female 43/30). RESULTS: Sixty-four patients had at least 1 sign of end-organ damage and 10 had extramedullary localization. One patient died early; of the remaining patients, 36 (50%) received anthracycline-based regimens as first-line therapy, 17 (24%) single alkylating agents, and 30 (42%) bortezomib or thalidomide as additional (n = 11) or unique treatments (n = 19). Twenty-three patients (31%) underwent autologous and/or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The median overall survival (OS) was 12.6 months; complete or partial response was achieved in 22 (30%) and 18 patients (25%), respectively; the median duration of response (DOR) was 16.4 months. HSCT patients had a longer OS and DOR (median 38.1 and 25.8 months, respectively) compared with nontransplanted patients (9.1 and 7.3 months, respectively, P < 0.001). OS was influenced by nonresponse to treatment, hypoalbuminemia, and HSCT. DOR was favorably influenced only by HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: pPCL is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis and a low response rate to conventional therapy. HSCT is effective, increasing OS and DOR by 69% and 88%, respectively. The use of bortezomib and thalidomide may improve outcomes.","['Pagano, L', 'Valentini, C G', 'De Stefano, V', 'Venditti, A', 'Visani, G', 'Petrucci, M T', 'Candoni, A', 'Specchia, G', 'Visco, C', 'Pogliani, E M', 'Ferrara, F', 'Galieni, P', 'Gozzetti, A', 'Fianchi, L', 'De Muro, M', 'Leone, G', 'Musto, P', 'Pulsoni, A']","['Pagano L', 'Valentini CG', 'De Stefano V', 'Venditti A', 'Visani G', 'Petrucci MT', 'Candoni A', 'Specchia G', 'Visco C', 'Pogliani EM', 'Ferrara F', 'Galieni P', 'Gozzetti A', 'Fianchi L', 'De Muro M', 'Leone G', 'Musto P', 'Pulsoni A']","['Institute of Hematology, Catholic University, Rome.

AIM: To determine if casticin, one of the constituents of Vitex rotundifolia L., has anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects in asthma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of casticin was studied in A549 human type II-like epithelial lung cells using an eotaxin inhibition assay. Additionally, its effects on eotaxin, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and inter-cellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression were investigated by real time-polymerase chain reaction (real time-PCR). The inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity in the presence of casticin was determined by analyzing confocal microscopy images of fluorescence immunocytochemical analysis while the suppression of inhibitory kappaB (IkappaB)-alpha phosphorylation was studied using Western blot analysis. Finally, the inhibitory effect of casticin on eosinophil migration toward prestimulated A549 cell media was measured using the human eosinophilic leukemia cell line. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Casticin significantly suppressed eotaxin production in cytokine activated A549 lung epithelial cells. Casticin also suppressed the mRNA expression levels of eotaxin, RANTES, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1, which subsequently contributed to the inhibition of eosinophil migration. Furthermore, casticin inhibited IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 in A549 cells. CONCLUSION: Casiticin inhibited the eosinophil migration and activity of chemokines and adhesion molecules involved in the inflammatory process of asthma by suppressing the NF-kappaB pathway. These results suggest that casticin has the potential for use in the treatment of allergic asthma.","['Koh, Duck-jae', 'Ahn, Hong-sik', 'Chung, Hwan-Suck', 'Lee, Hyojung', 'Kim, Youngchul', 'Lee, Jin-yong', 'Kim, Deog-gon', 'Hong, Moochang', 'Shin, Minkyu', 'Bae, Hyunsu']","['Koh DJ', 'Ahn HS', 'Chung HS', 'Lee H', 'Kim Y', 'Lee JY', 'Kim DG', 'Hong M', 'Shin M', 'Bae H']","['Department of Physiology, College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Asthma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokines, CC/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Eosinophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Lung/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Vitex/*chemistry']",2011/01/22 06:00,2012/01/11 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(11)00015-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2011.01.014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2011 Jul 14;136(3):399-405. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2011.01.014.

It has an oncogenic role in many different solid tumors. In this study, the expression of LRF was evaluated in benign prostate hyperplastic (BPH) and prostate cancer (PC) tissues. The functional expression of LRF was studied using multiple cellular and molecular methods including RT-PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Paraffin-embedded human tissues of BPH and PC were used to examine LRF expression. Histological staining of the BPH and PC tissue sections revealed nuclear expression of LRF with minimal expression in the surrounding stroma. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western immunoblot analyses demonstrated significantly higher mRNA transcripts and protein expression in PC than BPH. High expression of LRF suggests that it may have a potential role in the pathogenesis of both BPH and prostate cancer. Further studies will help elucidate the mechanisms and signaling pathways that LRF may follow in the pathogenesis of prostate carcinoma.","['Aggarwal, Himanshu', 'Aggarwal, Anshu', 'Hunter, William J 3rd', 'Yohannes, Paulos', 'Khan, Ansar U', 'Agrawal, Devendra K']","['Aggarwal H', 'Aggarwal A', 'Hunter WJ 3rd', 'Yohannes P', 'Khan AU', 'Agrawal DK']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, NE 68178, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Mol Pathol,Experimental and molecular pathology,0370711,IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia/*genetics/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/05/04 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4800(11)00005-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexmp.2011.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Pathol. 2011 Apr;90(2):226-30. doi: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2011.01.003.

In the current study, we demonstrate a functionalized gold nanoparticle (AuNP) that can serve as a universal carrier for the delivery of DNA oligonucleotides (oligos) into the nucleus. We designed various types of DNA oligos to redirect alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs, such as MCL-1 and BCL-6, and to sequester transcriptional factors, including estrogen receptor alpha and p53. We successfully delivered the oligos into the nucleus, resulting in the targeted effects. In addition, injection of the antisense DNAs into a xenograft tumor in a mouse model system resulted in inhibited development of the tumor by redirecting the alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA. Our findings show that these nanoconjugates efficiently load and deliver antisense DNAs to redirect gene splicing or double-stranded DNAs to decoy gene transcription by transcriptional factors into mammalian cells and in vivo animals. Therefore, our lego-like AuNP gene delivery system can be used universally to control different biological processes by modulating nuclear gene expression events in living systems.","['Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Kim, Jae-Hong', 'Park, Mira', 'Yeom, Ji-Hyun', 'Go, Hayoung', 'Kim, Sudeok', 'Han, Min Su', 'Lee, Kangseok', 'Bae, Jeehyeon']","['Kim DW', 'Kim JH', 'Park M', 'Yeom JH', 'Go H', 'Kim S', 'Han MS', 'Lee K', 'Bae J']","['Department of Biomedical Science, College of Life Science, CHA University, 222 Yatap-Dong, Seongnam 463-836, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,8100316,IM,"['Alternative Splicing/drug effects/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Phenomena/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Antisense/pharmacology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Gold/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oligonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/05/06 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0142-9612(10)01529-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.11.074 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomaterials. 2011 Apr;32(10):2593-604. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.11.074.

This retrospective study aimed to compare the results of CHOP with those from two protocols (PETHEMA-LAL3/97 and BURKIMAB) of specific therapy in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from Group A (n=31) received 6 standard CHOP cycles every 3 weeks. Patients from group B (n=44) received six multiagent cycles including high-dose methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine. The response to therapy, disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) were compared in the two groups. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable for the main clinical and biological parameters at diagnosis except for risk activity, previous HAART, bone marrow involvement, bulky disease and extranodal involved sites. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 10 out of 31 (32%) patients in group A and 28 out of 44 (67%) patients in group B (P=.005). After a median (range) follow-up of 70 (26-139) and 17 (1-134) months, the 5-year (95% CI) DFS probability was 87% (64%-100%) for group A and 70% (51%-89%) for group B (P=.374), and the 5-year (95% CI) OS was 27% (10%-43%) for Group A and 57% (40%-74%) for group B (P=.028). Multivariate analyses showed that specific therapy was associated with an improved CR and OS.

We show that in approximately 80% of primary human CD34+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two expanded populations with hemopoietic progenitor immunophenotype coexist in most patients. Both populations have leukemic stem cell (LSC) activity and are hierarchically ordered; one LSC population gives rise to the other. Global gene expression profiling shows the LSC populations are molecularly distinct and resemble normal progenitors but not stem cells. The more mature LSC population most closely mirrors normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP) and the immature LSC population a previously uncharacterized progenitor functionally similar to lymphoid-primed multipotential progenitors (LMPPs). This suggests that in most cases primary CD34+ AML is a progenitor disease where LSCs acquire abnormal self-renewal potential.","['Goardon, Nicolas', 'Marchi, Emanuele', 'Atzberger, Ann', 'Quek, Lynn', 'Schuh, Anna', 'Soneji, Shamit', 'Woll, Petter', 'Mead, Adam', 'Alford, Kate A', 'Rout, Raj', 'Chaudhury, Salma', 'Gilkes, Amanda', 'Knapper, Steve', 'Beldjord, Kheira', 'Begum, Suriya', 'Rose, Susan', 'Geddes, Nicola', 'Griffiths, Mike', 'Standen, Graham', 'Sternberg, Alexander', 'Cavenagh, Jamie', 'Hunter, Hannah', 'Bowen, David', 'Killick, Sally', 'Robinson, Lisa', 'Price, Andrew', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Virgo, Paul', 'Burnett, Alan', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Enver, Tariq', 'Jacobsen, Sten Eirik W', 'Porcher, Catherine', 'Vyas, Paresh']","['Goardon N', 'Marchi E', 'Atzberger A', 'Quek L', 'Schuh A', 'Soneji S', 'Woll P', 'Mead A', 'Alford KA', 'Rout R', 'Chaudhury S', 'Gilkes A', 'Knapper S', 'Beldjord K', 'Begum S', 'Rose S', 'Geddes N', 'Griffiths M', 'Standen G', 'Sternberg A', 'Cavenagh J', 'Hunter H', 'Bowen D', 'Killick S', 'Robinson L', 'Price A', 'Macintyre E', 'Virgo P', 'Burnett A', 'Craddock C', 'Enver T', 'Jacobsen SE', 'Porcher C', 'Vyas P']","['MRC MHU, WIMM, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/03/15 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(10)00526-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2010.12.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2011 Jan 18;19(1):138-52. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2010.12.012.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,"['G84/6443/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U137973817/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0801073/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0501838/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1000729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,['Copyright A(c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Here we demonstrate that 2-HG is a competitive inhibitor of multiple alpha-KG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone demethylases and the TET family of 5-methlycytosine (5mC) hydroxylases. 2-HG occupies the same space as alpha-KG does in the active site of histone demethylases. Ectopic expression of tumor-derived IDH1 and IDH2 mutants inhibits histone demethylation and 5mC hydroxylation. In glioma, IDH1 mutations are associated with increased histone methylation and decreased 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine (5hmC).

METHODS: The morphologic changes of leukemia K562 cells after DADS treatment were observed by Hoechst 33258 staining. Cell apoptosis rates after different concentrations and different durations of DADS treatment were determined by flow cytometry. Fas, FasL and caspase-8 mRNA expression was estimated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 48 hrs after DADS treatment. RESULTS: The characteristics of apoptosis in K562 cells induced by DADS were observed. After 24 hrs of DADS treatment, the apoptosis rate of K562 cells increased from (11.60 +/- 0.83)% at the concentration of 10 mg/L to (37.94 +/- 0.87)% at the concentration of 40 mg/L. The apoptosis rate of K562 cells increased after 40 mg/L DADS with the increasing time from (37.94 +/- 0.87)% (24 hrs) to (47.02 +/- 0.66)% (72 hrs). Expression of Fas and caspase-8 mRNA increased, while FasL mRNA expression decreased significantly 48 hrs after DADS treatment compared with the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DADS can induce apoptosis of human leukemia K562 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, possibly through increasing Fas and caspase-8 expression and decreasing FasL expression.","['Xiao, Zheng-Xiang', 'Yin, Xiao-Cheng', 'Tan, Yan-Fang', 'Peng, Yan-Hui']","['Xiao ZX', 'Yin XC', 'Tan YF', 'Peng YH']","['First Affiliated Hospital of Nanhua University, Hengyang, Hunan 421001, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,IM,"['Allyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bisbenzimidazole', 'Caspase 8/*genetics', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'fas Receptor/*genetics']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/04/14 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2011)01-0053-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2011 Jan;13(1):53-6.,,"['0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '5HI47O6OA7 (diallyl disulfide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'LHQ7J5KV9B (Bisbenzimidazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The aCGH detected all numerical chromosomal gains and losses from the mainline clones and 113 copy number alterations (CNAs) ranging from 0.257 to 102.519 megabases (Mb). Clinically significant recurrent deletions of 5q (involving the RPS14 gene), 12p12.3 (ETV6 gene), 17p13 (TP53 gene), 17q11.2 (NF1 gene) and 20q, double minutes containing the MYC gene and segmental amplification involving the MLL gene were further characterized with defined breakpoints and gene contents. Genomic features of microdeletions at 17q11.2 were confirmed by FISH using targeted BAC clones. The aCGH also defined break points in a derivative chromosome 6, der(6)t(3;6)(q21.3;p22.2), and an isodicentric X chromosome.

The most common neoplasms that metastasize to the heart are malignant melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia, but the relative numbers are greater with breast and lung cancers, reflecting the most common incidence of these cancers. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old Hispanic man presented to our hospital after being transferred from an outside hospital for workup and evaluation of an adrenal mass of the abdomen and pelvis, found on computed tomography. His chief complaint upon admission was altered mental status. Physical examination was unremarkable. He was alert and oriented and had a dry and non-erythematous oropharynx, and bilateral diffuse wheezing on lung examination. Computed tomography of the chest showed multiple hypodense lesions in the left ventricular myocardium, suggestive of metastases. There were also tiny sub-centimeter nodular densities in the right upper and lower lobes. Adrenal glands contained hypodense lesions, which showed characteristic adenocarcinomatous malignant cells. CONCLUSION: Cancers which have metastasized to the heart are found in six to 20% of patients with malignant neoplasms. The right side of the heart is more commonly involved in metastasis. This study is unusual in that a tumor of an unknown primary origin had metastasized to the left side of the heart.","['Cheruvu, Bharadwaj', 'Cheruvu, Praveena', 'Boyars, Michael']","['Cheruvu B', 'Cheruvu P', 'Boyars M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas, 301 University Boulevard, Galveston, TX 77555, USA. kiriti121@sbcglobal.net.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,2011/01/22 06:00,2011/01/22 06:01,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2009/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/22 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-5-23 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-5-23 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2011 Jan 20;5:23. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-5-23.,20110120,,PMC3037322,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this Swedish multi-centre study of childhood ALL diagnosed between 2002 and 2006, the MRD levels were analysed in 726 follow-up samples in 228 children using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) of rearranged immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor genes and multicolour flow cytometry (FCM). Using an MRD threshold of 0.1%, which was the sensitivity level reached in all analyses, the concordance between RQ-PCR and FCM MRD values at day 29 was 84%. In B-cell precursor ALL, an MRD level of >/=0.1% at day 29 predicted a higher risk of bone marrow relapse (BMR) with both methods, although FCM was a better discriminator. However, considering the higher median MRD values achieved with RQ-PCR, a higher MRD cut-off (>/=0.2%) improved the predictive capacity of RQ-PCR. In T-ALL, RQ-PCR was notably superior to FCM in predicting risk of BMR. That notwithstanding, MRD levels of >/=0.1%, detected by either method at day 29, could not predict isolated extramedullary relapse. In conclusion, the concordance between RQ-PCR and FCM was high and hence both methods are valuable clinical tools for identifying childhood ALL cases with increased risk of BMR.","['Thorn, Ingrid', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Botling, Johan', 'Thuresson, Britt', 'Wasslavik, Carina', 'Bjorklund, Elisabet', 'Li, Aihong', 'Lindstrom-Eriksson, Eleonor', 'Malec, Maria', 'Gronlund, Elisabeth', 'Torikka, Kerstin', 'Heldrup, Jesper', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Behrendtz, Mikael', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Jacobsson, Stefan', 'Olofsson, Tor', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Lonnerholm, Gudmar', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Sundstrom, Christer']","['Thorn I', 'Forestier E', 'Botling J', 'Thuresson B', 'Wasslavik C', 'Bjorklund E', 'Li A', 'Lindstrom-Eriksson E', 'Malec M', 'Gronlund E', 'Torikka K', 'Heldrup J', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Behrendtz M', 'Soderhall S', 'Jacobsson S', 'Olofsson T', 'Porwit A', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Rosenquist R', 'Sundstrom C']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. ingrid.thorn@akademiska.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08456.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Mar;152(6):743-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08456.x.

Although it is still controversial whether the 'insensitivity' of CML stem cells to treatment with TKIs is due to BCR-ABL-dependent or independent mechanisms, recent evidence indicates that treatment with IM suppresses BCR-ABL-dependent signaling in CML stem cells with no adverse effects on their survival. Treatment of CML cells with IM/TKIs induces autophagy, a genetically regulated process of adaptation to metabolic stress which may allow tumor cells to become metabolically inert, enabling their survival under conditions that may mimic growth factor/nutrient deprivation. Based on this hypothesis, TKI-induced autophagy may 'antagonize' TKI-induced cell death and inhibition of autophagy may eliminate this survival mechanism by restoring 'sensitivity' of CML stem cells to treatment with IM/TKIs. Consistent with this, recent evidence indicates that phenotypically and functionally defined CML-enriched stem cells that are insensitive to treatment with TKIs are efficiently eliminated by the combination of TKI and chloroquine, an inhibitor of late stage autophagy. Thus, inhibition of autophagy may 'sensitize' CML stem cells to treatment with TKIs, thus preserving the high specificity of TKI-based therapies.","['Calabretta, Bruno', 'Salomoni, Paolo']","['Calabretta B', 'Salomoni P']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.

Upon evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of these compounds against leukemia (HL60), lung (A549), melanoma (CRL1579), ovary (NIH:OVCAR-3), breast (SK-BR-3), prostate (DU145), stomach (AZ521), and pancreas (PANC-1) cancer cell lines, 11 compounds (5a, 6a, 2b-5b, 1c, and 3c-6c) exhibited activity with single-digit micromolar IC(50) values against one or more cell lines. Poricotriol A (1c), a hydroxy derivative of poricoic acid A (1a), exhibited potent cytotoxicities against six cell lines with IC(50) values of 1.2-5.5 muM. Poricotriol A induced typical apoptotic cell death in HL60 and A549 cells on evaluation of the apoptosis-inducing activity by flow cytometric analysis. Western blot analysis in HL60 cells showed that poricotriol A activated caspases-3, -8, and -9, while increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. This suggested that poricotriol A induced apoptosis via both mitochondrial and death receptor pathways in HL60. On the other hand, poricotriol A did not activate caspases-3, -8, and -9, but induced translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria and increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in A549. This suggested that poricotriol A induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway mostly by translocation of AIF, independent from the caspase pathway in A549. Furthermore, poricotriol A was shown to possess high selective toxicity in lung cancer cells since it exhibited only weak cytotoxicity against a normal lung cell line (WI-38).","['Kikuchi, Takashi', 'Uchiyama, Emiko', 'Ukiya, Motohiko', 'Tabata, Keiichi', 'Kimura, Yumiko', 'Suzuki, Takashi', 'Akihisa, Toshihiro']","['Kikuchi T', 'Uchiyama E', 'Ukiya M', 'Tabata K', 'Kimura Y', 'Suzuki T', 'Akihisa T']","['College of Science and Technology, Nihon University, 1-8 Kanda Surugadai, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 101-8308, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Male', 'Molecular Structure', 'Poria/*chemistry', 'Triterpenes/chemistry/*isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/04/20 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/np100402b [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2011 Feb 25;74(2):137-44. doi: 10.1021/np100402b.

We have previously developed such nanobioprobes for the detection and isolation of a single kind of tumor cells. Detection and isolation of multiple tumor markers or tumor cells from complex samples sensitively and with high efficiency is critical for the early diagnosis of tumors, especially malignant tumors or cancers, which will improve clinical diagnosis outcomes and help to select effective treatment approaches. Here, we expanded the application of the monoclonal antibody (mAb)-coupled FMBMNs for multiplexed assays. Multiple types of cancer cells, such as leukemia cells and prostate cancer cells, were detected and collected from mixed samples within 25 min by using a magnet and an ordinary fluorescence microscope. The capture efficiencies of mAb-coupled FMBMNs for the above-mentioned two types of cells were 96% and 97%, respectively. Furthermore, by using the mAb-coupled FMBMNs, specific and sensitive detection and rapid separation of a small number of spiked leukemia cells and prostate cancer cells in a large population of cultured normal cells (about 0.01% were tumor cells) were achieved simply and inexpensively without any sample pretreatment before cell analysis. Therefore, mAb-coupled multicolor FMBMNs may be used for very sensitive detection and rapid isolation of multiple cancer cells in biomedical research and medical diagnostics.","['Song, Er-Qun', 'Hu, Jun', 'Wen, Cong-Ying', 'Tian, Zhi-Quan', 'Yu, Xu', 'Zhang, Zhi-Ling', 'Shi, Yun-Bo', 'Pang, Dai-Wen']","['Song EQ', 'Hu J', 'Wen CY', 'Tian ZQ', 'Yu X', 'Zhang ZL', 'Shi YB', 'Pang DW']","[""Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (Ministry of Education), College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Research Center for Nanobiology and Nanomedicine (MOE 985 Innovative Platform), Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,ACS Nano,ACS nano,101313589,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/immunology', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Magnetics', '*Nanostructures']",2011/01/22 06:00,2011/05/21 06:00,['2011/01/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/nn1011336 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Nano. 2011 Feb 22;5(2):761-70. doi: 10.1021/nn1011336.

Heteractis magnifica, Stichodactyla haddoni and Paracodylactis sinensis by affecting the red blood corpuscles (RBC) and the mouse fibroblast cell line (L929) and leukemia cell line (P388). Crude toxin of all the three anemone species induced spontaneous hemolysis of chicken, goat and human erythrocytes. The crude toxin of H. magnifica (0.98 mg/ml) elicited hemolysis at levels of 4096, 512 and 4096 HU (hemolytic unit) in chicken, goat and human erythrocytes respectively. Subsequently, the crude toxin of S. haddoni (0.82 mg/ml) exhibited a hemolytic activity of 256, 128 and 512 HU and that of P. sinensis (0.60 mg/ml) had a hemolytic activity of 128, 4096 and 512 HU. Most of the partially purified proteins of these anemones also exhibited the activity against the three different erythrocytes. The viability of L929 and P388 was adversely affected on adding the crude toxins. The symptoms of toxicity shown by the cells were rounding, lysis and detachment from the substratum. These effects were the least in S. haddoni, as compared to those the crude toxins of the other two species. Inhibition of growth of L929 exhibited by the toxin of the three species ranged between 61.08 and 93.38%. Similarly, inhibition of the growth of P388 ranged between 51.32 and 86.16%.

A well-informed decision on the use of anthracyclines in the treatment of childhood cancers should be based on evidence regarding both antitumour efficacy and cardiotoxicity. OBJECTIVES: To compare antitumour efficacy of treatment including or not including anthracyclines in children with childhood cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2010) and EMBASE (1980 to March 2010). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trials databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment of any type of childhood cancer with and without anthracyclines and reporting outcomes concerning antitumour efficacy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: We identified RCTs for six types of tumour: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (three trials; 912 children), Wilms' tumour (one trial; 316 children), rhabdomyosarcoma/undifferentiated sarcoma (one trial; 413 children), Ewing's sarcoma (one trial; 94 children), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (one trial; 284 children) and hepatoblastoma (one trial; 255 children). All studies had methodological limitations. For ALL no evidence of a significant difference in antitumour efficacy was identified in the meta-analyses, but in most individual studies there was a suggestion of better antitumour efficacy in patients treated with anthracyclines. For both Wilms' tumour and Ewing's sarcoma a significant difference in event-free and overall survival in favour of treatment with anthracyclines was identified, although for Wilms' tumour the significant difference in overall survival disappears with long-term follow-up. For rhabdomyosarcoma/undifferentiated sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and hepatoblastoma no difference in antitumour efficacy between the treatment groups was identified. Clinical cardiotoxicity was evaluated in three RCTs: no significant difference between both treatment groups was identified, but in all individual studies there was a suggestion of a lower rate of clinical cardiotoxicity in patients who did not receive anthracyclines. None of the studies evaluated asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. For other childhood cancers no RCTs were identified. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At the moment no evidence from RCTs is available which underscores the use of anthracyclines in ALL. However, ""no evidence of effect"", as identified in this review, is not the same as ""evidence of no effect"". For Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma/undifferentiated sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and hepatoblastoma only one RCT was available and, therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made about the antitumour efficacy of treatment with or without anthracyclines in these tumours. For other childhood cancers no RCTs were identified and therefore, no conclusions can be made about the antitumour efficacy of treatment with or without anthracyclines in these tumours.","['van Dalen, Elvira C', 'Raphael, Martine F', 'Caron, Huib N', 'Kremer, Leontien Cm']","['van Dalen EC', 'Raphael MF', 'Caron HN', 'Kremer LC']","[""Paediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital / Academic Medical Center, PO Box 22660 (room A3-273), Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1100 DD.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Hepatoblastoma/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Wilms Tumor/drug therapy']",2011/01/21 06:00,2011/03/01 06:00,['2011/01/21 06:00'],"['2011/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD006647.pub3 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011 Jan 19;(1):CD006647. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD006647.pub3.,20110119,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014;9:CD006647.

Unfortunately, the survival for this type of cancer has not improved significantly in the past 25 years. To enhance the survival rate multimodal therapy regimens have been set up. In these regimens chemotherapy plays a pivotal role in the majority of advanced cases. Transmembrane protein- tyrosine kinases (PTK) are fundamental elements of the signal transduction. In consequence, they might be promising targets for cancer therapy. Imatinib (STI 571) was originally designed to inhibit the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in chronic myeloid leukemia. But imatinib also has an inhibitory impact on the PTK receptor c-kit and on its PTK activity. Furthermore, growth and invasion of HNSCC are strongly influenced by the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is altered by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). In this study, we incubated different HNSCC cell lines with rising concentrations of imatinib and/or carboplatin. After an incubation time of up to 10 days, we evaluated c-kit, MMP-2 and MMP-14 by ELISA techniques and immunohistochemical methods. Especially the combination of 7.5 mumol carboplatin with 30 mumol imatinib resulted in a significant decrease in MMP-2 expression in all observed cell lines (p<0.05). We did not demonstrate a significant alteration in c-kit expression by imatinib and carboplatin. We observed an increase in apoptosis in HNSCC cells by the combination of the two observed chemotherapeutic drugs. In all cell lines tested, expression of c-kit and MMP could be demonstrated. Our results indicate that MMP-2 expression was suppressed in the presence of imatinib. Thus, imatinib may exert in part its inhibitory effect on malignant cell growth via the blockage of the signal transduction of PTK receptors. Further studies are warranted, especially one keeping in mind the moderate toxicity of imatinib.","['Schultz, Johannes D', 'Rotunno, Sarah', 'Erben, Philipp', 'Sommer, J Ulrich', 'Anders, Clemens', 'Stern-Straeter, Jens', 'Hofheinz, Ralf-Dieter', 'Hormann, Karl', 'Sauter, Alexander']","['Schultz JD', 'Rotunno S', 'Erben P', 'Sommer JU', 'Anders C', 'Stern-Straeter J', 'Hofheinz RD', 'Hormann K', 'Sauter A']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/01/21 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/01/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2011.1153 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2011 Apr;25(4):1145-51. doi: 10.3892/or.2011.1153.

Some of them are also differentially distributed in various ethnic populations, suggesting selective functionality. We have therefore sequenced all exons and flanking regions of p53 from the Singaporean Chinese population and report here the characterization of some novel and uncharacterized SNPs - four in intron 1 (nucleotide positions 8759/10361/10506/11130), three in intron 3 (11968/11969/11974) and two in the 3'UTR (19168/19514). Allelic frequencies were determined for all these and some known SNPs, and were compared in a limited scale to leukemia and lung cancer patient samples. Intron 2 (11827) and 7 (14181/14201) SNPs were found to have a high minor allele frequency of between 26-47%, in contrast to the lower frequencies found in the US population, but similar in trend to the codon 72 polymorphism (SNP12139) that shows a distribution pattern correlative with latitude. Several of the SNPs were linked, such as those in introns 1, 3 and 7. Most interestingly, we noticed the co-segregation of the intron 2 and the codon 72 SNPs, the latter which has been shown to be expressed in an allele-specific manner, suggesting possible regulatory cross-talk. Association analysis indicated that the T/G alleles in both the co-segregating intron 7 SNPs and a 4tagSNP haplotype was strongly associated increased susceptibility to lung cancer in non-smoker females [OR: 1.97 (1.32, 3.394)].

Reconstructing the subclonal genetic ancestry of several samples by CNA profiling demonstrated a branching multi-clonal evolution model of leukaemogenesis, rather than linear succession. For some patient samples, the predominant diagnostic clone repopulated xenografts, whereas in others it was outcompeted by minor subclones. Reconstitution with the predominant diagnosis clone was associated with more aggressive growth properties in xenografts, deletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and a trend towards poorer patient outcome.

Therefore, establishing the presence of PML-RARA rearrangement is important for optimal patient management. AIM: The objective of this study is to compare and assess the role of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the diagnosis and long-term monitoring of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared 145 samples received at different interval of times to analyze the sensitivity of RT-PCR and FISH. RESULTS: The failure rate for RT-PCR was 4% at baseline, 13% at induction, and 0% at the end of consolidation. And for FISH it was 8% at baseline, 38% at induction, and 66% at the end of consolidation. The predictive values of relapse in the patients who were positive and negative by RT-PCR, at the end of induction, were 60% and 3%, respectively, and at end of consolidation it was 67% and 4%, respectively. On the other hand the predictive values of relapse in patients who were positive and negative by FISH at end of induction were 57% and 6%, respectively; while at end of consolidation it was 14% who were negative by FISH. CONCLUSION: Both RT-PCR and FISH are important for the diagnosis of APL cases, as both techniques complement each other in the absence or failure of any one of them. However, RT-PCR is more sensitive than FISH for the detection of minimal residual disease in the long-term monitoring of these patients. The present study shows that the predictive value of relapse is more associated with minimal residual disease (MRD) results by RT-PCR than that by FISH.","['Polampalli, S', 'Choughule, A', 'Prabhash, K', 'Amare, P', 'Baisane, C', 'Kabre, S', 'Mahadik, S', 'Shinde, S', 'Nair, R', 'Banavali, S']","['Polampalli S', 'Choughule A', 'Prabhash K', 'Amare P', 'Baisane C', 'Kabre S', 'Mahadik S', 'Shinde S', 'Nair R', 'Banavali S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2011/01/21 06:00,2011/06/01 06:00,['2011/01/21 06:00'],"['2011/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['75831 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.75831 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2011 Jan-Mar;48(1):60-7. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.75831.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a novel approach to targeting key proteins in CML cells with a ubiquitin-cycle inhibitor, WP1130. Bcr-Abl is rapidly modified with K63-linked ubiquitin polymers in WP1130-treated CML cells, resulting in its accumulation in aggresomes, where is it unable to conduct signal transduction. Induction of apoptosis because of aggresomal compartmentalization of Bcr-Abl was observed in both imatinib-sensitive and -resistant cells. WP1130, but not Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors, directly inhibits Usp9x deubiquitinase activity, resulting in the down-regulation of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1 and facilitating apoptosis. These results demonstrate that ubiquitin-cycle inhibition represents a novel and effective approach to blocking Bcr-Abl kinase signaling and reducing Mcl-1 levels to engage CML cell apoptosis. This approach may be a therapeutic option for kinase inhibitor-resistant CML patients.","['Sun, Hanshi', 'Kapuria, Vaibhav', 'Peterson, Luke F', 'Fang, Dexing', 'Bornmann, William G', 'Bartholomeusz, Geoffrey', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Donato, Nicholas J']","['Sun H', 'Kapuria V', 'Peterson LF', 'Fang D', 'Bornmann WG', 'Bartholomeusz G', 'Talpaz M', 'Donato NJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyanoacrylates', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Substrate Specificity/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Ubiquitination/drug effects']",2011/01/21 06:00,2011/05/12 06:00,['2011/01/21 06:00'],"['2011/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41207-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-276477 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Mar 17;117(11):3151-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-276477.

We compared 4 protocols to examine the impact of prestimulation and posttransduction culture in STIF in the context of lentiviral gene transfer. Observing 56 transplanted mice for up to 9.5 months, we found consistent engraftment and gene-marking rates after prolonged ex vivo expansion. Although a lentiviral vector with a validated insertional-mutagenic potential was used, longitudinal analysis identifying > 7000 integration sites revealed polyclonal fluctuations, especially in ""expanded"" groups, with de novo detection of clones even at late time points. Posttransduction expansion in STIF did not enrich clones with insertions in proto-oncogenes but rather increased clonal diversity.

This effect on PML-NBs is similar to that of viral immediate-early gene products, such as infected cellular protein 0 (ICP0) from human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), which also disrupts PML-NBs to override the intrinsic cellular defense. Here we report that E2FBP1 inhibits accumulation of ICP0 RNA and, at the same time, is degraded via ICP0's herpes ubiquitin ligase 2 (HUL-2) activity upon HSV-1 infection. These reciprocal regulatory roles of ICP0 and E2FBP1 are linked in an ARID-dependent fashion. Our results suggest that E2FBP1 functions as an intrinsic cellular defense factor in spite of its PML-NB dissociation function.","['Fukuyo, Yayoi', 'Horikoshi, Nobuo', 'Ishov, Alexander M', 'Silverstein, Saul J', 'Nakajima, Takuma']","['Fukuyo Y', 'Horikoshi N', 'Ishov AM', 'Silverstein SJ', 'Nakajima T']","['California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, 475 Brannan Street, Suite 220, San Francisco, California 94107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*pathogenicity', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Virulence Factors/*metabolism']",2011/01/21 06:00,2011/05/14 06:00,['2011/01/21 06:00'],"['2011/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02105-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02105-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Apr;85(7):3356-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02105-10.

The V617F mutation is thought to provide hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors with a survival and proliferation advantage. It has previously been shown that activated JAK2 promotes cell survival by upregulating the anti-apoptotic STAT5 target gene Bcl-xL. In this study, we have investigated the role of additional apoptotic players, the pro-apoptotic protein Bim as well as the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. METHODS: Pharmacological inhibition of JAK2/STAT5 signaling in JAK2V617F mutant SET-2 and MB-02 cells was used to study effects on signaling, cell proliferation and apoptosis by Western blot analysis, WST-1 proliferation assays and flow cytometry. Cells were transfected with siRNA oligos to deplete candidate pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess the impact of JAK2 inhibition on complexes of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. RESULTS: Treatment of JAK2V617F mutant cell lines with a JAK2 inhibitor was found to trigger Bim activation. Furthermore, Bim depletion by RNAi suppressed JAK2 inhibitor-induced cell death. Bim activation following JAK2 inhibition led to enhanced sequestration of Mcl-1, besides Bcl-xL. Importantly, Mcl-1 depletion by RNAi was sufficient to compromise JAK2V617F mutant cell viability and sensitized the cells to JAK2 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Bim and Mcl-1 have key opposing roles in regulating JAK2V617F cell survival and propose that inactivation of aberrant JAK2 signaling leads to changes in Bim complexes that trigger cell death. Thus, further preclinical evaluation of combinations of JAK2 inhibitors with Bcl-2 family antagonists that also tackle Mcl-1, besides Bcl-xL, is warranted to assess the therapeutic potential for the treatment of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.","['Rubert, Joelle', 'Qian, Zhiyan', 'Andraos, Rita', 'Guthy, Daniel A', 'Radimerski, Thomas']","['Rubert J', 'Qian Z', 'Andraos R', 'Guthy DA', 'Radimerski T']","['Disease Area Oncology, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Quinoxalines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2011/01/21 06:00,2011/05/25 06:00,['2011/01/21 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-24 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-24 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Jan 19;11:24. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-24.,20110119,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NVP-BSK805)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",PMC3037340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the Food and Drug Administration approved the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle cell lymphoma, it has become clear that new inhibitors are needed that have a better therapeutic ratio, can overcome inherent and acquired bortezomib resistance and exhibit broader anti-cancer activities. Marizomib (NPI-0052; salinosporamide A) is a structurally and pharmacologically unique beta-lactone-gamma-lactam proteasome inhibitor that may fulfill these unmet needs. The potent and sustained inhibition of all three proteolytic activities of the proteasome by marizomib has inspired extensive preclinical evaluation in a variety of hematologic and solid tumor models, where it is efficacious as a single agent and in combination with biologics, chemotherapeutics and targeted therapeutic agents. Specifically, marizomib has been evaluated in models for multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, chronic and acute lymphocytic leukemia, as well as glioma, colorectal and pancreatic cancer models, and has exhibited synergistic activities in tumor models in combination with bortezomib, the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide (Revlimid), and various histone deacetylase inhibitors. These and other studies provided the framework for ongoing clinical trials in patients with MM, lymphomas, leukemias and solid tumors, including those who have failed bortezomib treatment, as well as in patients with diagnoses where other proteasome inhibitors have not demonstrated significant efficacy. This review captures the remarkable translational studies and contributions from many collaborators that have advanced marizomib from seabed to bench to bedside.","['Potts, B C', 'Albitar, M X', 'Anderson, K C', 'Baritaki, S', 'Berkers, C', 'Bonavida, B', 'Chandra, J', 'Chauhan, D', 'Cusack, J C Jr', 'Fenical, W', 'Ghobrial, I M', 'Groll, M', 'Jensen, P R', 'Lam, K S', 'Lloyd, G K', 'McBride, W', 'McConkey, D J', 'Miller, C P', 'Neuteboom, S T C', 'Oki, Y', 'Ovaa, H', 'Pajonk, F', 'Richardson, P G', 'Roccaro, A M', 'Sloss, C M', 'Spear, M A', 'Valashi, E', 'Younes, A', 'Palladino, M A']","['Potts BC', 'Albitar MX', 'Anderson KC', 'Baritaki S', 'Berkers C', 'Bonavida B', 'Chandra J', 'Chauhan D', 'Cusack JC Jr', 'Fenical W', 'Ghobrial IM', 'Groll M', 'Jensen PR', 'Lam KS', 'Lloyd GK', 'McBride W', 'McConkey DJ', 'Miller CP', 'Neuteboom ST', 'Oki Y', 'Ovaa H', 'Pajonk F', 'Richardson PG', 'Roccaro AM', 'Sloss CM', 'Spear MA', 'Valashi E', 'Younes A', 'Palladino MA']","['Nereus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 10480 Wateridge Circle, San Diego, CA 92121, USA. mpalladino@nereuspharm.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrroles/*therapeutic use']",2011/01/21 06:00,2011/07/08 06:00,['2011/01/21 06:00'],"['2010/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['EPub-Abstract-CCDT-112 [pii]', '10.2174/156800911794519716 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2011 Mar;11(3):254-84. doi: 10.2174/156800911794519716.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '703P9YDP7F (marizomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",PMC3712795,,,"['R37 CA044848/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA050947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SPORE-P50100707/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA115811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA050947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH R01CA98871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA078378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098871/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA123645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA115811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37CA044848/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS475931'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TRIM5alpha protein from rhesus macaques (rhTRIM5alpha) restricts infection by HIV-1 while human TRIM5alpha (huTRIM5alpha) restricts infection by murine leukemia virus (MLV). In owl monkeys a related protein TRIM-Cyp restricts HIV-1 infection. Several models have been proposed for retroviral restriction by TRIM5 proteins (TRIM5alpha and TRIM-Cyp). These models collectively suggest that TRIM5 proteins mediate restriction by directly binding to specific determinants in the viral capsid. Through their ability to self-associate TRIM5 proteins compartmentalize the viral capsid core and mediate its abortive disassembly via a poorly understood mechanism that is sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. In this review, we discuss TRIM5-mediated restriction in detail.

GROs bind specific cellular proteins, such as nucleolin, a crucial protein interacting with P53; however, little is known about the relationship between GROs and P53. In this study, we have shown that GROs inhibited the proliferation of U937 cells (a human monocytic leukemia cell line without P53 expression) by inducing S-phase arrest. We also showed that GRO colocalized with nucleolin in U937 cells. GRO treatment induced alteration of a series of cell cycle regulatory proteins in U937 cells. Increased Cdk2 expression might promote the cells to enter S phase and subsequent decrease of Cdk2 might induce cell cycle arrest in S phase. Transfection of U937 cells with a wild-type p53 gene caused the formation of nucleolin-P53 complex, which alleviated the effect of GRO on leukemia cells. This alleviated effect is probably due to the decreased uptake of GRO.","['Zhi, Lei', 'Zhang, Jianwei', 'Jia, Yujiao', 'Shan, Shilong', 'Li, Yan', 'Wang, Donghai', 'Wang, Min', 'Rao, Qing', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Tang, Kejing', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Mi, Yingchang']","['Zhi L', 'Zhang J', 'Jia Y', 'Shan S', 'Li Y', 'Wang D', 'Wang M', 'Rao Q', 'Xing H', 'Tang K', 'Tian Z', 'Wang J', 'Mi Y']","[""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oligonucleotides,Oligonucleotides,101188415,IM,"['Biological Transport/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligonucleotides/chemical synthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'S Phase/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2011/01/21 06:00,2011/06/30 06:00,['2011/01/21 06:00'],"['2011/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/oli.2010.0254 [doi]'],ppublish,Oligonucleotides. 2011 Feb;21(1):21-7. doi: 10.1089/oli.2010.0254.

Recently published data from Western Australia suggest a link between proportion of optimal birth weight and the risk of ALL, but few studies have investigated the relationship between growth during infancy and early childhood and risk of leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine whether children diagnosed with ALL in Western Australia were taller at the time of diagnosis than children of the same age and sex in the general population. METHODS: Records of children diagnosed with ALL between January 1984 and June 2008 were accessed. Height before the commencement of chemotherapy was recorded and compared to the height of population norms derived from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. RESULTS: On average, male cases were 0.67 cm (95% CI -0.21, 1.54 cm) taller and female cases were 0.30 cm (95% CI -0.68, 1.28 cm) taller than population controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that children diagnosed with ALL in Western Australia are slightly taller than their counterparts in the general population. These findings are consistent with at least one previous study. While this increase in height may be too small to be recognizable clinically, it is consistent with the notion that growth factors play a role in the pathogenesis of ALL beyond infancy.","['Davis, Esther', 'Jacoby, Peter', 'de Klerk, Nicholas H', 'Cole, Catherine', 'Milne, Elizabeth']","['Davis E', 'Jacoby P', 'de Klerk NH', 'Cole C', 'Milne E']","['Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, WA, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Birth Weight', '*Body Height', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Western Australia/epidemiology']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2010/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22832 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 May;56(5):767-70. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22832.

However, neither its molecular mechanisms nor markers for its prediction before hepatectomy have been identified. We recently revealed up-regulation of erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3) in human HCC. Here we examined the clinical and biological significance of ERBB3 in HCC. Up-regulation of ERBB3 in HCC was strongly associated with male gender (P < 0.001), chronic hepatitis B (P = 0.002), microscopic vascular invasion (P = 0.034), early recurrence (P = 0.003), and worse prognosis (P = 0.004). Phosphorylated ERBB3 and its ligands [neuregulins (NRGs)] were detected in both HCC tissues and cells. Phosphorylation of ERBB3 could be induced by conditioned media of HCC cells and abolished by the pretreatment of conditioned media with anti-NRG antibodies or by the silencing of the endogenous NRG expression of the donor HCC cells. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 was required for ERBB3 phosphorylation. The downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog pathways were primarily elicited by NRG1/ERBB3 signaling, whereas the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways were elicited by both epidermal growth factor/epidermal growth factor receptor and NRG1/ERBB3 signaling. The activation and silencing of ERBB3-dependent signaling had potent effects on both the migration and invasion of HCC cells, but neither had significant effects on the proliferation of HCC cells, tumor formation, or tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: The constitutive activation of ERBB3-dependent signaling via the NRG1/ERBB3 autocrine loop plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell motility and invasion, which contribute to intrahepatic metastasis and early recurrence of HCC. ERBB3 is a marker for the prediction of intrahepatic metastasis and early recurrence. ERBB3-dependent signaling is a candidate target for the treatment of microscopic vascular invasion and for the prevention of HCC recurrence.","['Hsieh, Sen-Yung', 'He, Jung-Ru', 'Hsu, Chih-Yun', 'Chen, Wan-Ju', 'Bera, Rabindranath', 'Lin, Kuo-Yang', 'Shih, Tsung-Chieh', 'Yu, Ming-Chin', 'Lin, Yu-Jr', 'Chang, Chee-Jen', 'Weng, Wen-Hui', 'Huang, Shiu-Fen']","['Hsieh SY', 'He JR', 'Hsu CY', 'Chen WJ', 'Bera R', 'Lin KY', 'Shih TC', 'Yu MC', 'Lin YJ', 'Chang CJ', 'Weng WH', 'Huang SF']","['Liver Research Unit, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan. siming@adm.cgmh.org.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,IM,"['Autocrine Communication/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neuregulin-1/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptor, ErbB-3/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/03/19 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2010/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.24083 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2011 Feb;53(2):504-16. doi: 10.1002/hep.24083.

The overall response rate in 34 patients was 82% (9% complete [CR]), median TTP in the 28 responders was 23 months, the median time to subsequent treatment was 43 months, and the 8-year OS rate was 74% (median follow-up, 102 months). CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with rituximab was well tolerated and safe. Further studies are needed to determine if this intervention can decrease CLL-related morbidity and mortality.","['Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Keating, Michael J', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Thomas, Deborah A']","['Ferrajoli A', 'Keating MJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Thomas DA']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukemia, Houston, Texas, USA. aferrajo@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2010/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.25853 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Jul 15;117(14):3182-6. doi: 10.1002/cncr.25853.

However, still about 20% of children with ALL relapse despite risk-adapted polychemotherapy. The prognosis of relapsed ALL is relatively poor, even with modern aggressive chemotherapy. Identification of the biological and genetic mechanisms contributing to recurrence in patients with ALL is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies to treat refractory leukemic patients. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for many children with relapsed ALL. The gene expression profile obtained by microarray technology could provide important determinants of the drug response and clinical outcome in childhood ALL. Incorporation of the data on expression levels of newly identified genes into existing strategies of risk stratification might improve clinical management. Current microarray data show correlation of in vitro drug resistance with significant patterns of gene expression and explain clinical differences between early and late relapse. Genes involved in cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation, protein biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and DNA replication and repair are usually among those highly expressed in relapsed lymphoblasts. Current status and future perspectives of microarray data on gene expression and drug resistance profile in relapsed pediatric ALL are discussed in this review.","['Szczepanek, Joanna', 'Styczynski, Jan', 'Haus, Olga', 'Tretyn, Andrzej', 'Wysocki, Mariusz']","['Szczepanek J', 'Styczynski J', 'Haus O', 'Tretyn A', 'Wysocki M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Curie-Sklodowskiej 9, 85-094, Bydgoszcz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Failure']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/05/24 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2010/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00005-010-0110-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2011 Feb;59(1):61-8. doi: 10.1007/s00005-010-0110-1.

When distinguished clinically, paraneoplastic autoimmunity is more severe and often presents with a broader range of clinical signs and symptoms. Management of these patients is difficult and is usually centered in part on treatment of the underlying malignancy. Self-antigens recognized in the setting of paraneoplastic autoimmunity can be diverse, and the number of determinants recognized within a single antigen can be numerous. This review uses prototypic examples of paraneoplastic immune-mediated diseases and their associated malignancies to describe the mechanisms by which immune dysregulation can occur in the setting of cancer. Specific diseases covered include paraneoplastic pemphigus, Sweet's syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and the paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. The malignancies discussed include thymoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, among others. The mechanisms by which cancers induce autoimmunity are broken down into the following categories: disruption of central tolerance, peripheral immune dysregulation, and alteration of self-antigens. For each category, examples of paraneoplastic autoimmune diseases and their associated malignancies are discussed. Finally, mechanisms by which cancer treatment can lead to autoimmunity and examples of polymorphisms that are linked to both cancer and autoimmunity are discussed.","['Maverakis, Emanual', 'Goodarzi, Heidi', 'Wehrli, Lisa N', 'Ono, Yoko', 'Garcia, Miki Shirakawa']","['Maverakis E', 'Goodarzi H', 'Wehrli LN', 'Ono Y', 'Garcia MS']","['Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of California-Davis, 3301 C Street, Sacramento, CA, 95816, USA. emaverakis@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,9504368,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/genetics/immunology', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/genetics/*immunology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Skin/immunology/*pathology']",2011/01/20 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12016-010-8248-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Rev Allergy Immunol. 2012 Apr;42(2):135-44. doi: 10.1007/s12016-010-8248-5.,,['0 (Autoantigens)'],,,,['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were sorted by various differentiation markers using a system of magnetic separation Miltenyi Biotec MACS and then transplanted to syngeneic recipients. In some cases, limiting dilutions were used for measuring the concentration of leukemia-initiating cells. All transplanted cell populations caused death of recipients: c-kit- CD45- over 23.9 days, c-kit+ over 22.2 days, c-kit- CD45+ over 15.4 days, Ter119+ over 18.2 days, and Ter119- over 17.7 days. The concentrations of leukemia cells determined by the method of limiting dilutions was 1 per 37,000 c-kit+ bone marrow cells and 1 per 45 unsorted liver cells from sick animals. Thus, leukemia stem cells retain hierarchic organization in the studied model and can differentiate at least into myeloid and erythroid cells without loosing self-maintenance capacity.

Reports have demonstrated promising in vitro effects on different targets as well as a possible therapeutic index/selectivity in vitro and in experimental animals. Recently, however, general inhibition of protein synthesis was suggested as the main mechanism of the anti-cancerous effects of CGs. In addition, evidence of species differences of a magnitude sufficient to explain the results of many studies called for reconsideration of earlier results. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this report we identified primary B-precursor and T-ALL cells as being particularly susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of CGs. Digitoxin appeared most potent and IC(50) values for several patient samples were at concentrations that may be achieved in the clinic. Significant protein synthesis inhibition at concentrations corresponding to IC(50) was demonstrated in colorectal tumour cell lines moderately resistant to the cytotoxic effects of digoxin and digitoxin, but not in highly sensitive leukaemia cell lines. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that further investigation regarding CGs may be focused on diagnoses like T- and B-precursor ALL.","['Hallbook, Helene', 'Felth, Jenny', 'Eriksson, Anna', 'Fryknas, Marten', 'Bohlin, Lars', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Gullbo, Joachim']","['Hallbook H', 'Felth J', 'Eriksson A', 'Fryknas M', 'Bohlin L', 'Larsson R', 'Gullbo J']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. helene.hallbook@medsci.uu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cardiac Glycosides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Digitoxin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Species Specificity']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/08/04 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0015718 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2011 Jan 5;6(1):e15718. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0015718.,20110105,"['0 (Cardiac Glycosides)', 'E90NZP2L9U (Digitoxin)']",PMC3016342,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction approach has not changed substantially for many years. Despite identifying numerous heterogeneous factors in AML, bench-derived insights are sluggishly translated into clinical protocols. In the current review, advances in intensified dose induction protocols, risk stratification, and disease monitoring are presented. Some promising as well as disappointing agents used for tailoring and targeting therapies in AML are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Intensifying anthracycline dose in young AML patients was recently shown to improve induction results. Importantly, maximal doses in induction have been shown to be safe also in older adults, negating a common perception that too often led to attenuation of induction therapy in this population. Novel targeted agents and the explosive number of newly identified prognostic factors or disease-specific biomarkers are promoting AML therapy toward a more personalized future. SUMMARY: Survival of AML patients is constantly improving. High doses of 'old drugs' for chemotherapy induction, followed by a postremission combination of chemotherapy and novel targeted agents may hold the key for cure.

However, approximately 30% fail therapy. The major mechanism of acquired resistance is somatic mutation within the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain, which affects imatinib binding. Recently, more potent inhibitors have been approved that retain activity against most of the more than 100 mutations. However, some mutations remain problematic for one or more of the new inhibitors. The most frequently detected mutation, T315I, remains resistant to all of the currently approved inhibitors. More sensitive mutation techniques that focus on the detection of a limited number of specific mutations may be beneficial, but are yet to prove their clinical utility for the early detection of relapse in routine practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Inhibitors with alternate binding modes that may overcome T315I-associated resistance are at the preclinical stage or are undergoing clinical trial. SUMMARY: Each of the new, more potent kinase inhibitor drugs appear to have a partially overlapping set of mutations that confer a degree of resistance. Mutation detection techniques may need to adapt to provide clinicians with a more timely indication of mutation acquisition and pending relapse.","['Branford, Susan', 'Hughes, Timothy P']","['Branford S', 'Hughes TP']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, SA Pathology, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. susan.branford@health.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Benzamides', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834399ef [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Mar;18(2):111-6. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834399ef.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review will attempt to provide a survey of the FLT3 inhibitors currently under investigation and provide a discussion on their current status in clinical trials. RECENT FINDINGS: Over the past 10 years, a number of different compounds have been studied in vitro and clinically as FLT3 inhibitors. The first inhibitors studied were hampered by cumbersome pharmacokinetics and a general lack of potency. However, some agents have shown promise in clinical trials with transient responses in AML. Newer compounds, such as AC220, have demonstrated profound selectivity and potency against the FLT3 target, and are currently being investigated in clinical trials. SUMMARY: Clinical trials have so far demonstrated that inhibitors of FLT3 do have clinical activity in patients with FLT3-mutant AML, although this activity is often transient and correlates with effective in-vivo suppression of the FLT3 target. As newer, more potent agents are now entering advanced clinical trials, opportunities will emerge for real progress against this grim disease.","['Fathi, Amir', 'Levis, Mark']","['Fathi A', 'Levis M']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Benzothiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Phenylurea Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283439a03 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Mar;18(2):71-6. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283439a03.,,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",PMC3082742,,,"['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128864-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS287541'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, we address various maneuvers to optimize the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect while preventing graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). RECENT FINDINGS: Alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells can be recruited to mediate GVL effect by careful mismatching on the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) ligand. Donor posttransplant NK cell infusions have led to remission in poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Donor lymphocyte infusions may also be used both prophylactically or at the time of leukemia relapse. Posttransplant hypomethylating agents have emerged as promising therapies to safeguard against relapse. Prevention of GVHD while preserving GVL effect using third-party regulatory T cells is under investigation. Adoptive T-cell transfer against specific leukemic antigens and immunotherapy exploiting the marrow microenvironment seem promising as well. SUMMARY: In the setting of allogeneic SCT, cellular and immunotherapy needs to be thoroughly investigated for its potential to fight minimal residual disease. The tight balance between GVL and GVHD needs to be harnessed in an optimal fashion to lead to long-term durable remission.","['Parmar, Simrit', 'Fernandez-Vina, Marcelo', 'de Lima, Marcos']","['Parmar S', 'Fernandez-Vina M', 'de Lima M']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy, University of Texas, M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77005, USA. sparmar@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/*surgery/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328343b858 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Mar;18(2):98-104. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328343b858.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to detect the nucleophosmin and FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations among Iranian patients with AML and to assess the relationship between these mutations and the subtypes of the disease. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study of patients referred during 2007 through 2009. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of 131 AML patients were randomly collected at the time of diagnosis and prior to treatment and the DNA extracted. After amplifying the nucleophosmin and FLT3 gene regions, positive cases were screened by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and agarose gel electrophoresis techniques. RESULTS: Of 131 patients, 23 (17.5%) (0.95% CI=0.107-0.244) had nucleophosmin gene mutations. The highest frequency of such mutations was found among the subtypes of M4 (30.4%), M3 (21.7%) and M5 (17.4%). There was a high frequency of these mutations in the M3 subtype as well as a high frequency of allele D in all subtypes. Also, 21 (16.0%) samples (0.95% CI=0.092-0.229) had FLT3/ITD mutation, of which 8 samples had mutant nucleophosmin (8 of 23, 35%), and another 13 samples had wild-type nucleophosmin gene (13 of 108, 12%). There was a high degree of association between the occurrence of nucleophosmin and FLT3/ITD mutations (P=.012). CONCLUSION: Our data showed a high frequency of NPM1 mutations in the monocytic subtypes of AML, as well as a high degree of association between the occurrence of NPM1 and FLT3/ITD mutations.","['Pazhakh, Vahid', 'Zaker, Farhad', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Atashrazm, Farzaneh']","['Pazhakh V', 'Zaker F', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Atashrazm F']","['Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,IM,"['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Genes, fms', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/05/05 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['AnnSaudiMed_2011_31_1_45_75778 [pii]', '10.4103/0256-4947.75778 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 2011 Jan-Feb;31(1):45-50. doi: 10.4103/0256-4947.75778.,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",PMC3101725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying mechanisms mediating AML1/ETO-induced self-renewal are largely unknown. Using expression microarray analysis, we identified the Groucho-related amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES) as a consistently up-regulated AML1/ETO target. Elevated levels of AES mRNA and protein were confirmed in AML1/ETO-expressing leukemia cells, as well as in other AML specimens. High expression of AES mRNA or protein was associated with improved survival of AML patients, even in the absence of t(8;21). On a functional level, knockdown of AES by RNAi in AML1/ETO-expressing cell lines inhibited colony formation. Similarly, self-renewal induced by AML1/ETO in primary murine progenitors was inhibited when AES was decreased or absent. High levels of AES expression enhanced formation of immature colonies, serial replating capacity of primary cells, and colony formation in colony-forming unit-spleen assays. These findings establish AES as a novel AML1/ETO-induced target gene that plays an important role in the self-renewal phenotype of t(8;21)-positive AML.","['Steffen, Bjorn', 'Knop, Markus', 'Bergholz, Ulla', 'Vakhrusheva, Olesya', 'Rode, Miriam', 'Kohler, Gabriele', 'Henrichs, Marcel-Philipp', 'Bulk, Etmar', 'Hehn, Sina', 'Stehling, Martin', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Baumer, Nicole', 'Tschanter, Petra', 'Brandts, Christian', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Stocking, Carol', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Steffen B', 'Knop M', 'Bergholz U', 'Vakhrusheva O', 'Rode M', 'Kohler G', 'Henrichs MP', 'Bulk E', 'Hehn S', 'Stehling M', 'Dugas M', 'Baumer N', 'Tschanter P', 'Brandts C', 'Koschmieder S', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H', 'Stocking C', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/07/14 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)45245-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-09-242545 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Apr 21;117(16):4328-37. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-09-242545.

NK314, a new anticancer agent possessing inhibitory activity specific for topoisomerase IIalpha (Top2alpha), inhibited the growth of various ATL cell lines (50% inhibitory concentration: 23-70nM) with more potent activity than that of etoposide. In addition to the induction of DNA double-strand breaks by inhibition of Top2alpha, NK314 induced degradation of the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), resulting in impaired DNA double-strand break repair. The contribution of DNA-PK to inhibition of cell growth was affirmed by the following results: NK314 inhibited cell growth of M059J (a DNA-PKcs-deficient cell line) and M059K (a cell line with DNA-PKcs present) with the same potency, whereas etoposide exhibited weak inhibition of cell growth with M059K cells. A DNA-PK specific inhibitor, NU7026, enhanced inhibitory activity of etoposide on M059K as well as on ATL cells. These results suggest that NK314 is a dual inhibitor of Top2alpha and DNA-PK.

Recent stem-cell transplantation was associated with worse psychosocial health. CONCLUSION: Parents of children with cancer reported worse physical health, pain, and fatigue proximal to death. Those with leukemia/lymphoma were at higher risk for impaired quality of life. This knowledge can help in the design of targeted interventions to improve quality of life for children dying as a result of cancer.","['Tomlinson, Deborah', 'Hinds, Pamela S', 'Bartels, Ute', 'Hendershot, Eleanor', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Tomlinson D', 'Hinds PS', 'Bartels U', 'Hendershot E', 'Sung L']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Ave, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology/*psychology', 'Parents', 'Psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/04/02 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.31.4047 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.31.4047 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Feb 20;29(6):639-45. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.31.4047.

Inappropriate release of the intracellular domain of Notch (N(ICD)) from the plasma membrane results in the accumulation of deregulated nuclear N(ICD) that has been linked to human cancers, notably T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Nuclear N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex by interacting with the coactivator protein Mastermind-like 1 and the DNA binding protein CSL (for CBF-1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) to regulate target gene expression. Although it is well understood that N(ICD) forms a transcriptional activation complex, little is known about how the complex is assembled. In this study, we demonstrate that N(ICD) multimerizes and that these multimers function as precursors for the stepwise assembly of the Notch activation complex. Importantly, we demonstrate that the assembly is mediated by N(ICD) multimers interacting with Skip and Mastermind. These interactions form a preactivation complex that is then resolved by CSL to form the Notch transcriptional activation complex on DNA.","['Vasquez-Del Carpio, Rodrigo', 'Kaplan, Fred M', 'Weaver, Kelly L', 'VanWye, Jeffrey D', 'Alves-Guerra, Marie-Clotilde', 'Robbins, David J', 'Capobianco, Anthony J']","['Vasquez-Del Carpio R', 'Kaplan FM', 'Weaver KL', 'VanWye JD', 'Alves-Guerra MC', 'Robbins DJ', 'Capobianco AJ']","['Molecular Oncology Program, Division of Surgical Oncology, Dewitt Daughtry Family of Surgery and Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1600 NW 10th Avenue, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ankyrin Repeat', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Notch/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00360-10 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00360-10 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2011 Apr;31(7):1396-408. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00360-10.

We developed a multiplexed PCR-coupled liquid bead array to detect the expression of multiple genes in CTCs. METHODS: mRNA isolated from immunomagnetically enriched CTCs was subjected to multiplex PCR for KRT19 (keratin 19; also known as CK19), ERBB2 [v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian); also known as HER2], SCGB2A2 (secretoglobin, family 2A, member 2; also known as MGB1, mammaglobin A), MAGEA3 (melanoma antigen family A, 3), TWIST-1 [twist homolog 1 (Drosophila)], and HMBS (hydroxymethylbilane synthase; also known as PBGD). Biotinylated amplicons were hybridized against fluorescent microspheres carrying gene-specific capture probes and incubated with streptavidin-phycoerythrin. We quantified the captured labeled amplicons and decoded the beads by Luminex flow cytometry. The assay was validated for limit of detection, specificity, and comparison with reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and its clinical performance was evaluated in 64 patients with operable breast cancer, 20 patients with metastasis, and 17 healthy individuals. RESULTS: The assay was specific for each gene in complex multiplexed formats and could detect the expression of each gene at the level of a single SK-BR-3 cell. The assay produced results comparable to those for RT-qPCR for each gene. None of the genes tested was detected in the CTC fraction of healthy donors. We detected KRT19, ERBB2, MAGEA3, SCGB2A2, and TWIST1 in 26.6%, 12.5%, 18.7%, 10.9%, and 31.2% of operable breast cancer patients, respectively, and detected the corresponding genes in 65%, 20%, 30%, 20%, and 20% of patients with verified metastasis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of 6 genes in CTCs can be measured simultaneously and reliably, thereby saving precious sample and reducing the costs and time of analysis.","['Markou, Athina', 'Strati, Areti', 'Malamos, Nikos', 'Georgoulias, Vasilis', 'Lianidou, Evi S']","['Markou A', 'Strati A', 'Malamos N', 'Georgoulias V', 'Lianidou ES']","['Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, University of Athens, and Medical Oncology Unit, Helena Venizelou Hospital, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Early Detection of Cancer/methods', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Microspheres', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/04/29 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2010.154328 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2010.154328 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2011 Mar;57(3):421-30. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2010.154328.

Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is a genetically polymorphic influx transporter expressed on the sinusoidal membrane of human hepatocytes, and it mediates the hepatic uptake of many endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. Recent studies have demonstrated that OATP1B1 plays a major, clinically important role in the hepatic uptake of many drugs. A common single-nucleotide variation (coding DNA c.521T>C, protein p.V174A, rs4149056) in the SLCO1B1 gene encoding OATP1B1 decreases the transporting activity of OATP1B1, resulting in markedly increased plasma concentrations of, for example, many statins, particularly of active simvastatin acid. The variant thereby enhances the risk of statin-induced myopathy and decreases the therapeutic indexes of statins. However, the effect of the SLCO1B1 c.521T>C variant is different on different statins. The same variant also markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of several other drugs. Furthermore, certain SLCO1B1 variants associated with an enhanced clearance of methotrexate increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity by methotrexate in the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Certain drugs (e.g., cyclosporine) potently inhibit OATP1B1, causing clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, OATP1B1 plays a major role in the hepatic uptake of drugs, and genetic variants and drug interactions affecting OATP1B1 activity are important determinants of individual drug responses. In this article, we review the current knowledge about the expression, function, substrate characteristics, and pharmacogenetics of OATP1B1 as well as its role in drug interactions, in parts comparing with those of other hepatocyte-expressed organic anion transporting polypeptides, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1.","['Niemi, Mikko', 'Pasanen, Marja K', 'Neuvonen, Pertti J']","['Niemi M', 'Pasanen MK', 'Neuvonen PJ']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Helsinki, PO Box 20, Helsinki, FI-00014, Finland. mikko.niemi@helsinki.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Pharmacol Rev,Pharmacological reviews,0421737,IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1', 'Organic Anion Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Xenobiotics/*pharmacokinetics']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/06/02 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['pr.110.002857 [pii]', '10.1124/pr.110.002857 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Rev. 2011 Mar;63(1):157-81. doi: 10.1124/pr.110.002857.

Recently the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of Stil was found to be important for centriole duplication. Consistent with this finding, we report here that mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Stil are characterized by slow growth, low mitotic index and absence of clear centrosomes. We hypothesized that Stil regulates mitosis through the tumor suppressor Chfr, an E3 ligase that blocks mitotic entry in response to mitotic stress. Mouse fibroblasts lacking Stil by genomic or RNA interference approaches, as well as E9.5 Stil(-/-) embryos, express high levels of the Chfr protein and reduced levels of the Chfr substrate Plk1. Exogenous expression of Stil, knockdown of Chfr or overexpression of Plk1 reverse the abnormal mitotic phenotypes of fibroblasts lacking Stil. We further demonstrate that Stil increases Chfr auto-ubiquitination and reduces its protein stability. Thus, Stil is required for centrosome organization, entry into mitosis and cell proliferation, and these functions are at least partially mediated by Chfr and its targets. This is the first identification of a negative regulator of the Chfr mitotic checkpoint.","['Castiel, Asher', 'Danieli, Michal Mark', 'David, Ahuvit', 'Moshkovitz, Sharon', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Kirsch, Ilan R', 'Brandeis, Michael', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Castiel A', 'Danieli MM', 'David A', 'Moshkovitz S', 'Aplan PD', 'Kirsch IR', 'Brandeis M', 'Kramer A', 'Izraeli S']","[""Sheba Cancer Research Center and Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer 52621, Ramat Gan, Israel.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Centrosome/*metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Mitosis', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/06/21 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.079731 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.079731 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2011 Feb 15;124(Pt 4):532-9. doi: 10.1242/jcs.079731.

SKP2 is induced in the G(1)-S transit of the cell cycle, is frequently overexpressed in human cancer, and displays transformation activity in experimental models. Here we show that MYC induces SKP2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in human myeloid leukemia K562 cells with conditional MYC expression. Importantly, in these systems, induction of MYC did not activate cell proliferation, ruling out SKP2 up-regulation as a consequence of cell cycle entry. MYC-dependent SKP2 expression was also detected in other cell types such as lymphoid, fibroblastic, and epithelial cell lines. MYC induced SKP2 mRNA expression in the absence of protein synthesis and activated the SKP2 promoter in luciferase reporter assays. With chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, MYC was detected bound to a region of human SKP2 gene promoter that includes E-boxes. The K562 cell line derives from human chronic myeloid leukemia. In a cohort of chronic myeloid leukemia bone marrow samples, we found a correlation between MYC and SKP2 mRNA levels. Analysis of cancer expression databases also indicated a correlation between MYC and SKP2 expression in lymphoma. Finally, MYC-induced SKP2 expression resulted in a decrease in p27 protein in K562 cells. Moreover, silencing of SKP2 abrogated the MYC-mediated down-regulation of p27. Our data show that SKP2 is a direct MYC target gene and that MYC-mediated SKP2 induction leads to reduced p27 levels. The results suggest the induction of SKP2 oncogene as a new mechanism for MYC-dependent transformation.","['Bretones, Gabriel', 'Acosta, Juan C', 'Caraballo, Juan M', 'Ferrandiz, Nuria', 'Gomez-Casares, M Teresa', 'Albajar, Marta', 'Blanco, Rosa', 'Ruiz, Paula', 'Hung, Wen-Chun', 'Albero, M Pilar', 'Perez-Roger, Ignacio', 'Leon, Javier']","['Bretones G', 'Acosta JC', 'Caraballo JM', 'Ferrandiz N', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Albajar M', 'Blanco R', 'Ruiz P', 'Hung WC', 'Albero MP', 'Perez-Roger I', 'Leon J']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria, Universidad de Cantabria, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, SODERCAN (Sociedad para el Desarrollo de Cantabria), 39011 Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', '*Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'G1 Phase/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'S Phase/genetics', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)51864-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.165977 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Mar 18;286(11):9815-25. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.165977.

However, their effectiveness depends on an initial activation step in which they are monophosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). Some purine nucleoside antimetabolites and their monophosphate derivatives are exported by the ABC transporter ABCG2. Because clofarabine is a dCK substrate, and we show substantial variation in dCK and ABCG2 in myeloid leukemia, we hypothesized that the activity of dCK may modulate ABCG2-mediated resistance to clofarabine by regulating the formation of clofarabine monophosphate. We show that ABCG2 influence on clofarabine cytotoxicity was markedly influenced by dCK activity. When dCK expression was reduced by siRNA, clofarabine cytotoxicity was strongly reduced by enhanced ABCG2-mediated efflux. Conversely, dCK overexpression blunted ABCG2-mediated efflux of clofarabine by increasing the formation of clofarabine nucleotides. The use of an ABCG2 inhibitor confirmed that ABCG2 export of clofarabine is maximal when dCK levels are minimal. Analysis of intracellular clofarabine metabolites suggested that ABCG2 exported clofarabine more readily than clofarabine monophosphate. That ABCG2 primarily effluxes clofarabine, but not chlorfarabine-monophosphate, was confirmed by HPLC analysis of drug exported from ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Because the level and function of dCK and ABCG2 vary substantially among other types of cancer, these findings have important implications not only for clofarabine therapy but for purine nucleoside therapy in general. Therefore, we propose that addition of ABCG2 inhibitors would effectively increase the antitumor efficacy of purine nucleosides by blocking drug efflux that may be a significant mode of resistance when dCK levels are low.","['Nagai, Shinjiro', 'Takenaka, Kazumasa', 'Nachagari, Deepa', 'Rose, Charles', 'Domoney, Kali', 'Sun, Daxi', 'Sparreboom, Alex', 'Schuetz, John D']","['Nagai S', 'Takenaka K', 'Nachagari D', 'Rose C', 'Domoney K', 'Sun D', 'Sparreboom A', 'Schuetz JD']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Adenine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Arabinonucleosides/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clofarabine', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/04/22 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-1919 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1919 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Mar 1;71(5):1781-91. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1919.

Furthermore, c-Maf significantly decreases Tax-induced HTLV-1 envelope gp46 gene expression from an infectious HTLV-1 molecular clone and tax expression in a cell-free HTLV-1 infection system.

Recent studies report that melatonin may be an attractive candidate as an anticancer agent or for combined therapy because of its antioxidant, oncostatic and immunoregulatory activities. In this study, the potentiating effect of melatonin was evaluated on the apoptosis induced by puromycin as an anticancer drug in acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Melatonin did not show significant cytotoxicity against HL-60 cells compared to puromycin. However, melatonin significantly augmented the cytotoxicity of puromycin. Consistently, combined treatment of melatonin and puromycin reduced the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as bcl-2 and bcl-x(L) , and also induced caspase-3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage compared to puromycin treatment alone. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis revealed that melatonin promoted puromycin-induced apoptosis by increasing the sub-G1 population, but suppressing G2/M arrest in HL-60 cells. Interestingly, melatonin activated the phosphorylation of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) in combination with puromycin. Taken together, our results suggest that melatonin potentiates puromycin-induced apoptosis with caspase-3 and AMPK activation in HL-60 cells, and thus, melatonin treatment can be effectively applied to leukemia treatment as a potential sensitizer for chemotherapeutic agents.","['Koh, Wonil', 'Jeong, Soo-Jin', 'Lee, Hyo-Jung', 'Ryu, Ho-Geon', 'Lee, Eun-Ok', 'Ahn, Kyoo Seok', 'Bae, Hyunsu', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon']","['Koh W', 'Jeong SJ', 'Lee HJ', 'Ryu HG', 'Lee EO', 'Ahn KS', 'Bae H', 'Kim SH']","['College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pineal Res,Journal of pineal research,8504412,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Melatonin/*pharmacology', 'Puromycin/*pharmacology']",2011/01/20 06:00,2011/09/02 06:00,['2011/01/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00852.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Pineal Res. 2011 May;50(4):367-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00852.x.

The fundamental building block of chromatin is the nucleosome, which is composed of DNA wrapped around an octamer of four distinct histone proteins. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone proteins can affect chromatin structure and function and thereby play critical roles in regulating gene expression. Most histone PTMs are found in unstructured histone tails that protrude from the nucleosome core. As a consequence, (synthetic) peptide truncations of these tails provide convenient substrates for the analysis of histone binding proteins and modifying enzymes. Modifications located on residues that reside in the nucleosome core are more difficult to study because short peptides do not recapitulate this defined structured state well. Methylation of histone H3 on Lys79 (H3K79), mediated by the Dot1 enzyme, is an example of such a core PTM. This modification, which is highly conserved, is linked to human leukemia, and pharmacological modulation of Dot1 activity could be a strategy to treat leukemia. Here we review the available and emerging genetic, biochemical, and chemical methods that together are starting to reveal the function and regulation of this and other histone modifications on the nucleosome core.","['Frederiks, Floor', 'Stulemeijer, Iris J E', 'Ovaa, Huib', 'van Leeuwen, Fred']","['Frederiks F', 'Stulemeijer IJ', 'Ovaa H', 'van Leeuwen F']","['Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Netherlands Proteomics Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,IM,"['*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Epigenomics', 'Histones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nucleosomes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/05/25 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbic.201000617 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2011 Jan 24;12(2):308-13. doi: 10.1002/cbic.201000617.

In this study, we examined the effects of a new inhibitor of deacetylase enzymes, LBH589, on ATLL cells. LBH589 effectively induced apoptosis in ATLL-related cell lines and primary ATLL cells and reduced the size of tumors inoculated in SCID mice. Analyses, including with a DNA microarray, revealed that neither death receptors nor p53 pathways contributed to the apoptosis. Instead, LBH589 activated an intrinsic pathway through the activation of caspase-2. Furthermore, small interfering RNA experiments targeting caspase-2, caspase-9, RAIDD, p53-induced protein with a death domain (PIDD) and RIPK1 (RIP) indicated that activation of RAIDD is crucial and an event initiating this pathway. In addition, LBH589 caused a marked decrease in levels of factors involved in ATLL cell proliferation and invasion such as CCR4, IL-2R and HTLV-1 HBZ-SI, a spliced form of the HTLV-1 basic zipper factor HBZ. In conclusion, we showed that LBH589 is a strong inducer of apoptosis in ATLL cells and uncovered a novel apoptotic pathway initiated by activation of RAIDD.","['Hasegawa, H', 'Yamada, Y', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Mori, N', 'Tsuruda, K', 'Sasaki, D', 'Usui, T', 'Osaka, A', 'Atogami, S', 'Ishikawa, C', 'Machijima, Y', 'Sawada, S', 'Hayashi, T', 'Miyazaki, Y', 'Kamihira, S']","['Hasegawa H', 'Yamada Y', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Mori N', 'Tsuruda K', 'Sasaki D', 'Usui T', 'Osaka A', 'Atogami S', 'Ishikawa C', 'Machijima Y', 'Sawada S', 'Hayashi T', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Sakamoto, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'CRADD Signaling Adaptor Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Histone Deacetylases/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Panobinostat', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010315 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.315 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Apr;25(4):575-87. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.315.

On the basis of these properties, MSC are currently under clinical investigation in a range of therapeutic applications including tissue repair and immune-mediated disorders such as graft-versus-host-disease refractory to pharmacological immunosuppression. Although initial clinical results appear promising, there are significant concerns that application of MSC might inadvertently suppress antimicrobial immunity with an increased risk of infection. We demonstrate here that on stimulation with inflammatory cytokines human MSC exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial effector function directed against a range of clinically relevant bacteria, protozoal parasites and viruses. Moreover, we identify the tryptophan catabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) as the underlying molecular mechanism. We furthermore delineate significant differences between human and murine MSC in that murine MSC fail to express IDO and inhibit bacterial growth. Conversely, only murine but not human MSC express inducible nitric oxide synthase on cytokine stimulation thus challenging the validity of murine in vivo models for the preclinical evaluation of human MSC. Collectively, our data identify human MSC as a cellular immunosuppressant that concurrently exhibits potent antimicrobial effector function thus encouraging their further evaluation in clinical trials.","['Meisel, R', 'Brockers, S', 'Heseler, K', 'Degistirici, O', 'Bulle, H', 'Woite, C', 'Stuhlsatz, S', 'Schwippert, W', 'Jager, M', 'Sorg, R', 'Henschler, R', 'Seissler, J', 'Dilloo, D', 'Daubener, W']","['Meisel R', 'Brockers S', 'Heseler K', 'Degistirici O', 'Bulle H', 'Woite C', 'Stuhlsatz S', 'Schwippert W', 'Jager M', 'Sorg R', 'Henschler R', 'Seissler J', 'Dilloo D', 'Daubener W']","['Clinic of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Center for Child and Adolescent Health, Heinrich-Heine-University, Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany. meisel@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*metabolism', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacteria/drug effects/*growth & development', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus/drug effects/*growth & development', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology', 'Toxoplasma/drug effects/*growth & development', 'Toxoplasmosis/immunology/metabolism/parasitology']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010310 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.310 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Apr;25(4):648-54. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.310.

ERG mRNA overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in a subset of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Herein, a genome-wide screen of ERG target genes was conducted by chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-chip) in Jurkat cells. In this screen, 342 significant annotated genes were derived from this global approach. Notably, ERG-enriched targets included WNT signaling genes: WNT11, WNT2, WNT9A, CCND1 and FZD7. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of normal and primary leukemia bone marrow material also confirmed WNT11 as a target of ERG in six of seven patient samples. A larger sampling of patient diagnostic material revealed that ERG and WNT11 mRNA were co-expressed in 80% of AML (n=30) and 40% in T-ALL (n=30) bone marrow samples. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of ERG confirmed downregulation of WNT11 transcripts. Conversely, in a tet-on ERG-inducible assay, WNT11 transcripts were co-stimulated. A WNT pathway agonist, 6-bromoindirubin-3-oxime (BIO), was used to determine the effect of cell growth on the ERG-inducible cells. The addition of BIO resulted in an ERG-dependent proliferative growth advantage over ERG-uninduced cells. Finally, ERG induction prompted morphological transformation whereby round unpolarized K562 cells developed elongated protrusions and became polarized. This morphological transformation could effectively be inhibited with BIO and with siRNA knockdown of WNT11. In conclusion, ERG transcriptional networks in leukemia converge on WNT signaling targets. Specifically, WNT11 emerged as a direct target of ERG. Potent ERG induction promoted morphological transformation through WNT11 signals. The findings in this study unravel new ERG-directed molecular signals that may contribute to the resistance of current therapies in acute leukemia patients with poor prognosis characterized by high ERG mRNA expression.","['Mochmann, L H', 'Bock, J', 'Ortiz-Tanchez, J', 'Schlee, C', 'Bohne, A', 'Neumann, K', 'Hofmann, W K', 'Thiel, E', 'Baldus, C D']","['Mochmann LH', 'Bock J', 'Ortiz-Tanchez J', 'Schlee C', 'Bohne A', 'Neumann K', 'Hofmann WK', 'Thiel E', 'Baldus CD']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genome, Human/genetics', '*Genomics', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Oximes/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/agonists/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/06/24 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2010582 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.582 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2011 Apr 28;30(17):2044-56. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.582.

In prior clinical and animal studies, a dose-dependent muscular weakness has been observed with this drug, though the etiology of the weakness has not been defined. METHODS: Standard neurophysiologic techniques, including repetitive nerve stimulation, needle EMG, and single-fiber EMG, were used to evaluate patients who developed weakness while being treated with tandutinib and bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) for glioblastoma (NCT00667394). RESULTS: Six patients were observed to develop a reversible weakness that correlated with the administration of the tandutinib. The onset of weakness after starting tandutinib occurred within 3 to 112 days and in less than 15 days in 3 patients. Electrophysiologic studies showed that all patients developed abnormal repetitive nerve stimulation studies. Four patients had short duration motor unit potentials. Two of these patients also had abnormal single-fiber EMG, as did a third patient who did not have standard needle EMG. The clinical and electrophysiologic abnormalities improved with the termination or reduction in the dose of tandutinib. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that tandutinib is toxic to the neuromuscular junction, possibly by reversibly binding to a molecule on the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor complex. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that tandutinib 500 mg twice daily induces reversible muscle weakness and electrophysiologic changes consistent with neuromuscular junction dysfunction.","['Lehky, T J', 'Iwamoto, F M', 'Kreisl, T N', 'Floeter, M K', 'Fine, H A']","['Lehky TJ', 'Iwamoto FM', 'Kreisl TN', 'Floeter MK', 'Fine HA']","['EMG Section, NINDS, NIH, 8900 Wisconsin Ave., Bethesda, MD 20892-1404, USA. lehkyt@ninds.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Bevacizumab', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Electromyography', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myasthenia Gravis/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Neuromuscular Diseases/chemically induced', 'Neuromuscular Junction/*drug effects/physiopathology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Syndrome']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/02/15 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['76/3/236 [pii]', '10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182074a69 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurology. 2011 Jan 18;76(3):236-41. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182074a69.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab)', 'E1IO3ICJ9A (tandutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",PMC3034397,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00667394'],,,,,,

We have identified NS as a target of oxidative regulation in transformed hematopoietic cells. NS oligomerization occurs in HL-60 leukemic cells and Raji B lymphoblasts that express high levels of c-Myc and have high intrinsic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); reducing agents dissociate NS into monomers and dimers. Exposure of U2OS osteosarcoma cells with low levels of intrinsic ROS to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induces thiol-reversible disulfide bond-mediated oligomerization of NS. Increased exposure to H(2)O(2) impairs NS degradation, immobilizes the protein within the nucleolus, and results in detergent-insoluble NS. The regulation of NS by ROS was validated in a murine lymphoma tumor model in which c-Myc is overexpressed and in CD34+ cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. In both instances, increased ROS levels were associated with markedly increased expression of NS protein and thiol-reversible oligomerization. Site-directed mutagenesis of critical cysteine-containing regions of nucleostemin altered both its intracellular localization and its stability. MG132, a potent proteasome inhibitor and activator of ROS, markedly decreased degradation and increased nucleolar retention of NS mutants, whereas N-acetyl-L-cysteine largely prevented the effects of MG132. These results indicate that NS is a highly redox-sensitive protein. Increased intracellular ROS levels, such as those that result from oncogenic transformation in hematopoietic malignancies, regulate the ability of NS to oligomerize, prevent its degradation, and may alter its ability to regulate cell proliferation.","['Huang, Min', 'Whang, Patrick', 'Chodaparambil, Jayanth V', 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Kusler, Brenda', 'Xu, Liwen', 'Felsher, Dean W', 'Mitchell, Beverly S']","['Huang M', 'Whang P', 'Chodaparambil JV', 'Pollyea DA', 'Kusler B', 'Xu L', 'Felsher DW', 'Mitchell BS']","['Department of Medicine, Divisions of Oncology and Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', '*Protein Multimerization', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/06/02 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)53725-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.208470 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Apr 1;286(13):11035-46. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.208470.

The relationship between chronic lymphocytic leukemia and autoimmune cytopenias, particularly autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia, is well established. The responsible mechanisms, particularly the role of leukemic cells in orchestrating the production of polyclonal autoantibodies, are increasingly well understood. Recent studies show that autoimmune cytopenia is not necessarily associated with poor prognosis. On the contrary, patients with anemia or thrombocytopenia due to immune mechanisms have a better outcome than those in whom these features are due to bone marrow infiltration by the disease. Moreover, fears about the risk of autoimmune hemolysis following single agent fludarabine may no longer be appropriate in the age of chemo-immunotherapy regimens. However, treatment of patients with active hemolysis may pose important problems needing an individualized and clinically sound approach. The concept that autoimmune cytopenia may precede the leukemia should be revisited in the light of recent data showing that autoimmune cytopenia may be observed in monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, a condition that can only be detected by using sensitive flow cytometry techniques. On the other hand, there is no evidence of an increased risk of non-hemic autoimmune disorders in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Likewise, there is no epidemiological proof of an increased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients with non-hemic autoimmunity. Finally, since immune disorders are an important part of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, studies aimed at revealing the mechanisms linking the neoplastic and the immune components of the disease should help our understanding of this form of leukemia.","['Hodgson, Kate', 'Ferrer, Gerardo', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Moreno, Carol']","['Hodgson K', 'Ferrer G', 'Montserrat E', 'Moreno C']","[""Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Autoimmunity/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Models, Immunological', 'Thrombocytopenia/*immunology']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.036152 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.036152 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 May;96(5):752-61. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.036152.

Current research is, therefore, attempting to identify novel drug targets in neoplastic mast cells. Polo-like kinase-1 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an essential role in mitosis and has recently been introduced as a new target in myeloid leukemias and solid tumors. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the present study, we analyzed the expression and function of Polo-like kinase-1 in neoplastic mast cells in systemic mastocytosis. RESULTS: As determined by immunostaining, primary neoplastic mast cells as well as the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1 displayed phosphorylated Polo-like kinase-1. In addition, neoplastic mast cells expressed Polo-like kinase-1 mRNA. Polo-like kinase-1-specific small interfering RNA induced apoptosis in neoplastic mast cells, whereas no effect was seen with a control small interfering RNA. BI 2536, a drug targeting Polo-like kinase-1, was found to inhibit proliferation in HMC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. BI 2536 also inhibited the growth of primary neoplastic mast cells and cells of the canine mastocytoma cell line C2. The growth-inhibitory effects of BI 2536 on neoplastic mast cells were found to be associated with mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Finally, BI 2536 was found to synergize with the KIT-targeting kinase inhibitor midostaurin (PKC412) in inhibiting the growth of neoplastic mast cells. In control experiments, BI 2536 did not induce apoptosis in normal cultured mast cells. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data show that Polo-like kinase-1 is a potential therapeutic target in neoplastic mast cells. Targeting Polo-like kinase-1 may be an attractive pharmacological concept in the management of advanced systemic mastocytosis.","['Peter, Barbara', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Winter, Viviane', 'Hadzijusufovic, Emir', 'Ferenc, Veronika', 'Schuch, Karina', 'Mirkina, Irina', 'Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Mullauer, Leonhard', 'Willmann, Michael', 'Valent, Peter']","['Peter B', 'Gleixner KV', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Herrmann H', 'Winter V', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Ferenc V', 'Schuch K', 'Mirkina I', 'Horny HP', 'Pickl WF', 'Mullauer L', 'Willmann M', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pteridines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymidine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.031328 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.031328 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 May;96(5):672-80. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.031328.

However, little is known about the influence of these aberrations on outcome after relapse. This study aimed to identify clinical and molecular risk factors for patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 94 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and normal karyotype after first relapse for clinical and molecular risk factors for survival. All patients had received first-line treatment and follow-up within two prospective, multicenter trials. Leukemic blasts were analyzed at diagnosis for genetic aberrations in the FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, WT1, IDH1 and IDH2 genes by polymerase chain reaction and/or direct sequencing. RESULTS: A second complete remission was achieved in 52% of patients who received re-induction therapy. The presence of an FLT3-internal tandem duplication, duration of first complete remission less than 6 months and age above the median of 47 years were associated with a significantly lower rate of second complete remission. The median survival after relapse was 11 months and the 6-year survival rate was 28%. In multivariate analysis, FLT3-internal tandem duplication and age above the median were the only independent negative prognostic factors for survival. The 6-year survival rate of patients with none of these factors was 56%, whereas it was significantly inferior in patients with one or both of these factors (15% and 6%, respectively). This was also true for patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation after relapse. CONCLUSIONS: FLT3-internal tandem duplication and age are the major prognostic factors in patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia with a normal karyotype. Patients with at least one of these risk factors have a dismal outcome and might be considered for investigational treatment approaches after relapse.

The aim of the current study was to explore which microRNA are unique for seven different subtypes of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Expression levels of 397 microRNA (including novel microRNA) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 81 cases of pediatric leukemia and 17 normal hematopoietic control cases. RESULTS: All major subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, i.e. T-cell, MLL-rearranged, TEL-AML1-positive, E2A-PBX1-positive and hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with the exception of BCR-ABL-positive and 'B-other' acute lymphoblastic leukemias (defined as precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia not carrying the foregoing cytogenetic aberrations), were found to have unique microRNA-signatures that differed from each other and from those of healthy hematopoietic cells. Strikingly, the microRNA signature of TEL-AML1-positive and hyperdiploid cases partly overlapped, which may suggest a common underlying biology. Moreover, aberrant down-regulation of let-7b (~70-fold) in MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia was linked to up-regulation of oncoprotein c-Myc (P(FDR)<0.0001). Resistance to vincristine and daunorubicin was characterized by an approximately 20-fold up-regulation of miR-125b, miR-99a and miR-100 (P(FDR)</=0.002). No discriminative microRNA were found for prednisolone response and only one microRNA was linked to resistance to L-asparaginase. A combined expression profile based on 14 microRNA that were individually associated with prognosis, was highly predictive of clinical outcome in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5-year disease-free survival of 89.4%+/-7% versus 60.8+/-12%, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Genetic subtypes and drug-resistant leukemic cells display characteristic microRNA signatures in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Studies in transgenic mice suggest that BCR-ABL1 reduces the fraction of self-renewing 'leukemic' stem cells in the bone marrow but that some of these cells survive treatment with imatinib. This also seems to operate in humans. Data from models also strongly support the notion that JAK2(V617F) can initiate and sustain MPNs in mice; relevance to disease in humans is less clear. These data also support the hypothesis that level of JAK2(V617F) expression influences the MPN phenotype: higher levels favor erythrocytosis whereas lower levels favor thrombocytosis. Although TET2-mutations were thought to precede JAK2(V617F) in some persons with MPNs, it now appears that TET2 mutations may occur after JAK2(V617F). Further understanding of signal-transduction pathways activated in chronic myeloid leukemia suggests various possible targets for new therapies including the WNT/beta catenin, notch and hedgehog pathways. Finally, the clinical role of the new JAK2- and BCR-ABL1-inhibitors is considered.

Gene expression data has a special characteristic that there is a mismatch in gene dimension as opposed to sample dimension. All genes do not contribute for efficient classification of samples. A robust feature selection algorithm is required to identify the important genes which help in classifying the samples efficiently. In order to select informative genes (features) based on relevance and redundancy characteristics, many feature selection algorithms have been introduced in the past. Most of the earlier algorithms require computationally expensive search strategy to find an optimal feature subset. Existing feature selection methods are also sensitive to the evaluation measures. The paper introduces a novel and efficient feature selection approach based on statistically defined effective range of features for every class termed as ERGS (Effective Range based Gene Selection). The basic principle behind ERGS is that higher weight is given to the feature that discriminates the classes clearly. Experimental results on well-known gene expression datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Two popular classifiers viz. Nave Bayes Classifier (NBC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used for classification. The proposed feature selection algorithm can be helpful in ranking the genes and also is capable of identifying the most relevant genes responsible for diseases like leukemia, colon tumor, lung cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), prostate cancer.","['Chandra, B', 'Gupta, Manish']","['Chandra B', 'Gupta M']","['Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi 110016, India. bchandra104@yahoo.co.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biomed Inform,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medical Informatics/*methods', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism']",2011/01/19 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S1532-0464(11)00003-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbi.2011.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Inform. 2011 Aug;44(4):529-35. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2011.01.001.

Recently, altered numbers of GABAergic-parvalbumin (PV) and cholinergic interneurons were observed in the basal ganglia of individuals with TS. Thus, we postulated that gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)- and acetylcholine (ACh)-related genes might be associated with the pathophysiology of TS. Total RNA isolated from whole blood of 26 un-medicated TS subjects and 23 healthy controls (HC) was processed on Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays. Data were analyzed to identify genes whose expression correlated with tic severity in TS, and to identify genes differentially spliced in TS compared to HC subjects. Many genes (3627) correlated with tic severity in TS (p < 0.05) among which GABA- (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(3)) and ACh- (p = 4.25 x 10(-)(8)) related genes were significantly over-represented. Moreover, several GABA and ACh-related genes were predicted to be alternatively spliced in TS compared to HC including GABA receptors GABRA4 and GABRG1, the nicotinic ACh receptor CHRNA4 and cholinergic differentiation factor (CDF). This pilot study suggests that at least some of these GABA- and ACh-related genes observed in blood that correlate with tics or are alternatively spliced are involved in the pathophysiology of TS and tics.","['Tian, Yingfang', 'Gunther, Joan R', 'Liao, Isaac H', 'Liu, Dazhi', 'Ander, Bradley P', 'Stamova, Boryana S', 'Lit, Lisa', 'Jickling, Glen C', 'Xu, Huichun', 'Zhan, Xinhua', 'Sharp, Frank R']","['Tian Y', 'Gunther JR', 'Liao IH', 'Liu D', 'Ander BP', 'Stamova BS', 'Lit L', 'Jickling GC', 'Xu H', 'Zhan X', 'Sharp FR']","['University of California at Davis, M.I.N.D., Institute and Department of Neurology, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'RNA/genetics', 'Receptors, GABA-A/genetics', 'Receptors, Nicotinic/genetics', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Tourette Syndrome/*genetics/physiopathology']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/07/23 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-8993(11)00062-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.brainres.2011.01.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2011 Mar 24;1381:228-36. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2011.01.026.

This study examined the role of Tol in the death regulation of PC-3 and DU145 human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. The results showed that Tol inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis, as evidenced by nuclear fragmentation and cleaved caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Tol suppressed the specificity protein 1 (Sp1) protein in both PC-3 and DU145 cells. Tol also attenuated Sp1 mRNA and its promoter activity in DU145 cells, but did not alter them in PC-3 cells, indicating that Tol degrades Sp1 protein in these cells. Tol also downregulated protein levels, mRNA levels and promoter activities of survivin and myeloid cell leukemia-1, which are downstream targets of Sp1. The expressions of survivin and Mcl-1 and cancer cell growth were lower in the PC-3 cells treated with Sp1 interfering RNA and mithramycin A. Moreover, an oral injection of Tol decreased tumor growth and downregulated the Sp1 protein in athymic nude mice bearing DU145 cell xenografts without hepatotoxicity. Overall, Tol downregulates the Sp1 protein to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in androgen-refractory prostate cancers, both in vitro and in vivo, that show resistance against many chemotherapeutic agents.","['Choi, Eun-Sun', 'Shim, Jung-Hyun', 'Jung, Ji-Youn', 'Kim, Hyeong-Jin', 'Choi, Kyeong-Hee', 'Shin, Ji-Ae', 'Nam, Jeong-Seok', 'Cho, Nam-Pyo', 'Cho, Sung-Dae']","['Choi ES', 'Shim JH', 'Jung JY', 'Kim HJ', 'Choi KH', 'Shin JA', 'Nam JS', 'Cho NP', 'Cho SD']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Brain Korea 21 Project, Chonbuk National University, Jeon-ju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'ortho-Aminobenzoates/*pharmacology']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01871.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Apr;102(4):742-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.01871.x.

Indeed, he was quite different from most of his contemporaries in that his knowledge encompassed not only haematology and not only the medical sciences, but the biological sciences as a whole. He was among the first to describe X chromosome inactivation, and he established the critical link between glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and drug-induced haemolysis. He was a skilled and innovative clinician, and an early advocate of bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of acute leukaemia. He was a prolific author, with over 800 publications; a long time member of the Editorial Board of Blood; founder of the journal Blood Cells Molecules and Diseases; and an editor of Williams Haematology from the time of its inception. He bequeathed $1 million to the American Society of Haematology to recognise and reward outstanding basic research and its clinical application: a pursuit to which he had committed his life. Indeed, he became an extraordinary exemplar of the bench-to-bedside ethos, which holds that even today, an MD researcher, working with limited means and independent of pharmaceutical companies, can have a great impact on the practice of medicine.","['Beutler, Steven', 'Beutler, Bruce']","['Beutler S', 'Beutler B']","['Redlands Community Hospital, Redlands, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Portrait']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/history', 'Germany', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency/history', 'Hematologic Diseases/genetics/*history', 'Hematology/*history', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'X Chromosome Inactivation']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/05/13 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08542.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Mar;152(5):543-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08542.x.

A significant excess in mortality compared with the general population ceases to occur within 10 years after diagnosis for survivors of stomach, colorectal, cervical and thyroid cancer and melanoma, with these groups having a conditional 5-year relative survival of at least 95% after 10 years. For the remaining cancers we studied (pancreatic, lung, breast, prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukaemia), conditional 5-year relative survival estimates (at 10 years after diagnosis) ranged from 82% to 94%, suggesting that patients in these cohorts continue to have poorer survival compared with the age-matched general population. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of conditional survival have the potential to provide useful information for cancer clinicians, patients and their carers as they are confronted by personal and surveillance-related decisions. This knowledge may be effective in building realistic hope and helping people manage uncertainty about the future. We suggest that measures of conditional survival be incorporated into routine statistical reporting in Australia.","['Baade, Peter D', 'Youlden, Danny R', 'Chambers, Suzanne K']","['Baade PD', 'Youlden DR', 'Chambers SK']","['Viertel Centre for Research in Cancer Control, Cancer Council Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia. peterbaade@cancerqld.org.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/mortality', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/mortality', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Melanoma/mortality', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Quality of Life', 'Queensland/epidemiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/mortality', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/mortality', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality']",2011/01/19 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2011/01/19 06:00'],"['2010/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['baa10523_fm [pii]', '10.5694/j.1326-5377.2011.tb04171.x [doi]']",ppublish,Med J Aust. 2011 Jan 17;194(2):73-7. doi: 10.5694/j.1326-5377.2011.tb04171.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Med J Aust. 2011 Apr 4;194(7):376'],,,,,

METHODS: Expression patterns of PML and tumor protein 53 (TP53) of 132 cases of ESCC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathological parameters. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the prognostic influence of clinicopathological factors on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Forty-two cases (31.82%) were classified as lost expression of PML, 25 (18.94%) as focally positive, and 65 (49.24%) as diffusely expressed. Sixty-three cases (47.73%) were classified as over-expression of TP53. High expression of TP53 and down-regulation of PML were often found in advanced disease; and, in together with high pathological staging, grading, and positive margin, were associated with poor survival. However, only tumor differentiation (P = 0.016), distant metastasis (P = 0.001), and PML expression (P = 0.001) could act as independent prognostic factors for PFS, and LN metastasis (P = 0.004), TP53 (P = 0.006), and PML expression (P = 0.029) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS in multivariate analysis.

Further, cell growth inhibition and cell death induction were positively correlated with the capsaicin content (based on the Scoville scale) of the peppers, and the hydroxyl radical scavenger thiourea significantly inhibited the activity of pepper extracts, suggesting the involvement of free radicals in mediating the biological activity of the pepper extracts.

Suppressive as well as stimulating effects of this drug on T lymphocytes or dendritic cells (DC), which play a major role in immune tumor surveillance, have been reported. For this reason, we questioned whether Imatinib could also affect the phenotypic and functional properties of these subpopulations in Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients on prolonged Imatinib maintenance treatment. Circulating T lymphocytes and NK cells from Imatinib-treated Ph(+) ALL patients showed a subset distribution comparable to that of healthy donors. In addition, T-cell immunomodulant cytokine production (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) and proliferative responses were not impaired. A normal monocyte-derived DC differentiation and apoptotic body loading capacity was also observed in the majority of Imatinib-treated patients. In contrast, an impairment in the DC intracellular production of IL-12 was recorded, although this was not observed when normal DC were exposed in vitro to Imatinib. Finally, in vivo Imatinib treatment did not affect the T-lymphocyte proliferation and IFN-gamma production induced by leukemic apoptotic body-loaded DC, underling the potential capability of these cells to generate a specific immune response against tumoral antigens. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that immunotherapeutic approaches aimed at controlling residual disease in Ph(+) ALL patients in hematologic remission are not jeopardized by the long-term administration of Imatinib.","['Maggio, Roberta', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Elia, Loredana', 'Calabrese, Elisabetta', 'Della Starza, Irene', 'Intoppa, Stefania', 'Milani, Maria Laura', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Maggio R', 'Peragine N', 'De Propris MS', 'Vitale A', 'Elia L', 'Calabrese E', 'Della Starza I', 'Intoppa S', 'Milani ML', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigen Presentation/drug effects/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/05/19 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-010-0966-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2011 Apr;60(4):599-607. doi: 10.1007/s00262-010-0966-2.

Previous data indicated that MLAA-34 might be a novel anti-apoptosis factor related closely to carcinogenesis or progression of acute monocytic leukemia. The over-expression of MLAA-34 is intuitively expected to be associated with unfavorable clinical features in acute myeloid leukemia. However, there have been no clinical studies about the prognostic relevance of MLAA-34 expression in human malignancies. This study was done to investigate the clinical relevance of the expression of MLAA-34 in de novo acute myeloid leukemia. In 126 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia, the level of MLAA-34 expression and protein expression ratio were determined by using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blot, respectively. The results were analyzed with respect to the patients' clinical features and treatment outcomes. Both MLAA-34 expression rates and expression levels were found to be higher in patients with the French-American-British classification subtype M5, and the expression levels were also higher in patients with a leukocyte number of >/= 20 x 10(9)/L and patients with extramedullary disease. In addition, MLAA-34 over-expression (>/= median expression) was associated with an unfavorable day 7 response to induction chemotherapy and also associated with a poor survival rate. In multivariate analysis, high MLAA-34 levels was independently associated with a poorer relapse-free survival and overall survival in AML patients. In conclusion, our data indicate that MLAA-34 may be used as a prognostic marker for treatment decision-making in acute monocytic leukemia through validation by further studies.","['Zhao, Jianqiang', 'He, Aili', 'Zhang, Wanggang', 'Meng, Xin', 'Gu, Liufang']","['Zhao J', 'He A', 'Zhang W', 'Meng X', 'Gu L']","[""Department of Clinical Hematology, 2nd Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, 157, 5th West Road, 710004, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/05/19 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-011-0969-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2011 Apr;60(4):587-97. doi: 10.1007/s00262-011-0969-7.

The protein purification was performed through ion-exchange chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography and was characterized by SDS-PAGE, amino acid sequencing, and mass spectrum analysis. The antitumor activity of Naja haje venom (NHV) and its fractions (NHVI, NHV-Ia, NHV-Ib, NHV-Ic, NHV-II, NHV-III, and NHV-IV) were tested against different human cancer cell lines. The molecular cascade of cell death was explored through evaluation of apoptosis/necrosis ratio, DNA fragmentation, histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), cytochrome c release, total caspases, caspase-3, caspase-9, and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. Most of the separated fractions possessed variable cytotoxic effect against different cancer cells. The most potent antitumor fraction was NHV-Ic due to its ability to induce DNA damaging and fragmentation that was associated with a significant induction of apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway and disturbed cell cycle phases as well as an inhibition of HDAC activity. NHV-Ic induced the mitochondrial pathway initially by the impairment of Deltapsi(m) besides the DNA damage and in response to that the mitochondria-released cytochrome c that may in turn activated total caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-9 in lymphoblastic leukemia 1301 cells. The partial amino acid sequencing of NHV-Ic revealed 100, 95.65, and 91.3% homology with the Long neurotoxin 1 from Naja haje anchietae (Angolan cobra), Naja haje haje (Egyptian cobra), and Boulengerina annulata annulata (banded water cobra), respectively.","['El Hakim, Amr E', 'Gamal-Eldeen, Amira M', 'Shahein, Yasser E', 'Mansour, Nahla M', 'Wahby, Ahmed F', 'Abouelella, Amira M K']","['El Hakim AE', 'Gamal-Eldeen AM', 'Shahein YE', 'Mansour NM', 'Wahby AF', 'Abouelella AM']","['Department of Molecular Biology, National Research Center, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Elapid Venoms/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neurotoxins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-010-0631-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2011 Aug;85(8):941-52. doi: 10.1007/s00204-010-0631-8.

Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) plays an important role in the metabolism of thiopurine drugs used in pediatric leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The objective was to review the literature systematically to ascertain the performance characteristics of current genotype and enzymatic testing technologies for TPMT. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to describe TPMT testing technologies. Eligible studies evaluated either a TPMT genotype or TPMT phenotype technology in comparison to a reference standard and expressed results in terms of sensitivity and specificity or positive/negative predictive value. The laboratory technique was recorded, and the quality of the identified studies was assessed using a modified Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were reviewed. The sensitivity and specificity of the genotype test ranged from 55% to 100% and from 94% to 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the phenotype test ranged from 92% to 100% and from 86% to 98%, respectively. A variety of laboratory techniques were employed. Reviewed studies were of low methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review of TPMT test strategies found that available technologies demonstrated high values for sensitivity and specificity, however, there was a lack of a single gold standard and most studies were of poor quality. Disregard for study sample size and confounding factors such as concurrent medications and blood transfusions were the main contributors to low quality. There were also inconsistencies in the selection of a reference standard which complicated the interpretation of the findings.","['Donnan, Jennifer R', 'Ungar, Wendy J', 'Mathews, Maria', 'Rahman, Proton']","['Donnan JR', 'Ungar WJ', 'Mathews M', 'Rahman P']","['Department of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy/genetics', 'Child', 'Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics', 'Methyltransferases/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Research Design', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/10/18 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FTD.0b013e31820810cd [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2011 Apr;33(2):192-9. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31820810cd.,,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there remains a small but challenging subgroup of patients who show ultra high-risk genetics (17p deletion, TP53 mutation) and/or poor response to chemoimmunotherapy. The median life expectancy of these patients is below 2 to 3 years with standard regimens. Accordingly, CLL with the 17p deletion (and likely also with sole TP53 mutation) should be treated with alternative strategies. While p53 defects appear to play a central role in our understanding of this ultra high-risk group, at least half of the cases will not be predictable based on existing prognostic models. Current treatment approaches for patients with p53 defects or poor response to chemoimmunotherapy should rely on agents acting independently of p53, such as alemtuzumab, lenalidomide, flavopiridol, and a growing number of novel compounds (or combinations thereof) currently available in clinical trials. Poor survival times of patients with ultra high-risk CLL suggest that eligible patients should be offered consolidation with reduced-intensity allogeneic stem-cell transplantation or experimental approaches in clinical trials.","['Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Zenz, Thorsten']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Zenz T']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. stephan.stilgenbauer@uniklinik-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Recently, a ""monosomal karyotype"" in acute myeloid leukemia blasts has been found to be a principal predictor of resistance. It is also clear that patients with a normal karyotype, and other intermediate prognosis karyotypes, can be placed into a high-risk group based on the absence of a mutation in the NPM1 gene or the presence of an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3) gene, particularly if there is loss of the wild-type FLT3 allele. The effects of other genetic abnormalities have been inconsistent, perhaps reflecting differences in expression of the abnormality and its translation into protein. Several reports have shown the prognostic potential of profiling global gene expression, micro-RNA expression, DNA methylation, and proteomics. Although routine application of these approaches is still premature, pretreatment assessment of the nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation and FLT3 ITD status, as well as cytogenetics, should be routine. These results can be used to guide the choice of remission induction therapy, for example, by placing patients with monosomal karyotype or FLT3 ITDs on clinical trials. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant in first complete remission is generally indicated for high-risk patients. However, new approaches are needed to reduce the high rates of relapse, even after hematopoietic cell transplant.","['Estey, Elihu']",['Estey E'],"['Division of Hematology, University of Washington School of Medicine and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. eestey@uw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Data on pediatric experiences with imatinib in CML from controlled trials remain very limited, but this review of available data describes the role of imatinib in children with CML, addressing: 1) the starting dose; 2) pharmacokinetics in childhood; 3) possible adverse effects, with a focus on the still-growing skeleton; 4) early monitoring of treatment efficacy in an attempt to avoid failure; 5) the timing of allo-SCT in children; and 6) treatment of CML relapse after allo-SCT. Because the characteristics of CML in children seem to overlap extensively with what is described in adult internal medicine, most answers and pediatric algorithms are adapted from the treatment of CML in adults. Today in 2010, allo-SCT in children should be postponed until CML becomes refractory to imatinib. The approach for young patients with suboptimal responses is unclear because data on the efficacy and safety of second-generation TKIs in childhood are almost entirely missing. Other than being included in a formal trial on second-generation TKIs, allo-SCT for patients failing imatinib remains the first choice.","['Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Millot, Frederic']","['Suttorp M', 'Millot F']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany. meinolf.suttorp@uniklinikum-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

In contrast, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal disorders characterized by overproliferation of one or more lineages that retain the ability to differentiate. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is an aggressive MPN of childhood that is clinically characterized by the overproduction of monocytic cells that can infiltrate organs, including the spleen, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and lung. Major progress in understanding the pathogenesis of JMML has been achieved by mapping out the genetic lesions that occur in patients. The spectrum of mutations described thus far in JMML occur in genes that encode proteins that signal through the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, thus providing potential new opportunities for both diagnosis and therapy. These genes include NF1, NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, and, most recently, CBL. While the current standard of care for patients with JMML relies on allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant, relapse is the most frequent cause of treatment failure. Rarely, spontaneous resolution of this disorder can occur but is unpredictable. This review is focused on the genetic abnormalities that occur in JMML, with particular attention to germ-line predisposition syndromes associated with the disorder. Current approaches to therapy are also discussed.","['Loh, Mignon L']",['Loh ML'],"['Department of Pediatrics and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA. lohm@itsa.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The degree of complexity relates not only to the intrinsic pathobiological characteristics of the disease, but also to the group of patients whom it affects most frequently: older individuals or those who have been exposed to prior forms of chemotherapy. It is therefore crucial to develop clinical tools to predict with a certain degree of precision the prognosis and outcome for patients with specific subtypes of MDS in specific clinical situations. At the present time, patients with MDS are diagnosed using a set of well-established histopathological criteria. Prognosis is established using classifications that include morphological features, percentage of blasts, and clinical and molecular characteristics such as peripheral cytopenias and cytogenetics. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) is a classic example of this type of classification. Over the last 5 years, there has been an intense effort to develop new prognostic systems for MDS, and new molecular alterations with potential prognostic value have been discovered. Over the same period of time, several new therapeutic interventions have been developed for patients with MDS. Biomarkers of response to these agents, in particular for the hypomethylating agents, are needed to predict clinical benefit. This review summarizes current prognostic models of MDS and new molecular alterations with potential prognostic potential.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']",['Garcia-Manero G'],"['Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77025, USA. ggarciam@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Cytogenetics, age, and performance status have long determined prognosis and therapy. The advent of molecular diagnostics has heralded an explosion in new prognostic factors, including gene mutations in KIT, FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3), NPM1 (nucleophosmin 1), and CEBPA (CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-alpha). Microarray technology can now identify unique gene expression signatures associated with prognosis. Similarly microRNA expression, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and DNA methylation signatures have recently described important new prognostic subgroups of AML, and are contributing to our understanding of AML disease biology. Combined with proteomic profiling, these technologies have helped identify new targets and signaling pathways, and may soon help to identify individual patients likely to benefit from specific therapies, including allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. In summary, new clinical and molecular prognostic markers have begun to significantly improve our understanding of AML biology. We are now close to a time when we will be able to use these prognostic factors and technologies to identify new targets for therapy and to determine who may benefit from that therapy, and ultimately change how we treat individual patients with AML.","['Foran, James M']",['Foran JM'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA. james.foran@ccc.uab.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Telomere diseases include constitutional marrow failure as dyskeratosis congenita, some apparently acquired aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia; pulmonary fibrosis; and hepatic nodular regenerative hyperplasia and cirrhosis. Accelerated telomere attrition is a likely pathophysiology of cancer arising from chronic inflammation. Telomerase can be modulated by sex hormones, which may explain the activity of androgens in marrow failure. Measurement of telomere length of peripheral blood leukocytes is a simple screening clinical assay. Detection of a mutation in a patient has implications for therapy, prognosis, monitoring, and genetic counseling. For research in hematology and oncology, telomere biology could be assessed as a risk for secondary malignancies and in graft-versus-host disease, for progression in a variety of blood cancers, and as potentially modifiable by hormone replacement strategies.","['Young, Neal S']",['Young NS'],"['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. youngns@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

ALL cells can be recognized by their clonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes, expression of gene fusions, and leukemia-associated immunophenotypes. Assays based on polymerase chain reaction or flow cytometry can detect one ALL cell among 10,000 to 100,000 normal cells in clinical samples. The vast majority of cases have antigen-receptor gene rearrangements and leukemia immunophenotypes for MRD monitoring; about half of the cases currently have suitable gene fusions. The clinical significance of MRD has been conclusively demonstrated in both childhood and adult ALL. In most studies, MRD positivity is defined by the presence of 0.01% or more ALL cells; the risk of relapse is generally proportional to the level of MRD, particularly when measured during or at the end of remission-induction therapy. The prevalence of MRD during early therapy differs among genetic and biologic ALL subtypes. However, being a measurement of drug resistance in vivo and reflecting multiple cellular, host, and treatment variables, MRD is typically an independent prognostic factor. MRD is now used in several clinical trials for risk assignment and to guide clinical management overall. The time points at which MRD testing is performed and the threshold levels that trigger treatment intensification vary according to the methodology available, the results of preclinical correlative studies, and protocol design.","['Campana, Dario']",['Campana D'],"[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. dario.campana@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The goal of the current murine study was to select a freshly isolated donor T-cell subset for infusion that separates antilymphoma activity from GVHD, and to determine whether the selected subset could effectively prevent or treat progressive growth of a naturally occurring B-cell lymphoma (BCL(1)) without GVHD after recipients were given T cell-depleted bone marrow transplantations from major histocompatibility complex-mismatched donors. Lethal GVHD was observed when total T cells, naive CD4(+) T cells, or naive CD8(+) T cells were used. Memory CD4(+)CD44(hi) and CD8(+)CD44(hi) T cells containing both central and effector memory cells did not induce lethal GVHD, but only memory CD8(+) T cells had potent antilymphoma activity and promoted complete chimerism. Infusion of CD8(+) memory T cells after transplantation was able to eradicate the BCL(1) lymphoma even after progressive growth without inducing severe GVHD. In conclusion, the memory CD8(+) T-cell subset separated graft antilymphoma activity from GVHD more effectively than naive T cells, memory CD4(+) T cells, or memory total T cells.","['Dutt, Suparna', 'Baker, Jeanette', 'Kohrt, Holbrook E', 'Kambham, Neeraja', 'Sanyal, Mrinmoy', 'Negrin, Robert S', 'Strober, Samuel']","['Dutt S', 'Baker J', 'Kohrt HE', 'Kambham N', 'Sanyal M', 'Negrin RS', 'Strober S']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/*immunology', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Memory/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/complications/*immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/transplantation']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/05/12 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41216-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-10-312751 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Mar 17;117(11):3230-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-10-312751.

Using a combination of transgenic studies, global chromatin assays, and detailed molecular analyses we present evidence that PU.1 is regulated by a novel mechanism involving cross talk between different cis elements together with lineage-restricted autoregulation.

(S)G is understood to act as a DNA hypomethylating agent in ALL cells, however, the underlying mechanism leading to global cytosine demethylation remains unclear. Here we report that (S)G treatment results in reactivation of epigenetically silenced genes in T leukemia cells. Bisulfite genomic sequencing revealed that (S)G treatment universally elicited demethylation in the promoters and/or first exons of the genes that were reactivated. (S)G treatment also attenuated the expression of histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), thereby stimulating lysine methylation of the DNA methylase DNMT1 and triggering its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Taken together, our findings reveal a previously uncharacterized but vital mechanistic link between (S)G treatment and DNA hypomethylation.","['Yuan, Bifeng', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Wang, Hongxia', 'Xiong, Lei', 'Cai, Qian', 'Wang, Tina', 'Jacobsen, Steven', 'Pradhan, Sriharsa', 'Wang, Yinsheng']","['Yuan B', 'Zhang J', 'Wang H', 'Xiong L', 'Cai Q', 'Wang T', 'Jacobsen S', 'Pradhan S', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, California 92521-0403, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/04/22 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-3430 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3430 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Mar 1;71(5):1904-11. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-3430.

It was demonstrated that the P-gp mediated efflux decreases the drug concentration in cancer cells which results in the failure of chemotherapy. However, the MDR phenotype in cancer cells obviously involves various mechanisms. Therefore, if we want to estimate a contribution of the P-gp expression to the MDR phenotype, a clear quantitative relationship between the intracellular drug level and cell sensitivity must be established. To achieve this goal, a sensitive and non-radioactive assay for precise determination of intracellular levels of imatinib and its main metabolite N-desmethyl imatinib (CGP 74588) has been developed. The assay is based on an optimised extraction of cells with 4% formic acid after their separation from the growth medium by centrifugation through a layer of silicone oil. Cell extracts are subsequently analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Calibration curves were linear from 1 to 500 nmol/l for imatinib and from 2 to 500 nmol/l for CGP 74588, with correlation coefficients (r(2)) better than 0.998 and 0.996, respectively. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 1 nmol/l for imatinib and 2 nmol/l for CGP 74588.

It is clear that the currently available contraceptives fail to meet world-wide requirements, particularly in developing countries, therefore new methods of contraception are highly desirable. Gene deletion studies in mice have identified that the two cytokines interleukin (IL) 11 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are absolutely required for embryo implantation. Studies have demonstrated that administration of long acting IL11 and LIF inhibitors blocks embryo implantation resulting in infertility in mice. Clinical studies reveal that both cytokines are important regulators of embryo implantation in humans. Preventing implantation by targeting endometrial IL11 and LIF may be useful as a pharmacological non-hormonal strategy for women. In addition, vaginal application of the IL11 or LIF inhibitor with microbicides that block sexually transmitted infections could act as dual-role contraceptives, preventing implantation and sexually transmitted infections.","['Dimitriadis, E', 'Menkhorst, E']","['Dimitriadis E', 'Menkhorst E']","[""Prince Henry's Institute of Medical Research, PO Box 5152, Clayton, Melbourne 3168, Australia. evdokia.dimitriadis@princehenrys.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,J Reprod Immunol,Journal of reproductive immunology,8001906,IM,"['Abortifacient Agents, Nonsteroidal/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Contraception/trends', 'Embryo Implantation/drug effects', 'Endometrium/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/07/19 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-0378(10)00411-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jri.2010.12.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Reprod Immunol. 2011 Mar;88(2):233-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jri.2010.12.002.

Here, we report a first case of erythroblastic sarcoma that presented as bilateral ovarian masses in a 3 (1/2)-month-old infant girl with pure erythroid leukemia. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed that the marrow was completely replaced by large-sized blasts consistent with erythroblasts. Immunophenotypically, both the tumor cells from the ovarian mass and bone marrow blasts were positive for CD117, glycophorin A, and hemoglobin A, demonstrating erythroid differentiation. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that the tumor cells from ovarian mass expressed hemoglobin F and alpha1 spectrin, confirming their erythroid lineage.

Some retroviruses are preferentially integrated into certain genomic regions that may differ depending on the disease. In this study, we analyzed the integration site of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) in leukemic cells and 55 integration sites were determined. Although the integration sites were not located in a particular chromosome, the BLV provirus was integrated into transcription units at a frequency of 43.6% (24/55) and the transcriptional direction of the provirus was in accordance with that of the integrated host genes in 62.5% (15/24). The integration sites were located in introns of the host gene, excluding only one site, which was located in downstream from a stop codon. BLV provirus was never found in a protein coding sequence (CDS) in this study. Moreover, the BLV provirus did not favor integration near transcription start sites and CpG islands, or repetitive sequences such as transposons. Therefore, the possibility that the integration of the BLV provirus disrupts the host gene is very low. Although a hot spot was not found in the BLV provirus integration sites, the provirus favored the integration into regions disadvantageous for viral gene expression since no integration site was preferentially located into/near CDS, transcription start site or CpG island. It is suggested that the integration site of the BLV provirus in leukemic cells is related to the suppression of viral gene expression.","['Murakami, Hironobu', 'Yamada, Takahito', 'Suzuki, Miho', 'Nakahara, Yusuke', 'Suzuki, Kazuhiko', 'Sentsui, Hiroshi']","['Murakami H', 'Yamada T', 'Suzuki M', 'Nakahara Y', 'Suzuki K', 'Sentsui H']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Epizootiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0880, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,"[""3' Flanking Region"", ""5' Flanking Region"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/genetics/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-1702(11)00008-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virusres.2011.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2011 Mar;156(1-2):107-12. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2011.01.004.

Leukemic cells in patients with myeloid neoplasms can differentiate into DCs in vivo (referred to as in vivo leukemic DCs), which are postulated to affect anti-leukemia immune responses. We established a reproducible culture system of in vitro FLT3 ligand-mediated DC (FL-DC) differentiation from murine lineage(-) Sca-1(+) c-Kit(high) cells (LSKs), which made it possible to analyse the effects of target genes on steady-state DC differentiation from hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Using this system, we analysed the effects of various myeloid neoplasm-related gene abnormalities, termed class I and class II mutations, on FL-DC differentiation from LSKs. All class II mutations uniformly impaired FL-DC differentiation maintaining a plasmacytoid DC (pDC)/conventional DC (cDC) ratio comparable to the control cells. In contrast, class I mutations differentially affected FL-DC differentiation from LSKs. FLT3-ITD and a constitutively active form of Ras (CA-N-Ras) yielded more FL-DCs than the control, whereas the other class I mutations tested yielded less FL-DCs. Both FLT3-ITD and FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutation showed a comparable pDC/cDC ratio as the control. CA-N-Ras, c-Kit-TKD, TEL/PDGFRbeta, and FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha showed a severe decrease in the pDC/cDC ratio. CA-STAT5 and CA-MEK1 severely inhibited pDC differentiation. FLT3-ITD, CA-N-Ras, and TEL/PDGFRbeta aberrantly induced programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)-expressing DCs. In conclusion, we have established a simple, efficient, and reproducible in vitro FL-DC differentiation system from LSKs. This system could uncover novel findings on how myeloid neoplasm-related gene abnormalities differentially affect FL-DC differentiation from murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in a gene-specific manner.","['Fujita, Jiro', 'Mizuki, Masao', 'Otsuka, Masayasu', 'Ezoe, Sachiko', 'Tanaka, Hirokazu', 'Satoh, Yusuke', 'Fukushima, Kentaro', 'Tokunaga, Masahiro', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru']","['Fujita J', 'Mizuki M', 'Otsuka M', 'Ezoe S', 'Tanaka H', 'Satoh Y', 'Fukushima K', 'Tokunaga M', 'Matsumura I', 'Kanakura Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2, Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/immunology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/immunology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/immunology']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/07/02 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2478(11)00002-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imlet.2010.12.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2011 Apr 30;136(1):61-73. doi: 10.1016/j.imlet.2010.12.006.

Fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid, is worth of study as a promising candidate for apoptosis-based therapy of leukemia. Yet, it remains unclear whether this drug exerts the similar mechanisms on different leukemic cells. Here, we report a comparative analysis of fenretinide-induced apoptosis in three acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cell lines including HL60, NB4 and U937. Through a series of antagonist assays, we revealed similarities and differences of mechanisms involved in these three cell lines. Antioxidant vitamin C completely abrogated fenretinide-induced apoptosis in all cell lines, demonstrating that ROS is an essential and common mediator. However, the apoptotic effects of fenretinide could be blocked by ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 only in HL60 rather than the other two. Moreover, fumonisin B1 was unable to inhibit the generation of ROS in fenretinide-treated HL60 cells, indicating that ROS may function as upstream stimulus of ceramide-mediated apoptosis. These comparative results strongly suggest that the apoptotic response induced by fenretinide in HL60 involves both ROS and ceramide, whereas drug-induced apoptosis in NB4 and U937 requires ROS but is independent of ceramide. Differentiated modes of action exerting on AML may guide the use of this apoptosis-inducing drug, and hence advance our knowledge about the nature of cancer-specific responses to this drug.","['Jiang, Lulu', 'Pan, Xiaoling', 'Chen, Ying', 'Wang, Kankan', 'Du, Yanzhi', 'Zhang, Ji']","['Jiang L', 'Pan X', 'Chen Y', 'Wang K', 'Du Y', 'Zhang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), 197 Ruijin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Ceramides/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Fumonisins/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/04/07 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2011/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)00055-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.01.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 Feb 11;405(2):314-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.01.036.

Mitochondrial alterations and reduction in energy metabolism have been previously reported in the context of glucocorticoid (GC)-triggered apoptosis, although the mechanism is not yet clarified. We analyzed mitochondrial function in a GC-sensitive precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) model as well as in GC-sensitive and GC-resistant T-ALL model systems. Respiratory activity was preserved in intact GC-sensitive cells up to 24h under treatment with 100 nM dexamethasone before depression of mitochondrial respiration occurred. Severe repression of mitochondrial respiratory function was observed after permeabilization of the cell membrane and provision of exogenous substrates. Several mitochondrial metabolite and protein transporters and two subunits of the ATP synthase were downregulated in the T-ALL and in the precursor B-ALL model at the gene expression level under dexamethasone treatment. These data could partly be confirmed in ALL lymphoblasts from patients, dependent on the molecular abnormality in the ALL cells. GC-resistant cell lines did not show any of these defects after dexamethasone treatment. In conclusion, in GC-sensitive ALL cells, dexamethasone induces changes in membrane properties that together with the reduced expression of mitochondrial transporters of substrates and proteins may lead to repressed mitochondrial respiratory activity and lower ATP levels that contribute to GC-induced apoptosis.","['Eberhart, Karin', 'Rainer, Johannes', 'Bindreither, Daniel', 'Ritter, Ireen', 'Gnaiger, Erich', 'Kofler, Reinhard', 'Oefner, Peter J', 'Renner, Kathrin']","['Eberhart K', 'Rainer J', 'Bindreither D', 'Ritter I', 'Gnaiger E', 'Kofler R', 'Oefner PJ', 'Renner K']","['Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg, Josef-Engert-Str. 9, 93053 Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology/physiology', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/07/06 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0005-2728(10)00797-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.12.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2011 Jun;1807(6):719-25. doi: 10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.12.010.

Studies have shown that Toll-like receptors are not limited to normal immune cells but are expressed on tumour cells as well, including those of lymphoid neoplasms particularly B-cell malignancies, multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Neoplastic plasma cells in multiple myeloma usually show a different pattern of Toll-like receptor expression compared to normal B cells. These receptors on multiple myeloma cells, have been indicated to have a role in their proliferation, differentiation and survival, probably through induction of autocrine IL-6 secretion, and in their immunomodulatory functions. Moreover, it is speculated that these molecules may contribute to osteolytic lesions through activation of osteoclasts, and to angiogenesis through induction of pro-angiogenic factors. Knowledge on Toll-like receptor signalling in the biology of malignant plasma cells or their cellular microenvironment may give new insights into pathogenesis of multiple myeloma and may open new avenues for the therapy of this disease.","['Abdi, Jahangir', 'Engels, Ferdi', 'Garssen, Johan', 'Redegeld, Frank']","['Abdi J', 'Engels F', 'Garssen J', 'Redegeld F']","['Division of Pharmacology and Pathophysiology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptors/genetics/*immunology/metabolism']",2011/01/18 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1040-8428(10)00281-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2010.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2011 Nov;80(2):225-40. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2010.12.001.

Patient 3 was a pregnant woman with renal failure, who repeatedly developed PRES with convulsions.

Although this is a reproducible method, it has more drawbacks than even radioactivity. In addition to the shortcoming of measuring only necrotic killing, some non-radioactive methods have not been widely used either. The numerous limitations of these methods led researchers to develop other techniques. This study describes a new flow cytometric approach that measures human mast cell-mediated cytotoxicity by marking target cells with monoclonal antibody alongside annexin V/ PI co-labelling. METHODS: A colony forming unit - mast in vitro was developed from human bone marrow mononuclear cells in serum-free methylcellulose medium. Six-week-old human bone marrow-derived mast cells were used as effectors, and malignant B-lymphoblastoid cell lines like Daudi / Raji cells as targets. Effectors and targets were both co-incubated for short and long-term durations, and experiments were repeated several times. Cytotoxicity was calculated by flow cytometric mast cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay. RESULTS: This method was able to clearly show mast cell-mediated cytotoxicity against human tumours. It is well-known that some lymphokine-activated killer-sensitive cells are resistant to mast cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, a different type of lymphokine activated killer-sensitive cell in this study was found to be very sensitive to mast cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, this technique also allowed us to separate killing into different stages: early and late apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: When compared to chromium release and non-radioactive methods, this method has the advantages of allowing evaluation of early apoptosis and short/long term mast cell-mediated cytotoxicity with specific target marking.","['Ozdemir, O']",['Ozdemir O'],"['Department of Pediatrics (3(rd) Clinic), Allergy-Immunology Division, Istanbul Goztepe Research and Training Hospital, Goztepe, Kadikoy, Turkiye. ozdemir oner@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Allergol Immunopathol (Madr),Allergologia et immunopathologia,0370073,IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', '*Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Flow Cytometry/methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Propidium/metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling']",2011/01/18 06:00,2012/01/20 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-0546(10)00246-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.aller.2010.07.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Allergol Immunopathol (Madr). 2011 Sep-Oct;39(5):259-66. doi: 10.1016/j.aller.2010.07.007.

The present study aimed at analyzing the relevance of agmatine homeostasis in pathophysiology of human leukemia. Proliferation of the human leukemia cells HMC-1 and HL-60 was determined in the absence or presence of agmatine. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution was investigated by determination of caspase-3 activity and/or flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide. Expression analysis was performed by qPCR and by a microarray genechip. Exogenous agmatine inhibited proliferation of both HMC-1 and HL-60 cells. The antiproliferative effect was due to interference of agmatine with the cell cycle with no evident signs of apoptosis. Comparative analysis of expression of mRNA in untreated HMC-1 cells and in non-leukemic human mast cells revealed a much lower expression of agmatinase and diamine oxidase in HMC-1 cells indicating a significantly reduced agmatine catabolism in the leukemic cells. At the mRNA level, inhibition of proliferation of both cell lines by agmatine was associated with cell type-specific alterations of the expression of enzymes of the polyamine pathway. The present results point to a significant role of agmatine homeostasis in the (patho)physiology of cell proliferation of leukemic cells, at least in HMC-1 and HL-60 cells, that may serve as a potential target for an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of human leukemia.","['Haenisch, Britta', 'Bonisch, Heinz', 'Cichon, Sven', 'Allam, Jean-Pierre', 'Novak, Natalija', 'Molderings, Gerhard J']","['Haenisch B', 'Bonisch H', 'Cichon S', 'Allam JP', 'Novak N', 'Molderings GJ']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Agmatine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Polyamines/*metabolism']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2010/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00619-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.12.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2011 Sep;35(9):1248-53. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.12.023.

Recently, Hh signaling has been identified as a required functional pathway for leukemia stem cells(LSCs), and loss of this pathway impairs leukemia progression. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the expression of Hedgehog signaling molecules in Chronic Myelogeneous Leukemia (CML) patients and normal people by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to correlate mRNA expression to patients' clinical data. RESULTS: Here, we showed that Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Smoothened (Smo), and Gli1 genes of Hh signaling were significantly upregulated in CML patients when compared with normal people (P < 0.001). The levels of Shh, Smo mRNA in chronic phase of CML patients were obviously lower than that in blast crisis (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences of Shh, Ptch1, Smo, Gli1 mRNA expression found when comparing CML patients of chronic phase(CP) with imatinib(IM) treated or not(p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that activation of the Hh pathway maybe associated with CML progression.

AIM: To determine whether the activation of the pro-apoptotic poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) pathway is involved in the induction of corporal apoptosis, and whether the administration of 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), a specific PARP inhibitor, could ameliorate ED in diabetic rats. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (8-weeks-old) were randomly divided into three groups: age-matched controls (C), diabetic controls (DM), and 3-AB-treated diabetic group (DM + 3-AB). Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal (ip) injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). Eight weeks after the induction of diabetes, DM + 3-AB group treated with 3-AB (30 mg/kg/day, ip) for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At 12 weeks after diabetes induction, erectile function was assessed by cavernous nerve stimulation. Penile tissue was assessed for apoptosis, Masson's trichrome stain and immunohistochemical analysis for smooth muscle alpha actin. Expression of poly(ADP-ribose), phospho-protein kinase B (Akt), phospho-Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X Protein (Bax), and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were evaluated by Western blot. Caspase-3 activity and malondialdehyde (MDA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) concentrations were also determined. RESULTS: DM group showed impaired erectile function, increased PARP activity and corporal apoptosis, and decreased smooth muscle contents. Expression of phospho-Akt, phospho-Bad, Bcl-2, and concentrations of ATP and NAD+ were decreased in the DM group, whereas concentrations of MDA, expression of Bax, nuclear translocation of AIF, and caspase-3 activity were increased. Treatment with 3-AB restored erectile function and significantly reversed all molecular and histological alterations except for the increased MDA. CONCLUSION: Over-activation of penile PARP pathway in diabetic rats enhances corporal apoptosis via energy depletion, suppression of Akt phosphorylation, and activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which results in ED; these event could be prevented by treatment with 3-AB.","['Li, Wen Ji', 'Zhou, Juan', 'Li, Bao', 'Wang, Hao', 'Peng, Yu Bing', 'Wang, Zhong']","['Li WJ', 'Zhou J', 'Li B', 'Wang H', 'Peng YB', 'Wang Z']","[""Department of Urology and Andrology, Ninth People's Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Sex Med,The journal of sexual medicine,101230693,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Diabetes Complications/*complications', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Impotence, Vasculogenic/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Muscle, Smooth/*physiology', 'Penile Erection/*physiology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Streptozocin']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/09/07 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02176.x [doi]', 'S1743-6095(15)33478-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Sex Med. 2011 Apr;8(4):1072-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02176.x.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that 13cRA modulates brain neurochemical systems because increased 13cRA levels are correlated with depression and increased suicidal tendencies. However, the mechanism for the generation of endogenous 13cRA is not well understood. The present study identified and characterized a novel enzyme in zebrafish brain, 13-cis isomerohydrolase (13cIMH) (EC 5.2.1.7), which exclusively generated 13-cis retinol and can be oxidized to 13cRA. 13cIMH shares 74% amino acid sequence identity with human retinal pigment epithelium specific 65 kDa protein (RPE65), an 11-cis isomerohydrolase in the visual cycle, and retains the key residues essential for the isomerohydrolase activity of RPE65. Similar to RPE65, 13cIMH is a membrane-associated protein, requires all-trans retinyl ester as its intrinsic substrate, and its enzymatic activity is dependent on iron. The purified 13cIMH converted all-trans retinyl ester exclusively to 13-cis retinol with K(m) = 2.6 mum and k(cat) = 4.4 x 10(-4) .s(-1) . RT-PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry detected 13cIMH expression in the brain.

An accumulation of leukemic cells in peripheral blood of patients is a result of apoptosis disturbances as well as an increase in germinal centers CLL cell proliferation. The differences between CLL patients in the course and response to therapy reflects personal variability between patients in their genetic material. It was documented that many sufferers from CLL are over 60 years old, and because of many countries' population obsolescence this type of leukemia could become more frequent in the future. CLL remains incurable, and the therapy regimens available at present could induce even complete remissions, but finally a relapse of the disease. The etiology of this disease is still not known, but our understanding of the processes running in CLL cells has significantly increased. A number of new agents with potential of CLL cell elimination by apoptosis or autophagy were characterized. Some of them reflect potential in cell sensitization to standard therapy. The major challenge for the future is to develop targeted anti-cancer therapy and design the optimal personalized manner of CLL treatment. A special interest is focused on anti-cancer agents - natural substances of plant origin.

The great success of the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia illustrates the high potential of kinase inhibitor (KI) therapeutics, but also unveils a major limitation: the development of drug resistance. This is a significant concern as KIs reach large patient populations for an expanding array of indications. AREAS COVERED: we provide an up-to-date understanding of the mechanisms through which KIs function and through which cells can become KI-resistant. We review current and future approaches to overcome KI resistance, focusing on currently approved KIs and KIs in clinical trials. We then discuss approaches to improve KI efficacy and overcome drug resistance and novel approaches to develop less drug resistance-prone KI therapeutics. EXPERT OPINION: although drug resistance is a concern for current KI therapeutics, recent progress in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and promising technological advances may overcome this limitation and provide powerful new therapeutics.","['Barouch-Bentov, Rina', 'Sauer, Karsten']","['Barouch-Bentov R', 'Sauer K']","['Stanford University School of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease and Geographic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stereoisomerism']",2011/01/18 06:00,2011/07/30 06:00,['2011/01/18 06:00'],"['2011/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2011.546344 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2011 Feb;20(2):153-208. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2011.546344.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC3095104,,,"['R01 GM088647/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI070845-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM100785/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI070845/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM088647-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS256985'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell morphology was examined under microscope after immunofluorescence staining for neurofilament protein, cell vitality accessed by the Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay, and expressions of a panel of insulin signaling-related proteins was detected by Western blot analysis. We show here that, at low concentrations of 0.1-1.0 micromol/L, fibrillar Abeta(1-40) had little effects on the cells; however, at higher concentrations of 2-10 mumicromol/L, it caused pathological changes, decreased the cell viability, and reduced the expression of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-I, Protein Kinase B, and B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that fibrillar Abeta(1-40) not only decreases the viability of cholinergic neuron but also down regulates the expression of important proteins in the insulin signal transduction pathway. We speculate that fibrillar Abeta(1-40) may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's through disrupting the insulin signaling pathway, therefore decreasing neuronal activity and eventually leading to the apoptosis and cell loss.","['Du, Yi-Feng', 'Yan, Peng', 'Guo, Shou-Gang', 'Qu, Chuan-Qiang']","['Du YF', 'Yan P', 'Guo SG', 'Qu CQ']","['Department of Neurology, Shandong University Affiliated Provincial Hospital, Jinan, Shangdong 250021, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anat Rec (Hoboken),"Anatomical record (Hoboken, N.J. : 2007)",101292775,IM,"['Amyloid beta-Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholinergic Fibers/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Animal', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptor, Insulin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/04/26 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2009/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ar.21088 [doi]'],ppublish,Anat Rec (Hoboken). 2011 Feb;294(2):287-94. doi: 10.1002/ar.21088.

METHODS: This retrospective chart review included 514 patients </= 18 years of age diagnosed with ALL or AML between January 1999 and December 2007. PI episodes were identified by radiology report reviews. RESULTS: Twenty patients with ALL and four patients with AML presented 31 PI episodes. The median time between diagnoses of leukemia and PI was 1.0 month (interquartile range 0.8-6.4 months). Plain radiographs diagnosed all PI episodes. Computerized tomography (CT) and ultrasound were performed in 6 and 13 episodes, respectively. All CT and three ultrasounds demonstrated PI. Thirty episodes occurred exclusively in the colon, most commonly in the ascending (n = 26) and transverse (n = 18) segments. Treatment included complete bowel rest in 27 (87.1%) and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics in 29 (93.5%). One case required colectomy. Two episodes were untreated. There were no fatalities associated with PI. CONCLUSIONS: PI is uncommon in children with ALL or AML. Ultrasound is less sensitive than plain radiographs for diagnosis. PI occurred almost exclusively in the colon. With conservative management, most patients had excellent outcome.","['Li, Siyang', 'Traubici, Jeffrey', 'Ethier, Marie-Chantal', 'Gillmeister, Biljana', 'Alexander, Sarah', 'Gassas, Adam', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Li S', 'Traubici J', 'Ethier MC', 'Gillmeister B', 'Alexander S', 'Gassas A', 'Sung L']","['Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Pneumatosis Cystoides Intestinalis/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/01/15 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-011-1088-x [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2012 Feb;20(2):343-7. doi: 10.1007/s00520-011-1088-x.

ATL is a rare adult onset T-cell malignancy that is characterized by the presence of ATL flower cells with T-cell markers, HTLV-1 antibodies in the serum, and monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 provirus in affected cells. Ocular manifestations associated with HTLV-1 virus infection have been reported and include HTLV-1 uveitis and keratoconjunctivitis sicca, but reports of ocular involvement in ATL are exceedingly rare. This article describes the ocular manifestations and pathology of ATL. We also report for the first time a case of a 34-year-old male with systemic ATL and prominent atypical lymphoid cell infiltration in the choroid. To our knowledge, this is the first report defining prominent choroidal involvement as a distinct ocular manifestation of ATL. ATL may masquerade as a variety of other conditions, and molecular techniques involving microdissection and PCR have proven to be critical diagnostic tools.

The core apoptosis pathway is well conserved between mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans, but the extent to which ubiquitin ligases regulate apoptotic cell death is not known. To investigate the role of E3 ligases in apoptosis, we inhibited 108 of the 165 predicted E3 ubiquitin ligase genes by RNA interference and quantified apoptosis in the C. elegans germline after genotoxic stress. From this screen, we identified the homologous to E6-associated protein C terminus-domain E3 ligase EEL-1 as a positive regulator of apoptosis. Intriguingly, the human homologue of EEL-1, Huwe1/ARF-BP1/Mule/HectH9, has been reported to possess both pro- and anti-apoptotic functions through its ability to stimulate Mcl-1 and p53 degradation, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that eel-1 is required to promote DNA damage-induced germ cell apoptosis, but does not have a role in physiological germ cell apoptosis or developmental apoptosis in somatic tissue. Furthermore, eel-1 acts in parallel to the p53-like gene cep-1 and intersects the core apoptosis pathway upstream of the Bcl-2/Mcl-1 orthologue ced-9.

PP2A has been described as a potential therapeutic target in chronic myeloid leukemia, Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we show that PP2A inactivation is a recurrent event in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and that restoration of PP2A phosphatase activity by treatment with forskolin in AML cells blocks proliferation, induces caspase-dependent apoptosis and affects AKT and ERK1/2 activity. Moreover, treatment with forskolin had an additive effect with Idarubicin and Ara-c, drugs used in standard induction therapy in AML patients. Analysis at protein level of the PP2A activation status in a series of patients with AML at diagnosis showed PP2A hyperphosphorylation in 78% of cases (29/37). In addition, we found that either deregulated expression of the endogenous PP2A inhibitors SET or CIP2A, overexpression of SETBP1, or downregulation of some PP2A subunits, might be contributing to PP2A inhibition in AML. In conclusion, our results show that PP2A inhibition is a common event in AML cells and that PP2A activators, such as forskolin or FTY720, could represent potential novel therapeutic targets in AML.","['Cristobal, I', 'Garcia-Orti, L', 'Cirauqui, C', 'Alonso, M M', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Odero, M D']","['Cristobal I', 'Garcia-Orti L', 'Cirauqui C', 'Alonso MM', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Odero MD']","['Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colforsin/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010294 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.294 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Apr;25(4):606-14. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.294.

We investigated 350 patients-283 s-AML after MDS and 67 transformed MPNs-for NPM1mut. NPM1mut was detected in 43/350 patients (12.3%) at diagnosis of s-AML (transformed MDS: 37/283; 13.1%; transformed MPNs: 6/67; 9.0%). Cytogenetic alterations were present in 12/40 cases (30.0%) with available karyotypes. Additional molecular mutations were found in 23/43 NPM1mut s-AML after MDS (53.5%) and in transformed MPN in 18/37 (48.6%): FLT3-ITD: 14/37 (37.8%); FLT3-TKD: 3/28 (10.7%); NRASmut: 4/37 (10.8%), RUNX1mut: 1/16 (6.3%). In NPM1mut-transformed MPNs, five out of six cases showed 1-2 additional molecular mutations (2 x KITD816V, ETV6-PDGFRB, 2 x JAK2V617F, 2 x FLT3-ITD). Backtracking of nine of these cases by quantitative real time PCR showed the NPM1mut already at diagnosis of MDS/MPN, at variable levels and up to 14 months before diagnosis of AML, and at transformation often being preceded or accompanied by other genetic alterations. Thus, NPM1 mutations are involved in the transformation from MDS to AML or MPN to blast phase in single cases, which should be further confirmed in larger studies.","['Schnittger, S', 'Bacher, U', 'Haferlach, C', 'Alpermann, T', 'Dicker, F', 'Sundermann, J', 'Kern, W', 'Haferlach, T']","['Schnittger S', 'Bacher U', 'Haferlach C', 'Alpermann T', 'Dicker F', 'Sundermann J', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. susanne.schnittger@mll.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics/mortality', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010299 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.299 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Apr;25(4):615-21. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.299.

Previous studies demonstrated that mice transplanted with hematopoietic cells expressing the AF4-MLL fusion protein develop proB ALL. The AF4-MLL oncoprotein becomes activated by Taspase1-mediated hydrolysis, which subsequently leads to a heterodimer of the cleavage products AF4-MLL.N and MLL.C. This protein-protein interaction is due to the FYRN and FYRC interaction domains present in both protein fragments. Heterodimerization subsequently induces high-molecular-weight protein complex formation that is protected against SIAH1/2-mediated polyubiquitinylation. Here, we attempted to selectively block this initial heterodimerization step, aiming to prevent the oncogenic activation of the AF4-MLL multiprotein complex. The minimal interaction interface was experimentally defined first in a bacterial two-hybrid system, and then in mammalian cells by using a biosensor assay. Expression of the FYRC domain, or smaller portions thereof, resulted in the inhibition of heterodimer formation, and blocked AF4-MLL multiprotein complex formation with subsequent destruction of the AF4-MLL oncoprotein. Thus, it is in principle possible to specifically target the AF4-MLL protein. This knowledge can now be exploited to design inhibitory decoys in order to destroy the AF4-MLL oncoprotein.","['Pless, B', 'Oehm, C', 'Knauer, S', 'Stauber, R H', 'Dingermann, T', 'Marschalek, R']","['Pless B', 'Oehm C', 'Knauer S', 'Stauber RH', 'Dingermann T', 'Marschalek R']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/ZAFES, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010308 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.308 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Apr;25(4):663-70. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.308.

We performed a meta-analysis comparing efficacy of melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) and MP by pooling results on RR, PFS and OS reported in all the identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) under a random effects model. Overall, six prospective RCTs, with data extractable from five published trials (n=1571) [corrected] were identified. The pooled odds ratio of responding to therapy with MPT vs MP was 3.39 (P<0.001, 95% CI: 2.24-5.12). The pooled hazard ratios for PFS and OS were and 0.68 (P<0.001; 95% CI: 0.55-0.82) and 0.80 (P=0.07; 95% CI: 0.63-1.02), respectively, in favor of MPT. The odds ratios for high grade peripheral neuropathy and deep venous thrombosis were 6.6 and 2.4, respectively, in favour of MP. There was significant heterogeneity among the RCTs. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that in previously untreated, transplant ineligible, elderly myeloma patients, the addition of T to MP results in significantly improved RR and PFS with a trend towards improvement in OS compared with MP alone, but at a cost of significantly greater toxicity.","['Kapoor, P', 'Rajkumar, S V', 'Dispenzieri, A', 'Gertz, M A', 'Lacy, M Q', 'Dingli, D', 'Mikhael, J R', 'Roy, V', 'Kyle, R A', 'Greipp, P R', 'Kumar, S', 'Mandrekar, S J']","['Kapoor P', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Gertz MA', 'Lacy MQ', 'Dingli D', 'Mikhael JR', 'Roy V', 'Kyle RA', 'Greipp PR', 'Kumar S', 'Mandrekar SJ']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Rate', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage', 'Transplants', 'Treatment Outcome']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010313 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.313 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Apr;25(4):689-96. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.313.

Here, we investigated whether the isotype of the B-cell receptor (BCR) expressed by the tumoral cells correlated with the molecular subtype and survival. Gene expression analysis clustered the 53 patients included in this study into three subgroups, 17 germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) cases, 26 activated B-cell-like (ABC) cases and 10 intermediate cases. The molecular subtype was correlated with the isotype, as 15/17 GCB cases expressed a secondary isotype (immunoglobulin (Ig)G or IgA), whereas 24/26 ABC cases expressed a primary isotype (IgM or IgD) (P<0.0001). There was a trend toward a worse outcome for patients with an ABC DLBCL and a shorter overall survival for patients with IgM+ tumor (P=0.21 and 0.014, respectively). Finally, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed a striking asymmetric pattern, as the IGHM gene is conserved only on the productive IGH allele in most IgM+ tumors. Taken together, these data indicate that the isotype of the BCR is a reliable indicator for the GCB and ABC subtypes in DLBCL, and suggest that the conservation of an IgM is required for ABC DLBCL lymphomagenesis to occur.","['Ruminy, P', 'Etancelin, P', 'Couronne, L', 'Parmentier, F', 'Rainville, V', 'Mareschal, S', 'Bohers, E', 'Burgot, C', 'Cornic, M', 'Bertrand, P', 'Lenormand, B', 'Picquenot, J-M', 'Jardin, F', 'Tilly, H', 'Bastard, C']","['Ruminy P', 'Etancelin P', 'Couronne L', 'Parmentier F', 'Rainville V', 'Mareschal S', 'Bohers E', 'Burgot C', 'Cornic M', 'Bertrand P', 'Lenormand B', 'Picquenot JM', 'Jardin F', 'Tilly H', 'Bastard C']","['INSERM U918, Laboratoire de genetique oncologique, Genetique et clinique des proliferations lymphoides, IFRMP23, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France. phirum@rouen.fnclcc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Germinal Center/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/06/10 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2010302 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.302 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Apr;25(4):681-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.302.

Remarkably, SIP1/ZEB2 is a known target of the microRNA 200 (miR-200) family. In this light, we postulated that Sip1/ZEB2 and the miR-200 family could play a role during the NO-dependent differentiation of mES. METHODS AND RESULTS: The results of the present study show that Sip1/ZEB2 expression is downregulated during the NO-dependent expression of mesendoderm and early cardiovascular precursor markers, including Flk1 and CXCR4 in mES. Coincidently, members of the miR-200 family, namely miR-429, -200a, -200b, and -200c, were transcriptionally induced in parallel to mouse Tert. This regulation occurred at the level of chromatin. Remarkably, miR-429/miR-200a overexpression or Sip1/ZEB2 knockdown by short hairpin RNA interference elicited a gene expression pattern similar to that of NO regardless of the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor. CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first demonstrating that the miR-200 family and Sip1/ZEB2 transcription factor are regulated by NO, indicating an unprecedented molecular circuitry important for telomerase regulation and early differentiation of mES.","['Rosati, Jessica', 'Spallotta, Francesco', 'Nanni, Simona', 'Grasselli, Annalisa', 'Antonini, Annalisa', 'Vincenti, Sara', 'Presutti, Carlo', 'Colussi, Claudia', ""D'Angelo, Carmen"", 'Biroccio, Anna', 'Farsetti, Antonella', 'Capogrossi, Maurizio C', 'Illi, Barbara', 'Gaetano, Carlo']","['Rosati J', 'Spallotta F', 'Nanni S', 'Grasselli A', 'Antonini A', 'Vincenti S', 'Presutti C', 'Colussi C', ""D'Angelo C"", 'Biroccio A', 'Farsetti A', 'Capogrossi MC', 'Illi B', 'Gaetano C']","[""Laboratorio di Patologia Vascolare, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata-IRCCS, Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Donors/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 2']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/05/19 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['ATVBAHA.110.214478 [pii]', '10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.214478 [doi]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2011 Apr;31(4):898-907. doi: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.214478.

Here, we address the hypothesis that statins affect T cell adhesion and migration by modulating the function of specific GTPases. Statins inhibit the synthesis of mevalonic acid, which is required for farnesyl and geranylgeranyl isoprenoid synthesis. Ras superfamily GTPases are post-translationally isoprenylated to facilitate their anchorage to membranes, where they function to stimulate signal transduction processes. We demonstrate that 1 muM statin inhibits the adhesion, migration, and chemotaxis of the T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM and TEM of CCRF-CEM and PEER T-ALL cells, but higher statin concentrations are needed to inhibit adhesion of primary T cells. Similar effects are observed following treatment with GGTI-298 or RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Rap1b but not Rap1a, Rac1, Rac2, RhoA, or Cdc42. Statins also alter Rap1 activity and Rap1b localization. Rap1 levels are higher in primary T cells than T-ALL cells, which could explain their reduced sensitivity to statins. These results demonstrate for the first time that the closely related Rap1a and Rap1b isoforms have different functions and suggest that statins or Rap1b depletion could be used to reduce tissue invasion in T-ALL.","['Infante, Elvira', 'Heasman, Sarah J', 'Ridley, Anne J']","['Infante E', 'Heasman SJ', 'Ridley AJ']","[""Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, New Hunt's House, Guy's Campus, King's College London, London SE1 1UL, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lovastatin/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Simvastatin/*pharmacology', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'rap GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/06/01 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0810441 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0810441 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2011 Apr;89(4):577-86. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0810441.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In a ""3 + 3"" design, patients received escalating doses of tipifarnib (days 1-14) and bortezomib (days 1, 4, 8, 11) every 3 weeks until maximum tolerated dose was reached. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected at days 1, 8, and 22 for measurement of chymotrypsin-like and farnesyltransferase activity. Purified bone marrow leukemic blasts were collected at baseline and at day 8 for measurement of NF-kappaB activity. RESULTS: The combination was well-tolerated, and maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Dose-limiting toxicities included diarrhea, fatigue, and sensorimotor neuropathy. Chymotrypsin-like and farnesyltransferase activity within PBMCs were decreased in a majority of patients at day 8. NF-kappaB activity within leukemic blasts was decreased in a majority of patients at day 8. Complete response with incomplete count recovery was observed in 2 patients, and additional 5 patients had stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: Tipifarnib and bortezomib combination in patients with advanced leukemias was well-tolerated, demonstrated relevant target inhibition, and was associated with signals of clinical activity in patients with advanced and refractory acute leukemias. Future studies of this combination may be warranted in more selected groups of patients in whom these molecular targets are of particular importance.","['Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Duong, Vu H', 'Winton, Elliott F', 'Stuart, Robert K', 'Burton, Michelle', 'Zhang, Shumin', 'Cubitt, Christopher', 'Blaskovich, Michelle A', 'Wright, John J', 'Sebti, Said', 'Sullivan, Daniel M']","['Lancet JE', 'Duong VH', 'Winton EF', 'Stuart RK', 'Burton M', 'Zhang S', 'Cubitt C', 'Blaskovich MA', 'Wright JJ', 'Sebti S', 'Sullivan DM']","['H.

The present study examines 5 phosphoproteins (pErk, pAkt, pS6, pStat3, and pStat5) in response to 5 cytokine/growth factors (stem cell factor [SCF], Flt-3/Flk-2 ligand [FL], granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor [GM-CSF], interleukin-3 [IL-3], and granulocyte-CSF [G-CSF]) within 7 immunophenotypically defined populations, spanning progenitor to mature myeloid/myelomonocytic cells in normal bone marrows with further comparison to AML samples. The normal cohort showed pathway-specific responses related to lineage, maturation, and stimulus. Heterogeneous-signaling responses were seen in homogeneous immunophenotypic subsets emphasizing the additive information of signaling. These profiles provided a critical baseline for detection of dysregulated signaling in AML falling into 4 broad categories, viz lack of response, increased activation, altered constitutive expression, and dysregulated response kinetics, easily identified in 10 of 12 AMLs. These studies clearly show robust and reproducible flow cytometry phosphoprotein analyses capable of detecting abnormal signal-transduction responses in AML potentially contributing to definitive reliable identification of abnormal cells. As functional correlates of underlying genetic abnormalities, signal-transduction abnormalities may provide more stable indicators of abnormal cells than immunophenotyping which frequently changes after therapy and disease recurrence.","['Marvin, James', 'Swaminathan, Suchitra', 'Kraker, Geoffrey', 'Chadburn, Amy', 'Jacobberger, James', 'Goolsby, Charles']","['Marvin J', 'Swaminathan S', 'Kraker G', 'Chadburn A', 'Jacobberger J', 'Goolsby C']","['Robert H.

In CML, the BCR/ABL fusion kinase causes the constitutive activation of STAT5, thereby driving the expression of genes promoting survival. BCR/ABL kinase inhibitors have become the mainstay of therapy for CML, although CML cells can develop resistance through mutations in BCR/ABL. To overcome this problem, we used a cell-based screen to identify drugs that inhibit STAT-dependent gene expression. Using this approach, we identified the psychotropic drug pimozide as a STAT5 inhibitor. Pimozide decreases STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, although it does not inhibit BCR/ABL or other tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, pimozide decreases the expression of STAT5 target genes and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CML cell lines. Pimozide also selectively inhibits colony formation of CD34(+) bone marrow cells from CML patients. Importantly, pimozide induces similar effects in the presence of the T315I BCR/ABL mutation that renders the kinase resistant to presently available inhibitors. Simultaneously inhibiting STAT5 with pimozide and the kinase inhibitors imatinib or nilotinib shows enhanced effects in inhibiting STAT5 phosphorylation and in inducing apoptosis. Thus, targeting STAT5 may be an effective strategy for the treatment of CML and other myeloproliferative diseases.","['Nelson, Erik A', 'Walker, Sarah R', 'Weisberg, Ellen', 'Bar-Natan, Michal', 'Barrett, Rosemary', 'Gashin, Laurie B', 'Terrell, Shariya', 'Klitgaard, Josephine L', 'Santo, Loredana', 'Addorio, Martha R', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Griffin, James D', 'Frank, David A']","['Nelson EA', 'Walker SR', 'Weisberg E', 'Bar-Natan M', 'Barrett R', 'Gashin LB', 'Terrell S', 'Klitgaard JL', 'Santo L', 'Addorio MR', 'Ebert BL', 'Griffin JD', 'Frank DA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Pimozide/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/06/07 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)36507-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-11-255232 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Mar 24;117(12):3421-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-11-255232.

When active, PML localizes to subnuclear structures named PML oncogenic domains (PODs) or PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), whereas inactive PML is located diffusely throughout the nucleus of cells. The objective of the current study was to develop a high content screening (HCS) assay for the identification of chemical activators of PML. We describe methods for automated analysis of POD formation using high throughput microscopy (HTM) to localize PML immunofluorescence in conjunction with image analysis software for POD quantification. Using this HCS assay in 384 well format, we performed pilot screens of a small synthetic chemical library and mixture-based combinatorial libraries, demonstrating the robust performance of the assay. HCS counter-screening assays were also developed for hit characterization, based on immunofluorescence analyses of the subcellular location of phosphorylated H2AX or phosphorylated CHK1, which increase in a punctate nuclear pattern in response to DNA damage. Thus, the HCS assay devised here represents a high throughput screen that can be utilized to discover POD-inducing compounds that may restore the tumor suppressor activity of PML in cancers or possibly promote anti-viral states.","['Yip, Kenneth W', 'Cuddy, Michael', 'Pinilla, Clemencia', 'Giulanotti, Marc', 'Heynen-Genel, Susanne', 'Matsuzawa, Shu-ichi', 'Reed, John C']","['Yip KW', 'Cuddy M', 'Pinilla C', 'Giulanotti M', 'Heynen-Genel S', 'Matsuzawa S', 'Reed JC']","['Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biomol Screen,Journal of biomolecular screening,9612112,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'HeLa Cells', '*High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1087057110394181 [pii]', '10.1177/1087057110394181 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomol Screen. 2011 Feb;16(2):251-8. doi: 10.1177/1087057110394181.

Some GFP fusion proteins lacking a polyQ tract may also induce nuclear aggresomes in cultured cells. Here we identify single missense mutations within the basic DNA recognition region of Bam HI Z E B virus replication activator (ZEBRA), an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded basic zipper protein without a polyQ tract, that efficiently induced the formation of nuclear aggresomes. Wild-type (WT) ZEBRA was diffusely distributed within the nucleus. Four non-DNA-binding mutants, Z(R179E), Z(R183E), Z(R190E), and Z(K178D) localized to the periphery of large intranuclear spheres, to discrete nuclear aggregates, and to the cytoplasm. Other non-DNA-binding mutants, Z(N182K), Z(N182E), and Z(S186E), did not exhibit this phenotype. The interior of the spheres contained promyelocytic leukemia and HSP70 proteins. ZEBRA mutants directly induced the nuclear aggresome pathway in cells with and without EBV. Specific cellular proteins (SC35 and HDAC6) and viral proteins (WT ZEBRA, Rta, and BMLF1) but not other cellular or viral proteins were recruited to nuclear aggresomes. Co-transfection of WT ZEBRA with aggresome-inducing mutants Z(R183E) and Z(R179E) inhibited late lytic viral protein expression and lytic viral DNA amplification. This is the first reported instance in which nuclear aggresomes are induced by single missense mutations in a viral or cellular protein. We discuss conformational changes in the mutant viral AP-1 proteins that may lead to formation of nuclear aggresomes.","['Park, Richard', ""Wang'ondu, Ruth"", 'Heston, Lee', 'Shedd, Duane', 'Miller, George']","['Park R', ""Wang'ondu R"", 'Heston L', 'Shedd D', 'Miller G']","['Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 6', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factor AP-1', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/05/17 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)51858-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.198325 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Mar 18;286(11):9748-62. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.198325.

The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of plasma cell neoplasms encompasses a broad spectrum of disorders, from the precursor disorder monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to plasma cell leukemia. The classification includes, in addition to precursor lesion MGUS, plasma cell myeloma, plasmacytoma, immunoglobulin deposition diseases, and osteosclerotic myeloma. Plasma cell myeloma is further divided into symptomatic plasma cell myeloma or multiple myeloma (MM), asymptomatic smoldering myeloma (SMM), non-secretory myeloma, and plasma cell leukemia. Although histopathologic cut-off criteria are incorporated into the classification schema, distinction between MGUS, SMM, and MM depends primarily on the presence or absence of end-organ damage, as defined by ""CRAB"" criteria (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, lytic bone lesions, or a combination of these). Systematic evaluation of pathogenetic differences between MGUS and MM should offer invaluable insights into early myelomagenesis. Given the complex, intertwined nature of the malignant plasma cell and its surroundings, multiple pathogenetic mechanisms play a critical role in interactions between neoplastic cells and their microenvironment. Understanding the events leading to end-organ damage, like anemia and bone remodeling, is a critical part of investigating early myelomagenesis and should provide us with better tools for early identification and treatment of these patients.","['Korde, Neha', 'Maric, Irina']","['Korde N', 'Maric I']","['National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1508, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic']",2011/01/15 06:00,2011/07/16 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(10)00107-1 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2011 Jan;48(1):13-21. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.11.004.,,,PMC3026628,,,['ZIA CL090027-01/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS253406'],,['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, how CB-T compares to related (RD-T) and unrelated donor transplantation (URD-T) is not established. We compared survival of 75 double-unit CB-T, 108 RD-T, and 184 URD-T recipients who received transplants over the same period for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Patients had similar ages and disease risk, and a similar percentage had acute leukemia. The incidence of day 180 transplant-related mortality (TRM) of 21% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12-31) after CB-T was higher than that of RD-T recipients. However, this was compensated for by a low risk of TRM after day 180, and a relatively low incidence of relapse. Hence, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 55% (95% CI: 45-68) after CB-T was similar to that after RD-T or URD-T (P = .573). In multivariate analysis, donor source had no influence on PFS, with the only significant factors being recipient age and disease risk. In a subanalysis of 201 patients with acute leukemia, CB-T, RD-T, and URD-T recipients also had similar 2-year disease-free survival (P = .482).

We hypothesized that interleukin-2 (IL-2) combined with DLI after chemotherapy might augment graft-versus-leukemia effects. To identify a safe and effective IL-2 regimen, a phase I/II study of DLI plus IL-2 therapy was performed for such patients. After chemotherapy, 17 patients received DLI (1 x 10(8) CD3/kg for patients with related donors, and 0.1 x 10(8) CD3/kg for those with unrelated donors) and an escalating dose of induction IL-2 (1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 x 10(6) IU/m(2)/day representing levels I [n = 7], Ia [n = 9], and II [n = 1]) for 5 days followed by maintenance (1.0 x 10(6) IU/m(2)/day) for 10 days as a continuous intravenous infusion. Unacceptable IL-2-related toxicities developed in 1 patient at level I, 2 at level Ia, and 1 at level II. Grades III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) developed in 5 patients, and extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) developed in 8.

Data on the efficacy of HCT after RIC relative to myeloablative conditioning (MAC) are limited. We compared the outcomes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients >18 yrs who received UCB grafts after either RIC or MAC. One hundred nineteen adult patients with AML in complete remission (CR) underwent an UCB transplant after RIC (n =74, 62%) or MAC (n = 45, 38%) between January 2001 and December 2009. Conditioning was either reduced intensity and consisted of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg, fludarabine 200 mg/m(2), and total-body irradiation (TBI) 200 cGy or myelablative and consisted for cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg, fludarabine 75 mg/m(2), and TBI 1200-1320 cGy. All patients received cyclosporine (day -3 to day +180) and mycophenolate mofetil (day -3 to day +45) post-HCT immunosuppression and hematopoietic growth factor. Use of RIC was reserved for patients >45 years (n = 66, 89%) or preexisting severe comorbidities (n = 8, 11%). The 2 groups were similar except for preceding myelodysplastic syndrome (RIC = 28% versus MAC = 4%, P < .01) and age that was dictated by the treatment protocols (median, RIC = 55 years versus MAC = 33years; P < .01). The incidence of neutrophil recovery at day +42 was higher with RIC (94% versus MAC = 82%, P < .1), whereas platelet recovery at the sixth month was similar (RIC = 68% versus MAC = 67%, P = .30). Incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (RIC = 47% versus MAC = 67%, P < .01) was decreased with similar incidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) (RIC = 30% versus MAC = 34%, P = .43). Median follow-up for survivors was 3.8 and 4.5 years for RIC and MAC, respectively (P = .4). Using RIC, 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was decreased (31% versus MAC = 55%, P = .02) and 3-year relapse incidence was increased (43% versus MAC = 9%, P < .01). Two-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) was similar (RIC = 19% versus MAC = 27%; P = .55). In multivariate analysis, RIC recipients and those in CR2 with CR1 duration <1 year had higher risk of relapse and poorer LFS with no independent predictors of TRM. UCB with RIC extends the use of allogeneic HCT for older and frail patients without excessive TRM with greater benefit for patients in CR1 and CR2 with longer CR1.","['Oran, Betul', 'Wagner, John E', 'DeFor, Todd E', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Brunstein, Claudio G']","['Oran B', 'Wagner JE', 'DeFor TE', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Brunstein CG']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. oranx002@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Mycophenolic Acid/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Myeloablative Agonists', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods/standards', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Whole-Body Irradiation', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/15 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2010/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00024-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.01.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Sep;17(9):1327-34. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.01.007.

It has been revealed that the receptor complexes for IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OM), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) utilize this gp130 protein as a common signal-transducing component, explaining how these cytokines mediate overlapping biological function. Recent observations with mice lacking gp130 or having continuously activated gp130 protein have disclosed an important biological function of gp130 in cardiovascular system: the former mice show extremely hypoplastic development of the ventricular myocardium at 16.5 days postcoitum (dpc), and the latter exhibit hypertrophy of myocardium. These cardiovascular abnormalities are considered to be the results of the perturbation of gp130, which also transduces the signal of cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a recently isolated factor causing hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes and having sequence similarity with IL-6, IL-11, LIF, CNTF, and OM. In fact, CT-1 shares gp130 with these cytokines as a critical signaling component. Besides various well-established mechanisms by which cardiac growth and development are regulated, a gp130 signaling may be a newly discovered mechanism that regulates these events.","['Hirota, H', 'Yoshida, K', 'Taga, T', 'Kishimoto, T']","['Hirota H', 'Yoshida K', 'Taga T', 'Kishimoto T']","['Hisao Hirota and Tadamitsu Kishimoto are at the Department of Medicine III, Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Trends Cardiovasc Med,Trends in cardiovascular medicine,9108337,,,1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['2011/01/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]']","['1050-1738(96)00037-0 [pii]', '10.1016/1050-1738(96)00037-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Cardiovasc Med. 1996 May;6(4):109-15. doi: 10.1016/1050-1738(96)00037-0.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 1996.

Combined FC and mitoxantrone (M) has been reported to be effective in a single arm study, and rituximab when added to chemotherapy in CLL is synergistic. A randomized, two-stage, Phase II trial of FCM and FCM-R was conducted in relapsed CLL. The primary endpoint was response rate 2 months after therapy, assessed according to the 2008 International Workshop CLL criteria. In addition, minimal residual disease (MRD) in the marrow was studied 2 months after therapy, with MRD negativity defined as <0.01% CLL cells. Fifty-two patients were entered, 26 in each arm. The overall response rates to FCM and FCM-R were 58% and 65% respectively. Combined complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete marrow recovery [CR(i)] was 15% (95% confidence interval [CI]:4-35%) for FCM and 42% (95%CI:23-63%) for FCM-R, with eight patients achieving MRD negativity (3 FCM; 5 FCM-R). The toxicity of both regimens was acceptable. In conclusion, the addition of rituximab to FCM improves the response rates in relapsed CLL, resulting in more complete remissions and without additional safety concerns.

Here, we explored the mechanisms of 3 kinds of human feeder cells, including human placental cells from the chorionic plate, human bone marrow stromal cells, and human foreskin fibroblasts. First, we determined that undifferentiated growth of 2 kinds each of human (H1 and HSF6) and mouse (D3 and CE3) ESCs was possible in all human feeder cell types tested (human placental cells, human bone marrow stromal cells, and human foreskin fibroblasts), without the need for exogenous cytokine supplementation including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor. We then prepared their corresponding endogenous bFGF-knockout feeders using siRNA and tried to maintain human and mouse ESCs in their undifferentiated state; however, neither human nor mouse ESCs could be maintained in bFGF-knockout human feeder cells. The expressions of stemness markers such as Oct-4 and Nanog were significantly decreased in the bFGF-knockout group compared with those in the controls, and differentiation had already occurred, despite the undifferentiated morphologic appearance of the ESCs. In conclusion, human feeder cells are able to support the undifferentiated growth of human and mouse ESCs via bFGF synthesis.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of korbazol-induced apoptosis in B-CLL leukemic cells. METHODS: peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 10 B-CLL patients were used for assessing the effect of caspase inhibitors and chelator of intracellular Ca(2)+. RESULTS: cell death rate induced by the tested compound was decreased with the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, and the inhibitors of caspase-2 (Z-VDVAD-FMK) and -4 (ZYVAD- FMK), but not with the caspase-9 inhibitor z-LEHD-FMK and caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-FMK. No significant release of cytochrome C (cyt C) from mitochondria to the cytosol of B-CLL cells treated with korbazol was observed. Moreover, chelating of intracellular Ca(2)+ with BAPTA-AM almost completely abolished the cytotoxic effect of korbazol.

METHODS: the relative count of CD34(+) cells in peripheral blood was evaluated by flow cytometry and the results were recorded on the total number of mononuclear cells (MNCs). CD34(+) status was correlated with the percentage of circulating and bone marrow blasts, cytogenetic studies, CFU-GM colony growth, overall survival and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: the number of MNC positive for anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody in the healthy control group ranged from 0.00% to 0.73%. Therefore, the cutoff value for overexpression of CD34 antigen on peripheral blood MNC of MDS patients was >/= 1% (CD34(+) cases). The mean number of circulating CD34(+) MNCs in 30 MDS patients was significantly higher than in the control group (p=0.009). The proportion of circulating CD34(+) MNCs did not correlate with the blast count in the peripheral blood (r=0.282, p=0.131), neither with the blast count in the bone marrow. In contrast, the proportion of circulating CD34(+) cells in MDS patients was significantly correlated with the proportion of bone marrow CD34(+) cells (r=0.461, p=0.035). The proportion of circulating CD34(+) cells did not correspond to the percentage of blast count in the bone marrow, neither with the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities or abnormal growth of GM-progenitors.

METHODS: analysis of cell surface antigen profiles was performed by flow cytometric immunophenotyping on bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMMNCs) specimens from 39 adult MDS patients and 5 healthy individuals. Expression of cell surface antigen profiles was correlated with FAB subtype, cytogenetics, CFU-GM colony growth, overall survival (OS) and leukemic transformation (LT). RESULTS: expression levels of early differentiation and myelo-monocytic antigens (CD38, CD13, CD33, CD14 and CD15) on myeloid cell compartment of BMMCs were significantly higher in MDS patients in comparison to healthy control group, suggesting maturational left shift of bone marrow myeloid cell compartment in MDS. CD34 antigen expression was in a positive linear correlation with HLA-DR antigen expression (r=0.652; p=0.0004), and in negative correlation with the expression of CD11b and CD15 antigens (r=-0.48; p=0.014 and r=-0.564; p=0.0033, respectively). Myeloid antigen ratio (HLA-DR/CD11b) was 2.5 fold higher in patients with MDS in comparison to control group. Patients with advanced disease had significantly higher myeloid antigen ratio than patients with low risk MDS (p<0.05). The type of CFU-GM colony growth and the presence of chromosomal aberrations were unrelated to the proportion of CD34(+) cells and elevated myeloid ratio. Patients with elevated proportion of CD34(+) BMMNCs or elevated myeloid ratio had significantly shorter OS and higher LT rate in comparison to patients whose proportion of CD34(+) BMMNCs and myeloid ratio were within normal range. CONCLUSION: the presence of abnormalities in antigen expression profiles of bone marrow myeloid cell compartment has clinical implication in MDS, with particular contribution in predicting the patient outcome. Elevated proportion of CD34(+) BMMNCs and elevated myeloid ratio of bone marrow myeloid compartment are useful immunophenotypic tools for estimation of prognosis in this very heterogeneous disorder group.","['Marisavljevic, D', 'Kraguljac-Kurtovic, N']","['Marisavljevic D', 'Kraguljac-Kurtovic N']","['Medical Center ""Bezanijska kosa"", Department of Hematology, Belgrade, Serbia. maris@tehnicom.net']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Myeloid Cells/*classification/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2011/01/14 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2010 Oct-Dec;15(4):746-52.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulation of apoptosis pathways also contributes to chemoresistance of B-CLL cells. Therefore, it is not surprising that induction and acceleration of apoptosis represent key point in novel B-CLL therapeutic protocols. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of two natural products, Immunarc forte and Korbazol on the in vitro survival of leukemic cells. METHODS: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 20 B-CLL patients and 20 healthy donors were used for cytotoxicity studies. Cytotoxic activity of the tested products were assessed by the MTT colorimetric assay and the type of cell death was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: we found that Korbazol was selectively cytotoxic against B-CLL cells, but the cytotoxic activity of Immunarc forte was much weaker. Of note, synergy was shown between these two drugs, and this effect was also selective, without affecting the normal mononuclear cells. According to Annexin-V binding, Korbazol and Immunarc forte induced apoptotic type of cell death in B-CLL cells. Moreover, treatment with Korbazol, but not with Immunarc forte, decreased spontaneous apoptosis in cultured normal polymorphonuclear cells. CONCLUSION: our findings imply that Korbazol is as potential therapeutic agent that induces apoptosis of B-CLL cells. The resistance of normal mononuclear cells and anti-apoptotic effects on normal polymorphonuclear cells, as well as its ability to synergize with Immunarc forte, warrants further investigation and supports their therapeutic application in the treatment of B-CLL.","['Baskic, D', 'Ilic, N', 'Popovic, S', 'Djurdjevic, P', 'Ristic, P', 'Avramovic, D', 'Arsenijevic, N']","['Baskic D', 'Ilic N', 'Popovic S', 'Djurdjevic P', 'Ristic P', 'Avramovic D', 'Arsenijevic N']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia. dejan.baskic@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biological Products/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*pathology']",2011/01/14 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2010 Oct-Dec;15(4):732-9.,,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Biological Products)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that THDF induces cell-cycle arrest in the M phase and inhibits tubulin polymerization. This was associated with the accumulation of cyclin B1 and p21(Cip1) , changes in the phosphorylation status of cyclin B1, Cdk1, Cdc25C, and MPM-2, and activation of the acidic sphingomyelinase (ASMase). Moreover, desipramine attenuated THDF-mediated cell death, indicating a crucial role of ASMase in the mechanism of cell death.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 20 consecutive HIV-negative patients with leukemic or lymphomatous meningitis who were treated with intrathecal liposomal cytarabine between 2004 and 2007. We focused on efficacy and on any late effects of the drug. RESULTS: Twenty patients who received intrathecal liposomal cytarabine injection as part of their treatment; of these, 9 were alive and in complete remission at the end of the study. Median survival from the time of the first injection was 22.7 months (range, 0.5 to 64 months). Short-term toxicity related to intrathecal of liposomal cytarabine was observed in 2 cases; headache in 1 case and regressive facial palsy and diplopy in 1 case. Long-term toxicity was seen in 2 cases; clinical symptoms were urinary and fecal dysfunction with confusion in 1 case, and urinary dysfunction in 1 case. Both patients had been heavily pre-treated with neurotoxic drugs and neuraxis irradiation. CONCLUSION: In our experience, intrathecal liposomal cytarabine injections were convenient in the management of leukemic and lymphomatous meningitis, and can lead to long-term survival. Although neurotoxicity was rare, clinicians should exercise caution when retreatment is required in relapsing patients.","['Brion, Annie', 'Legrand, Faezeh', 'Larosa, Fabrice', 'Schillinger, Francoise', 'Garnache-Ottou, Francine', 'Helias, Philippe', 'Fontan, Jean', 'Heczko, Marian', 'Delaby, Philippe', 'Daguindau, Etienne', 'Vuillier, Jacqueline', 'Chauchet, Adrien', 'Deconinck, Eric']","['Brion A', 'Legrand F', 'Larosa F', 'Schillinger F', 'Garnache-Ottou F', 'Helias P', 'Fontan J', 'Heczko M', 'Delaby P', 'Daguindau E', 'Vuillier J', 'Chauchet A', 'Deconinck E']","[""Centre hospitalier universitaire, Service d'Hematologie, Besancon 25030, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes/chemistry', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2011/01/14 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-011-9632-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Aug;30(4):1697-702. doi: 10.1007/s10637-011-9632-6.

Previously, we demonstrated that ATM kinase can regulate changes in PML NB number in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). PML NBs make extensive contacts with chromatin and ATM mediates DNA damage-dependent changes in chromatin structure in part by the phosphorylation of the KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1) at S824. We now demonstrate that in the absence of DNA damage, reduced KAP1 expression results in a constitutive increase in PML NB number in both human U2-OS cells and normal human diploid fibroblasts. This increase in PML NB number correlated with decreased nuclear lamina-associated heterochromatin and a 30% reduction in chromatin density as observed by electron microscopy, which is reminiscent of DNA damaged chromatin. These changes in chromatin ultrastructure also correlated with increased histone H4 acetylation, and treatment with the HDAC inhibitor TSA failed to further increase PML NB number. Although PML NB number could be restored by complementation with wild-type KAP1, both the loss of KAP1 or complementation with phospho-mutants of KAP1 inhibited the early increase in PML NB number and reduced the fold induction of PML NBs by 25-30% in response to etoposide-induced DNA DSBs. Together these data implicate KAP1-dependent changes in chromatin structure as one possible mechanism by which ATM may regulate PML NB number in response to DNA damage.","['Kepkay, Rosemarie', 'Attwood, Kathleen M', 'Ziv, Yael', 'Shiloh, Yosef', 'Dellaire, Graham']","['Kepkay R', 'Attwood KM', 'Ziv Y', 'Shiloh Y', 'Dellaire G']","['Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*ultrastructure', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis/chemistry', 'Tripartite Motif-Containing Protein 28', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*analysis/chemistry/metabolism']",2011/01/14 06:00,2011/04/29 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['14551 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.2.14551 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Jan 15;10(2):308-22. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.2.14551.

Skin lesions were de novo in 7.5%, concurrent in 26.6%, and subsequent in 60.7%. Several morphologic characteristics (density, size of tumor cells, inflammatory background) were statistically useful in distinguishing between varied myeloid disorders. De novo MLCs displayed a specific morphologic profile. Association of CD68, CD33, and MPO could diagnose 100% of the cases of MLC. However, the immunohistochemical panel could not distinguish between the varied underlying myeloid disorders, with the exception that CD123 was particularly powerful in recognizing chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and also permitted reclassification of 4 cases as blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.","['Benet, Claire', 'Gomez, Aurelie', 'Aguilar, Claire', 'Delattre, Claire', 'Vergier, Beatrice', 'Beylot-Barry, Marie', 'Fraitag, Sylvie', 'Carlotti, Agnes', 'Dechelotte, Pierre', 'Hospital, Valerie', ""d'Incan, Michel"", 'Costes, Valerie', 'Dereure, Olivier', 'Ortonne, Nicolas', 'Bagot, Martine', 'Laroche, Liliane', 'Blom, Astrid', 'Dalac, Sophie', 'Petrella, Tony']","['Benet C', 'Gomez A', 'Aguilar C', 'Delattre C', 'Vergier B', 'Beylot-Barry M', 'Fraitag S', 'Carlotti A', 'Dechelotte P', 'Hospital V', ""d'Incan M"", 'Costes V', 'Dereure O', 'Ortonne N', 'Bagot M', 'Laroche L', 'Blom A', 'Dalac S', 'Petrella T']","['University Hospital Center, Plateau Biology Technology Gerard Mack, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/pathology', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/congenital/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology']",2011/01/14 06:00,2011/02/18 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['135/2/278 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPFMNYCVPDEND0 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2011 Feb;135(2):278-90. doi: 10.1309/AJCPFMNYCVPDEND0.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the role of FLT3/ITD signaling in B-cell development, we studied VDJ recombination in the pro-B cells of FLT3/ITD mice and discovered an increased frequency of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) introduced by the VDJ recombinase. Early pro-B cells from FLT3/ITD mice were found to have a lower efficiency and decreased accuracy of DSB repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which is required for rejoining DSBs during VDJ recombination. Reduced NHEJ repair probably results from reduced expression of Ku86, a key component of the classic DNA-PK-dependent NHEJ pathway. In compensation, early pro-B cells from FLT3/ITD cells mice show increased levels of the alternative, and highly error-prone, NHEJ pathway protein PARP1, explaining the increase in repair errors. These data suggest that, in early pro-B cells from FLT3/ITD mice, impairment of classic NHEJ decreases the ability of cells to complete postcleavage DSB ligation, resulting in failure to complete VDJ recombination and subsequent block of B-lymphocyte maturation. These findings might explain the poor prognosis of leukemia patients with constitutive activation of FLT3 signaling.","['Li, Li', 'Zhang, Li', 'Fan, Jinshui', 'Greenberg, Kathleen', 'Desiderio, Stephen', 'Rassool, Feyruz V', 'Small, Donald']","['Li L', 'Zhang L', 'Fan J', 'Greenberg K', 'Desiderio S', 'Rassool FV', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Recombination, Genetic/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2011/01/14 06:00,2011/05/12 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41204-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-05-286070 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Mar 17;117(11):3131-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-05-286070.

This is primed for receptor-induced activation of its membrane fusion function first by cellular furin cleavage in the ectodomain and then by viral protease cleavage in the endodomain. The first cleavage separates the peripheral surface (SU) subunit from the transmembrane (TM) subunit, and the latter releases a 16-residue-long peptide (R) from the TM endodomain. Here, we have studied the distribution of R peptide cleavages in the spike TM subunits of Moloney MLV preparations with partially R-peptide-processed spikes. The spikes were solubilized as trimers and separated with an R peptide antibody. This showed that the spikes were either uncleaved or cleaved in all of its TM subunits. Further studies showed that R peptide cleavage-inhibited Env mutants, L(649)V and L(649)I, were rescued by wild-type (wt) Env in heterotrimeric spikes. These findings suggested that the R peptide cleavages in the spike are facilitated through positive allosteric cooperativity; i.e., the cleavage of the TM subunit in one Env promoted the cleavages of the TMs in the other Envs. The mechanism ensures that protease cleavage in newly released virus will generate R-peptide-cleaved homotrimers rather than heterotrimeric intermediates. However, using a cleavage site Env mutant, L(649)R, which was not rescued by wt Env, it was possible to produce virus with heterotrimers. These were shown to be less fusion active than the R-peptide-cleaved homotrimers. Therefore, the cooperative cleavage will speed up the maturation of released virus for fusion competence.","['Loving, Robin', 'Kronqvist, Malin', 'Sjoberg, Mathilda', 'Garoff, Henrik']","['Loving R', 'Kronqvist M', 'Sjoberg M', 'Garoff H']","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Gene Products, env/*metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*Virus Internalization', '*Virus Release']",2011/01/14 06:00,2011/05/14 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02500-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02500-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Apr;85(7):3262-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02500-10.

However, whether HBx has the ability to disturb the susceptibility of hepatocytes to common chemotherapeutic agents remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that HBx enhances cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity by a mechanism involving degradation of Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Ectopic expression of HBx sensitized hepatocytes to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by a marked downregulation of Mcl-1 but not of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Overexpression of Mcl-1 prevented HBx-induced proapoptotic and proinflammatory effects during cisplatin treatment both in vitro and in vivo. HBx-induced dysregulation of Mcl-1 resulted mainly from posttranslational degradation rather than transcription repression. Moreover, a caspase-3 inhibitor effectively abrogated HBx-enhanced Mcl-1 degradation and cell death. Importantly, antioxidants blocked activation of caspase-3 and acceleration of Mcl-1 loss, as well as cell death, in HBx-expressing hepatocytes upon cisplatin exposure in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these data implicate oxidative stress-dependent caspase-3-mediated degradation of Mcl-1 as a mechanism contributing to HBx-mediated sensitization of cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity. A combination of cisplatin and antioxidants might provide more advantage than cisplatin alone in the treatment of cancer patients with chronic HBV infection.","['Hu, Liang', 'Chen, Lei', 'Li, Liang', 'Sun, Hanyong', 'Yang, Guangzhen', 'Chang, Yanxin', 'Tu, Qianqian', 'Wu, Mengchao', 'Wang, Hongyang']","['Hu L', 'Chen L', 'Li L', 'Sun H', 'Yang G', 'Chang Y', 'Tu Q', 'Wu M', 'Wang H']","['International Cooperation Laboratory on Signal Transduction, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Institute, 225 Changhai Road, Shanghai 200438, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'Hepatitis B virus/*pathogenicity', 'Hepatocytes/*pathology/*virology', 'Humans', 'Liver/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins', 'Virulence Factors/*metabolism']",2011/01/14 06:00,2011/05/14 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01841-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01841-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Apr;85(7):3214-28. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01841-10.

This complex plays vital roles in the regulation of development-specific gene expression. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, a comparative microarray analysis of gene expression in primary adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma samples was performed, and the results were evaluated for their oncogenic and clinical significance. RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 and RING1 and YY1 binding protein transcripts with enhanced levels of trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 were found in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells compared with those in normal CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between the expression level of Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 and that of miR-101 or miR-128a, suggesting that the altered expression of the latter miRNAs accounts for the overexpression of the former. Patients with high Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 or RING1 and YY1 binding protein transcripts had a significantly worse prognosis than those without it, indicating a possible role of these genes in the oncogenesis and progression of this disease. Indeed, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells were sensitive to a histone methylation inhibitor, 3-deazaneplanocin A. Furthermore, 3-deazaneplanocin A and histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat showed a synergistic effect in killing the cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells have deregulated Polycomb repressive complex 2 with over-expressed Enhancer of zeste homolog 2, and that there is the possibility of a new therapeutic strategy targeting histone methylation in this disease.","['Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Osaka, Akemi', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Choi, Young Lim', 'Mano, Hiroyuki', 'Marquez, Victor E', 'Hayashi, Tomayoshi', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Moriwaki, Yuji', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Yamada, Yasuaki']","['Sasaki D', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Hasegawa H', 'Osaka A', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Choi YL', 'Mano H', 'Marquez VE', 'Hayashi T', 'Yanagihara K', 'Moriwaki Y', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Kamihira S', 'Yamada Y']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 852-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', '*Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Indoles', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Panobinostat', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2011/01/14 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.028605 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.028605 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 May;96(5):712-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.028605.

Endogenous cannabinoids (also called endocannabinoids) bind to the same receptors as those of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa. The most extensively studied endocannabinoids are anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine, AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. The endocannabinoids, their congeners and the cannabinoid receptors, together with the metabolic enzymes and putative transporters form the endocannabinoid system (ECS). In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the relationships of ECS, sex steroid hormones and cytokines in female fertility, and underline the importance of this endocannabinoid-hormone-cytokine network. METHODS: Pubmed and the Web of Science databases were searched for studies published since 1985, looking into the ECS, sex hormones, type-1/2 T-helper (Th1/Th2) cytokines, leukaemia inhibitory factor, leptin and reproduction. RESULTS: The ECS plays a pivotal role in human reproduction. The enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids normalize levels of AEA for successful implantation. The AEA degrading enzyme (fatty acid amide hydrolase) activity as well as AEA content in blood may potentially be used for the monitoring of early pregnancies. Progesterone and oestrogen are involved in the maintenance of endocannabinoid levels. The ECS plays an important role in the immune regulation of human fertility. CONCLUSIONS: The available studies suggest that tight control of the endocannabinoid-hormone-cytokine network is required for successful implantation and early pregnancy maintenance. This hormone-cytokine network is a key element at the maternal-foetal interface, and any defect in such a network may result in foetal loss.","['Karasu, T', 'Marczylo, T H', 'Maccarrone, M', 'Konje, J C']","['Karasu T', 'Marczylo TH', 'Maccarrone M', 'Konje JC']","['Endocannabinoid Research Group (ERG), Reproductive Sciences Section, Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine, University of Leicester, Robert Kilpatrick Clinical Sciences Building, Leicester Royal Infirmary, PO Box 65, Leicester, Leicestershire LE2 7LX, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Hum Reprod Update,Human reproduction update,9507614,IM,"['Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cytokines/*physiology', '*Endocannabinoids', 'Female', 'Fertility/*physiology', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Signal Transduction']",2011/01/14 06:00,2011/08/13 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['dmq058 [pii]', '10.1093/humupd/dmq058 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod Update. 2011 May-Jun;17(3):347-61. doi: 10.1093/humupd/dmq058.

Thus, the long-term risks of having a knee prosthesis must be evaluated. This study focuses on the potential carcinogenic effects of the prosthesis; it is a long-term follow-up of all patients in Sweden between 1975 and 2006. METHODS: The incidence of cancer in a total population of operated individuals was compared to the overall national cancer incidence in Sweden by means of standardised incidence ratios. Analysis of cancer latency period was performed to identify potential aetiological factors. RESULTS: For male and female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA), the overall cancer risks were elevated, ranging from 1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.18) for men with OA to 1.26 (1.23-1.29) for men with RA. The greatest increases in risk were observed for the leukaemia subtypes, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and essential thrombocytosis (ET), ranging from 3.31 (1.24-8.83) for ET in men with OA to 7.38 (1.85-29.51) for ET in women with RA. Increases in risk were also observed for breast cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma. The latency analysis revealed elevated risks late in the study period for both solid and haematopoietic cancers. However, only increases in MDS and possibly prostate cancer and melanoma rates appeared to be connected to the operation. CONCLUSION: This study showed that OA and RA arthroplasty patients have a significantly higher risk of cancer than the general population. Elevated risks of MDS and possibly prostate cancer and melanoma indicated a potential connection to exposure to metals in the implant. The observed excessive incidence of ET was likely associated with the inflammatory disease.","['Wagner, Philippe', 'Olsson, Hakan', 'Lidgren, Lars', 'Robertsson, Otto', 'Ranstam, Jonas']","['Wagner P', 'Olsson H', 'Lidgren L', 'Robertsson O', 'Ranstam J']","['Institute of Clinical Sciences Lund, Department of Orthopedics, Lund University Hospital, Lund University, Sweden. pw@nko.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications/therapy', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/*methods', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Knee Prosthesis/adverse effects', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/etiology', 'Osteoarthritis/complications/therapy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/etiology/therapy', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sweden', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications/etiology']",2011/01/14 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(10)01127-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2010.11.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2011 May;47(7):1061-71. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.11.023.

STUDY DESIGN: The Texas Cancer Registry identified 2800 cases diagnosed from 1995 to 2006 who were (1) born in Texas and (2) diagnosed at ages 2 to 17 years. The state birth certificate data were used to identify 11 200 age- and sex-matched control subjects. A multilevel mixed-effects regression model compared vaccination rates among cases and control subjects at the public health region and county level. RESULTS: Children born in counties with higher hepatitis B vaccine coverage had lower odds of all cancers combined (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.98) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) specifically (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.88). A decreased odds for ALL also was associated at the county level with higher rates of the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.92) and 4-3-1-3-3 vaccination series (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.87).

CONCLUSIONS: Some common childhood vaccines appear to be protective against ALL at the population level.","['Pagaoa, Melissa A', 'Okcu, M Fatih', 'Bondy, Melissa L', 'Scheurer, Michael E']","['Pagaoa MA', 'Okcu MF', 'Bondy ML', 'Scheurer ME']","['Division of Epidemiology and Disease Control, The University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Haemophilus Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Hepatitis B Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/*methods', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pediatrics/*methods', 'Poliovirus Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/prevention & control', 'Regression Analysis', 'Texas', 'Vaccines/adverse effects']",2011/01/14 06:00,2011/07/23 06:00,['2011/01/14 06:00'],"['2010/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2010/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-3476(10)01048-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpeds.2010.11.054 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 2011 Jun;158(6):996-1002. doi: 10.1016/j.jpeds.2010.11.054.
