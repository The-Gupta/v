During the 36-year period between 1955 and 1990, more than 33,000 patients received allogeneic bone marrow transplants; more than 45% of these were performed during the 3 years 1988-1990. Transplants are effective therapy for leukemia and other hematologic diseases. It is widely considered that transplants are the treatment of choice for aplastic anemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, those who fail conventional therapy for acute leukemia and a variety of genetic, metabolic and immune deficiency disorders. Successful application of bone marrow transplantation is limited by complications such as graft failure, graft versus host disease GVHD and interstitial pneumonia and, until recently, the requirement for an HLA-identical sibling donor. In the past few years, an increasing number of transplants were performed using unrelated or HLA-partially matched related donors with some success. Development of post-transplant complications can often be predicted by risk factor assessment. In this report, current data from the IBMTR are summarized and several risk factors affecting outcome identified.","['Sobocinski, K A', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Rimm, A A', 'Bortin, M M']","['Sobocinski KA', 'Horowitz MM', 'Rimm AA', 'Bortin MM']","['Division of Biostatistics/Clinical Epidemiology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0753-3322(92)90275-C [pii]', '10.1016/0753-3322(92)90275-c [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 1992;46(2-3):57-69. doi: 10.1016/0753-3322(92)90275-c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TALL-103/2 cells are absolutely dependent on interleukin 2 (IL-2) for their growth and survival in culture and thus provide a model cell line for studies of IL-2 signal transduction in a TCR-gamma/delta T-cell. In this report, we focus on the regulation of SRC-family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) by IL-2. TALL-103/2 cells were found to contain p56-LCK, p59-FYN, p62-YES and p53/56-LYN. Stimulation of growth factor-deprived TALL-103/2 cells with IL-2, however, induced increases in the relative activity only of the p56-LCK kinase. This IL-2-mediated increase in LCK kinase activity was manifested both by increased kinase autophosphorylation and by increased phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate enolase during in vitro kinase assays. Furthermore, immunoblot assays determined that the levels of p56-LCK protein were unaltered by IL-2-treatment, indicating that the measured elevations in LCK kinase activity reflected an increase in the specific activity of this PTK. In TALL-103/2 cells, IL-2 stimulated concentration-dependent increases in p56-LCK activity that displayed rapid and transient kinetics: detectable increases occurred within 1 minute after IL-2 stimulation, peaked at 10 minutes, and declined to baseline levels by 30 minutes. Treatment of TALL-103/2 cells with IL-4 abrogated IL-2-initiated proliferation, but did not inhibit IL-2-mediated activation of p56-LCK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Torigoe, T', ""O'Connor, R"", 'Fagard, R', 'Fischer, S', 'Santoli, D', 'Reed, J C']","['Torigoe T', ""O'Connor R"", 'Fagard R', 'Fischer S', 'Santoli D', 'Reed JC']","['University of Pennsylvania, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['CA-47859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-54957/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1043-4666(92)90080-B [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(92)90080-b [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1992 Sep;4(5):369-76. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(92)90080-b.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The former comparison is based on the conditional likelihood for matched case-control studies and the latter on the unconditional likelihood for Poisson regression. It is shown that the two likelihoods are orthogonal and that their product is an estimator of the full survival likelihood that would have been obtained on the total cohort, had complete covariate data been available. Parameter estimation and significance tests follow in the usual way by maximizing this product likelihood. The method is illustrated using data on leukemia following irradiation for cervical cancer. In this study, the original cohort study showed a clear excess of leukemia in the first 15 years after exposure, but it was not feasible to obtain dose estimates on the entire cohort. However, the subsequent nested case-control study failed to demonstrate significant differences between alternative dose-response relations and effects of time-related modifiers.

The myelodysplastic syndromes have become a paradigm for human preleukemia, where nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities, including complete or partial deletions of chromosomes five and seven, trisomy eight and Y chromosome loss suggest specific changes. Of particular significance are 5q deletions, as many genes important in hemopoiesis are located in this region, including the proto-oncogene FMS, which encodes the receptor for the macrophage colony-stimulating factor, CSF-1. Genetic damage such as point mutations in the RAS and FMS genes has been detected in preleukemia patients. The RAS gene family (N, K and H) encodes membrane-bound G proteins, which, like other proto-oncogenes, are components of the intracellular signal transduction pathways controlling mitogenesis and differentiation.

This method enables the psoralen moiety to be coupled to the phosphonate backbone between any two desired bases in a sequence. When hybridized to a target mRNA, the psoralen moiety can be directed toward a uridine base and, in turn, can undergo a photo-addition reaction with the target under UV irradiation at 365 nm. Several different non-nucleotide-based amino-linker reagents have been prepared for incorporation into methylphosphonate oligonucleotides by standard phosphonamidite chemistry. In addition, an N-hydroxysuccinimide activated ester analog of 4'-[(3-carboxypropionamido)methyl]-4,5',8- trimethylpsoralen has been synthesized for conjugation to the amino-linker moieties. Using this approach, we have prepared a number of psoralen-methylphosphonate-oligonucleotide conjugates which are complementary to the chimeric bcr/abl mRNA associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Solution hybridization studies with a 440-base subfragment of the bcr/abl RNA have shown that the psoralen moiety does not adversely affect duplex stability. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses have demonstrated that the psoralen-oligonucleotide conjugates undergo photo-addition to the RNA in a sequence-specific manner. Optimal photo-addition occurs when the psoralen moiety is inserted adjacent to one or more adenine residues in the oligonucleotide sequence, particularly between adenine and thymine (5'-3'). This internal labeling approach greatly increases the number of potential target sites available for photo-cross-linking experiments.","['Reynolds, M A', 'Beck, T A', 'Hogrefe, R I', 'McCaffrey, A', 'Arnold, L J Jr', 'Vaghefi, M M']","['Reynolds MA', 'Beck TA', 'Hogrefe RI', 'McCaffrey A', 'Arnold LJ Jr', 'Vaghefi MM']","['Genta Inc., San Diego, California 92121.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chimera/genetics', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/*chemical synthesis', 'Furocoumarins/*chemical synthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides/*chemical synthesis', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*chemical synthesis', 'Photochemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/genetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trioxsalen/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis']",1992/09/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/09/11 19:15'],"['1992/09/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/09/11 19:15 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bc00017a003 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 1992 Sep-Oct;3(5):366-74. doi: 10.1021/bc00017a003.,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Furocoumarins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '329W4YM10Z (methylphosphonic acid)', '9RZS3WBN9X (aminomethyltrioxsalen)', 'Y6UY8OV51T (Trioxsalen)']",,['bcr/abl'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this communication we report on a quantitative analysis of the interactions of MC540 with serum and serum components. Human serum inhibited the MC540-sensitized photoinactivation of K562 leukemia cells most effectively, followed in order of decreasing potency by calf, newborn calf, horse, and fetal bovine serum. The photoprotective capacity of these five sera was directly proportional to their albumin content.

HTLV-I is detected in most patients with adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and healthy carriers, who are frequently found in the southwestern parts of Kyushu and Shikoku Districts. HTLV-I-infected cells express IL-2 receptors, and HTLV-I-infected T cell lines can be established from most of ATL patients in culture in the presence of IL-2. Furthermore, these IL-2 dependent T cell lines often begin to proliferate in the absence of IL-2 and to not respond to IL-2, despite IL-2 receptors on their cell surface, thus mimicking ATL cells in vivo. These findings suggest that HTLV-I is an etiological agent of ATL. In this mini-review, the T cell immortalizing activity of HTLV-I in vitro, with special reference to the evolution of ATL cells based on our results, is described.","['Maeda, M']",['Maeda M'],"['Chest Disease Research Institute, Kyoto University.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*microbiology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hum Cell. 1992 Mar;5(1):70-8.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulation of pRB level and phosphorylation state was investigated during the induction of differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELC) by the chemical agent hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). In MELC, there is a critical time in G1 or early S phase when HMBA must be present in order to induce differentiation. This is followed by prolongation of the subsequent G1 phase, resumption of progression through the cell cycle for several generations, and then cell cycle arrest in G1-G0. Associated with HMBA-induced prolongation of G1, there is an increase in the amount of the underphosphorylated form of pRB. A variant cell line (DS19/VCR-C) with accelerated kinetics of HMBA-mediated differentiation shows a more marked increase in underphosphorylated pRB. In culture with HMBA, as MELC resume progression through the cell cycle, pRB is present in the phosphorylated form. The total amount of pRB increases approximately 3-fold over the succeeding cell divisions prior to terminal arrest in G1. This increase in pRB is inhibited by dexamethasone, which also blocks HMBA-induced MELC differentiation. During this period, RB mRNA also increases approximately 3- to 5-fold, which reflects an increase in the rate of transcription, with no change in mRNA stability. The state of phosphorylation and amount of pRB appear to be involved in the control of HMBA-induced terminal cell division of MELC.","['Richon, V M', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Marks, P A']","['Richon VM', 'Rifkind RA', 'Marks PA']","['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],['CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['Acetamides/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma/drug effects', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1992 Jul;3(7):413-20.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results demonstrate that okadaic acid treatment is associated with induction of a differentiated monocyte phenotype characterized by: (a) growth arrest; (b) increases in Mac-1 cell surface antigen expression; (c) down-regulation of c-myc transcripts; and (d) induction of tumor necrosis factor gene expression. This induction of monocytic differentiation was associated with transient increases in c-jun mRNA levels, which were maximal at 6 h. Similar effects were obtained for the c-fos gene. Run-on analysis demonstrated detectable levels of c-jun transcription in U-937 cells and that this rate is increased approximately 40-fold following okadaic acid exposure. c-jun mRNA levels were superinduced in cells treated with both okadaic acid and cycloheximide, whereas inhibition of protein synthesis had little, if any, effect on okadaic acid-induced c-jun transcription. The half-life of c-jun mRNA was similar (45-50 min) in both untreated and okadaic acid-induced cells. In contrast, treatment with both okadaic acid and cycloheximide was associated with stabilization (t 1/2 = 90 min) of c-jun transcripts. Taken together, these findings indicate that the induction of c-jun transcription by okadaic acid is controlled primarily by a transcriptional mechanism. Since previous studies have demonstrated that the c-jun gene is autoinduced by Jun/AP-1, we also studied transcription of c-jun promoter (positions -132/+170)-reporter gene constructs with and without a mutated AP-1 element.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kharbanda, S', 'Datta, R', 'Rubin, E', 'Nakamura, T', 'Hass, R', 'Kufe, D']","['Kharbanda S', 'Datta R', 'Rubin E', 'Nakamura T', 'Hass R', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Ethers, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, jun/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1992 Jul;3(7):391-9.,"['0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,"['c-fms', 'c-fos', 'c-jun', 'fos', 'jun', 'jun-B']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Commitment to terminal cell division is first detected in a portion of the cell population during this prolonged G1. HMBA-induced commitment is stochastic. This study has examined changes in two known cell cycle regulators, p34cdc2 and cyclin A, in cycle-synchronized MELC in the absence and presence of HMBA. Histone H1 kinase activity of p34cdc2, and the levels of CDC2Mm mRNA, 1.8-kilobase mRNA of cyclin A, and cyclin A protein changed during cell cycle progression in MELC, and all of them were suppressed during G1. The suppression of the H1 kinase activity and cyclin A expression continued through the prolonged G1 in MELC cultured with HMBA, whereas p34cdc2 protein level did not vary through the cell cycle in MELC cultured without or with inducer. Phosphorylation of p34cdc2 in uninduced MELC gradually increased as cells progressed from G1 to S. In induced MELC, an increase in phosphorylation of p34cdc2 occurred during the prolonged G1, and prior to the exit of the bulk of the cells from G1 to S. These results suggest that in HMBA-induced MELC, p34cdc2 phosphorylation per se is not a limiting factor in determining G1 to S progression. The persistent suppression of cyclin A expression and histone H1 kinase activity may play a role in HMBA-induced commitment to terminal differentiation.","['Kiyokawa, H', 'Ngo, L', 'Kurosaki, T', 'Rifkind, R A', 'Marks, P A']","['Kiyokawa H', 'Ngo L', 'Kurosaki T', 'Rifkind RA', 'Marks PA']","['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],['CA-0874823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*analysis', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclins/*analysis', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1992 Jun;3(6):377-83.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used this cell line to test whether the state of differentiation of a cell changes its response to interferon (IFN). The characteristics of expression of several IFN-alpha- and IFN-gamma-inducible genes in undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells were examined. p67, an IFN-gamma-inducible protein, was induced similarly in three cell types, whereas another IFN-gamma-inducible protein, p56, was induced strongly only in undifferentiated cells. In contrast, two isozymes of 2,5(A)-synthetase were induced better in differentiated cells in response to either IFN. Several IFN-alpha-inducible mRNAs, e.g., 561, 6-16, 1-8, and 2A, were induced much more strongly in granulocytes than in macrophages or in undifferentiated cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the IFN-stimulated response element of gene 561 and nuclear extracts of IFN-alpha-treated cells revealed the appearance of one complex and the disappearance of another one, concomitant with differentiation of the cells to granulocytes. These observations suggest that expression of IFN-inducible genes in HL-60 cells is regulated by trans-acting factors whose activity changes with the state of differentiation of the cells. Our study may have implications in the optimal clinical use of IFNs. Inducing cellular differentiation may augment the efficacy of IFNs as antitumor agents.","['Bandyopadhyay, S K', 'Kumar, R', 'Rubin, B Y', 'Sen, G C']","['Bandyopadhyay SK', 'Kumar R', 'Rubin BY', 'Sen GC']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195-5285.']",['eng'],"['AL-22510/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA-38661/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1992 Jun;3(6):369-75.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bone marrow register of the University of Dusseldorf allowed us to assess among other epidemiological features the incidence of MDS, which was compared to that of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Among a total of 18,416 different patients registered between 1975 and 1990, 584 cases of MDS (3.2%) and 506 cases of AML (2.8%) were identified. Over the study period, the percentage of newly diagnosed MDS rose from 1.3% to 4.5%, while there was no upward trend for AML. Among all patients undergoing bone marrow biopsy, the proportion of those over 60 years of age increased from 41.9% in 1975 to 54.1% in 1990. We found a strong correlation between the proportion of elderly patients and the relative frequency of MDS diagnoses. Thirty-one patients (5.3%) were classified as a secondary MDS because of previous treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or irradiation for a variety of malignancies. Twelve patients were identified in whom occupational exposure to organic solvents could not be ruled out. For calculating age-specific incidence rates, the analysis was confined to the town district of Dusseldorf (575,000 inhabitants), because exact demographical data were available for this population. In the last quinquennium of the study period (1986-90), myelodysplastic syndromes were more frequent than AML in the age group 50-70 years (4.9 v 1.8/100,000/year). In patients over 70, the incidence of MDS was more than 3 times that of AML (22.8 v 6.7/100,000). In this group, men had a higher incidence of MDS (33.9/100,000) than women (18/100,000). Crude annual incidence (all age groups) was also higher for MDS (4.1/100,000) than for AML (2.1/100,000) in recent years. We conclude that MDS are relatively common haematological neoplasias.

Three possible mechanisms, i.e. a cytotoxic effect, differentiation-induction of malignant cells, and prolongation of blood cell survival by destroying the reticuloendothelial system, may explain the effects of etoposide.

Presenting features were typically related to pancytopenia although hepatosplenomegaly and granulocytic sarcomas were far more prevalent than in the adult population. Morphological assessment of the peripheral blood and the bone marrow showed seven patients had refractory anaemia (RA), 13 patients had RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), nine patients had RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) and four patients had chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). The overall mean survival was short (9.9 months) in all the subgroups and the leukaemic transformation rate was high. None of the patients scored 0-1 according to the Bournemouth Scoring System; four patients scored 2 whereas 29 patients scored 3 to 4. We conclude that unlike adults, the myelodysplastic syndromes in children run an aggressive clinical course, irrespective of the FAB subtype, and the pathogenesis of these diseases in paediatric practice warrants scientific scrutiny. Intensive chemotherapy such as the one used in de novo-AML lead to complete remission in some children and these early results suggest that this should be the treatment of choice in paediatric MDS.","['Tuncer, M A', 'Pagliuca, A', 'Hicsonmez, G', 'Yetgin, S', 'Ozsoylu, S', 'Mufti, G J']","['Tuncer MA', 'Pagliuca A', 'Hicsonmez G', 'Yetgin S', 'Ozsoylu S', 'Mufti GJ']","[""University of Hacettepe, Hacettepe Children's Hospital, Department of Paediatric Haematology, Ankara, Turkey.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hepatomegaly', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Splenomegaly', 'Treatment Outcome']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06428.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Oct;82(2):347-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06428.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also tested the hypothesis that the selective use of AMSA (100 mg/m2/d on days 7, 8 and 9) would increase the complete remission (CR) rate when leukaemia cells remained in the bone marrow immediately following 6 d of Ara-C (2-3 g/m2/12 h) alone. Of 155 patients evaluable for response, 115 (74%) experienced marked cytoreduction by day 6 and received no further induction chemotherapy; 53 (45%) of these patients achieved CR after one course and 45 (38%) had resistant disease. The 36 patients (23%) with inadequate cytoreduction after the 6 d of ara-C alone were randomly assigned either to no further chemotherapy (21 patients) or to 3 d of AMSA (15 patients). The CR rates after one course were 14% and 53%, respectively (P = 0.01), and the fractions with resistant disease were 76% and 40%, respectively. The fractional reduction of leukaemia cells in the day 6 bone marrow aspirate specimen (P < 0.0001) and the reduction in the leukaemia cell mass measured in the day 6 marrow biopsy (P = 0.001) were the strongest predictors for achieving CR versus having residual disease in univariate analyses. The median duration of remission was 5 months, but seven patients (10%) remain in CR after 30-92 + months. Among the 140 patients who received only the 6 d of ara-C, the pretreatment albumin (P = 0.002) and lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.01) levels were the strongest predictors of response in univariate analyses, but only the albumin remained significant (P = 0.01) in a stepwise logistic regression analysis. Those patients with albumin > 4.0 mg/dl and LDH < 125% of normal had a 71% CR rate, and only 16% had resistant disease. Thus, pretreatment characteristics and rapid cytoreductin in the day 6 bone marrow sample identified a favourable subset of patients with AML in first relapse, some of whom responded quite well to 6 d of ara-C alone and have had long disease-free remissions.","['Larson, R A', 'Day, R S', 'Azarnia, N', 'Bennett, J M', 'Browman, G', 'Goldberg, J', 'Gottlieb, A', 'Grunwald, H', 'Miller, K', 'Raza, A']","['Larson RA', 'Day RS', 'Azarnia N', 'Bennett JM', 'Browman G', 'Goldberg J', 'Gottlieb A', 'Grunwald H', 'Miller K', 'Raza A', 'et al.']","['University of Chicago Medical Center, IL 60637-1470.']",['eng'],['CA-28734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amsacrine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06427.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Oct;82(2):337-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06427.x.,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction chemotherapy led to remission from the acute leukaemia. However, neither clinically nor morphologically did this remission mean a return to normal haematopoiesis. The two patients who displayed myelodysplastic features before and when AML was diagnosed, again developed myelodysplasia, and the third patient, who had a long history of polycythaemia vera, returned to this myeloproliferative condition. Nor was cytogenetic normalization achieved; instead, abnormal cell clones were found in which all but one of the karyotypic aberrations present at acute leukaemia diagnosis had disappeared. The solitary anomalies that were detected in these reemerging clones must correspond to the primary cytogenetic aberrations of the patients pre-leukaemic diseases. They were del(5) (q11q33) and del(17) (p11) in the two myelodysplastic cases, and der(18)t(9;18) (p11;p11) in the patient with long-standing polycythaemia vera. The other, secondary, aberrations were probably the leukaemogenic changes, and with the eradication or reduction of the subclones containing them, the leukaemic phenotype disappeared.

In 62 AML patients, predominantly enrolled on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) treatment protocols, in whom immunoglobulin (Ig) as well as T-cell receptor beta chain (TCR-beta) gene rearrangement analyses had been performed, morphology, cytochemistry, antigen profile and karyotype were reviewed retrospectively. Nuclear reactivity with anti-TdT antibody was demonstrated in 34 patients (55%) and confirmed by ribonuclease protection assay in all patients tested. Five TdT-protein negative patients were TdT-transcript positive. Lymphoid antigens (lyA) were detected in 24 of 51 cases tested (47%) with B-cell antigens (CD19, CD10) being restricted to TdT+ AML (P = 0.03). Only two patients had Ig heavy, none had Ig light chain or TCR-beta gene rearrangements. Although both patients with rearranged Ig loci were TdT+, either by protein or RNA analysis, the low incidence of such rearrangement within the TdT+ AML group (6%) argues against a significant association between the presence of TdT and crosslineage Ig gene rearrangements in AML. While FAB-diagnoses did not differ between TdT+ and TdT- or lyA+ and lyA- AML, particular immunophenotypic features correlated with TdT positively, e.g. the presence of early antigens, CD34 and HLA-DR, and the absence of the more mature myelo-monocytic antigens, CDw65 and CD14. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities were associated with TdT+ AML such as inv(16) (p13q22) or t(16;16) (p12;q22) (five patients; P = 0.03) and t(8;21) (q22;q22) (three patients).

To clarify why the unusual myeloid tumours developed in non-haematopoietic tissues, we examined the capability of HSM-1 to bind to skin fibroblast layers. The HSM-1 cells were found to bind to both bone marrow stromal layers and skin fibroblast layers. Among the other myeloid cell lines tested, none was found to bind to skin fibroblast layers. These findings suggest that the GS cell line may be derived from a haematopoietic precursor cell which can bind to skin fibroblasts and is localized in non-haematopoietic tissues resulting in the formation of extramedullary myeloid metaplasia.

Overall cancer mortality was raised in West African males (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.25-1.54), and non-significantly raised in West African females (RR 1.14, 0.96-1.37) compared to mortality in the England and Wales-born population. Much of the increased risk was due to very high rates of liver cancer in males (RR 31.6, 23.8-41.9), but rates were also raised for a wide range of other cancers in each sex. Only lung and brain cancer had significantly decreased mortality. In East Africans, overall cancer mortality was low in males (RR 0.63, 0.56-0.70), and in females (RR 0.80, 0.72-0.89). Mortality was significantly low for cancers of the stomach, pancreas and testis, and Hodgkin's disease in males, for cervical cancer in females, and for lung cancer and melanoma in both sexes. Cancer sites with significantly raised mortality included oropharyngeal cancer, leukaemia, and multiple myeloma in both sexes. In Caribbean immigrants overall cancer rates were significantly low in males (RR 0.71, 0.68-0.74) and in females (RR 0.76, 0.73-0.80). Mortality was significantly low for many cancers including colorectal, lung, testis and brain cancers. Mortality was significantly raised only for cancer of the prostate in males, of the placenta in females, and of the liver, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma in both sexes. Overall, mortality was high from prostatic cancer and liver cancer, and was low from brain cancer, in predominantly ethnic African immigrant groups. Both East and West African immigrants had raised rates of leukaemia. All of the migrant groups had high rates of multiple myeloma and low rates of testicular, ovarian and lung cancer. Genetic and environmental factors that may contribute to these patterns are discussed.","['Grulich, A E', 'Swerdlow, A J', 'Head, J', 'Marmot, M G']","['Grulich AE', 'Swerdlow AJ', 'Head J', 'Marmot MG']","['Department of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],['G8802774/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Africa/ethnology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/mortality', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/mortality', 'Genital Neoplasms, Male/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Lymphoma/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Pharyngeal Neoplasms/mortality', 'Social Class', 'Time Factors', 'Transients and Migrants/*statistics & numerical data', 'Urologic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Wales/epidemiology', 'West Indies/ethnology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1992.383 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1992 Nov;66(5):905-11. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1992.383.,,,,,PMC1977983,,,,,,,,,,

The increase in life span was greater in mice treated with 72 mg kg-1 DWA2114R on the 6th day following tumour inoculation than in mice treated at earlier times. Such superior effects against advanced L1210 were also seen with cis-diammine (1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II) (CBDCA) but not seen with the parent compound, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) or other antitumour agents devoid of platinum. After the injection of DWA2114R on day 6, most of the ascites tumour cells accumulated in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle and the total cell number markedly decreased from 10(8) to less than 10(6). On the other hand, only a temporary G1 arrest and a less than 50% reduction of the cell number were induced after a similar treatment on day 3. Interestingly, the superiority of DWA2114R for advanced L1210 was lost in athymic nude mice and mice depleted of T cells by anti-thymocyte antisera. In addition, mice cured of advanced L1210 specifically rejected re-inoculated L1210 cells. These results indicate that the superior antitumour activity against advanced L1210 is unique to DWA2114R among the agents tested (except for CBDCA) and is caused by both an increased drug susceptibility of tumour cells and a drug-induced antitumour effect mediated by T cells of the host mice.","['Akamatsu, K', 'Endo, K', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Kamisango, K', 'Morikawa, K', 'Koizumi, M', 'Koizumi, K']","['Akamatsu K', 'Endo K', 'Matsumoto T', 'Kamisango K', 'Morikawa K', 'Koizumi M', 'Koizumi K']","['Exploratory Research Laboratories, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.

The venom of Naja nigricollis nigricollis possessed the most potent cytotoxic activity towards B16F10 melanoma cells among various examined venoms [2]. The main cytotoxic factor (P4) isolated from this venom showed preferential activity on tumor cell lines and caused lysis at concentrations of 10(-7) M (0.8-1 micrograms/ml) [3]. The present study examined the binding of cytotoxin P4 to melanoma B16F10 and WEHI-3B leukemia cell lines and found that, like cytotoxicity, it depended on concentration, temperature and incubation time. Cytotoxin concentrations that elicited no apparent damage to cells during the first hour of incubation caused lysis after a longer period of incubation, suggesting that a critical number of bound molecules is required in order to cause cell death. Bivalent ions, such as Mg2+, Ca2+ or Sr2+, which decreased binding to the cells also inhibited cytotoxicity. Competition experiments as well as the displacement of 75% of the bound radiolabelled cytotoxin with 'cold' cytotoxin, suggest the presence of specific binding sites for the toxin in the examined tumor cells. The non-specific binding of the cytotoxin P4 to sea urchin ova and sperm cells without affecting their fertility, even at high concentrations of 10(-5) M, indicates that the specific binding to cells is probably a necessary condition for cell lysis.","['Borkow, G', 'Chaim-Matyas, A', 'Ovadia, M']","['Borkow G', 'Chaim-Matyas A', 'Ovadia M']","['Department of Zoology, George S.

This may explain the increased occurrence of various opportunistic infections in heavy ethanol users. Immunological alterations associated with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) also permit more opportunistic infections. In this study, we used a murine model of retrovirus infection induced by LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus. The combined effects of ethanol use and early retroviral infection (prior to the development of AIDS) on resistance to Streptococcus pneumoniae were investigated. Consumption of ethanol by non-retrovirus-infected mice resulted in decreased resistance to S. pneumoniae. However, retrovirus-infected mice fed a diet containing high concentrations of ethanol (6 and 7% v/v) exhibited a greater resistance to S. pneumoniae infection than retrovirus-infected mice fed diets with lower concentrations (5%) or no ethanol. The total number of white blood cells also decreased as serum ethanol levels increased. There were also fewer lymphocytes and more neutrophils and monocytes in retrovirus-infected mice fed ethanol. Diet consumption decreased as the concentration of ethanol increased in the diet. Consumption was dependent upon the dark-light cycle. The highest diet consumption was observed during the first 4 hr of the dark period. The level of ethanol in serum was influenced by the amount of the diet consumed and its ethanol concentration.

We determined the effect of the derivatives on the equilibrium binding of 1 nM [3H]NBTI to human erythrocytes and mouse P388 leukemia cells and on the inhibition of zero-trans influx of formycin B in P388 cells and equilibrium exchange of uridine in human erythrocytes. Placement of substituent groups at the 5'-position of NBTI had relatively little effect on its binding to high-affinity binding sites or its inhibition of nucleoside transport, regardless of the size of the substituent group (up to about 1000 kDa). All substituents at the 2-position considerably reduced the affinity of NBTI to membrane binding sites and its potency as an inhibitor of nucleoside transport, but some substituent groups reduced the affinity of binding more than the inhibition of nucleoside transport. The effect of the 2-substituents was not directly related to their size. Attachment of a succinate at the 3'- or 5'-position also reduced to a greater extent the binding of NBTI than its inhibition of nucleoside transport, which was relatively little affected. Attachment of succinates at both the 3' and 5'-positions almost completely abolished both binding to high-affinity sites and inhibition of nucleoside transport. Both functions of NBTI were abolished completely by the simultaneous blockage of the 2'- and 3'-positions.

We also demonstrated that this glucocorticoid inhibits TPA-induced increases in expression of the EGR-1 early response gene. The results of nuclear run-on assays and half-life experiments indicated that this effect of dexamethasone is regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Similar studies were performed for the NF-kappa B gene. While TPA treatment was associated with transient increases in NF-kappa B mRNA levels, this induction was blocked by dexamethasone. In contrast, dexamethasone had no significant effect on the activation of pre-existing NF-kappa B protein as determined in DNA-binding assays. Taken together, these findings suggest that the activated glucocorticoid receptor inhibits signaling pathways which include expression of the EGR-1 and NF-kappa B genes and that such effects may contribute to a block in TPA-induced monocytic differentiation.","['Hass, R', 'Brach, M', 'Gunji, H', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Kufe, D']","['Hass R', 'Brach M', 'Gunji H', 'Kharbanda S', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],['CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",1992/10/20 00:00,1992/10/20 00:01,['1992/10/20 00:00'],"['1992/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(92)90474-W [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(92)90474-w [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1992 Oct 20;44(8):1569-76. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(92)90474-w.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding is compatible with a previous finding that IL-6 mRNA was absent from follicular center cells in reactive lymphoid tissues. The functions of IL-6 in these lymphomas may be quite diverse. It appears that IL-6, as an autocrine factor, is responsible for the plasmacytoid differentiation of lymphoma cells in IP and some IBL (IBL-P). The differentiation of lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma cells in SLL, however, may not be mediated by an autocrine IL-6 mechanism. Interleukin-6 may provide a growth signal, rather than acting as a differentiation factor, for some IBL cells and for some transformed tumor cells in proliferation centers in SLL.","['Hsu, S M', 'Xie, S S', 'Waldron, J A Jr']","['Hsu SM', 'Xie SS', 'Waldron JA Jr']","['Department of Pathology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock.']",['eng'],['47462/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/metabolism/pathology', 'Plasma Cells/cytology']",1992/10/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/10/11 19:15'],"['1992/10/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/10/11 19:15 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1992 Oct;141(4):915-23.,['0 (Interleukin-6)'],,,,PMC1886645,,,,,,,,,,

Parallel and divergent features of these diseases are reviewed. In MM, expression of multiple hemopoietic lineage-associated antigens on the malignant cells and the substantial likelihood of progression to acute myelogenous leukemia suggest transformation of a pluripotent stem cell. In CLL, transformation more likely involves a committed B-cell progenitor. Another difference is that clonal evolution with associated cytogenetic progression is common in MM but not CLL. Other data, including studies of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, suggest that MM results both from increased proliferation and accumulation of tumor cells, whereas tumor cell accumulation is the predominant feature of CLL. These differences may be reflected in the seemingly greater role of cytokine abnormalities in MM progression. For example, osteoclast-activating properties of some cytokines account for bone involvement in MM but not in CLL. MM and CLL share common features such as stage-dependent anemia and immune deficiency. Both diseases respond to alkylating agents but vary markedly in their sensitivity to fludarabine (CLL greater than MM) and glucocorticoids (MM greater than CLL). Differences between these diseases in progression-free interval and survival may reflect different definitions of premalignant and malignant phases rather than biologic differences. Detailed comparisons between MM and CLL may provide additional insights into these and related B-cell cancers.","['Barlogie, B', 'Gale, R P']","['Barlogie B', 'Gale RP']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205.']",['eng'],"['CA28771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology', '*Multiple Myeloma/etiology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(92)90176-C [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(92)90176-c [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1992 Oct;93(4):443-50. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(92)90176-c.,,,,85,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The histories of 57 patients with CLL who underwent splenectomy at the Mayo Clinic between 1975 and 1991 were retrospectively reviewed. Of the 57 patients, 50 underwent splenectomy for reasons directly related to their disease process such as cytopenias or symptomatic splenomegaly. The histories from these 50 patients were studied to assess the response to splenectomy and the operative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Ninety-four percent of patients were in Rai stage III or IV with extensive marrow infiltration, massive splenomegaly, and cytopenias refractory to chemotherapy. A positive response to splenectomy was defined at 3 months of follow-up as: (1) a hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL or greater in a patient with a preoperative value less than 11 g/dL; or (2) a platelet count of 100 x 10(3)/mm3 or greater in a patient with a preoperative value less than 100 x 10(3)/mm3. A positive response was achieved in 77% of patients with anemia, 70% of patients with thrombocytopenia, and 64% of patients with both anemia and thrombocytopenia. The response was sustained at 1 year of follow-up in 86%, 84%, and 85% of the patients, respectively. Postoperative transfusion requirements decreased correspondingly. The operative morbidity was 26%, and the operative mortality was 4%. The mean duration of hospitalization was 9.8 days (median: 9 days; range: 5 to 24 days). The actuarial median survival after splenectomy was 41 months in responders and 14 months in nonresponders. We found no preoperative parameters that were clearly predictive of a poor hematologic response. In particular, outcome was not affected by preoperative spleen size or the degree of marrow infiltration by CLL. All patients with symptomatic splenomegaly had an improved sense of well-being. CONCLUSION: In this, the largest single institution study to date, we found splenectomy to be efficacious in providing durable remissions of refractory cytopenias and in relieving symptomatic splenomegaly in the majority of patients with CLL. The procedure is associated with a low perioperative mortality. Although the impact on survival is uncertain, the improved peripheral blood counts may allow the administration of adequate doses of myelosuppressive chemotherapy.","['Neal, T F Jr', 'Tefferi, A', 'Witzig, T E', 'Su, J', 'Phyliky, R L', 'Nagorney, D M']","['Neal TF Jr', 'Tefferi A', 'Witzig TE', 'Su J', 'Phyliky RL', 'Nagorney DM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*surgery', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Splenectomy/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1992/10/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/10/11 19:15'],"['1992/10/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/10/11 19:15 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(92)90174-A [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(92)90174-a [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1992 Oct;93(4):435-40. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(92)90174-a.,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employees experienced fewer deaths from each of the major causes than were expected based on U.S., California, and local county mortality rates. Respiratory cancer was significantly elevated in one socioeconomic category comprised of operators (SMR = 157, 95% CI = 109-220). The 34 cases who died from respiratory cancer and 136 matched controls, all of whom were operators, were included in a nested case-control study. Departments in which subjects had worked were grouped into 13 work assignment or product categories by an industrial hygienist without knowledge of case-control status. Smoking habits and other occupational exposures were ascertained by telephone interview from subjects or surrogate-responders. As expected, current cigarette smoking was strongly related to respiratory cancer. After adjustment for smoking, cases were significantly more likely than controls to have ever worked in one of the 13 work areas (supervision, services, and business support). However, no dose-response relationship was evident with duration of employment in this work area and the departments involved were associated with plant security and not chemical production. Results were similar when a 15-year latency period was assumed. These findings suggest that the excess of respiratory cancer mortality among operators was most likely due to differences in cigarette smoking or other factors not ascertained, rather than to a specific occupational exposure.","['Burchfiel, C M', 'Cartmill, J B', 'Axe, F D', 'Bond, G G']","['Burchfiel CM', 'Cartmill JB', 'Axe FD', 'Bond GG']","['Department of Epidemiology, Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI 48674.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,"['Adult', 'California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Prevalence', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.4700220107 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1992;22(1):69-83. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700220107.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relationships to growth and growth hormone secretion.,1343-8,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of 18-Gy cranial irradiation on growth, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging in children who underwent previous irradiation for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN: Clinical survey. SETTING: Department of Pediatrics of the University of Bologna (Italy). PATIENTS: Ten boys and 18 girls who were treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia; median age at diagnosis was 3.1 years and at the end of follow-up was 11.5 years. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Height was periodically measured from diagnosis until the end of follow-up, when GH secretion study and magnetic resonance imaging were performed. The mean height SD score was significantly lower than at diagnosis only at the end of treatment. Nocturnal mean GH concentration and GH response to pharmacological tests (arginine and levodopa [L-dopa]) were pathological in 22 cases (81.5%) and 18 cases (64.3%), respectively. Sixteen cases (59.2%) had a blunted GH release to the three tests. Mean pituitary anterior lobe height was reduced and seven subjects (25%) showed an empty sella. CONCLUSIONS: Cranial irradiation with 18 Gy does not seem to influence the growth pattern of most children who are treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, despite severe impairment of GH secretion and morphological abnormalities of the sellar area. However, a follow-up until final height is necessary.","['Cicognani, A', 'Cacciari, E', 'Carla, G', 'Rosito, P', 'Cau, M', 'Mancini, A F', 'Zucchini, S', 'Vecchi, V', 'Pirazzoli, P', 'Paolucci, G']","['Cicognani A', 'Cacciari E', 'Carla G', 'Rosito P', 'Cau M', 'Mancini AF', 'Zucchini S', 'Vecchi V', 'Pirazzoli P', 'Paolucci G']","['First Pediatric Clinic, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Dis Child,American journal of diseases of children (1960),0370471,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthropometry', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth/*radiation effects', 'Growth Hormone/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/pathology/radiation effects', 'Infant', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland/*pathology/*radiation effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*radiotherapy']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archpedi.1992.02160230101028 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dis Child. 1992 Nov;146(11):1343-8. doi: 10.1001/archpedi.1992.02160230101028.,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase technique, these antibodies were applied to sections of normal organs and to peripheral blood and bone marrow films from hematologically normal individuals and patients with hematologic malignancies. In control experiments, antibodies showed reactivity with cytoplasmic constituents of granulocytes from the promyelocytic to the neutrophilic stage. In acute myeloid leukemia, antibody K101 was positive (more than 20% of blasts) in 13 of 21 (62%) cases, while antibody D46 was positive in 11 of 17 (65%) cases. Antibody H36/71 was positive in only 4 of 24 (17%) cases of acute myeloid leukemia. At least one marker was present in 6 of 8 (75%) cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with myeloid antigen-positive blasts and was negative in 20 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with myeloid antigen-negative blasts. These results support the view that abnormal granules (with defective expression of the D46, K101, and H36/71 antigens) form in blastic and leukemic cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen consecutive patients with enhancement of the cisternal portion of the third cranial nerve on postcontrast MR were retrospectively identified; 50 control patients referred for pituitary microadenomas were also retrospectively reviewed. FINDINGS: The enhancement was bilateral in six patients and unilateral in seven patients. Four of the six patients with bilateral enhancement had unilateral oculomotor nerve palsies; none had bilateral third cranial nerve palsy. Five of the seven patients with unilateral enhancement had ipsilateral third nerve palsies. Of the nine patients with third nerve palsies, the pupil was involved in four patients. Follow-up studies were available in six patients, four of whom had third nerve palsy. Resolution of the enhancement correlated with resolution of the symptoms in two patients. The patients' underlying diagnoses were lymphoma (four), leukemia (one), viral meningitis (one), neurofibromatosis (two), inflammatory polyneuropathy-HIV related (one), ophthalmoplegic migraine (one), Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (one), coccidioidomycosis (one), and diabetes (one).

However, analysis of cytokine synthesis by single CSF cells using molecular biology techniques may improve the differential diagnosis of hematological neoplasia of the brain and spinal cord in the future.","['Weller, M', 'Stevens, A', 'Sommer, N', 'Schabet, M', 'Wietholter, H']","['Weller M', 'Stevens A', 'Sommer N', 'Schabet M', 'Wietholter H']","['Department of Neurology, University of Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Denmark,Acta Neurol Scand,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,0370336,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/physiology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Immunoglobulin M/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Interleukin-6/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Meninges/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Serum Albumin/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/cerebrospinal fluid', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/cerebrospinal fluid']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0404.1992.tb05053.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Neurol Scand. 1992 Aug;86(2):129-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0404.1992.tb05053.x.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research question has been previously addressed using sample populations of registered nurses, physicians, and medical students. This inquiry was conducted using a sample population of nurse anesthetists. The target population was 500 CRNAs who reside in areas of high AIDS incidence--New York City, San Francisco, and Houston. The participants were equally divided among the three cities using a randomized list provided by the AANA. The design for this study was an experimental 2 x 2 factorial with two independent variables: disease of the individual, either leukemia or AIDS, and the sexual preference of the individual, either heterosexual or homosexual. The randomly distributed questionnaire consisted of three scales: the interpersonal attraction inventory, the prejudicial evaluation scale, and the social interaction scale. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) were conducted not only on the main effects, disease and sexual preference, but also on the interaction effects of disease and sexual preference. The significant findings of the MANOVAs were subjected to factorial analysis for each scale, and then the MANOVAs were conducted again. The statistical analysis indicated that CRNAs possess a negative attitude toward AIDS patients but not toward leukemia patients. Their attitudes are based on their perception that AIDS patients are responsible for their illness. Potential behavioral consequences were also reported by CRNAs, based on these attitudes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kacir, K S']",['Kacir KS'],,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,AANA J,AANA journal,0431420,,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*nursing', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Homosexuality', 'Humans', 'New York City', 'Nurse Anesthetists/*psychology', 'San Francisco', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Texas']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,AANA J. 1992 Apr;60(2):169-73.,,['AANA J. 1992 Apr;60(2):107-8.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation as a result of a procoagulant factor release and primary hyperfibrinolysis due to plasminogen activators also released by leukemic cells have been implicated in the development of this syndrome. The aim of this work was to evaluate urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and related parameters of the fibrinolytic system in 14 ANLL patients. Our results showed an increased u-PA concentration in ANLL patients compared to controls [2.63 (1.61-4.62) vs. 0.95 (0.77-1.48) ng/ml, p < 0.01]. u-PA levels correlated positively with tissue-type plasminogen activator. The relevance of the enhancement of u-PA in this clinical setting was supported by the fact that it was the only analytical parameter positively correlated with patient mortality (p < 0.05). Though u-PA levels do not seem to be the determining factor in the development of the hemorrhagic syndrome of ANLL patients, a contributory role of this plasminogen activator is suggested from our results.","['Garcia Frade, L J', 'Sureda, A', 'Torrado, M C', 'Garcia Avello, A']","['Garcia Frade LJ', 'Sureda A', 'Torrado MC', 'Garcia Avello A']","['Departamento de Hematologia, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Universidad de Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents/blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/analysis', 'Hemorrhagic Disorders/blood/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/blood', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*blood', 'alpha-2-Antiplasmin/analysis']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000204586 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1992;88(1):7-10. doi: 10.1159/000204586.,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '0 (alpha-2-Antiplasmin)', '0 (fibrin fragment D)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient, a 79-year-old man, had a long standing history of CLL, that had been complicated by the development of a Guillain-Barre-like syndrome and a peripheral biclonal gammopathy. The biclonal immunoglobulins identified in the serum were IgM lambda and IgG lambda. The patient's condition progressed and he eventually developed ophthalmologic complications. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained during evaluation of his visual dysfunction contained numerous small, mature lymphocytes consistent with the presence of CLL cells in the central nervous system (CNS); immunoperoxidase staining of these cells revealed a monoclonal population. Protein electrophoretic evaluation of the patient's CSF showed a single monoclonal band and immunofixation electrophoresis of the CSF revealed that the immunoglobulin present was IgG lambda. No evidence for the monoclonal IgM paraprotein identified in serum could be appreciated in the CSF by immunofixation. Taken together, these findings strongly implied that there was CNS involvement by the leukemia and this process caused the patient's neurologic symptoms.

The effect of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) on leukemic blast progenitors was studied both in methylcellulose and in suspension cultures. PE1 and PE2 values varied among the patients. PE2 of 4 patients out of 7 patients became significantly higher in relapse than at diagnosis. The sensitivity to Ara-C of leukemic blast progenitors deteriorated in 5 patients in relapse.

This study compared age-standardized sex ratio values for mortality from 18 cancers (or groups of cancers), and total cancer mortality over the period 1950-1989 in 24 European countries, for 4 age groups (all ages, 20-44 years, 45-64 years, and 65 years and over). For lung cancer and other tobacco-related neoplasms, appreciable rises in sex ratio values were observed until the late 1970s, particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe, before levelling off in recent years, particularly among the younger age groups. In the late 1980s, the range of variation in overall age-standardized sex ratios for lung cancer was between 2 and 3 in the United Kingdom and in Nordic countries, and around or over 10 in Southern Europe. In young adults, the decline in sex ratio values observed in Denmark and Sweden (unity), and in other Nordic countries and in the United Kingdom (around or below 2) reflects a levelling of lung cancer in young males and an increase in young females. This clearly indicates that young women are a priority target group for smoking control interventions in Europe. Appreciable cohort effects were also observed for stomach cancer: rises in sex ratio values were greater in, or restricted to, middle- and older age groups, whereas in the young there was some tendency towards a levelling in sex differentials. The overall sex ratio values for stomach cancer were around 2 in most areas of Europe in the late 1980s. For intestinal cancer, sex ratio values showed some tendency to rise, reaching a level of 1.3-1.7 in the late 1980s; steady rises were also registered in sex ratio values for melanoma (skin cancer), reaching 1.5-1.8 in the late 1980s in most countries. These upward trends which were minor or inconsistent at younger ages in several countries became progressively stronger with advancing age. Sex ratio values were below unity for cancers of the gallbladder and the thyroid. Sex ratio values tended to rise also for leukaemia (from 1.2-1.5 to 1.5-1.7), but showed no noticeable trend for lymphomas or myeloma. The overall sex ratio values for total cancer mortality in the 1950s were between 1.2 and 1.4 in most European countries. Thereafter, they rose appreciably in several countries, reaching 1.9 in Czechoslovakia, Italy and Poland, and 2.3 in France.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Levi, F', 'La Vecchia, C', 'Lucchini, F', 'Negri, E']","['Levi F', 'La Vecchia C', 'Lucchini F', 'Negri E']","['Institut universitaire de medecine sociale et preventive, Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,World Health Stat Q,World health statistics quarterly.

Iodine yield was higher with O2 and Ar, as compared to CO2 and N2O; degassed solution revealed the lowest iodine yield. Exposure of L1210 mouse leukemia cells to shock waves reduced the number of viable cells with no difference between O2-, Ar-, or N2O-equilibrated and degassed conditions. CO2 equilibration resulted in a more pronounced reduction. The difference between chemical and biological effects argues against the involvement of free radicals in cell killing by shock waves. In additional experiments, gas bubbles of various sizes were introduced into the test vials. Addition of a 10 microL gas bubble revealed an over 10-fold increase in iodine yield from degassed potassium iodide solution with all gases. Addition of a gas bubble also reduced the number of viable cells again with no difference between the gases.

When RU38486 was added no later than 24 hours after the addition of dexamethasone, it prevented the inhibition of [14C]acetate incorporation into nonsaponifiable lipids, partly reversed the decrease in plating efficiency and reduced cell fragmentation. In addition, the accumulation of dolichols in the nuclei of dexamethasone-treated cells was abolished by RU38486.

The anti-plicamycin antibody was produced against a plicamycin-bovine serum albumin conjugate prepared by using diazotized p-aminobenzoic acid as a cross-linker. The radiolabeled ligand, 125I-plicamycin, was prepared by the chloramine-T method. The linear plicamycin concentration range was 7-400 ng/ml. The coefficients of variation for intra- and interday variabilities were 7.5 and 15%, respectively. No interference was observed from either the structurally related chromomycin A or concomitantly used drugs hydroxyurea or allopurinol. With this method of testing, plicamycin levels in plasma could be determined in patients receiving small (0.85-1.0 mg/m2) therapeutic plicamycin doses. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data in humans indicate that the plasma drug disappearance curve was biphasic with a mean elimination half-life of 10.6 +/- 1.7 h, total clearance rate of 11.1 +/- 0.4 ml/min/m2, and area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve of 1,289-1,546 ng-h/ml.

These antibodies identify mutually exclusive subpopulations of non-B lymphocytes in peripheral lymphoid organs and blood. However, in thymus the antibodies defined populations of double-positive, double-negative and single-positive cells that showed a progressive maturation consistent with that described for CD4 and CD8 in other mammalian species. Furthermore, functional studies clearly associated cytotoxic effector cell function with the subpopulation reactive with CA9.JD3 (CD8). In contrast, proliferation stimulated by allogeneic cells and mitogens was more pronounced in the subpopulation reactive with CA13.1E4 (CD4). Cell and tissue distribution studies revealed that CA13.1E4 stained neutrophils with equivalent intensity to the staining of peripheral T cells. CA13.1E4 precipitated a 60 kD protein from the surface of T cells and highly purified neutrophils under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. CA9.JD3 precipitated a heterodimer of 32 kd and 36 kD under reducing conditions, and a 70 kD protein under non-reducing conditions. The expression of CD4 by canine neutrophils is without precedent in other mammalian species; the functional significance of neutrophil CD4 expression is puzzling in light of the current understanding of the functions of CD4 which include it's role as a receptor for nonpolymorphic regions of MHC class II molecules.","['Moore, P F', 'Rossitto, P V', 'Danilenko, D M', 'Wielenga, J J', 'Raff, R F', 'Severns, E']","['Moore PF', 'Rossitto PV', 'Danilenko DM', 'Wielenga JJ', 'Raff RF', 'Severns E']","['Department of Pathology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis.']",['eng'],"['CA 23175-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/physiology', 'Antibody Specificity/*immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis/*immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis/*immunology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dogs', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*immunology/physiology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/pathology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1992.tb01963.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1992 Aug;40(2):75-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1992.tb01963.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lowest HC II and AT III levels was observed in coagulopathy secondary to liver disease, the HC II level in sepsis was the second lowest. In DIC due to APL, the decrease in HC II was not accompanied by a decrease in AT III. Thus, we divided all 124 samples tested into APL and non-APL groups. The HC II level correlated positively with fibrinogen and plasminogen in both the APL and non-APL groups. In the APL group, the HC II level had a significant negative correlation with the thrombin-AT III complex (TAT), fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer levels as well as the prothrombin time, while AT III showed no correlations with any of the haemostatic parameters. These results suggest that HC II may be consumed preferentially by thrombin in APL patients with DIC, and thus may spare the consumption of AT III. Accordingly, HC II seems to be a superior indicator of DIC than AT III in APL patients. Moreover, replacement therapy with HC II instead of AT III may be useful to treat DIC associated with APL. In the non-APL group, the HC II levels were positively correlated with the levels of AT III and pseudocholinesterase activity. This indicates that plasma HC II levels are closely related not only to consumption coagulopathy but also to hepatic synthetic activity, as is the case for plasma AT III.","['Kario, K', 'Matsuo, T', 'Kodama, K', 'Katayama, S', 'Kobayashi, H']","['Kario K', 'Matsuo T', 'Kodama K', 'Katayama S', 'Kobayashi H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo Prefectural Awaji Hospital, Sumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,IM,"['Adult', 'Antithrombin III/analysis', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Butyrylcholinesterase/blood', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*blood/etiology', 'Hemostasis', 'Heparin Cofactor II/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*complications', 'Liver Diseases/blood/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/complications', 'Sepsis/blood/complications', 'Thrombin/biosynthesis']",1992/05/15 00:00,1992/05/15 00:01,['1992/05/15 00:00'],"['1992/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0049-3848(92)90292-i [doi]'],ppublish,Thromb Res. 1992 May 15;66(4):435-44. doi: 10.1016/0049-3848(92)90292-i.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '81604-65-1 (Heparin Cofactor II)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', 'EC 3.1.1.8 (Butyrylcholinesterase)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although etoposide has acquired a place in many first-line protocols for lymphomas and, more recently, for leukemias, the role of teniposide has remained limited. Teniposide is a more potent inhibitor of topoisomerase II than etoposide, and has a less toxic effect on hematopoietic progenitor cells. Both drugs have been regarded as equitoxic and cross-resistant. The role of teniposide in front-line treatment of leukemias has only been established in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Some promising results have been obtained in small numbers of patients with refractory adult ALL and acute monoblastic leukemia. However, the remission rates and remission duration were not significantly different from those of other combination regimens. Data on teniposide in untreated acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia are very scarce. In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the antineoplastic activity of teniposide has been demonstrated in studies by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and in two large studies conducted by the Australian and New Zealand Lymphoma Co-operative Chemotherapy Study Group. In these studies, teniposide had comparable but not significantly better activity than vincristine. The dose-dependent antineoplastic activity of teniposide has led to its use in several conditioning regimens in bone marrow transplantation for leukemias and lymphomas. The limited clinical data currently available on teniposide seem to warrant further clinical trials with this agent in leukemias and lymphomas.","['Sonneveld, P']",['Sonneveld P'],"['University Hospital Rotterdam Dijkzigt, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(92)90313-P [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1992 Apr;19(2 Suppl 6):59-64.,['957E6438QA (Teniposide)'],,,52,,,,,,,,,,,

Beginning with its paired use with cytarabine for patients relapsing on conventional therapy, teniposide has shown consistent ability to reduce leukemic cell populations not responsive to other agents. Encouraging results in the treatment of refractory ALL led to the decision to incorporate teniposide into combination chemotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed leukemia. This strategy has yielded higher cure rates for subsets of patients at high risk of treatment failure, including those with initial leukocyte counts of more than 100 x 10(9)/L, and may extend remission lengths for all patients, regardless of risk status. In view of the prolonged marrow aplasia seen with use of teniposide and cytarabine as inducing agents, the optimal role of this combination may be that of ""remission reinforcement"" therapy. Because of its novel mechanism of action, teniposide affords opportunities to develop new drug combinations that may increase the proportion of long-term ALL survivors still further.","['Rivera, G K', 'Evans, W E']","['Rivera GK', 'Evans WE']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",['eng'],['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(92)90312-O [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1992 Apr;19(2 Suppl 6):51-8.,['957E6438QA (Teniposide)'],,,34,,,,,,,,,,,

Following the initial clinical introduction of teniposide in the 1970s, investigations focused almost exclusively on its analogue, etoposide, because of its formulation, which was felt to have advantages in addition to oral administration. Despite consistently inadequate dosing and scheduling, early phase I and II trial results with teniposide were promising, and current trends encourage a second look. The substantial antitumor activity of teniposide is comparable with that of etoposide, and clinical interest was rekindled when it was shown to have considerable activity against small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In view of the inadequacy of early trials and the premature cessation of clinical study, it is recommended that teniposide be reevaluated for its activity against malignant lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease, leukemias, and SCLC, against all of which its early results were encouraging. In addition, consideration should be given to its activity against brain tumors, neuroblastomas and other childhood solid tumors, and ovarian cancer; its potential value against gastric, hepatocellular, breast, and bladder cancers also should be investigated. Other areas that warrant further study include elucidation of the exact mechanism of action of teniposide, its role in both single- and multiple-agent chemotherapeutic regimens, and resolution of its optimal dose and schedule. Finally, it is suggested that with new routes of administration and improved formulations, teniposide may be expected to play a significant role in the treatment of malignant lymphomas, SCLC, and pediatric lymphocytic leukemia and neuroblastoma.","['Muggia, F M', 'Kelley, S L']","['Muggia FM', 'Kelley SL']","['Kenneth Norris Jr Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Teniposide/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1992 Apr;19(2 Suppl 6):43-50.,['957E6438QA (Teniposide)'],,,56,,,,,,,,,,,

The incorporation of [6-3H]-thymidine was assayed simultaneously. The intracellular BFP was measured by dual flow cytometry for DNA and BFP. A lymph node was studied immunohistochemically. Serum BFP was measured in four cases of lymphocytic leukaemia. In two cases, dual staining was performed. The intracellular BFP of the mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes was increased within 24 h. The extracellular BFP was increased exponentially from 72 h. The extracellular BFP at 96 h did not correlate with the [3H]-thymidine incorporation. The intracellular BFP increase began in G1 phase. Immunostaining showed that the B cells also produced BFP. The serum BFP level in leukaemia was high in 1 of 4 cases and the leukaemic cells in two cases showed high intracellular BFP content. These observations indicate that BFP is produced in activated human lymphocytes and in lymphocytic leukaemic cells.

Corn oil did not appear to affect tumor rates in female rats. The gavage technique per se did not appear to influence tumor rates in rats of either sex. Previously reported time-related increases in certain site-specific neoplasia in control rats appeared to have stabilized in recent years, but control tumor rates are still much greater than those seen a decade ago. More recent studies continue to show increasing rates of leukemia and mammary gland tumors and decreasing survival. Female rats also continue to show time-related increases in maximum mean body weight. Inter-laboratory variability in body weight and in the rates of a number of site-specific neoplasms were also significant. High mean body weights in control groups were found to be associated with increased rates of mammary and pituitary tumors. Our evaluation supports the view that if historical control data are to be utilized in the interpretation of experimental results, primary emphasis should be given to lab and route of administration-specific tumor rates for studies that are contemporary to the study under evaluation.

Black men have the greatest risk for both lung cancer and cancer of the prostate. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and solid tumors of the brain and nervous system are the most frequent forms of malignancy occurring among children less than or equal to 14 years. Office screening is the traditional method for identifying cancer victims as early as possible. A suitable screening test should be rapid, simple, inexpensive, and impose minimal discomfort. There must be a window of opportunity available to identify the cancer during a detectable preclinical phase, and therapeutic modalities must be available to alter progression. An office screening test for cancer may have any one of four outcomes, and three of them are bad. False negatives are the worst adverse outcome because cancer remains undetected despite screening. An epidemic of lung cancer, caused by cigarette smoking, is occurring in all race and sex groups. If Americans stopped smoking, 87% of lung cancer deaths could be prevented. Tobacco abuse also is a major risk factor for cancer of the esophagus, larynx, and oral cavity. Cigarette smoking is a contributing factor for cancer of the bladder, kidney, and pancreas, and it has been associated with both cervical cancer and cancer of the stomach. Smoking and smokeless tobacco cessation endorsements, messages, and programs must be part of routine disease prevention and health promotion activities in every primary care practice. More than 1 million Americans became new cancer victims last year, and more than 1 million additional cases will be detected this year. Because of the striking variability in state and regional patterns of various forms of cancer, geographic location of a practice may influence the frequency of cancers seen. Four sites (breast, prostate, lung, colon, and rectum) were responsible for 55% of cancer mortality and 56% of all new cases of cancer detected during 1991.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Cresanta, J L']",['Cresanta JL'],"['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Prim Care,Primary care,0430463,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Melanoma/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Primary Health Care', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sex Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'United States/epidemiology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prim Care. 1992 Sep;19(3):419-41.,,,,43,,,,,,,,,,,

Because lipoxins are also products of the same lipoxygenase enzyme, we tested their actions on signal transduction events related to DNA synthesis. Lipoxins A4 and B4 (10 nM) significantly enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation into Friend cells in the absence of fetal bovine serum without affecting cell differentiation or cell number. Lipoxin B4 increased the duration of time that cells spent in the S phase of the cell cycle, and also significantly enhanced protein kinase C activity in nuclei, whereas c-fos expression was unaffected by either of the lipoxins tested.

These phosphoproteins include phospholipase C gamma 1, the beta and gamma subunits of the Fc epsilon RI, the Src family protein-tyrosine kinase Lyn, and a 72-kDa protein that coimmunoprecipitates from lysates of antigen-stimulated cells with antibody to the receptor beta subunit. We now present evidence that the 72-kDa Fc epsilon RI-associated protein is the protein-tyrosine kinase PTK72 that forms part of the antigen receptor complex in B lymphocytes. The identification is based on immunoreactivity with anti-PTK72 antiserum, chromatographic profiles on the affinity resin heparin/agarose, and one-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping studies. Enzymatic activity of the kinase is increased in anti-PTK72 immune complexes prepared from lysates of antigen-activated RBL-2H3 cells. The 72-kDa protein-tyrosine kinase is the principal substrate for in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of RBL-2H3 cells. The discovery that RBL-2H3 mast cells share a receptor-activated protein-tyrosine kinase, PTK72, with B lymphocytes provides additional support for the existence of common signaling pathways initiated by multichain immune recognition receptors.","['Hutchcroft, J E', 'Geahlen, R L', 'Deanin, G G', 'Oliver, J M']","['Hutchcroft JE', 'Geahlen RL', 'Deanin GG', 'Oliver JM']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907.']",['eng'],"['CA09634/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37372/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.19.9107 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Oct 1;89(19):9107-11. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.19.9107.,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,PMC50074,,,,,,,,,,

The murine leukaemic, cyclophosphamide-resistant L1210/CPA cells, having high levels of intracellular ADH activity, were less sensitive to SDA compared to ADH deficient L1210/O cells as measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation in proliferation studies. Furthermore, pretreatment of L1210/CPA cells with the ADH inhibitor, diethyl aminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), resulted in potentiation of the SDA response. Murine bone marrow cells were more resistant to SDA than splenic T cells. However, addition of DEAB to bone marrow cultures potentiated the sensitivity of progenitor cells to SDA, as measured by colony formation. The results indicate that levels of ADH in the target tissues would determine the potency of SDA and subsequently offer selectivity and specificity to the therapeutic potentials of this putative purging agent.","['Kazmi, S M', 'Li, D', 'Koop, K', 'Conant, J', 'Lau, C Y']","['Kazmi SM', 'Li D', 'Koop K', 'Conant J', 'Lau CY']","['Biological Research Department, R.

The T-MLs were categorized according to the updated Kiel classification, and the T-cell pleomorphic type (Pleo) was subcategorized into 3 subtypes: Pleo-ATLL, Pleo-clear and Pleo-others. The population of S100+ cells and the first to fifth minimal distances of every S100+ cell were measured on micrographs of paraffin sections that had reacted to anti-S100 protein antibody according to the ABC method. Lymphoblastic and chronic lymphocytic leukemia types showed low populations of S100+ cells and long values of the first minimal distance. T-zone lymphoma without follicles and angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia-type T-ML had high populations and low values of the first minimal distance. Among the three subtypes of Pleo in the lymph node, Pleo-ATLL gave the highest population and the shortest value of the first minimal distance of S100+ cells, but this trend was not found in the skin. Clusters of more than five S100+ cells were more common in the Pleo-ATLL subtype than in the other two subtypes.

The t(9;22) abnormality corresponded to a rearrangement within the breakpoint cluster region gene, while antigen receptor gene studies showed multiple rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) concomitant with a single rearrangement of the T cell receptor beta chain gene (TCR beta). We speculate that this case represents the neoplastic transformation of a stem cell, the Ph abnormality being involved in the early steps of transformation. It is conceivable that the IGH but not the TCR beta gene was accessible to recombination within the malignant clone, thus generating the multiple rearrangements observed.

For this, a retrovirus combining v-ski with a temperature-sensitive version of the v-sea oncogene was constructed. In transformed erythroblasts, v-ski disturbed the concerted expression of several erythrocyte genes, leading to an abnormal erythroblast phenotype. Expression levels of hemoglobin and erythrocyte anion transporter (band 3) were elevated, while expression of the erythroid-specific histone H5 was strongly suppressed. v-ski could also be shown to repress or severely retard the temperature-induced erythroid differentiation of v-ski/ts-v-sea-transformed cells. The undifferentiated cells had an abnormal erythroblast or early reticulocyte phenotype characterized by unusually low levels of histone H5. In chicks, the v-ski/ts-v-sea virus displayed enhanced leukemogenicity compared with viruses containing just the single oncogenes. Thus, v-ski cooperates with tyrosine kinase oncogenes in a similar fashion to the v-erbA oncogene, however the pattern of genes affected by these two oncogenes is different.","['Larsen, J', 'Beug, H', 'Hayman, M J']","['Larsen J', 'Beug H', 'Hayman MJ']","['Department of Microbiology, State University of New York, Stony Brook 11794.']",['eng'],"['CA28146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42573/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chick Embryo', 'Erythroblasts/*pathology', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics/toxicity', '*Oncogenes', 'Phenotype', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', '*Transcription Factors']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1992 Oct;7(10):1903-11.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (env-sea oncogene protein, Avian Erythroblastosis Retrovirus)', '0 (v-ski protein, Avian retrovirus)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,"['v-sea', 'v-ski']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This type of drug differs from traditional tumoricidal agents by promoting differentiation of the malignant, immature cells. METHODS: The authors describe a patient with optic nerve infiltration by acute promyelocytic leukemia documented ophthalmoscopically and confirmed by standardized echography and magnetic resonance imaging. High-resolution chromosome banding revealed the patient had a 15;17 chromosomal translocation known to be associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Treatment was instituted with oral all trans-retinoic acid without adjuvant radiotherapy or intrathecal chemotherapy. RESULTS: Results of serial bone marrow examination showed progressive differentiation of malignant cells with complete bone marrow remission. Results of serial ophthalmic examinations showed complete resolution of the leukemic optic nerve head infiltration. CONCLUSION: All trans-retinoic acid alone can be an effective treatment for optic nerve head infiltration in acute promyelocytic leukemia. This case suggests that radiation therapy may not be necessary in acute promyelocytic leukemia with optic nerve infiltration.","['Brown, D M', 'Kimura, A E', 'Ossoinig, K C', 'Weiner, G J']","['Brown DM', 'Kimura AE', 'Ossoinig KC', 'Weiner GJ']","['University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Department of Ophthalmology, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Fundus Oculi', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Optic Disk/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-6420(92)31783-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-6420(92)31783-x [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 1992 Sep;99(9):1463-7. doi: 10.1016/s0161-6420(92)31783-x.,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interest in this enzyme is based on the view that it may play a role in the regulation of peptide signals in different tissues, including the nervous and immune systems. We have previously shown that endopeptidase-24.11 is present in Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system of newborn pigs [Kioussi C. and Matsas R. (1991) J. Neurochem. 57, 431-440]. In the present study we have investigated the developmental expression of the endopeptidase by Schwann cells in the rat sciatic nerve, from embryonic day 16 to maturity. Endopeptidase-24.11 was monitored enzymatically as well as by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry using the monoclonal anti-endopeptidase antibody 23B11. We found an age-dependent decline in both the enzyme activity and the levels of immunoreactive protein. Endopeptidase-24.11 was first detected at embryonic day 18 and was present in all neonatal and early postnatal Schwann cells. However, as myelination proceeded the endopeptidase was gradually suppressed in the majority of cells that form myelin but retained in non-myelin-forming cells in the adult animal. At this stage, only very few large diameter myelinated fibers expressed weakly endopeptidase-24.11. Schwann cells dissociated from postnatal day 5 nerves and cultured up to one week in the absence of axons expressed endopeptidase-24.11. These results show that the endopeptidase has a distinct developmental profile in the rat sciatic nerve, similar to that of a group of other Schwann cell surface antigens, including the cell adhesion molecules N-CAM and L1 and the nerve growth factor receptor. We suggest that, as is the case with these antigens, endopeptidase-24.11 may play a role in nerve development and/or regeneration. In addition, persistence of endopeptidase-24.11 in a minority of adult myelin-forming Schwann cells suggests a possible role for the enzyme in axon-myelin apposition and maintenance, especially of larger diameter axons.","['Kioussi, C', 'Crine, P', 'Matsas, R']","['Kioussi C', 'Crine P', 'Matsas R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,IM,"['Aging/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Kidney/enzymology/growth & development', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal/enzymology', 'Myelin Sheath/*physiology', 'Neprilysin/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Schwann Cells/enzymology/*physiology', 'Sciatic Nerve/*enzymology/growth & development']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0306-4522(92)90382-C [pii]', '10.1016/0306-4522(92)90382-c [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 1992 Sep;50(1):69-83. doi: 10.1016/0306-4522(92)90382-c.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon is known as genomic imprinting and is manifested at either the chromosomal or gene level. Genomic imprinting seems to play an important role in cancer predisposition syndromes, and phenotypic consequences are evident in constitutional deletion syndromes and uniparental disomies. Moreover, there seems to be a preferential retention of paternal alleles in sporadic tumours such as Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma and retinoblastoma. To investigate whether chromosomes involved in acquired abnormalities of haematologic neoplasms show a similar 'parent of origin' bias, we studied the inheritance of the translocated chromosomes 9 and 22 in cases of Philadelphia-chromosome-positive leukaemia, using unique specific chromosome band polymorphisms. Here we show that the translocated chromosome 9 was of paternal origin, whereas the translocated chromosomes 22 were derived exclusively from the maternal copy, in 11 cases with reliable polymorphisms. Our data therefore provide evidence that imprinting phenomena may play an important role in acquired tumour-specific chromosome rearrangements.","['Haas, O A', 'Argyriou-Tirita, A', 'Lion, T']","['Haas OA', 'Argyriou-Tirita A', 'Lion T']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/359414a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1992 Oct 1;359(6394):414-6. doi: 10.1038/359414a0.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional interactions of these cis and trans factors with sequences located in the far 5' end of the cluster occur by as yet obscure mechanisms. Because of the complexity of this regulatory puzzle, precise identification of the determinants that control hemoglobin switching has proven difficult. Phylogenetic footprinting is an evolutionary approach to this problem which is based on the supposition that the basic mechanisms of switching are conserved throughout mammalian phylogeny. Alignment of the 5' flanking regions of the gamma genes of several species allows the identification of footprints of 100% conserved sequence. We have now tested oligomers spanning 13 such phylogenetic footprints and find that 12 are bound by nuclear proteins. One conserved element located at -1086 from the gamma genes exhibits repressor activity in transient transfection studies. The protein that binds this element, CSBP-1 (conserved sequence-binding protein 1), also binds at three sites within a silencer element upstream from the epsilon globin gene. Further analysis reveals that the CSBP-1 binding activity is identical to that of a recently cloned zinc finger protein that has been shown to act as a repressor in other systems. The binding of CSPB-1 to silencer sequences in the epsilon and gamma globin genes may be important in the stage-specific silencing of these genes.","['Gumucio, D L', 'Heilstedt-Williamson, H', 'Gray, T A', 'Tarle, S A', 'Shelton, D A', 'Tagle, D A', 'Slightom, J L', 'Goodman, M', 'Collins, F S']","['Gumucio DL', 'Heilstedt-Williamson H', 'Gray TA', 'Tarle SA', 'Shelton DA', 'Tagle DA', 'Slightom JL', 'Goodman M', 'Collins FS']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0616.']",['eng'],['HL-33940/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.12.11.4919-4929.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Nov;12(11):4919-29. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.11.4919-4929.1992.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,PMC360424,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we describe the identification of another integration site, designated Fli-2 (Friend leukemia virus integration-2), in an erythroleukemia cell line induced by Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV). Rearrangements at the Fli-2 locus were found in two erythroleukemia cell lines independently induced by F-MuLV and one leukemic cell line derived from the spleen of a mouse infected with the polycythemia strain of Friend leukemia virus. The deduced amino acid sequence of a cDNA corresponding to a transcript originating from genomic DNA adjacent to Fli-2 is identical to that of the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 gene, a member of the gene family of RNA-binding proteins involved in RNA splicing. In one erythroleukemia cell line, A1 expression was undetectable as a result of F-MuLV integration in one allele and loss of the other allele.

These viral gene products modulate both the quantity and the quality of viral gene expression through regulation at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The most intensely studied retroviral regulatory proteins, termed Tat and Rev, are encoded by the prototypic complex retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1. However, considerable information also exists on regulatory proteins encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus type I, as well as several other human and animal complex retroviruses. In general, these data demonstrate that retrovirally encoded transcriptional trans-activators can exert a similar effect by several very different mechanisms. In contrast, posttranscriptional regulation of retroviral gene expression appears to occur via a single pathway that is probably dependent on the recruitment of a highly conserved cellular cofactor.

Patients with stable early stage disease do not need treatment, whereas those with progressive early stage disease or advanced stage disease do. The standard initial therapeutic regimen is orally administered chlorambucil and prednisone. The overall response rate to initial chemotherapy is approximately 80%; the median duration of response is 2 years. Conventional chemotherapy, however, does not provide long-term remission for patients in whom the disease becomes refractory to chlorambucil. For such patients, alternative treatment approaches including the use of purine nucleoside analogues or bone marrow transplantation may be considered. Fludarabine, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and pentostatin are three analogues of the naturally occurring deoxypurine nucleoside, deoxyadenosine, and all have shown activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Overall response rates of 57 to 79% have been reported with use of fludarabine. A dose-related toxic effect is myelosuppression. Experience with bone marrow transplantation is limited.

In another study, we have found that TPA (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate) treatment of E26-transformants displaying an 'early erythroid' phenotype results in the production of cells with either myeloid or eosinophil characteristics. To analyze this induction in greater detail we have produced a panel of four monoclonal antibodies against E26-transformants before and after TPA-induced differentiation. Two antibodies, MEP21 and MEP26, reacted with proteins of 150 and 47-60 kDa, respectively, which are expressed on the surface of E26 progenitor cells but whose expression is extinguished following TPA-induced differentiation. A third antibody, EOS47, recognizes a 100 kDa molecule that is expressed on the surface of TPA-induced peroxidase positive cells (an enzyme that in avian species is restricted to cells of the eosinophilic lineage). MEP21, MEP26, and EOS47 do not react with lymphoid, myeloid, or more mature erythroid lineage cell lines. The fourth antibody, MEP17, recognizes a heterodimer of 140 and 150 kDa chains which is expressed at high levels by E26-transformed progenitor cells and at lower levels by TPA-induced cells. Further biochemical characterization of the MEP17 antigen revealed a structure similar to that of the leukocyte adhesion molecule VLA-4; a member of the integrin family of adhesion proteins. All four antibodies react with subpopulations of cells in the bone marrow and spleens of 1-day-old chickens. Although the MEP21 and MEP26 antibodies do not appear to react with mature cells of most hematopoietic lineages they are expressed at high levels by mature thrombocytes. In addition, MEP17 is expressed at high levels by the majority of bursal B-cells, thrombocytes, and more weakly by thymocytes. The reagents described should be useful as markers for the study of development, migration, and differentiation of normal avian hematopoietic progenitor cells and eosinophilic precursors, and for the study of retrovirus-induced neoplasia.","['McNagny, K M', 'Lim, F', 'Grieser, S', 'Graf, T']","['McNagny KM', 'Lim F', 'Grieser S', 'Graf T']","['Differentiation Programme, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/chemistry/*immunology', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'Eosinophils/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Precipitin Tests']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Oct;6(10):975-84.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sensitisation was generally greater in the more chemo-resistant specimens. The ratio of sensitivities of cells to Adriamycin compared with aclacinomycin A was greatest in the more Adriamycin-resistant specimens which supports the idea that cross-resistance between these agents may not be great.

The etiology is unknown. In previous studies, we showed that impaired hepatic endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) clearance in patients with acute viral hepatitis A, B, or C versus controls results in endotoxemia and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) release. TNF-alpha mediates anti-proliferative and differentiating effects in AML cell lines. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) released in acute viral hepatitis, acts in synergy with TNF-alpha. HL60, KG1, and U937 AML cells treated 3, 6, and 9 days with physiologically attainable TNF-alpha (10 U/ml), IFN-gamma (100 U/ml) and LPS (10 ng/ml) levels, have significantly diminished viability and cell growth versus controls. Treatment of HL60 AML cells with LPS/TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma also resulted in significantly increased monocytic pathway differentiation not seen with KG1 or U937 AML cells. HL60 AML cells treated with TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma for 6 days released endogenous TNF-alpha (1.57 U/10(6) cells) upon LPS stimulation compared to less than 0.01 U/10(6) cells in non-LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma-treated cells or untreated cells (p less than 0.0001). Untreated HL60 AML cells co-cultured with HL60 cells pretreated for 6 days with TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma and then subjected to LPS stimulation had significantly diminished cell growth compared to controls (p less than 0.0001). This effect could be reversed with anti-TNF-alpha antibody, supporting the concept that endogenous TNF-alpha release by LPS/TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma treated HL60 AML cells may act by paracrine means to suppress growth of other AML cells. The beneficial effects of post-transfusional hepatitis in AML patients may be mediated via LPS/TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma-induced AML cell growth suppression and/or terminal differentiation in which AML cells participate by releasing TNF-alpha after being acted upon by LPS/TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma. Endogenously released TNF-alpha might then act by autocrine/paracrine means to mediate further suppression and terminal differentiation.","['Treon, S P', 'Broitman, S A']","['Treon SP', 'Broitman SA']","['Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, MA 02118.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Hepatitis/*complications/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*pathology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*administration & dosage/metabolism']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Oct;6(10):1036-42.,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cells from six out of 17 T-ALL/T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with a prothymocyte (stage I) or a mature thymocyte (stage III), but not with a common thymocyte (stage II) phenotype, could proliferate, in a dose-dependent manner, in response to recombinant IL2 (rIL2) and anti-Tac and TU27 moAbs as well as polyclonal anti-IL2 purified immunoglobulin G could inhibit this IL2-induced cell proliferation. Both crude or/and Amicon-concentrated media conditioned by T-ALL cells from 10 out of 13 tested patients contained IL2 activity as assessed by colorimetric biological and immunoenzymatic assays; this biologic activity was due to a 14.5 kDa molecule adsorbed by anti-IL2 antibodies in an immunoaffinity assay. Although less than 10% of fresh leukemic cells expressed IL2R alpha (Tac) chain, a 24 h cell incubation in the absence of any mitogenic stimulation induced IL2R alpha chain expression in five out of 13 patients (11-83% Tac+ cells). Morever, Tac mRNA transcripts could be detected in fresh cells from all 10 patients tested. Staining of fresh leukemic cells with an IL-2R beta-chain-specific monoclonal antibody and flow cytometry analysis revealed that 4-13% of leukemic cells were positive. Binding experiments with 125I-rIL2 showed a small number of high affinity IL2R on fresh cells from three T-ALL patients (114-200 sites/cell, dissociation constant = 101-181 pm). Finally, antibodies against IL2R alpha, IL2R beta and IL2 could inhibit both IL2 driven and spontaneous cell proliferation of most patients' T-ALL cells, although in some cases an heterogenous pattern of inhibition was observed. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that an IL2/IL2R-dependent mechanism could be involved in the proliferation of some T-ALL cells.","['Sahraoui, Y', 'Allouche, M', 'Ammar, A', 'Spanakis, E', 'Clemenceau, C', 'Jasmin, C', 'Perraki, M', 'Varela-Millot, C', 'Georgoulias, V']","['Sahraoui Y', 'Allouche M', 'Ammar A', 'Spanakis E', 'Clemenceau C', 'Jasmin C', 'Perraki M', 'Varela-Millot C', 'Georgoulias V']","['Oncogenese Appliquee, INSERM U268, Hopital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Oct;6(10):1025-35.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-1 stimulated tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) uptake of AML cells in 8/12 cases, whereas IL-4 enhanced 3H-TdR uptake in 5/12. Combination of both factors resulted in an additive effect in 6/12 cases which could be abrogated by the addition of anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). To study whether IL-1, IL-4, or IL-1 plus IL-4 affects the AML progenitor cell directly or indirectly by the release of endogenous factors, supernatants of stimulated AML cells (n = 6) were analyzed for GM-CSF, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) production. IL-1 induced the endogenous secretion of GM-CSF, IL-6, and TNF in most cases. In contrast, no secretion of growth factors was induced by IL-4, whereas in 2 cases IL-4 suppressed the IL-1-induced secretion of GM-CSF, TNF, and IL-6. This was associated with a decline in the proliferative response to IL-1 measured in a clonogenic assay. In addition it was shown that exogenous supplied GM-CSF and TNF could raise the suppressive effects of IL-4 on the IL-1-supported proliferation. In summary these data indicate that the IL-4-supported proliferation is not caused by the endogenous secretion of GM-CSF, IL-6, and TNF. Furthermore the suppressive effect of IL-4 on the IL-1-induced proliferation in some cases may be caused by a reduced secretion of GM-CSF, TNF, and IL-6.","['Wagteveld, A J', 'Esselink, M T', 'Limburg, P', 'Halie, M R', 'Vellenga, E']","['Wagteveld AJ', 'Esselink MT', 'Limburg P', 'Halie MR', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Hematology, State University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/pharmacology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Oct;6(10):1020-4.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before cell culture cord blood contained progenitor cells (CD34+) in various differentiation stages (CD38(-)----CD38bright), mature lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils, but no immature neutrophils and immature monocytes. During cell culture, all CD34+ cells acquired the CD38 antigen between day 2 and 5 of cell culture, the CD34 antigen was lost between day 5 and 11 of cell culture. Differentiation of cells into the myeloid cell lineage was characterized by the acquisition of both CD33 and CD71. The latter is indicative for the active proliferation of these cells. Maturation of the cells into the neutrophilic pathway was indicated by the acquisition of first the CD15 antigen followed by CD11b and CD16 respectively. Whereas maturation of the cells into the monocytic pathway was indicated by the acquisition of first CD11b followed by CD14 and a dim expression of both CD15 and CD16. In normal bone marrow, cells of various maturational stages are already present before cell culture. During cell culture differentiation of cells into the myeloid lineage and maturation of the cells along the monocyte and neutrophilic lineage followed identical pathways as was observed before cell culture. Differentiation and maturational pathways of cord blood and adult bone marrow were identical. The results confirm the surface-antigen-defined pathways of myeloid cell differentiation described previously for non-cultured normal bone marrow aspirates.

Neither Coln nor VCR induced the differentiation of HL-60 cells, but in combination with RA increased the percentage of nitroblue tetrazolium-positive cells, the expression of the mature myelocyte surface marker Mo 1, and the content of MT over the effects produced by RA alone. In contrast, pretreatment with Coln or VCR delayed the commitment to a differentiation pathway induced by DMSO. The supra-additivity exhibited between Coln and RA required the administration of Coln prior to RA; thus, Coln had no effect when given two days after the cellular exposure to RA.

However, when bone marrow cells of the same grafted mice are cultured under similar conditions, hardly any IL-3 activity is detectable. To elucidate the mechanism of this difference, we examined whether the bone marrow cells either suppress IL-3 production by STIL-3 C5 cells or produce an IL-3 inhibitor. When STIL-3 C5 cells were cultured in the presence of normal bone marrow cells, the culture supernatant showed a significantly reduced IL-3 activity as assessed by growth stimulatory effects on IL-3-dependent DA-1 cells and mast cells. The conditioned medium (CM) did not inhibit the growth of IL-3-independent cell lines. Heat treatment of the CM resulted in a recovery of the IL-3 activity, indicating that the effect was mediated by a heat-labile inhibitor rather than by suppression of IL-3 production. CM of bone marrow cells alone did not inhibit the IL-3 activity. The inhibitor was produced by a stem cell-enriched fraction of the bone marrow, and not by fractions of T cells, granulocytes, or adherent cells including macrophages. Stimulation of the stem cell-enriched fraction of bone marrow with STIL-3 C5-CM also induced the production of the IL-3 inhibitor, which was recovered in a MW 50-100 kD fraction after ultrafiltration.

The number of splenic Lyt2+ (CD8+ equivalent) cells was constant irrespective of the leukemic status of the animals. However, the number of L3T4+ cells (CD4+ equivalent) in leukemic mice was three-fold lower than that of normal mice with regressed mice demonstrating a 30% increase in the number of L3T4+ cells compared to normals.

Cytoplasmic 5'NT (cyto-5'NT) and non-specific (e.g. acid- and alkaline) phosphatases (AP) regulate the intracellular degradation of nucleotides. High NT and AP activities might cause a resistance to the thiopurines 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG). We studied the relation between these enzymes and immunophenotype, drug resistance and prognosis in 77 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Enzyme activities were assessed radiochemically; in vitro drug resistance was measured with the MTT assay. AP activities were higher in T-ALL and B-ALL than in precursor B-ALL. Cyto-5'NT activity was very low in all phenotypes and accounted for a significant proportion of total IMPase activity only in the very immature CD10- c mu- precursor B-ALL. CD10+ ALL cases with high ecto-5'NT activities showed a trend (p = 0.065) for a lower probability of continuous complete remission than those with a low activity. Ecto-5'NT activity was not related to in vitro drug resistance to 6-TG. A weak correlation was found between in vitro 6-TG resistance and cyto-5'NT and AP activities. We conclude that high ecto-5'NT activities do not cause a resistance to 6-thiopurines in childhood ALL. Some patients have high cyto-5'NT and AP activities associated with 6-thiopurine resistance.","['Pieters, R', 'Huismans, D R', 'Loonen, A H', 'Peters, G J', 'Hahlen, K', 'van der Does-van den Berg, A', 'van Wering, E R', 'Veerman, A J']","['Pieters R', 'Huismans DR', 'Loonen AH', 'Peters GJ', 'Hahlen K', 'van der Does-van den Berg A', 'van Wering ER', 'Veerman AJ']","['Free University Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*analysis"", 'Acid Phosphatase/*analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(92)90033-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992 Sep;16(9):873-80. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90033-4.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'POMP protocol', 'PVDA protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Rats from five different strains and mice from 3 strains were inoculated intracerebrally or intraperitoneally from birth to 10 days of age and observed for signs of neurologic disease and tumors for 24 weeks. Nervous system pathology, MuLV gp70 expression, and virus production were evaluated weekly for 4 weeks after perinatal infection of Fisher (F344) rats. Blood-brain-barrier integrity and ultrastructure were evaluated in 21-day-old symptomatic infected rats. Microvessel and mixed glial cell cultures were prepared from brains of infected and uninfected 21-day-old F344 rats and evaluated for virus production, MuLV gp70 expression, and the presence of PVC-211 MuLV DNA. RESULTS: Tremor, ataxia, spasticity, and hindlimb weakness occurred in rats and mice as early as 3 weeks after neonatal infection. Severity, latency, and progression varied among mouse and rat strains but exposure to PVC-211 MuLV before 6 days of age was required for disease expression. Rapid PVC-211 MuLV replication in brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC) early in the perinatal period was followed by widespread astrogliosis, neuropil vacuolation, and finally, neuronal degeneration in the spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, and subcortex. MuLV gp70 expression in vivo increased during infection, was restricted to BCEC, but was not associated with perivascular inflammatory infiltrates. BCEC cultured from microvessel preparations but not astrocytes or microglia in mixed glial cell cultures isolated from infected rats contained PVC-211 MuLV DNA, expressed MuLV gp70, and produced infectious virus. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid replication of PVC-211 MuLV that occurs in the nervous system of infected rodents is restricted to BCEC. These infected BCEC appear to play a critical role in initiating the astroglial response in this neurodegenerative process through mechanisms that remain to be defined.","['Hoffman, P M', 'Cimino, E F', 'Robbins, D S', 'Broadwell, R D', 'Powers, J M', 'Ruscetti, S K']","['Hoffman PM', 'Cimino EF', 'Robbins DS', 'Broadwell RD', 'Powers JM', 'Ruscetti SK']","['Retrovirus Research Center, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],['AII-25336/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Genetic Variation/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Nervous System/*microbiology/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Neuroglia/microbiology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Rats, Inbred WF', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Virus Replication']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1992 Sep;67(3):314-21.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One course of modified-DCMP regimen induced complete remission in September, but she developed spiking fever at a nadir period of WBC after induction chemotherapy. CT revealed multiple hepato-splenic abscesses presumably due to candida infection. She was treated with intravenous administration of amphotericin B (AMPH-B) and other antifungal agents. Despite the hematological remission and prolonged use of these antifungal agents, high fever persisted. A catheter was inserted into the portal vein under ultrasonic-guidance. AMPH-B was administered through the catheter: the initial dose was 3 mg/day and was soon increased to 20 mg/day. Her fever subsided in 1 week, and the sizes of liver abscesses on CT reduced markedly. Chill and hypokalemia were observed during this therapy. The catheter was removed from the portal vein after 29 days. Partial portal vein thrombosis was noted around the catheter tip. This case suggests the usefulness of intraportal administration of AMPH-B in patients with hematological malignancy developing multiple liver abscesses.","['Miyazaki, H', 'Ino, T', 'Sobue, R', 'Tuzuki, M', 'Maeda, H', 'Nomura, T', 'Wakita, M', 'Hirano, M']","['Miyazaki H', 'Ino T', 'Sobue R', 'Tuzuki M', 'Maeda H', 'Nomura T', 'Wakita M', 'Hirano M']","['Department of medicine, Fujita Health University.']",['jpn'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,"['Abscess/*drug therapy', 'Adult', 'Amphotericin B/*administration & dosage', 'Catheterization', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Liver Abscess/*drug therapy', 'Portal Vein', 'Splenic Diseases/*drug therapy']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1992 Aug;33(8):1052-6.,['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the potential relationship between Mlvi-2 and the genes encoding the growth hormone receptor and the prolactin receptor, we determined the chromosomal location of all three loci in the rat, using a panel of rat-mouse somatic cell hybrids, and in the mouse, using a panel of (C57BL/6J x Mus spretus)F1 x C57BL/6J interspecific backcross mice. These analyses revealed that Ghr, Prlr, and Mlvi-2 map to chromosome 2 in the rat and to chromosome 15 in the mouse, in close proximity with each other. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of rat genomic DNA showed no overlaps between the gene encoding the prolactin receptor and the remaining loci. Moreover, expression of the prolactin receptor was not affected by provirus insertion in Mlvi-2. During these studies, however, we detected one T-cell lymphoma line (2779) in which the prolactin receptor gene was activated by provirus integration. Sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction-derived cDNA clones showed that the prolactin receptor RNA message initiates at the 5' long terminal repeat and utilizes the splice donor site 5' of the gag gene to splice the viral sequences onto exon 1 of the prolactin receptor. This message is predicted to encode the intact prolactin receptor protein product. Exposure of the T-cell lymphoma line 2779 to prolactin promoted cellular proliferation.","['Barker, C S', 'Bear, S E', 'Keler, T', 'Copeland, N G', 'Gilbert, D J', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Yeung, R S', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Barker CS', 'Bear SE', 'Keler T', 'Copeland NG', 'Gilbert DJ', 'Jenkins NA', 'Yeung RS', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']",['eng'],"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Prolactin/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Thymoma/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.11.6763-6768.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Nov;66(11):6763-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.11.6763-6768.1992.,"['0 (Receptors, Prolactin)']",,"['Ghr', 'Mlvi-2', 'Prlr']",,PMC240173,,,,,,['GENBANK/M95683'],,,,

In this study, we used the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) to investigate whether the activation of NF-kappa B by the viral transactivator Tax from human T-cell leukemia virus type I also depends on the production of reactive oxygen intermediates. The Tax-induced activation of the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappa B in Jurkat T cells was potently suppressed by micromolar concentrations of PDTC. Within the same concentration range, PDTC and two other dithiocarbamates also strongly interfered with transactivation of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by Tax but had no effect on transactivation of the same LTR by Tat. Transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I LTR by Tax was also barely influenced. Tax seems to activate NF-kappa B by a mechanism shared with all other inducers of NF-kappa B tested so far.

The in vivo distribution and intrahepatic deacylation of liposomal FUdR-dipalmitate was found to be strongly dependent on liposome composition and on drug to lipid ratio. The use of fluid-type liposomes (egg PC/PS/CHOL) rendered FUdR-dipalmitate more susceptible to enzymatic breakdown than solid-type liposomes (DSPC/DPPG/CHOL). A decrease of the retention of the drug in the body was also obtained when FUdR-dipalmitate was incorporated in solid-type liposomes with high drug to lipid ratio (1:10) than with low ratio (1:50). In spite of these substantial differences in the rates at which FUdR was liberated from liposomes with different fluidity, size, or drug to lipid ratio, only minor differences in therapeutic effect were observed in a number of murine tumour models (P388 leukaemia, Lewis Lung carcinoma, B16 melanoma and a C26 adenocarcinoma liver metastasis model). The lipophilic prodrug of FUdR exhibited antitumour activity at 100-600 times lower doses than the free drug. However, at these therapeutic doses FUdR-dipalmitate was also far more toxic.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Through 1990, 126 patients were transplanted during untreated first relapse of AML. Several preparative regimens were used, two of which involved more than 20 patients. Regimen 1 (29 patients) consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) 120 mg/kg and 15.75 Gy of fractionated total-body irradiation (TBI) with methotrexate (MTX) given intermittently during a 102-day period to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Regimen 2 (22 patients) consisted of the same CY and TBI treatment and a combination of MTX and cyclosporine (CSP) for GVHD prophylaxis. The remaining 75 patients were treated with 17 other transplant regimens. Outcome was compared for patients who were treated with regimen 1, regimen 2, and any other regimen. RESULTS: The 5-year probabilities of relapse-free survival (RFS), relapse, and nonrelapse mortality for 126 patients were .23, .57, and .44, respectively. With regimen 1, relapse (.26) was significantly less than for regimen 2 (.70; P = .004) or any other regimen (.76; P = .004). Regimen 1 patients developed more acute GVHD (.67) than regimen 2 patients (.26; P = .02) or patients on other regimens (.41; P = .02), and had increased nonrelapse mortality. Nevertheless, regimen 1 patients had a significantly higher 3-year RFS (.38) than those treated with regimen 2 (.18; P = .04) or any other regimen (.20; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: For patients who received 120 mg/kg CY and 15.75 Gy TBI, relapse incidence was less and survival was better after GVHD prophylaxis with MTX alone than after a combination of MTX and CSP, despite a significantly higher incidence of acute GVHD. The results of treatment with regimen 1 justify future studies of the optimal timing of allogeneic BMT in the treatment of patients with AML.","['Clift, R A', 'Buckner, C D', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Schoch, G', 'Petersen, F B', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Sanders, J', 'Sullivan, K M', 'Storb, R', 'Singer, J']","['Clift RA', 'Buckner CD', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Schoch G', 'Petersen FB', 'Bensinger WI', 'Sanders J', 'Sullivan KM', 'Storb R', 'Singer J', 'et al.']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104-2092.']",['eng'],"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.11.1723 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Nov;10(11):1723-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.11.1723.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, a variety of pediatric tumors are responsive to RA in vitro, which provides additional rationale for a phase I evaluation of RA in children with cancer that is refractory to standard therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase I trial of RA administered orally twice daily for 28-day treatment courses was performed. Cohorts of at least three pediatric cancer patients were entered at successive RA dose levels (from 45 to 80 mg/m2/d) until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was consistently observed. RESULTS: The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of RA was 60 mg/m2/d. Three of eight patients at the 80-mg/m2/d dose level developed reversible pseudotumor cerebri that necessitated discontinuation of the agent. Both patients with APL achieved complete remission (CR), whereas no patients with solid tumors had objective responses. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated a relatively short terminal half-life for RA (45 minutes), with diminution in plasma levels after chronic dosing. CONCLUSIONS: The MTD and recommended phase II dose for RA in children is 60 mg/m2/d given twice daily. Reversible CNS toxicity related to RA-induced pseudotumor cerebri is dose-limiting. Two children with APL achieved a CR to RA, which supports the inclusion of pediatric patients in clinical trials that evaluate the use of RA for patients with APL.","['Smith, M A', 'Adamson, P C', 'Balis, F M', 'Feusner, J', 'Aronson, L', 'Murphy, R F', 'Horowitz, M E', 'Reaman, G', 'Hammond, G D', 'Fenton, R M']","['Smith MA', 'Adamson PC', 'Balis FM', 'Feusner J', 'Aronson L', 'Murphy RF', 'Horowitz ME', 'Reaman G', 'Hammond GD', 'Fenton RM', 'et al.']","['Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Capsules', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Pseudotumor Cerebri/chemically induced', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.11.1666 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Nov;10(11):1666-73. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.11.1666.,"['0 (Capsules)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",['J Clin Oncol. 1992 Nov;10(11):1659-61.

In the present study, we analysed expression of p21X mRNA and tax/rex mRNA in uncultured and cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from eight patients with adult T cell leukaemia by using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction coupled to reverse transcription. The results demonstrated that the expression of p21X mRNA occurs constitutively in all uncultured and cultured PBMCs, whereas the expression of tax/rex mRNA is inducible in the cultured PBMCs, as described previously. In uncultured and cultured PBMCs from the one specimen in which p21X mRNA was highly expressed, the p21X protein was detectable by Western blotting. On the other hand, p27rex protein was detectable only after cultivation.

In this culture, designated MOMP1, more than 98% of cells display viral antigens. The MOMP1 culture is immune to superinfection with MV and is not cured by anti-MV antibodies. No evidence of defective interfering particles was obtained. The persistently infected culture releases an infectious virus showing a miniplaque and thermoresistant modified phenotype that, unlike the parental virus Edmonston strain which produces a lytic infection with extensive cell fusion, establishes an immediate persistence in MOLT4 cells with neither significant loss of cell viability nor cell fusion. This suggests that the modification in the virus suffices to maintain the state of persistence without requiring a coevolution of the host cell during the infection, as has been reported in other persistent virus infections.","['Fernandez-Munoz, R', 'Celma, M L']","['Fernandez-Munoz R', 'Celma ML']","['Unidad de Virologia, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Antibodies, Viral', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Fusion', 'Defective Viruses', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/microbiology', 'Measles virus/*growth & development/pathogenicity/ultrastructure', 'Phenotype', 'Superinfection/microbiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-73-9-2195 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1992 Sep;73 ( Pt 9):2195-202. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-73-9-2195.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Throughout that time period, both types of grafts were macroscopically and histologically characteristic of differentiated thymus or intestine tissues, respectively. Beginning at week 2 postengraftment, clusters of lymphocytes were present within intestine grafts, particularly in subepithelial regions and in areas below villus crypts. As determined by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometric analyses, lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes of sham-engrafted mice (AT x BM-SHAM) were essentially void of T cells, whereas in AT x BM thymus-engrafted (AT x BM-THG) mice, which served as a positive control for T cell repopulation, normal levels of T cells were present in spleen and lymph nodes by week 3 postengraftment, and at times thereafter. Most striking, however, was the finding that T cell repopulation of the spleen and lymph nodes occurred in AT x BM fetal intestine-engrafted (AT x BM-FIG) mice beginning 3 wk postengraftment. Based on H-2 expression, peripheral T cells in AT x BM-FIG mice were of donor bone marrow origin, and consisted of CD3+, T cell receptor (TCR)-alpha/beta+ T cells with both CD4+8- and CD4-8+ subsets. Peripheral T cells in AT x BM-FIG mice were functionally mature, as demonstrated by their capacity to proliferate after stimulation of CD3 epsilon. Moreover, alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes were generated in primary in vitro cultures of spleen cells from AT x BM-FIG and AT x BM-THG mice, though not in spleen cell cultures from AT x BM-SHAM mice. Histologic studies of engrafted tissues 3-4 wk postengraftment demonstrated that thymus leukemia (Tl) antigens were expressed on epithelial surfaces of intestine grafts, and that both TCR-alpha/beta+ and TCR-gamma/delta+ lymphocytes were present in intestine grafts. Collectively, these findings indicate that the murine small intestine has the capacity to initiate and regulate T cell development from bone marrow precursors, thus providing a mechanism by which extrathymic development of intestine lymphocytes occur.","['Mosley, R L', 'Klein, J R']","['Mosley RL', 'Klein JR']","['Department of Biological Science, University of Tulsa, Oklahoma 74104.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK035566/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-35566/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/analysis/physiology', 'Fetus', 'Intestine, Small/*physiology', 'Intestines/immunology/*transplantation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Thymus Gland/transplantation']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.176.5.1365 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1992 Nov 1;176(5):1365-73. doi: 10.1084/jem.176.5.1365.,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,PMC2119435,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that interleukin 4 (IL-4) not only inhibits but also prevents the proliferation of B-CLL cells. We report here that IL-4 protects the B-CLL cells from death by apoptosis (programmed cell death [PCD]). IL-4 inhibits spontaneous and hydrocortisone (HC)-induced PCD of highly purified B cells from 12 unselected CLL patients, as shown by sustained cell viability and lack of DNA fragmentation. IL-1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -7, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and transforming growth factor beta have no protective effect. The in vitro rescue from apoptosis by IL-4 is reflected by an increased expression of Bcl-2 protein, a proto-oncogene directly involved in the prolongation of cell survival in vivo and in vitro. Hence, IL-4-treated B-CLL cells express significantly more Bcl-2 than unstimulated, HC-treated, or fresh B-CLL cells. Furthermore, subcutaneous injection of IL-4 into one CLL patient enhances Bcl-2 protein expression in the leukemic B cells. These data may suggest that IL-4 prevents apoptosis of B-CLL cells using a Bcl-2-dependent pathway. Given our recent observations that fresh T cells from B-CLL patients express IL-4 mRNA, we propose that IL-4 has an essential role in the pathogenesis of CLL disease, by preventing both the death and the proliferation of the malignant B cells.","['Dancescu, M', 'Rubio-Trujillo, M', 'Biron, G', 'Bron, D', 'Delespesse, G', 'Sarfati, M']","['Dancescu M', 'Rubio-Trujillo M', 'Biron G', 'Bron D', 'Delespesse G', 'Sarfati M']","['University of Montreal, Notre-Dame Hospital Research Center, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Receptors, IgE/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.176.5.1319 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1992 Nov 1;176(5):1319-26. doi: 10.1084/jem.176.5.1319.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,PMC2119420,,,,,,,,,,

We present here a case of T cell ALL with a t(1;3)(p34;p21) translocation that also disrupts the SCL locus and leads to dysregulated SCL gene expression. This translocation, similar to previously reported SCL gene disruptions, appears to have been mediated, at least in part, by the V(D)J recombinase complex, since cryptic heptamer recognition sequences, as well as nontemplated N region nucleotide addition, are present at the breakpoints. The t(1;3) also disrupts a region on chromosome 3 characterized by alternating purine and pyrimidine residues, which can form a Z-DNA structure, reported to be prone to recombination events. A previously undescribed, evolutionarily conserved transcript unit is detected within 8 kb of the breakpoint on chromosome 3. This report extends the spectrum of recognized SCL translocations associated with T cell ALL, and underscores the contention that dysregulated SCL expression may be a causal event in T cell ALL.","['Aplan, P D', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Kirsch, I R']","['Aplan PD', 'Raimondi SC', 'Kirsch IR']","['Navy Medical Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20889.']",['eng'],"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.176.5.1303 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1992 Nov 1;176(5):1303-10. doi: 10.1084/jem.176.5.1303.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,['SCL'],,PMC2119434,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S46854', 'GENBANK/S46855', 'GENBANK/S46856', 'GENBANK/S46857', 'GENBANK/X70198', 'GENBANK/X70199', 'GENBANK/X70200', 'GENBANK/X70201', 'GENBANK/X70202', 'GENBANK/X70203']",,,,

Since T cell depletion of the bone marrow graft has decreased the risk of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), but has been associated with higher rates of leukemia relapse, GVL reactivity is probably caused by donor-derived T lymphocytes. Previously, we demonstrated that minor histocompatibility (mH) antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones, generated from patients after BMT, are capable of major histocompatibility complex-(MHC) restricted lysis of (clonogenic) myeloid leukemic cells. Here, we investigated whether donor-derived leukemia-specific CTL clones can be generated in vitro, before BMT, using irradiated leukemic cells from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia as stimulator cells, and peripheral blood or bone marrow from the HLA genotypically identical sibling donor as responder cells. Several CTL lines were generated that showed specific lysis (> 50%) of the recipient leukemic cells in a 51Cr-release assay. Two of these CTL lines were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of the irradiated recipient cells. Multiple leukemia-reactive, HLA class I and II-restricted clones with various specificities could be established. These alloreactive, antileukemic CTL clones may cause GVL reactivity after BMT, and may be used as adjuvant immunotherapy in the treatment of leukemia.","['Faber, L M', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H']","['Faber LM', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA-B7 Antigen/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*physiology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.176.5.1283 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1992 Nov 1;176(5):1283-9. doi: 10.1084/jem.176.5.1283.,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B7 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",,,,PMC2119433,,,,,,,,,,

In this case, tal-1 transcription is initiated from a promoter located within the fourth exon similarly to the DU 528 cell line. In a T-ALL bearing a t(1;14) affecting the 5' part of tal-1, two types of tal-1 transcripts were observed, namely those probably initiated from the D delta region juxtaposed to tal-1 by the translocation, and those from the exon 4 promoter. It is interesting that this exon 4 promotion was also found in leukemic T cell lines and T-ALL samples without apparent tal-1 genomic alteration. In contrast, no transcript initiated from the exon 4 promoter was found in T-ALL with tald1 or tald2 deletion. In these cells, tal-1 is expressed via SIL-tal-1 fused transcripts. Finally, this exon 4 initiation was detected neither in normal bone marrow, nor in malignant cells from the erythroid/megakaryocytic lineages. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that the exon 4 promoter is specifically active in T cell lineage.","['Bernard, O', 'Azogui, O', 'Lecointe, N', 'Mugneret, F', 'Berger, R', 'Larsen, C J', 'Mathieu-Mahul, D']","['Bernard O', 'Azogui O', 'Lecointe N', 'Mugneret F', 'Berger R', 'Larsen CJ', 'Mathieu-Mahul D']","['U. 301 Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM)-Institut de Genetique Moleculaire (IGM), France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Antisense/chemical synthesis', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.176.4.919 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1992 Oct 1;176(4):919-25. doi: 10.1084/jem.176.4.919.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,['tal-1'],,PMC2119401,,,,,,"['GENBANK/L14735', 'GENBANK/L14736', 'GENBANK/L14737', 'GENBANK/L14738', 'GENBANK/L14739', 'GENBANK/L14740', 'GENBANK/S45696', 'GENBANK/S45697', 'GENBANK/S45699', 'GENBANK/S45702', 'GENBANK/X67500']",,,,

To determine whether such transdominant Rev proteins could provide long-term protection against HIV infection without affecting T cell function, T leukemia cell lines were stably transduced with a retroviral vector encoding a transdominant mutant of the Rev protein, M10. While all the M10-expressing cell lines remained infectable by HIV-1, these same cells failed to support a productive replication cycle when infected with a cloned isolate of HIV-1. In addition, two out of three M10-expressing CEM clones were also resistant to highly productive infection by a heterogeneous HIV-1 pool. Expression of M10 did not affect induction of HIV transcription mediated by the kappa B regulatory element or Tat. Importantly, constitutive expression of Rev M10 did not alter the secretion of interleukin 2 in response to mitogen stimulation of EL-4 and Jurkat cells.

Analysis of somatic mutations and mutations to charged residues demonstrated that the mutations in CLLs are highly selected.","['Cai, J', 'Humphries, C', 'Richardson, A', 'Tucker, P W']","['Cai J', 'Humphries C', 'Richardson A', 'Tucker PW']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['eng'],['CA-44016/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.176.4.1073 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1992 Oct 1;176(4):1073-81. doi: 10.1084/jem.176.4.1073.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,['V<down>H</down>5'],,PMC2119384,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S40279', 'GENBANK/S75517', 'GENBANK/X58392', 'GENBANK/X59703', 'GENBANK/X59704', 'GENBANK/X59705', 'GENBANK/X59706', 'GENBANK/X59707', 'GENBANK/X63232', 'GENBANK/X63233']",,,,

Whole cells and low speed cytosols were analysed for specific oestradiol-binding activity. ERs were enriched from cell extracts by either fractionated ethanol precipitation (0-25% (v/v) ethanol) and/or microscale-immunoaffinity chromatography. Immunoreactive proteins of identical molecular weight (approximately 65 kDa) were detected in all cell lines examined. Whole cell binding assays showed specific oestradiol-binding activity in MCF 7, IM 9 and CCRF cells. Borderline binding was found in HL 60 myeloid cells. No specific binding could be detected in AEH 1, NS I and SP 0 cells. Identical results were obtained using agar-electrophoresis after dextran-coated charcoal treatment. Immunoaffinity purified ERs from MCF 7, AEH 1 and HL 60 cells were subjected to limited proteolysis, where identical tryptic fragments were generated. In conclusion, we have confirmed by immunological methods that ERs are expressed in a variety of cell lines derived from the immune system and the haematopoietic system. The lack of specific hormone binding or very low-affinity hormone binding in some of the cells examined may be due to post-translational events or point mutations.","['Jakob, F', 'Tony, H P', 'Schneider, D', 'Thole, H H']","['Jakob F', 'Tony HP', 'Schneider D', 'Thole HH']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity/methods', 'Cytosol/chemistry', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Estradiol/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic System/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Lymphatic System/*chemistry', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Receptors, Estradiol/*analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1677/joe.0.1340397 [doi]'],ppublish,J Endocrinol. 1992 Sep;134(3):397-404. doi: 10.1677/joe.0.1340397.,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Receptors, Estradiol)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HEL cells were cocultured with various doses of PF4 in either a plasma clot system for colony assay or a liquid system for tritiated thymidine incorporation. A significant inhibition of HEL colony growth and tritiated thymidine incorporation was seen at PF4 doses of 1 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. The inhibitory effect of PF4 could be abrogated by the addition of heparin (5 to 10 micrograms/ml). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that PF4 had no obvious effect on the expression of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa of HEL cells. Binding of 125I-PF4 to HEL cells reached equilibrium within 20 to 30 minutes with dissociation constant of 1.3 x 10(-10)M and Bmax of 6.3 pmol/10(5) cells and was inhibited by an excess of unlabeled PF4, beta TG, and heparin but was not affected by PMA, IL-3, IL-6, GM-CSF, and interferon-alpha. PF4 did not affect the binding of 125I-IL-3 and 125I-IL-6 to HEL cells. These data demonstrate that PF4 inhibits the growth of HEL cells by specific binding to HEL cells and suggest that the action of PF4 may be associated with the heparin-binding sites of the molecule.","['Han, Z C', 'Maurer, A M', 'Bellucci, S', 'Wan, H Y', 'Kroviarski, Y', 'Bertrand, O', 'Caen, J P']","['Han ZC', 'Maurer AM', 'Bellucci S', 'Wan HY', 'Kroviarski Y', 'Bertrand O', 'Caen JP']","['Institut des Vaisseaux et du Sang, INSERM U 160, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,IM,"['Cell Division/*drug effects', 'DNA/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Platelet Factor 4/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Thromboglobulin/pharmacology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0022-2143(92)90116-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1992 Oct;120(4):645-60.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (beta-Thromboglobulin)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. Despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. This was opposite to the decreased frequencies of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The isolates of P. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, Staphylococcus aureus were ranked as major pathogens. Among the recent isolates of S. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. Therefore, until more effective means for control of P. aeruginosa bacteremia in particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.","['Funada, H', 'Machi, T', 'Matsuda, T']","['Funada H', 'Machi T', 'Matsuda T']","['Protected Environment Unit, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,Kansenshogaku zasshi.

The Ag was shown to be a highly heterogeneous glycoprotein consisting of a 28-kDa protein and N-linked oligosaccharides ranging from 10 to 50 kDa. In the present study, cDNA clones were isolated from a human T cell cDNA expression library in Escherichia coli by using mAb C33. The identity of cDNA was verified by immunostaining and immunoprecipitation of transfected NIH3T3 cells with mAb. The cDNA contained an open reading frame of a 267-amino acid sequence which was a type III integral membrane protein of 29.6 kDa with four putative transmembrane domains and three putative N-glycosylation sites. The C33 gene was found to belong to a newly defined family of genes for membrane proteins, such as CD9, CD37, CD53, CD63, and TAPA-1, and was identical to R2, a cDNA recently isolated because of its strong up-regulation after T cell activation. Availability of mAb for C33 Ag enabled us to define its distribution in human leukocytes. C33 Ag was expressed in CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD16+ granulocytes. Its expression was low in CD8+ T cells and mostly negative in CD16+ NK cells. PHA stimulation enhanced the expression of C33 Ag in CD4+ T cells by about 5-fold and in CD8+ T cells by about 20-fold. PHA stimulation also induced the dramatic size changes in the N-linked sugars previously shown to accompany human T cell leukemia virus type 1-induced transformation of CD4+ T cells.","['Imai, T', 'Fukudome, K', 'Takagi, S', 'Nagira, M', 'Furuse, M', 'Fukuhara, N', 'Nishimura, M', 'Hinuma, Y', 'Yoshie, O']","['Imai T', 'Fukudome K', 'Takagi S', 'Nagira M', 'Furuse M', 'Fukuhara N', 'Nishimura M', 'Hinuma Y', 'Yoshie O']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Library', 'Giant Cells/*immunology', 'Glycosylation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kangai-1 Protein', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Nov 1;149(9):2879-86.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD82 protein, human)', '0 (Kangai-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies were performed to quantify the expression by monocytes and alveolar macrophages of Fc epsilon RII in asthma and to determine biologic response modifiers that regulate Fc epsilon RII. Whereas 2.5 +/- 1.0% of the monocytes obtained from normal volunteers were Fc epsilon RII positive, this increased to 16.7 +/- 2.4% in asthma (p < 0.001). Stimulation of Fc epsilon RII expression on monocytes was shown to be an activity of IL-4 (24.5 +/- 5.9%), granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (28.1 +/- 5.2%), IFN-alpha (15.8 +/- 5.3%), IFN-gamma (10.4 +/- 3.7%), and macrophage-CSF (7.3 +/- 0.7%) but not of IL-2, IL-6, or TNF-alpha. Expression of Fc epsilon RII by these cytokines was associated with the induction of specific mRNA transcripts. Using Fc epsilon RII subtype specific primers in the polymerase chain reaction expansion of cDNA, cytokine-induced receptors were shown to be Fc epsilon RIIb. Alveolar macrophages from nonasthmatic subjects displayed minimal expression of Fc epsilon RII (3.2 +/- 1.2%); however, these receptors were present on 69.2 +/- 6.3% of asthmatic volunteers (p < 0.001). Induction of Fc epsilon RII appears specific for allergic asthma insofar as these receptors are also not expressed in subjects with interstitial lung disease (1.3 +/- 1.3%). As assessed by shift in mean fluorescence, instillation of allergen in the asthmatic's airway further up-regulated Fc epsilon RII on alveolar macrophages by 151 +/- 7%. Up-regulation of Fc epsilon RII in atopic individuals may therefore reflect allergen-induced exposure of mononuclear phagocytes to one or more of these cytokines. These studies suggest a mechanism by which an immunologic stimulus that leads to the production of these cytokines (e.g., allergen or viral infection) would contribute to the development or exacerbation of allergic disease.","['Williams, J', 'Johnson, S', 'Mascali, J J', 'Smith, H', 'Rosenwasser, L J', 'Borish, L']","['Williams J', 'Johnson S', 'Mascali JJ', 'Smith H', 'Rosenwasser LJ', 'Borish L']","['Department of Medicine, National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, CO 80206.']",['eng'],"['AI24848/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36577/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Allergens/immunology', 'Asthma/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/immunology', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, IgE/*analysis/genetics']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Oct 15;149(8):2823-9.,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, IAP does not itself directly bind these ligands, which are instead recognized by the leukocyte response integrin (LRI). In fact, IAP is more widely expressed than the LRI and is even on erythrocytes, which express no known integrins. This suggests that IAP may have additional functions besides signal transduction in association with the LRI. In this work we have quantitated IAP expression on several myeloid cells and cell lines, as well as erythrocytes, using a mAb which recognizes this protein. These data show that there are about 10,000 IgG-binding sites on each erythrocyte and 20 times that number on the myeloid cell lines U937 and HL60. Normal PMN and monocytes express about 25,000 IgG-binding sites. There are twice as many Fab'-binding sites on each cell, suggesting that each IgG binds via both Ag-combining sites. Binding data using several mAb to IAP suggest that IAP undergoes a temperature-dependent conformational change. Unlike some integrin receptors, IAP is not stored in a regulated secretory compartment in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). In addition, there is no evidence for internalization or shedding of IAP upon PMN activation. These data show that IAP is expressed at significant levels on myeloid cells and erythrocytes and that its expression is unaffected by the state of PMN activation.","['Rosales, C', 'Gresham, H D', 'Brown, E J']","['Rosales C', 'Gresham HD', 'Brown EJ']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.']",['eng'],"['AI23790/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI24674/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM38330/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Erythrocytes/*chemistry', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Integrins/*analysis/immunology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Protein Conformation', '*Signal Transduction', 'Temperature']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Oct 15;149(8):2759-64.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Integrins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the histologic findings, type, and prognosis of lymphomas with cutaneous ulcers. METHODS: Thirty-three patients (20 with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, 10 with other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and 3 with leukemia) were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: All patients had a poor prognosis; 23 died within 9 months after the onset of the ulcers. Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had a worse prognosis, had a higher incidence of systemic involvement, and more often had ulcers as an initial manifestation of lymphoma than did the patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The histopathologic findings ranged from a nonspecific inflammatory infiltrate to ulcers with marked adjacent epidermal epidermotropism to ulcers with an angiocentric infiltrate. CONCLUSION: A variety of lymphomas may cause cutaneous ulceration. Adequate sampling of these ulcers is necessary for diagnosis. The average life expectancy after ulcer formation is 21 months.","['Helm, K F', 'Su, W P', 'Muller, S A', 'Kurtin, P J']","['Helm KF', 'Su WP', 'Muller SA', 'Kurtin PJ']","['Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Skin Ulcer/*pathology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0190-9622(92)70221-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0190-9622(92)70221-z [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1992 Oct;27(4):553-9. doi: 10.1016/0190-9622(92)70221-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All reported patients with an associated malignant neoplasm have had a poor prognosis. OBJECTIVE: We present three new cases of paraneoplastic pemphigus associated with a malignant neoplasm and further characterize this disease. METHODS: We used clinical criteria, histologic and immunopathologic examinations, and immunophenotyping to characterize this disease. In addition, we performed immunoprecipitation studies with extracts of radiolabeled human keratinocytes to characterize the antigens to which patient serum binds. RESULTS: All three patients had clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic findings that were strongly suggestive of paraneoplastic pemphigus. Their sera immunoprecipitated a complex of four polypeptides from human keratinocyte extracts with molecular weights of 250, 230, 210, and 190 kd, confirming the diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus. The 250, 230, and 210 kd antigens comigrated with desmoplakin I, the 230 kd bullous pemphigoid antigen, and desmoplakin II, respectively. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping revealed large populations of monoclonal CD19+, CD5+ B cells in two cases. Although two of the patients died, one patient is alive and well 2 years after the diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus. CONCLUSION: We report three cases of paraneoplastic pemphigus. One patient is alive and well 2 years after diagnosis, which suggests that a subgroup of patients may have a more benign course.","['Camisa, C', 'Helm, T N', 'Liu, Y C', 'Valenzuela, R', 'Allen, C', 'Bona, S', 'Larrimer, N', 'Korman, N J']","['Camisa C', 'Helm TN', 'Liu YC', 'Valenzuela R', 'Allen C', 'Bona S', 'Larrimer N', 'Korman NJ']","['Department of Dermatology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195-5032.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Diseases/*pathology', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Pemphigus/*pathology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Stomatitis/pathology', 'Tongue Diseases/pathology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0190-9622(92)70220-A [pii]', '10.1016/0190-9622(92)70220-a [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1992 Oct;27(4):547-53. doi: 10.1016/0190-9622(92)70220-a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is secondary to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Most lesions are located in the anogenital and axillary areas, but the route of infection is generally difficult to establish. OBJECTIVE: We report six children with perineal ecthyma gangrenosum and discuss predisposing factors, origin, and route of infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective clinical study. RESULTS: Three children had blood cultures positive for P. aeruginosa, and one died. Predisposing factors were present in all cases; two had received chemotherapy (neuroblastoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia), and two had idiopathic granulocytopenia. The last two patients previously had received treatment with systemic antibiotics and had abnormal granulocyte killing several months later. CONCLUSION: Septicemic ecthyma gangrenosum can be rapidly fatal in young children and requires aggressive antibiotic therapy. Benign ecthyma gangrenosum in healthy infants may result from a modification of bowel microflora after antibiotic therapy in conjunction with maceration in the diaper area. However, careful evaluation and long-term follow-up must be done to detect neutropenia, functional abnormalities of granulocytes, or a possible immune deficiency.","['Boisseau, A M', 'Sarlangue, J', 'Perel, Y', 'Hehunstre, J P', 'Taieb, A', 'Maleville, J']","['Boisseau AM', 'Sarlangue J', 'Perel Y', 'Hehunstre JP', 'Taieb A', 'Maleville J']","['Service of Dermatology, Hopital des Enfants, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Ecthyma/drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gangrene', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Perineum', 'Pseudomonas Infections/*complications/drug therapy', '*Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/*complications/drug therapy']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0190-9622(92)70210-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0190-9622(92)70210-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1992 Sep;27(3):415-8. doi: 10.1016/0190-9622(92)70210-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The peripheral blood and bone marrow appearances of all cases of childhood ALL presenting in one health region of England in 13 years and eight months were reviewed. All cases presenting with cytopenia without circulating blasts and marrow aspirates with no infiltrate of blasts were studied in detail. RESULTS: Four of 305 (1.3%) children presented in this way. All four had reticulin fibrosis and increased cellularity in all or part of the marrow biopsy specimen. All were girls. Three had common and one surface membrane immunoglobulin positive ALL. Reassessment of this prodrome, by combining the features of four previously reported series of similar cases with the present one, highlighted the female preponderance (19 of 22 cases), bone marrow fibrosis (10 of 11 evaluable cases), prominent bone marrow lymphocytes (14 of 22 cases) and temporary recovery (all 12 evaluable cases). Six of 14 evaluable cases had bone marrow biopsy specimen appearances of apparently uniform hypocellularity, but only one of these did not have fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: If, in addition to an aspirate, a bone marrow trephine biopsy is carried out the prodrome can be distinguished from aplasia in most cases. The similarity of this prodrome to aplastic anaemia is merely superficial.

METHODS: Blood mononuclear cells from 155 patients with B cell (n = 120) or T cell (n = 35) chronic lymphoproliferative disorders were tested with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 by indirect immunoperoxidase or immunoalkaline phosphatase techniques. B cell diseases included chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), CLL in prolymphocytic transformation (CLL/PL), prolymphocytic leukaemia (B-PLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) in leukaemic phase. The T cell diseases comprised large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia, T-PLL, and T-NHL. RESULTS: These showed significantly higher proportions of Ki-67 positive cells in T cell (11.2%) than in B cell (2.9%) disorders (p < 0.001). The highest values were found in NHL of both B and T cell types, particularly when low grade disease transformed to high grade.

In addition to the selective expression of various phenotype marker genes, several members of the heat shock gene family exhibit differential expression throughout the developmental sequence of these two cell types. As determined by steady state mRNA levels, in both osteoblasts and HL-60 cells expression of hsp27, hsp60, hsp70, hsp89 alpha, and hsp89 beta may be associated with the modifications in gene expression and cellular architecture that occur during differentiation. In both differentiation systems, the expression of hsp27 mRNA shows a 2.5-fold increase with the down-regulation of proliferation while hsp60 mRNA levels are maximal during active proliferation and subsequently decline post-proliferatively. mRNA expression of two members of the hsp90 family decreases with the shutdown of proliferation, with a parallel relationship between hsp89 alpha mRNA levels and proliferation in osteoblasts and a delay in down-regulation of hsp89 alpha mRNA levels in HL-60 cells and of hsp89 beta mRNA in both systems. Hsp70 mRNA rapidly increases, almost twofold, as proliferation decreases in HL-60 cells but during osteoblast growth and differentiation was only minimally detectable and showed no significant changes. Although the presence of the various hsp mRNA species is maintained at some level throughout the developmental sequence of both osteoblasts and HL-60 cells, changes in the extent to which the heat shock genes are expressed occur primarily in association with the decline of proliferative activity. The observed differences in patterns of expression for the various heat shock genes are consistent with involvement in mediating a series of regulatory events functionally related to the control of both cell growth and differentiation.","['Shakoori, A R', 'Oberdorf, A M', 'Owen, T A', 'Weber, L A', 'Hickey, E', 'Stein, J L', 'Lian, J B', 'Stein, G S']","['Shakoori AR', 'Oberdorf AM', 'Owen TA', 'Weber LA', 'Hickey E', 'Stein JL', 'Lian JB', 'Stein GS']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],"['AR33920/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR35166/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR39588/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240480308 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1992 Mar;48(3):277-87. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240480308.,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rex is a phosphoprotein found predominantly in the cell nucleolus, whose function is thought to be regulated by its nucleolar localization and phosphorylation. Therefore, we investigated the in vivo phosphorylation of Rex protein in more detail. Phosphorylation of Rex occurred in all HTLV-I-infected cell lines examined in vivo, primarily at serine residues and to a very small extent at threonine residues. Treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) led to significant but transient enhancement of the incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into Rex protein. N-terminal truncation of Rex protein abolished TPA-dependent phosphorylation. Chymotryptic digestion of phosphorylated Rex yielded two phosphopeptides. In vivo phosphorylation sites were identified as serine residues 70 and 177 and threonine residue 174. Serine 70 was a TPA-dependent phosphorylation site within a regulatory domain. We have already shown that the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine) specifically blocked accumulation of viral unspliced gag-pol mRNA. Therefore, the phosphorylation at serine 70 may be involved in the regulation of Rex function in response to extracellular stimuli.","['Adachi, Y', 'Copeland, T D', 'Takahashi, C', 'Nosaka, T', 'Ahmed, A', 'Oroszlan, S', 'Hatanaka, M']","['Adachi Y', 'Copeland TD', 'Takahashi C', 'Nosaka T', 'Ahmed A', 'Oroszlan S', 'Hatanaka M']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, rex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1992/10/25 00:00,1992/10/25 00:01,['1992/10/25 00:00'],"['1992/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)36709-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Oct 25;267(30):21977-81.,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Phosphates)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Wegener's granulomatosis autoantigen.",21193-9,"Proteinase-3 (PR-3) is a neutral serine proteinase present in the azurophil granules of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It degrades a variety of extracellular matrix proteins including elastin in vitro and causes emphysema when administered by tracheal insufflation to hamsters. It is identical to the target autoantigen (c-ANCA) associated with Wegener's granulomatosis and to myeloblastin, a serine proteinase first identified in HL-60 leukemia cells. In this study, the gene encoding PR-3 was cloned and sequenced. The gene spans approximately 6.5 kilobase pairs and consists of five exons and four introns. The genomic organization of PR-3 is similar to that of the other serine proteinases expressed in hemopoietic cells. Each residue of the catalytic triad of PR-3 is located on a separate exon, and the positions of the residues within the exons are similar to those in human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G. The phase and placement of the introns in the PR-3 gene are also similar to those in human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G. The 400-base pair (bp) 5'-flanking sequence of the PR-3 gene contains a TATA box at position 379. There is no CAAT box promoter element. The 3'-untranslated region is 200 bp, extending from a TGA stop codon to the site of polyadenylation 10 bp after the canonical AATAAA signal. Amplification of PR-3 from a human/hamster hybrid cell line localizes the gene to human chromosome 19. Evidence from Northern analysis suggests that PR-3 expression is primarily confined to the promyelocytic/myelocytic stage of bone marrow development.","['Sturrock, A B', 'Franklin, K F', 'Rao, G', 'Marshall, B C', 'Rebentisch, M B', 'Lemons, R S', 'Hoidal, J R']","['Sturrock AB', 'Franklin KF', 'Rao G', 'Marshall BC', 'Rebentisch MB', 'Lemons RS', 'Hoidal JR']","['Department of Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City 84132.']",['eng'],"['1K08 HL-02370/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-37615/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Autoantigens/blood/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*enzymology', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis/blood/enzymology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloblastin', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*genetics/immunology']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)36816-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Oct 15;267(29):21193-9.,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/D12491', 'GENBANK/D12492', 'GENBANK/D12493', 'GENBANK/M76534', 'GENBANK/M76535', 'GENBANK/M84722', 'GENBANK/M95763', 'GENBANK/M96014', 'GENBANK/M96015', 'GENBANK/M97911']",,,,

Evidence for a third AMPD gene exhibiting alternatively spliced 5'-exons.,20866-77,"Higher eukaryotes express multiple isoforms of AMP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.6). In humans, four AMP deaminase variants, termed M (muscle), L (liver), E1, and E2 (erythrocyte) can be distinguished by a variety of biochemical and immunological criteria. Previous molecular studies have reported two genes, AMPD1 and AMPD2, that produce isoform M and L transcripts, respectively. This study identifies a third human AMP deaminase gene, AMPD3. Nucleotide sequence alignments between AMPD3 cDNAs isolated from several human libraries indicate three different extreme 5'-ends. Alternate forms of the AMPD3 cDNAs contain a common 2301-bp open reading frame (ORF) and 3'-untranslated region of 1245 bp. Two of the three forms, however, exhibit additional 5'-end nucleotide sequences that would extend their respective ORFs by 21 and 27 nucleotides. RNase protection analyses and the partial characterization of human AMPD3 genomic clones demonstrate alternative splicing of three different 5'-terminal exons. Western blot analyses detect anti-E-specific immunoreactivity in affinity-purified extracts derived from the bacterial expression of a truncated AMPD3 cDNA. These results are discussed in relation to AMP deaminase isoform diversity.","['Mahnke-Zizelman, D K', 'Sabina, R L']","['Mahnke-Zizelman DK', 'Sabina RL']","['Department of Cellular Biology and Anatomy, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['AR40766/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR03326/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['AMP Deaminase/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Erythrocytes/enzymology', '*Exons', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Library', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscles/enzymology', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)36768-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Oct 15;267(29):20866-77.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.5.4.6 (AMP Deaminase)']",,"['AMPD', 'AMPD1', 'AMPD2', 'AMPD3']",,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/D12491', 'GENBANK/D12492', 'GENBANK/D12493', 'GENBANK/M76534', 'GENBANK/M76535', 'GENBANK/M84720', 'GENBANK/M84721', 'GENBANK/M84722', 'GENBANK/M96014', 'GENBANK/M96015']",,,,

Regulation by phorbol esters.,20804-10,"The expression of the beta isoenzyme for protein kinase C is regulated developmentally and in response to inducers of cell differentiation (such as phorbol esters and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3). The 5' segment of the gene for protein kinase C beta was cloned from a human leukocyte genomic library in EMBL3 bacteriophage. This segment of the gene (greater than 54 kilobases in length) encompassed the coding sequence for the amino-terminal regulatory domain of the enzyme, the 5'-untranslated region, and the 5'-flanking region. Initiation of transcription was identified by S1 nuclease analysis and confirmed by RNase protection analysis at 197 base pairs 5' of the initiator ATG. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region revealed it to be extremely G+C-rich (> 80%) with many features of a CpG island. Comparison of sequence with known cis-regulatory motifs disclosed a number of potential regulatory elements including an octamer binding motif at -76, Sp1-binding sites at -94 and -63, E boxes at -110, -26, and +18, an AP-1 site at -442, and an AP-2 site at -330. To demonstrate promoter activity, a 630-base pair fragment extending from -587 to +43 was subcloned in front of a promoterless luciferase gene. This fragment was able to drive the expression of luciferase in transient transfections of human hematopoietic cells. Deletion analysis demonstrated that a fragment -111 to +43 was necessary and sufficient for promoter activity; this fragment did not contain TATA or CAAT motifs. The promoter was stimulated 8-20-fold by phorbol esters accounting for the previously observed transcriptional activation of protein kinase C beta. This phorbol ester responsiveness was conferred by the basal promoter (-111 to +43) and was independent of the AP-1 site. These results define a novel mechanism of protein kinase C autoregulation at a transcriptional level.","['Obeid, L M', 'Blobe, G C', 'Karolak, L A', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Obeid LM', 'Blobe GC', 'Karolak LA', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],['HL-43707/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Genomic Library', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Leukocytes/enzymology', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase C/*genetics', 'RNA Probes', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)36758-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Oct 15;267(29):20804-10.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA Probes)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/D12491', 'GENBANK/D12492', 'GENBANK/D12493', 'GENBANK/M76532', 'GENBANK/M76533', 'GENBANK/M76534', 'GENBANK/M76535', 'GENBANK/M96014', 'GENBANK/M96015', 'GENBANK/S47311']",,,,

In addition, perturbation of adhesion receptor function during ex vivo expansion may alter the behavior of infused cells in adoptive immunotherapy protocols. Finally, circulating malignant cells may utilize receptors normally involved in recruitment and recirculation. This paper reviews the function and regulation of adhesion molecules involved in normal leukocyte trafficking. The evidence implicating specific adhesion receptors in the spread of lymphoid malignancies through the bloodstream is then discussed.","['Stoolman, L M', 'Kaldjian, E']","['Stoolman LM', 'Kaldjian E']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109-0602.']",['eng'],"['HL-07517/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA49256/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Switzerland,Invasion Metastasis,Invasion & metastasis,8202435,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Lymphoma/*physiopathology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Invasion Metastasis. 1992;12(2):101-11.,['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)'],,,106,,,,,,,,,,,

The incubation of either peripheral-blood lymphocytes (PBL) or large granular lymphocytes (LGL) with swainsonine (SW), an inhibitor of mannosidase II, resulted in the augmentation of cytotoxicity against K562 leukemia cells. The enhanced cytotoxicity was associated with increased binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Con-A to SW-treated effector cells, and immunofluorescence staining of the target K562 cells using goat anti-Con-A antibody (Ab) showed a significant positive shift in the flow cytometric pattern. Electrophoretic separation and immunoblotting analysis revealed that 4 components with a molecular weight of approximately 95, 80, 60 and 50 kDa were recognized by anti-Con-A Ab from the detergent-extract of K562 cells. The addition of Con-A during the antibody incubation step of the Western blotting abolished their expression, thus excluding non-specific binding of the antibody. The addition of Con-A also strongly inhibited the cytotoxicity of SW-treated effector cells (PBL or LGL) against K562 cells, and this inhibition was abolished by 40 mM alpha-methyl-mannopyranoside (alpha-MM), which binds to Con-A. Furthermore, Con-A increased the binding frequency of SW-treated LGL to K562, in spite of the inhibited cytotoxicity, and this effect could be neutralized by the further addition of alpha-MM. Our results suggest that Con A-like molecules might play an important role in cell-cell interactions between SW-treated effector cells and NK target cells.","['Yagita, M', 'Noda, I', 'Maehara, M', 'Fujieda, S', 'Inoue, Y', 'Hoshino, T', 'Saksela, E']","['Yagita M', 'Noda I', 'Maehara M', 'Fujieda S', 'Inoue Y', 'Hoshino T', 'Saksela E']","['Department of Immunology, Fukui Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Binding Sites', 'Concanavalin A/*analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Lectins/*analysis/physiology', 'Mannose/*metabolism', 'Swainsonine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/21 00:00,1992/10/21 00:01,['1992/10/21 00:00'],"['1992/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910520428 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1992 Oct 21;52(4):664-72. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910520428.,"['0 (Lectins)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)', 'RSY4RK37KQ (Swainsonine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five-day-old CFW mice were inoculated by the oral-intragastric route with 1.0 x 10(7) CFU of two C. albicans and two C. tropicalis strains isolated from the blood of patients with acute leukemia and with C. albicans 4918 and its cerulenin-resistant mutant 4918-10. C. albicans and C. tropicalis spread to the lungs, liver, and kidneys within 30 min postinoculation, and organ CFU of the two species were comparable over the following 10 days. Close association of blastoconidia with the villous surface of the small intestine resulted in lysis of microvilli and then progressive invasion of villi. Blastoconidia within villi were surrounded by a conspicuous zone of clearing. Persistent colonization of the small and large intestines by C. albicans blood isolates and strains 4918 and 4918-10 was similar for 31 days after inoculation, but consistently exceeded that of C. tropicalis. In mice colonized with C. albicans, immunosuppression with cortisone acetate and cyclophosphamide on days 30 and 33 after inoculation increased stomach CFU 40- to 370-fold and intestinal CFU 30- to 80-fold. In contrast, persistent colonization by C. tropicalis was undetectable before immunosuppression and only became apparent after treatment. C. albicans disseminated more frequently and with higher organ CFU than C. tropicalis. Despite this fact, 20% of mice infected with C. tropicalis died, compared with 4% infected with C. albicans blood isolates. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed penetrative growth by Candida hyphae exclusively in the mucosa and submucosa of the stomach from immunosuppressed, persistently colonized mice. Taken together, the data indicate that C. tropicalis appears to be more virulent than C. albicans and that factors responsible for gastrointestinal colonization, systemic dissemination, and mortality in immunocompromised mice may not be identical.","['de Repentigny, L', 'Phaneuf, M', 'Mathieu, L G']","['de Repentigny L', 'Phaneuf M', 'Mathieu LG']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Candida/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Candida albicans/immunology/pathogenicity', 'Candidiasis/*immunology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/immunology/microbiology', 'Immunocompromised Host/*immunology', 'Intestines/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Time Factors']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/iai.60.11.4907-4914.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 1992 Nov;60(11):4907-14. doi: 10.1128/iai.60.11.4907-4914.1992.,,,,,PMC258247,,,,,,,,,,

The PCR analysis was positive using either one or both pairs of primers in 11 of the the 20 cases (55 per cent) of B-cell lymphomas which all had positive rearrangement by Southern analysis. The two pairs of primers seemed to produce complementary results as the specimens may be positive to one pair but negative to the other. The false negative rate of 45 per cent is however much higher than the respective figures of 18 per cent and 0 per cent observed in our patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a previous study.

This observation led to a successful immunochemotherapy protocol in mice using Dacarbazine plus cytoreductive chemotherapy. Therefore an in vivo and in vitro pilot study was conducted in patients (pts) with resistant or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The DNA-repair enzyme O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyl-transferase (OGAT) and the in vitro chemosensitivity to Temozolomide, a Dacarbazine derivative, were evaluated in leukemic blasts. RESULTS: Nine pts received Dacarbazine (0.4-0.8 g/sqm/day) on days 0, 1 and 2. On day 7, noticeable blast reduction occurred in 4 pts: pt 1 was in partial remission on day 21, pt 6 still showed bone marrow leukemia, pt 8 died of sepsis on day 8, pt 9 is still in aplasia on day 25. Low OGAT levels and consistent sensitivity to Temozolomide in vitro were found in the blasts of pts responsive to Dacarbazine. Subsequently, pts 1-7 underwent Ara-C (1g/sqm/day) plus Mitoxantrone (6mg/sqm/day) treatment for 6 days. Four pts entered complete remission after 27-45 days of aplasia. Failures were due to hypoplastic death, absolute drug resistance, or hypoplasia followed by blast cell regrowth. CONCLUSIONS: These data point out that Dacarbazine can induce a marked reduction of blast cells as well as severe myelotoxicity in leukemic patients.","['Franchi, A', 'Papa, G', ""D'Atri, S"", 'Piccioni, D', 'Masi, M', 'Bonmassar, E']","['Franchi A', 'Papa G', ""D'Atri S"", 'Piccioni D', 'Masi M', 'Bonmassar E']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale e Scienze Biochimiche, II Universita, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Antiemetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nausea/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Remission Induction', 'Temozolomide']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1992 Mar-Apr;77(2):146-50.,"['0 (Antiemetics)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Prevalence of HDMTX-induced acute hepatotoxicity was 1.47% (1/68 patients). ALT values did not change in 22% (15/68) and decreased in 76.4% (52/68) after HDMTX infusion. Mean ALT levels calculated in all the patients decreased significantly during HDMTX administration when compared to the values reached during induction (p less than 0.0001). Direct hyperbilirubinemia was present only in the child with HDMTX-related hepatotoxicity.

Since ""in vivo"" studies demonstrated that it was responsible for thrombocytopenia in humans, anagrelide has been used recently in a small number of patients with thrombocytosis and myeloproliferative disorders. Platelet count was well controlled in the large majority of patients, and only minimal side effects were observed. PATIENTS: Eight patients (5 with essential thrombocythemia, 2 with chronic granulocytic leukemia, and 1 with idiopathic myelofibrosis) received anagrelide (induction dose 4 mg/die; mean maintenance dose 2 mg/die; mean observation time 26 weeks). Complete blood counts were determined 4 times during the first month, and subsequently every month. ""In vivo"" and ""ex vivo"" platelet function was studied before anagrelide and after 4 and 10 days of therapy. RESULTS: Platelet count was reduced and maintained below 500 x 10(9)/L in 5 of 8 patients. Headache, palpitation/tachycardia, gastrointestinal symptoms and a decrease in hemoglobin were the side effects. Anagrelide did not modify the leukocyte count or ""in vivo""/""ex vivo"" platelet function.

Peripheral blood neutrophil and blast cell count was monitored daily. Changes in marrow blast cell morphologic features, mitotic index, and the reactivity to a panel of monoclonal antibodies were assessed after 3 and 7 days of treatment. RESULTS: Peripheral blood neutrophil and blast cell count increased in 6/7 cases. The mitotic index of marrow cells increased in 6/7 cases.

A number of studies have, however, failed to demonstrate this finding. Here we report the molecular rearrangements of 107 patients and their clinical follow-up. METHODS: Localization of the breakpoints was determined according to conventional criteria, after digestion with 2 to 4 restriction endonucleases and hybridization with 1 or 2 molecular probes. RESULTS: Sixty two patients were rearranged in the 5' area and 45 in the 3' area: there was no difference between the survival curves of the two groups, at least not after 3 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The site of the breakpoint within the M-BCR has no prognostic significance in our series.","['Zaccaria, A', 'Martinelli, G', 'Buzzi, M', 'Zuffa, E', 'Zamagni, M D', 'Testoni, N', 'Russo, D', 'Guerrasio, A', 'Saglio, G', 'Tura, S']","['Zaccaria A', 'Martinelli G', 'Buzzi M', 'Zuffa E', 'Zamagni MD', 'Testoni N', 'Russo D', 'Guerrasio A', 'Saglio G', 'Tura S']","['Centro di Genetica Oncologica, Universita di Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1992 Jan-Feb;77(1):16-20.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency of abnormalities varied among the subtypes: 1/2 in refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts; 18/24 in refractory anaemia; 5/6 in refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB); and 2/2 in refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in transformation. The most frequent abnormalities, either single, double or complex defects, were -5/5q-, -7, +8 and +21; 16q-/16p-, +19 and -X were also common. The percentage of aneuploid cells, in particular hypodiploid cells, was increased. The abnormalities were detected more frequently in complex aberrations associated with RAEB and RAEB in transformation. The presence of -5/5q- as a sole aberration was associated with longer mean survival time (greater than 18 months) but multiple (more than two) chromosomal abnormalities were associated with a poorer prognosis and a mean survival time of only 7.5 months. Chromosome follow-up studies indicated that patients with -7, +8, +21, -X and complex defects, increased hypodiploid cells and karyotpic evolution were likely to have a high risk of transformation to leukaemia or to a more severe subtype of MDS with a short overall mean survival time. These defects, mostly of the deleted type, are assumed to play a specific role in the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia.

This review first summarizes the findings of these studies as they pertain to dental radiology, then uses their concepts in combination with dosimetry from the dental literature to estimate the radiation risk from dental radiology. Estimation of risk from groups of exposed individuals requires use of mathematical models that fit the epidemiological data. The ICRP estimates that a single brief whole-body exposure of 1 Gy to 10,000 people results in about 500 additional cancer deaths over the lifetime of the exposed individuals, assuming a dose rate effectiveness factor of 2 for cancers other than leukaemia. Leukaemias are seen as a wave from 5 to 30 years following exposure. Cancers other than leukaemia typically start to appear about 10 years following exposure and remain in excess for as long as most exposed populations are followed, presumably for the lifetime of the exposed individuals. The gonadal dose is so small from dental radiography that the risk of heritable defects is negligible in comparison with the somatic risk. The dental literature contains several studies reporting sufficient dosimetric data for radiosensitive sites in the head and neck to allow estimation of the risk of fatal cancers from intra-oral and panoramic radiography. The highest estimated risks (using the ICRP data) are for leukaemia (bone marrow), thyroid and bone surface cancer. The total risk is estimated to be 2.5 fatal malignancies per 10(6) full-mouth examinations made with D-speed film and round collimation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['White, S C']",['White SC'],"['School of Dentistry, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Dentomaxillofac Radiol,Dento maxillo facial radiology,7609576,,"['Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Radiography, Dental/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1259/dmfr.21.3.1397466 [doi]'],ppublish,Dentomaxillofac Radiol. 1992 Aug;21(3):118-26. doi: 10.1259/dmfr.21.3.1397466.,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that treatment of the T-cell leukemia line Jurkat with SK&F 96365 inhibited the Ca2+ influx triggered by antibodies against the CD3/TCR complex, while the inositol trisphosphate-dependent Ca2+ release from intracellular stores remained intact. A 50% inhibition of the Ca2+ influx was obtained with 5 microM SK&F 96365, while higher concentrations of the drug blocked the CD3-dependent Ca2+ influx completely. In addition to its blocking of the Ca2+ influx, treatment with SK&F 96365 was found to accumulate mitotic cells. The drug (5 microM) imposed a total cell cycle arrest in G2/M. The mitosis block could be reversed by removal of the inhibitor from the cultures, while elevation of intracellular or extracellular Ca2+ did not restore cell cycle progression. This suggests that the cell cycle block induced by SK&F 96365 is not directly related to its action as an inhibitor of receptor-mediated calcium entry. Our findings indicate that SK&F 96365, in addition to its ability to inhibit receptor-triggered Ca2+ influx, offers a new method for imposing a reversible mitosis arrest in hematopoietic cell lines.","['Nordstrom, T', 'Nevanlinna, H A', 'Andersson, L C']","['Nordstrom T', 'Nevanlinna HA', 'Andersson LC']","['Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(92)90103-F [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(92)90103-f [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1992 Oct;202(2):487-94. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(92)90103-f.,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Imidazoles)', 'I61V87164A (1-(2-(3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy)-4-methoxyphenylethyl)-1H-imidazole)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used gel shift and transfection assays to demonstrate that the GATA motif in the SCL promoter binds GATA-1 (and GATA-2), and also mediates transcriptional transactivation. To identify a role for SCL in erythroid differentiation, we generated stable transfectants of MEL and K562 (a human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line that can differentiate along the erythroid pathway) cells overexpressing wild-type, antisense or mutant SCL cDNA. Increasing the level of SCL expression in two independent MEL lines (F4-6 and C19, a 745 derivative) and K562 cells increased the rate of spontaneous (i.e. in the absence of inducer) erythroid differentiation. Conversely, induced differentiation was inhibited in MEL transfectants expressing either antisense SCL cDNA or a mutant SCL lacking the basic domain.

In the majority of cells, v-abl causes a growth arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle; while in a minority of cells, v-abl abrogates the requirement for growth factors. Using temperature sensitive mutants, it can be demonstrated that v-Abl tyrosine kinase is required for growth inhibition or stimulation. The two phenotypes are not caused by mutations or differences in the expression of v-Abl, but are dependent on the cell context. Two stable subclones of NIH3T3 cells have been isolated that exhibit similar morphology and growth characteristics. However, upon infection with A-MuLV, the 'positive' cells become serum- and anchorage-independent, whereas the 'negative' cells become arrested in G1. The positive phenotype is dominant, shown by cell fusion, and treatment with 5-azacytidine converts the negative cells to the positive phenotype. Activation of v-Abl tyrosine kinase induces the serum-responsive genes in the positive but not in the negative cells.

Low prevalences of CRS were observed in northeastern Japan, and high prevalences in southwestern Japan, with the highest in Okinawa. These conditions could be explained by the lower rate of rubella H1 antibody in the female population of southwestern Japan. Time of maternal rubella was in the gestational age interval from 26 to 57 days for cataract, from 25 to 62 days for heart disease and from 16 to 131 days for deafness. HTLV-1 is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia. Main route of transmission of this virus is mother-to-child transmission, through breast milk. Among the 311 mother-child pairs in Okinawa, 65 mothers (20.9%) and 10 children (3.2%) were seropositive for HTLV-1. Ten (15.4%) of the 65 seropositive mothers had seropositive children.

We have developed a murine model to study the effect of daily cocaine administration and retrovirus infection on the lymphoid cell populations of the thymus. C57BL/6 female mice were studied following chronic cocaine administration for 11 weeks with simultaneous LP-BM5 MuLV infection. Cocaine administration reduced body and thymus weight, significantly reduced the number of CD8+ cells in the thymus, and partially prevented thymus enlargement due to lymphoid cell proliferation induced by LP-BM5 MuLV infection. Retrovirus infection was associated with a decrease in the percentage and absolute number of Thy 1.2+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in the thymus, an effect potentiated by cocaine administration. Therefore cocaine impairs thymic function by altering the number of cells expressing T cell differentiation markers in MAIDS.","['Lopez, M C', 'Colombo, L L', 'Huang, D S', 'Wang, Y', 'Watson, R R']","['Lopez MC', 'Colombo LL', 'Huang DS', 'Wang Y', 'Watson RR']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, Arizona Health Sciences Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['AA08037/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA 04827/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Cell Count', 'Cocaine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*blood', 'Organ Size', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects/microbiology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Time Factors']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0090-1229(92)90246-k [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1992 Oct;65(1):45-52. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(92)90246-k.,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'I5Y540LHVR (Cocaine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that the macrophages can produce formazan at a high level, which can interfere with the final results of a direct MTT assay. The new indirect MTT assay can avoid such interference because the effectors are separated from the targets before the assay is performed, so the real viability of the targets is reflected. An indirect MTT assay, as developed in this study, could be better than the direct assay for examining the suppressive effect of activated macrophages on non-adherent tumour cells in vitro.

Twenty-six patients with hematological malignancies and 2 metastatic melanoma patients in a progressive stage were enrolled in this clinical trial. Of the 26 patients, 24 were at a stage of minimal residual disease, including 14 patients who had received autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) 2-5 months previously, 7 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and 3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.

Spontaneous killing activity was low prior to treatment, but increased upon termination of treatment in 10/15 evaluated cycels. rIL-2-activated cytotoxicity in vitro was markedly elevated in 8/12 and 6/8 patients after one and two cycles, respectively, of sequential treatment, as well as in 3/8 CML and 5/6 patients after one and two cycles, respectively, of concomitant treatment. Activation of the T cell mitogenic response was demonstrated in 6/9 patients after concomitant CMI, while no such effect was observed throughout a sequential treatment in lymphoma and leukemia patients after ABMT. Although a direct correlation between immune stimulation and the in vivo antitumor response cannot yet be determined, our clinical observations support a beneficial therapeutic effect in a substantial number of patients.

The primary mechanism of action is unknown but effects on membrane biology are documented. We have studied the effect of two ether lipids on membrane lipids and examined the hypothesis that membrane peroxidative damage may be involved in their mechanism of action. With the use of cells having membranes enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids of the omega-3 family of fatty acids, we have demonstrated that the prototypical ether lipid 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine and a thioether lipid analogue, 1-O-hexadecylmercapto-2-methoxymethyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine , increase membrane lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity in a time- and drug concentration-dependent manner. The oxidative cofactors Fe2+ and ascorbic acid were required. The pattern of cell death did not fully correspond to the peroxidation, since cofactors were required for peroxidation but not cytotoxicity. However, the rate of decrease in cell viability after exposure to the drug and cofactors corresponded to the peroxidation rate. In addition, when L1210 cells modified with the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid or unmodified cells were used, there was no ether lipid-enhanced peroxidation, and the cells were significantly less sensitive to the drug, with or without cofactors. The lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin E inhibited 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine peroxidation and cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of cofactors but not consistently without them. Depletion of cellular glutathione content of L1210 cells using L-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine resulted in 40% augmentation of cofactor-facilitated cytotoxicity of 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine and a borderline effect on peroxidation. Another ether lipid, the thio compound 1-O-hexadecylmercapto-2-methoxymethyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine , enhanced peroxidation in the presence of cofactors with kinetics corresponding to those of cytotoxicity. In the presence of ether lipid and cofactors the intensity of ascorbate free radical increased, consistent with oxidative stress. We conclude that the ether lipids stimulate membrane lipid peroxidation in a time- and drug concentration-dependent manner in the presence of oxidative cofactors. Even though peroxidation may not fully explain the cytotoxic effect of the ether lipid class of anticancer drugs, this observation provides further information on the nature of the membrane damage induced by the drugs.

H-ras mRNA levels showed a dramatic decrease in K562 cells subjected to erythroid and myelomonocytic differentiation. The same result was found at the protein level for p21H-ras. Expression of K-ras and N-ras in K562 cells also decreased with differentiation, although significant mRNA levels remained despite cessation of cell proliferation. The decrease in K-ras expression was greater for TPA-treated cells than for 1-beta-arabinofuranosylcytosine-treated cells. TPA-induced myelomonocytic differentiation in HEL cells also resulted in a dramatic down-regulation of H-ras mRNA levels.

Moreover, the influence of NH4Cl and monensin on these processes was studied. Based on protein synthesis inhibition ([3H]leucine incorporation), it appeared that cytotoxicity was not fully expressed directly after exposure to IT due to a delay in either the internalization of membrane-bound IT or the action of intracellular ricin A. Varying the duration of incubation and postponing [3H]leucine addition for up to 24 h after initiation showed that cytotoxicity occurred in two phases, rapid internalization of initially bound IT followed by a continuous but slower uptake, possibly due to reexpression of the CD3 antigen. No differences were found in the rate of internalization and degradation of 125I-labeled WT32 and WT32-ricin A. Internalization started rapidly after binding at 37 degrees C, was fastest during the first 12 h (+/- 360,000 molecules/cell), and continued for at least 24 h (+/- 420,000 molecules/cell). Exocytosis of intracellularly degraded molecules became measurable after 1 to 2 h of incubation at 37 degrees C and increased to approximately 400,000 molecules/cell in 24 h. After 4 h of incubation at 37 degrees C the number of internalized molecules exceeded the amount of WT32 that could maximally bind to the cell membrane (+/- 150,000 molecules/cell), confirming reexpression of antigen. The addition of NH4Cl and monensin enhanced the cytotoxicity of WT32-ricin A, probably due to an increased intracellular amount of IT. These agents appeared to reduce strongly the degradation of internalized WT32, resulting in an accumulation of intracellular molecules. NH4Cl was most effective during the first 12 h of incubation, whereas monensin increased the amount of intracellular WT32 molecules after 2 to 24 h. Our observations suggest that incubation conditions for the optimal cytotoxicity of IT treatment can be predicted by studying the internalization and degradation of the IT or respective monoclonal antibody.","['van Oosterhout, Y V', 'Preijers, F W', 'Wessels, H M', 'de Witte, T']","['van Oosterhout YV', 'Preijers FW', 'Wessels HM', 'de Witte T']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital St. Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/therapy', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Ricin/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Nov 1;52(21):5921-5.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have compared the relative abilities of these inhibitors to reduce the toxicity of in vitro exposures to tubercidin against clonogenic progenitor cells of normal human bone marrow (CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, CFU-GM) and of two leukemic human cell lines (HL-60/C1, CCRF-CEM) that differ in their expression of transporter subtypes. Short (1-h) exposures to 1 microM tubercidin alone inhibited colony formation (a) of normal human hematopoietic progenitors (CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, CFU-GM) by 100%, and (b) of HL-60/C1 and CCRF-CEM cells by > 90%. Pretreatment (30 min) with nitrobenzylthioinosine, dilazep, or dipyridamole followed by simultaneous treatment (1 h) with these transport inhibitors during tubercidin exposures reduced toxicity against hematopoietic progenitors and cell lines. Greater reductions of toxicity were consistently seen with bone marrow progenitors and CCRF-CEM cells than with HL-60/C1 cells. For CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-GM cells, reductions in tubercidin toxicity of 50-100% were achieved at these concentrations: > or = 0.1 microM (nitrobenzylthioinosine); > or = 0.1 microM (dilazep); and > or = 3.0 microM (dipyridamole). Pretreatment (30 min) followed by simultaneous treatment (1 h) with any of the transport inhibitors (> or = 0.1 microM) and 0.1 microM [3H]-tubercidin blocked the uptake of radioactivity completely in CCRF-CEM cells and only partially in HL-60/C1 cells. These effects, which were consistent with the nucleoside transport phenotypes of CCRF-CEM cells (inhibitor-sensitive) and HL-60/C1 cells (inhibitor-sensitive and inhibitor-resistant), suggested that protection was due to the inhibition of tubercidin uptake via equilibrative nucleoside transport system(s). Light-density mononuclear cells from human bone marrow, of which the clonogenic progenitors represented only a minor (< 0.01%) subpopulation, possessed far fewer nitrobenzylthioinosine-binding sites (2 x 10(4) sites/cell, Kd = 0.7 nM) than either HL-60/C1 cells (1.7 x 10(5) sites/cell, Kd = 0.9 nM) or CCRF-CEM cells (3.3 x 10(5) sites/cell, Kd = 0.5 nM). Initial rates of uptake of 1 microM [3H]adenosine (0-6 s, 20 degrees C) by human bone marrow mononuclear cells were reduced partially by 0.1 microM inhibitor (nitrobenzylthioinosine > dipyridamole > dilazep) and completely by 10 microM inhibitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Cass, C E', 'King, K M', 'Montano, J T', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, A']","['Cass CE', 'King KM', 'Montano JT', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine/pharmacokinetics', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dilazep/*pharmacology', 'Dipyridamole/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Thioinosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tubercidin/adverse effects/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Nov 1;52(21):5879-86.,"['46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'F8KLC2BD5Z (Dilazep)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mouse Fli-1 was shown to be involved in 75% erythroleukemias induced by Friend murine leukemia virus suggesting the possibility that Fli-1 may play a critical role in cellular transformation. Since Fli-1 maps to the mouse chromosome region syntenic with human chromosome 11q23-24, it is tempting to speculate that human Fli-1 may be involved in human sarcomas, leukemias, and lymphomas involving human chromosome 11q23-24. We have isolated complementary DNA clones representing the human homologue of Fli-1 gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the human Fli-1 gene codes for a 452-residue protein the predicted amino sequence of which shows 80% homology to the human erg-2 protein previously described. A 3.5-kilobase transcript of the human Fli-1 gene was observed in different cells. Sequence analysis revealed two domains of ets homology, one at the 5' and the other at the 3' end of the Fli-1 gene. This 3'-ets homology domain, which is mainly responsible for DNA binding activity, is seen in all the ets family members; however, the 5'-ets homology region is conserved in only five genes, Fli-1, c-ets-1, ets-2, GABP-alpha, and erg, suggesting a common biological function which is shared among these genes. Interestingly, mouse and human Fli-1 transcripts contain highly homologous 5'-untranslated region suggesting that this conserved region may play an important role in the posttranscriptional regulation of the Fli-1 transcript.","['Prasad, D D', 'Rao, V N', 'Reddy, E S']","['Prasad DD', 'Rao VN', 'Reddy ES']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Jefferson Cancer Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107-5541.']",['eng'],['CA 57157/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Oct 15;52(20):5833-7.,['0 (Viral Structural Proteins)'],,"['Fli-1', 'PU.1', 'Spi-1', 'erg-2', 'ets']",,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S44781', 'GENBANK/S44786', 'GENBANK/S44787', 'GENBANK/S45205', 'GENBANK/S72766', 'GENBANK/S72767', 'GENBANK/S72768', 'GENBANK/S72769', 'GENBANK/S72771', 'GENBANK/X63098']",,,,

In addition to confirming the diagnosis, the pattern of virus distribution, utilized recently in studies of Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus-6-associated lymphoma, has suggested which tumors are more likely to have the virus playing a passenger role (virus detected in uninvolved tissues) and in which tumors the virus may have an etiological role (virus restricted to tumor cells).

The most frequently observed genetic abnormalities among the malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are translocations, which appear to be lineage and, to a large extent, lymphoma specific. Recombinases that normally mediate the process of antigen receptor gene rearrangement appear to have an important (but not exclusive) role in the mediation of these translocations and of other types of gene fusion (e.g., deletion of intervening DNA). Frequently, such fusions result in the increased or inappropriate expression of crucially important proteins, many of which are transcription factors that regulate the expression of other genes. These abnormalities, however, do not appear to be sufficient to induce lymphoma, and it is likely that the additional genetic lesions required differ from one tumor to another. The likelihood of any given clone of cells accumulating a sufficient number of relevant genetic lesions to give rise to a lymphoma is probably a function of its life span. Prolonged survival of a cell clone may be mediated by viral genomes (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus and human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1), by the abnormal expression of cellular genes that inhibit apoptosis (e.g., bcl-2), or by the mutation or deletion of cellular genes that are necessary for apoptosis, e.g., p53. The background rate at which genetic lesions occur is amplified by the interaction of inherited and environmental factors, the latter appearing to be the major determinant of incidence rates. However, inherited factors that influence lymphomagenesis, including variability in the ability to repair DNA damage or in the fidelity of antigen receptor recombinases for their signal sequences, may be crucial determinants of which particular individuals in a given environmental setting develop lymphoma.","['Magrath, I']",['Magrath I'],"['Lymphoma Biology Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Humans', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/*genetics']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Oct 1;52(19 Suppl):5529s-5540s.,,,"['bcl-2', 'c-myc', 'p53', 'tax']",73,,,,,,,,,,,

This leukemia is ultimately observed in the peritoneal cavity as an ascites with cells infiltrating the granulomatous tissue. It has been proposed, however, that hematopoietic organs such as the spleen and bone marrow are involved in preleukemic development of Moloney murine leukemia. Therefore, to determine if the spleen plays a role in this development, mice were splenectomized at various times relative to virus inoculation. When splenectomies were performed 3 days before and 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after virus inoculation there was, in all cases, a decreased death rate compared to sham-splenectomized controls. The greatest difference in death rate due to promonocytic leukemia was observed when mice were splenectomized at 4 weeks after virus inoculation. The decrease in disease incidence observed as a result of splenectomy was not caused by decreased virus spread in hematopoietic organs or an alteration in the profile of the cellular infiltrate in the granuloma. It was found, however, that the spleens of 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane-treated mice, relative to those of normal mice, have a significantly increased number of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells and a slightly increased number of multipotential colony-forming cells. These observations suggest that a population of target cells for transformation, consisting of granulocyte-macrophage precursor cells, may reside in the spleen. Alternatively, partially transformed cells may reside temporarily in the spleen during the developmental stages of the disease process.","['Nason-Burchenal, K', 'Wolff, L']","['Nason-Burchenal K', 'Wolff L']","['Biology Department, Catholic University of America, Washington, DC 20064.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['3T3 Cells/microbiology', 'Animals', 'Ascites/etiology/microbiology', 'Granuloma/chemically induced', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Inflammation/blood/chemically induced/complications', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/etiology/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/etiology/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Peritoneal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Peritonitis/chemically induced/complications/microbiology', 'Preleukemia/blood/etiology/*microbiology', 'Spleen/pathology/*physiology', 'Splenectomy', 'Terpenes', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Oct 1;52(19):5317-22.,"['0 (Terpenes)', '26HZV48DT1 (pristane)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance-conferring cellular defenses against the cytotoxic effects of MC540/photodynamic therapy have not been well characterized. This study focuses on the cytoprotective effects of the glutathione-dependent selenoperoxidases GPX and PHGPX, which can detoxify a wide variety of hydroperoxides, including lipid-derived species (LOOHs). Murine leukemia L1210 cells were grown in 1% serum media without [L.Se(-)] and with [L.Se(+)] selenium supplementation. L.Se(-) cells expressed 10- to 20-fold lower GPX and PHGPX activities than L.Se(+) controls and were markedly more sensitive to MC540-mediated photoperoxidation (LOOH formation) and clonally assessed photokilling. Susceptibility of L.Se(-) cells to photoperoxidation and photokilling could be fully reversed to L.Se(+) levels by replenishing Se, and partially reversed by treating with Ebselen, a selenoperoxidase mimetic. Altered lipid composition, greater uptake of MC540, and defective catabolism of H2O2 were all ruled out as possible factors in the elevated photosensitivity of L.Se(-) cells. Human leukemia K562 cells (capable of expressing PHGPX but not GPX) exhibited 5- to 10-fold lower PHGPX activity under Se-deficient relative to Se-sufficient conditions. Although MC540 uptake (nmol/mg lipid) by K562 and L1210 cells was essentially the same, the former were more resistant to photoinactivation. However, like murine counterparts, Se-deficient cells were more susceptible to photoperoxidation and photokilling than Se-sufficient controls. These results clearly demonstrate that GPX and/or PHGPX in L1210 cells and PHGPX in K562 cells play an important cytoprotective role during photooxidative stress. Whether membrane damage due to lipid photoperoxidation is causally related to cell death is not certain; however, the parallel effects of Se deficiency on LOOH formation and cell killing are at least consistent with this possibility.","['Lin, F', 'Geiger, P G', 'Girotti, A W']","['Lin F', 'Geiger PG', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],['I-PO1-CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Azoles/pharmacology', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Glutathione/deficiency', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoindoles', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Organoselenium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Radiation Tolerance/drug effects', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Selenium/deficiency']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Oct 1;52(19):5282-90.,"['0 (Azoles)', '0 (Isoindoles)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '40X2P7DPGH (ebselen)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'EC 1.11.1.12 (Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This change did not affect drug sensitivity. The drug-resistant HL-60/AR cells examined in 1986, 1987, and 1991 demonstrated a very stable karyotype. The most striking feature was a large homogeneously staining region in the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q11.2), and translocation of the remainder of the long arm to another centromere. Other changes in the HL-60/AR cells included inversion in 9q, partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 10p, addition of material to the p arm of der(16), loss of chromosome 22, and the appearance of a new marker chromosome. Both HL-60/S and the HL-60/AR cells were found not to amplify DNA or mRNA sequences coding for the Pgp.

In the present study we investigated leukemic hairy cells (HC) for the presence of the p75 IL-2R chain which binds IL-2 with intermediate affinity and plays a crucial role in transducing the message to the cell. For this purpose, we tested highly enriched leukemic HC from six hairy cell leukemia patients for the presence of IL-2R transcripts and for the expression of the p55 and p75 IL-2R chains on their surface membrane by flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation analyses. The functional role of IL-2 in the regulation of HC proliferation was also investigated. Our results indicate that freshly isolated HC express detectable messages for both the p75 IL-2R and the p55 IL-2R. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated detectable levels of p75 IL-2R on the HC from all patients tested. A mixture of two specific mAb was able to immunoprecipitate detectable amounts of p75 IL-2R from leukemic HC. When leukemic HC were cultured in the presence of several concentrations of IL-2 a low proliferative response was observed. Moreover, the IL-2-driven proliferation of HC was markedly inhibited by anti-p75 IL-2R mAb and to a lesser extent by anti-p55 IL-2R mAb. These findings provide direct evidence of the expression of different IL-2 receptors on leukemic HC and suggest that these molecules might play a role in leukemic cell growth.","['Trentin, L', 'Zambello, R', 'Benati, C', 'Cassatella, M', 'Agostini, C', 'Bulian, P', 'Adami, F', 'Carra, G', 'Pizzolo, G', 'Semenzato, G']","['Trentin L', 'Zambello R', 'Benati C', 'Cassatella M', 'Agostini C', 'Bulian P', 'Adami F', 'Carra G', 'Pizzolo G', 'Semenzato G']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, Padua University School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precipitin Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Oct 1;52(19):5223-8.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the prognostic value of the growth fraction in non-Hodgkin lymphoma of Waldeyer ring (W-NHL) and the nasal cavity (N-NHL), the authors applied Ki-67 immunostaining combined with image analysis on such lymphomas. METHODS: The authors studied 29 patients (18 with W-NHL and 11 with N-NHL), applying Ki-67 to frozen sections. The number of Ki-67-positive cells in a unit area (0.044 mm2), as an indicator of proliferative activity, and the mean area per Ki-67-positive cell (microns2), as an indicator of DNA content, were measured by the image processing system. RESULTS: High-grade lymphomas showed a significantly larger number of Ki-67-positive cells than intermediate-grade lymphomas (102.5 +/- 21.6 in high-grade and 46.8 +/- 8.92 in intermediate-grade lymphomas, P = 0.03), even when analyzed separately by immunophenotypes. A large mean area per Ki-67-positive cell was associated significantly with a T-cell phenotype (36.3 +/- 7.69 microns2 in T-cell lymphomas and 19.4 +/- 2.33 microns2 in B-cell lymphomas, P = 0.034) and an unfavorable clinical outcome. High proliferative activity, defined as nuclear Ki-67 expression in 2000 or more B-cell lymphoma cells and 1000 or more T-cell lymphoma cells in a 1-mm2 area, was found to be a strong predictor of poor survival among these patients (P = 0.048 and P = 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Ki-67 immunostaining, combined with image analysis, is a novel method for determining a tumor proliferative index that provides useful clinical data regarding head and neck lymphomas.","['Yamanaka, N', 'Harabuchi, Y', 'Kataura, A']","['Yamanaka N', 'Harabuchi Y', 'Kataura A']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Sapporo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Nucleolus/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasal Cavity/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nose Neoplasms/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Tonsillar Neoplasms/*pathology/physiopathology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19921101)70:9<2342::aid-cncr2820700922>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Nov 1;70(9):2342-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19921101)70:9<2342::aid-cncr2820700922>3.0.co;2-6.,"['0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the degree to which such impairment is attributable to the procedure or is a condition existing before BMT is not known. METHODS: The presence, nature, and correlates of neuropsychologic impairment were investigated in 55 adult BMT candidates, all of whom had a malignant condition. Impairment was assessed using a screening battery of standardized neuropsychologic tests. RESULTS: Results indicated that: (1) neuropsychologic performance was associated with specific disease and treatment risk factors, in particular a history of cranial radiation or central nervous system disease treated with intrathecal chemotherapy; (2) performance on tests reflecting memory or higher cognitive processing was more likely to be impaired; and (3) the risk of impairment increased as the number of disease and treatment risk factors for cognitive impairment in the patient increased. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that neuropsychologic impairment occurs in a significant minority of adult patients before BMT. Research is necessary to determine the extent to which such impairment significantly compromises patients' abilities to: (1) make decisions regarding undergoing BMT or participating in research protocols and (2) understand and execute self-care behaviors after BMT. More broadly, greater attention should be devoted to investigating the presence of long-term neuropsychologic impairment in adult patients with cancer.","['Andrykowski, M A', 'Schmitt, F A', 'Gregg, M E', 'Brady, M J', 'Lamb, D G', 'Henslee-Downey, P J']","['Andrykowski MA', 'Schmitt FA', 'Gregg ME', 'Brady MJ', 'Lamb DG', 'Henslee-Downey PJ']","['Department of Behavioral Science, Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, Lexington, Kentucky.']",['eng'],['RR05374/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Attention', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cognition Disorders/*etiology', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Memory', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychology', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Regression Analysis', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19921101)70:9<2288::aid-cncr2820700913>3.0.co;2-m [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Nov 1;70(9):2288-97. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19921101)70:9<2288::aid-cncr2820700913>3.0.co;2-m.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B.,2214-24,"BACKGROUND: The long-term psychosocial adaptations of 273 survivors of advanced Hodgkin disease were assessed to determine the nature and extent of problems experienced and to identify those at high risk for maladaptation. METHODS: Hodgkin disease survivors were identified who initially had been treated in clinical trials within the Cancer and Leukemia Group B from 1966 to 1986, were currently disease free, and had completed treatment for a minimum of 1 year. All survivors had advanced Hodgkin disease (with disease diagnosed at a mean age of 28 years). Survivors were at a mean age of 37 years at the time of interview (6.3 years after treatment completion), and 60% were male. Survivors were interviewed over the telephone 7-10 days after questionnaires were mailed to them concerning their psychological, social, vocational, and sexual functioning. RESULTS: Psychological distress was found to be elevated by one standard deviation (SD) above that of healthy subjects on the Brief Symptom Inventory, and 22% met the criterion suggested for a psychiatric diagnosis. In addition, the following problems were reported by survivors to be a consequence of having had Hodgkin disease: denial of life (31%) and health (22%) insurance, sexual problems (37%), conditioned nausea in response to reminders of chemotherapy (39%), and a negative socioeconomic effect (36%). Survivors found to be at high risk for maladaptation were: men earning less than $15,000 per year or who were currently unemployed; unmarried individuals; those with serious illnesses since treatment completion; and those who were less educated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that including a routine assessment of these factors would help to target survivors in need of additional evaluation and treatment.","['Kornblith, A B', 'Anderson, J', 'Cella, D F', 'Tross, S', 'Zuckerman, E', 'Cherin, E', 'Henderson, E', 'Weiss, R B', 'Cooper, M R', 'Silver, R T']","['Kornblith AB', 'Anderson J', 'Cella DF', 'Tross S', 'Zuckerman E', 'Cherin E', 'Henderson E', 'Weiss RB', 'Cooper MR', 'Silver RT', 'et al.']","['Psychiatry Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York City, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['CA 03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*mortality/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress, Psychological/*psychology']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19921015)70:8<2214::aid-cncr2820700833>3.0.co;2-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Oct 15;70(8):2214-24. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19921015)70:8<2214::aid-cncr2820700833>3.0.co;2-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven hundred fifty-two of 779 children treated for ALL entered complete remission. The mean follow-up time for the 752 patients was 4.4 years. Two children had AML develop 12 and 13 months after the diagnosis of ALL, respectively. METHODS: The estimated overall risk of secondary AML was calculated for the patient population as instances per 1000 patient-years of follow-up. This was compared with recent reported cases from another institution. RESULTS: The estimated overall risk of secondary AML was 0.61 instances per 1000 patient-years of follow-up (95% confidence interval: 0.15, 4.4). The difference between the risk of 0.61 among DFCI patients versus previously reported risk of 5.8 among a differently treated group of patients with ALL was statistically significant (P = 0.0008). No epipodophyllotoxin was used in the patients in the DFCI consortium. In contrast, an epipodophyllotoxin was used in 12 of 13 previously reported patients who had secondary AML develop. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that the use of epipodophyllotoxins may be associated with an increased risk of having secondary AML develop in patients with ALL.","['Kreissman, S G', 'Gelber, R D', 'Cohen, H J', 'Clavell, L A', 'Leavitt, P', 'Sallan, S E']","['Kreissman SG', 'Gelber RD', 'Cohen HJ', 'Clavell LA', 'Leavitt P', 'Sallan SE']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['CA 06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19921015)70:8<2208::aid-cncr2820700832>3.0.co;2-p [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Oct 15;70(8):2208-13. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19921015)70:8<2208::aid-cncr2820700832>3.0.co;2-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a possible association is reported between HCL and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC). METHODS: A retrospective study of the case records of 50 patients with HCL in a study of alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) treatment of HCL. RESULTS: Three of 50 patients with HCL studied had RCC, and 2 of these also had CRC. In addition, two other patients had CRC. The other malignant lesions developed either before or after the diagnosis of HCL. In all patients, the HCL responded to alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN), but in four patients, the second lesion was diagnosed during IFN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings could indicate that IFN does not correct a possible common basic etiologic defect and shows that even early CRC and RCC do not respond to the IFN doses administered. These findings should be considered in future trials of IFN treatment of these diseases. The authors also recommend a reevaluation of the frequency of second malignant lesions in HCL; this may be important particularly with the increased survival in patients with HCL who receive alpha-IFN treatment.","['Nielsen, B', 'Braide, I', 'Hasselbalch, H']","['Nielsen B', 'Braide I', 'Hasselbalch H']","['University Department of Medicine and Hematology, Aarhus Amtssygehus, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/complications', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Facial Neoplasms/complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*complications', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/therapy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19921015)70:8<2087::aid-cncr2820700813>3.0.co;2-p [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Oct 15;70(8):2087-90. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19921015)70:8<2087::aid-cncr2820700813>3.0.co;2-p.,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its use as marker in myeloid leukemia].,579-85,"A hyaluronan-binding protein fraction was isolated by affinity chromatography of peripheral human blood mononuclear cell culture medium through immobilized hyaluronan. The presence of a hyaluronan-binding protein similar to human brain hyaluronectin was demonstrated by (i) the ELISA method on hyaluronan-coated plastic plates using anti-hyaluronectin antibodies, (ii) the lowering of the elution volume of the protein on liquid gel chromatography in the presence of hyaluronan, (iii) the extinction of the reaction to human brain hyaluronectin when antibodies were absorbed out with monocyte hyaluronectin, (iv) western blotting with polyclonal and monoclonal anti-hyaluronectin antibodies. The hyaluronectin-producing cells were adherent (10 min., 37 degrees C) to plastic, esterase (+) and CD 14 (+) cells and had the morphology of monocytes. The protein expression was investigated in leukemic cells by means of the immunocytochemical method. Hyaluronectin expression was restricted to 4/12 of M4 and M5 types of acute myeloid leukemias. Other myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were negative. The results indicate that hyaluronectin can be produced under free form in the absence of hyaluronan, by human peripheral blood monocytes. It supports the hypothesis that the expression of hyaluronectin in tumour stroma could be due, at least in part, to inflammatory cells of the tumour. The expression of the protein by M4 and M5 acute myeloid leukemia cells suggests that hyaluronectin could be synthesized by immature cells of the monocytic lineage as well as by mature monocytes.","['Delpech, B', 'Girard, N', 'Vannier, J P', 'Tilly, H', 'Piguet, H']","['Delpech B', 'Girard N', 'Vannier JP', 'Tilly H', 'Piguet H']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie moleculaire, Centre Henri-Becquerel, Rouen.""]",['fre'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,C R Acad Sci III,"Comptes rendus de l'Academie des sciences.

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The British National Lymphoma Investigation (a collaborative group of over 60 participating centres in Britain treating lymphomas). PATIENTS: 2846 patients first treated for Hodgkin's disease during 1970-87, for whom follow up was complete in 99.8%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Second primary cancers; uniform pathology reviews confirmed the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease and of second primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. RESULTS: 113 second primary cancers occurred. Relative risk of cancer other than Hodgkin's disease was 2.7 (95% confidence interval 2.3 to 3.3) compared with the general population, with significant risk of leukaemia (16.0(9.1 to 26.0)); non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (16.8(9.8 to 26.9)); and cancers of the colon (3.2 (1.4 to 6.2)), lung (3.8 (2.6 to 5.4)), bone (15.1 (1.8 to 54.7)), and thyroid (9.4 (1.1 to 33.9)). Absolute excess risk associated with treatment was greater for solid tumours than for leukaemia and lymphomas. Relative risk of leukaemia increased soon after treatment, reaching a peak after five to nine years. It was increased substantially after chemotherapy (27.9 (12.7 to 52.9)), combined treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (21.5 (7.9 to 46.8)), and relative to number of courses of chemotherapy but was not significantly increased after radiotherapy (2.5 (0.1 to 14.1)). Relative risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma increased in the first five years after treatment and remained high but showed no clear relation with type or extent of treatment. Relative risk of solid tumours was less raised initially but increased throughout follow up and for lung cancer 10 years or more after entry was 8.3 (4.0 to 15.3). The risk of solid tumours increased after treatments including radiotherapy and after chemotherapy alone. The risk after chemotherapy increased significantly with time since first treatment. CONCLUSION: The risk of solid cancer, not of leukaemia, is the major long term hazard of treatment for Hodgkin's disease, and this seemed to apply after chemotherapy as well as after radiotherapy. These risks of second cancers are important in choice of treatment and in follow up of patients, but they are small compared with the great improvements in survival which have been brought about by modern therapeutic methods for Hodgkin's disease.","['Swerdlow, A J', 'Douglas, A J', 'Hudson, G V', 'Hudson, B V', 'Bennett, M H', 'MacLennan, K A']","['Swerdlow AJ', 'Douglas AJ', 'Hudson GV', 'Hudson BV', 'Bennett MH', 'MacLennan KA']","['Department of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alkylating Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Chlorambucil/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/adverse effects', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom']",1992/05/02 00:00,1992/05/02 00:01,['1992/05/02 00:00'],"['1992/05/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/02 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.304.6835.1137 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1992 May 2;304(6835):1137-43. doi: 10.1136/bmj.304.6835.1137.,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)']",,,,PMC1882078,,,,,,,,,,

Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels were found to be elevated at the time of diagnosis (median 23 mg/dl; 41% of patient group had levels greater than 25 mg/dl) and diminished after successful chemotherapeutic treatment in 9 of 10 cases, with a maximum decrease from 56 to 10 mg/dl. In contrast, reduced levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) (medians 137, 87 and 20 mg/dl, respectively) were observed at the time of diagnosis.

LAK activity was generated from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells cultured for 6 days with 1,000 U/ml recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2). Cytotoxicity was evaluated using a standard 4-hour chromium release assay. Susceptibility of leukemic cells to LAK was defined on the basis of the mean Cr release in 52 samples of normal bone marrow cells. Using allogeneic LAK, we examined leukemic cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood of 252 patients [102 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 99 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 13 with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC) and 38 with chronic leukemias of various types]. A significant lysis could be detected in 62% of all leukemias tested (in 68% of AML, 60% ALL, 92% CML-BC, 39% chronic leukemias). The mean chromium release (effector-to-target cell ratio 50:1) was 28.8 +/- 13.5% for LAK-sensitive leukemias versus 5.2 +/- 3.2% for resistant leukemias. We observed a distinct susceptibility of various leukemia subtypes. LAK cytotoxicity against autologous leukemia cells was examined in 40 leukemia patients in complete remission (24 AML, 16 ALL). 63% of the patients developed a significant cytotoxicity against their autologous leukemia cells. Regarding mean Cr releases, the efficiency of allogeneic LAK activity of normal donors did not differ significantly from that of autologous LAK activity of patients in complete remission against the same leukemic target cells. Analysis of our data revealed that examinations with allogeneic LAK activity make it possible to predict whether patients will develop significant in vitro killing of their autologous leukemia cells during complete remission. These results may be of particular importance in determining which patients could benefit from immunologic therapy modalities and in scheduling immunotherapy. Further clinical studies are necessary to ascertain the clinical significance of therapeutic approaches with IL-2 or adoptive cellular immunotherapy combined with IL-2 for treatment of human leukemia.","['Teichmann, J V', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Thiel, E']","['Teichmann JV', 'Ludwig WD', 'Thiel E']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Steglitz, Free University of Berlin, FRG.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Nat Immun,Natural immunity,9206126,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nat Immun. 1992 May-Jun;11(3):117-32.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a retrospective analysis was performed on 446 patients, from a single institution, who received transplants of marrow from HLA-identical siblings and the combination of cyclosporine (CSP) and methotrexate (MTX) to determine risk factors for acute GVHD associated with this more effective form of GVHD prophylaxis. The incidences of Grades II-IV and Grades III-IV (severe) acute GVHD were 35% and 16%, respectively. Increased clinical grades of acute GVHD in patients without advanced malignant disease were associated with a decreased survival. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the onset of Grades II-IV acute GVHD were sex mismatch and donor parity (P = .001), increased dose of total body irradiation (TBI) (P = .001), and reduction to less than 80% of the scheduled dose of MTX (P = .02) or CSP (P = .02). The multivariate analysis indicated a relative risk of 1.37 for acute GVHD in a group defined as having advanced malignant disease at transplant; however, this difference failed to reach conventional levels of statistical significance (P = .07). Reduction of MTX and CSP occurred in up to 36% and 44% of patients, respectively, primarily because of renal or hepatic dysfunction. The periods of increased risk for the onset of acute GVHD were up to 1 week after a reduction of MTX and 2 weeks after a reduction in CSP. When only patients who developed Grades II-IV acute GVHD were considered, the more severe acute GVHD of Grades III-IV was associated with increased patient age of 40 years or greater (P = .05) and dose reductions of CSP (P = .008). Serologic status of patient and donor for cytomegalovirus (CMV), HLA antigens in the A and B loci, and isolation in a laminar air flow room during marrow transplantation, all previously identified as risk factors for acute GVHD, were not confirmed as risk factors in this study population. The toxicity of MTX and CSP and the development of acute GVHD from inadequate immunosuppression because of dose reduction warrants further trials with potentially less toxic immunosuppressive agents. Risk factors for acute GVHD should be considered in clinical management and in the design of clinical trials.","['Nash, R A', 'Pepe, M S', 'Storb, R', 'Longton, G', 'Pettinger, M', 'Anasetti, C', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Bowden, R A', 'Deeg, H J', 'Doney, K']","['Nash RA', 'Pepe MS', 'Storb R', 'Longton G', 'Pettinger M', 'Anasetti C', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Bowden RA', 'Deeg HJ', 'Doney K', 'et al.']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclosporine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Hematologic Diseases/surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67552-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Oct 1;80(7):1838-45.,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['Blood. 1993 Apr 1;81(7):1972-4.

In addition, we have isolated cDNA clones from a t(8;21) AML cDNA library that contain fused sequences from chromosome 8 and 21. The chromosome 8 component, referred to as ETO (for eight twenty-one), is encoded over a large genomic region, as suggested by the analysis of corresponding yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). The DNA sequence of the chromosome 21 portion of the fusion transcript is derived from the normal AML1 gene. A striking similarity (67% identity over 387 bp, with a corresponding 69% amino acid identity) was detected between AML1 and the Drosophila segmentation gene, runt. The critical consequence of the translocation is the juxtaposition of 5' sequences of AML1 to 3' sequences of ETO, oriented telomere to centromere on the der(8) chromosome.","['Erickson, P', 'Gao, J', 'Chang, K S', 'Look, T', 'Whisenant, E', 'Raimondi, S', 'Lasher, R', 'Trujillo, J', 'Rowley, J', 'Drabkin, H']","['Erickson P', 'Gao J', 'Chang KS', 'Look T', 'Whisenant E', 'Raimondi S', 'Lasher R', 'Trujillo J', 'Rowley J', 'Drabkin H']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Health Sciences and Cancer Center, Denver 80262.']",['eng'],"['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01HD017449/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Drosophila/*genetics', 'Genomic Library', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Protein Kinases/genetics', 'Rats', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67550-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Oct 1;80(7):1825-31.,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",,"['AML1', 'ETO', 'runt']",,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S44625', 'GENBANK/S45790', 'GENBANK/S72766', 'GENBANK/S72767', 'GENBANK/S72768', 'GENBANK/S72769', 'GENBANK/S72771', 'GENBANK/X63096', 'GENBANK/X63097', 'GENBANK/X63098']",,,,

Using Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining, we have determined the temporal order of expression for C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP delta in differentiating myelomonocytic marrow cells. These studies show a unique temporal pattern of C/EBP isoform expression in the myeloid lineage. In particular, C/EBP alpha expression is very high in proliferative myelomonocytic cells, and diminishes during phenotypic maturation. While we have detected C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP delta in multiple myeloid leukemia cell lines, and C/EBP alpha in normal myeloid cells and in de novo human myeloid leukemias, we have not detected these C/EBP isoforms in either erythroid or lymphoid cells. Finally, we show that C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP delta protein and messenger RNA levels correlate in maturing granulocytic cells.

In situ hybridization was performed on metaphase cells from bone marrow of 17 leukemias and two cell lines with a variety of chromosome 11q23 abnormalities. It was established that in infant leukemias the translocations t(11;19), t(4;11), and t(5;11) had occurred in the region defined by YAC 13HH4. Additionally, the translocations t(4;11), t(6;11), t(9;11), t(X;11), and t(10;11) in other leukemias were found to disrupt the same region of chromosome 11q23, although an exception was found in one t(6;11) translocation for which the breakpoint was distal to the YAC. One patient had a t(9;11) translocation in a therapy-related leukemia, suggesting that this class of etoposide-related malignancy has similar breakpoints to those occurring in de novo leukemias. An example of a lymphoma-derived translocation t(4;11) was shown to involve a deletion of the region defined by YAC 13HH4. A leukemia with a deletion on chromosome 11 (q23-q25) was also studied and it was shown that the YAC sequence was unaffected. It was concluded that, with a few exceptions, the translocations at 11q23 in a wide range of acute infant and adult leukemias occur in a common region and may result from a common underlying mechanism.","['Kearney, L', 'Bower, M', 'Gibbons, B', 'Das, S', 'Chaplin, T', 'Nacheva, E', 'Chessells, J M', 'Reeves, B', 'Riley, J H', 'Lister, T A']","['Kearney L', 'Bower M', 'Gibbons B', 'Das S', 'Chaplin T', 'Nacheva E', 'Chessells JM', 'Reeves B', 'Riley JH', 'Lister TA', 'et al.']","[""ICRF Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Chromosomes, Fungal', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X Chromosome']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67528-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Oct 1;80(7):1659-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that in the selection of a strategy entailing combined use of cycle-specific drugs plus CSF to increase the antileukemic effectiveness of chemotherapy in AML, G-CSF is preferable to GM-CSF or IL-3, since it has fewer potential clinical side effects, and that, furthermore, DNR may be as useful as Ara-C.","['Waga, K', 'Furusawa, S', 'Nagashima, S', 'Saito, K', 'Shishido, H']","['Waga K', 'Furusawa S', 'Nagashima S', 'Saito K', 'Shishido H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Reference Values', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1992 Aug;56(1):17-27.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since cholesterol affects the fluidity of cell membranes, the inhibitory effect of cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) on HPD was similarly tested. FLC were induced with either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), hemin, or both. The cells responded to DMSO-treatment by the synthesis of a large amount of hemoglobin and a decrease in both the cell volume and rate of cell-growth. Hemin, on the other hand, did not drive FLC to synthesize hemoglobin and reduced only moderately the growth rate compared to untreated cultures. The combined effect of DMSO and hemin led to a profound inhibition of the growth rate, but did not increase the synthesis of hemoglobin compared to the level observed in cells treated with DMSO only. The binding property of HPD to FLC was also determined. DMSO-treatment significantly reduced the amount of HPD-binding, and combined treatment with DMSO and hemin resulted in even a lower level of HPD-binding. On the other hand, induced as well as non-induced cells showed the same sensitivity to photoactivated HPD when both DNA and protein synthesis were examined. Pretreatment of both differentiated and undifferentiated cells with CHS reduced the cytotoxicity of photoactivated HPD to the same level. We conclude that the decreased binding of HPD to differentiated cells is a result of a reduction in their cell volume. Thus, the differentiation process per se does not protect cells against the photodynamic effect of HPD. Moreover, CHS may act as a scavenger or first acceptor of singlet oxygen blocking the photodynamic effect.","['Lejbkowicz, F', 'Salzberg, S']","['Lejbkowicz F', 'Salzberg S']","['Department of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biomater Artif Cells Immobilization Biotechnol,"Biomaterials, artificial cells, and immobilization biotechnology : official journal of the International Society for Artificial Cells and Immobilization Biotechnology",9111988,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholesterol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematoporphyrin Derivative/*pharmacology/radiation effects', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10731199209119770 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomater Artif Cells Immobilization Biotechnol. 1992;20(2-4):1111-20. doi: 10.3109/10731199209119770.,"['0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '68335-15-9 (Hematoporphyrin Derivative)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'T3J4KS4201 (cholesteryl succinate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The A-LAK activity was generated promptly and from donors whose lymphocytes did not display any LAK activity. In comparison to LAK, a higher percentage of A-LAK expressed the CD25 and HLA class II (HLA-DR) activation-associated structures and high density of HLA class I antigens. Most striking, however, was the observation that lymphocytes from A-LAK cultures consistently contained a high density of CD2, CD11a, and CD18 adhesion molecules, as indicated cytometrically by their ""bright"" fluorescence intensity. Three color flow cytometric analysis indicated that virtually all CD56+,CD3- natural killer (NK) and CD56+,CD3+ T cells in unstimulated, LAK and A-LAK populations displayed this ""bright"" phenotype, while most CD56-,CD3+ T cells (with the exception of the small proportion found in A-LAK) were of the ""dim"" phenotype. The A-LAK cultures also contained a higher percentage of lymphocytes expressing CD11b (CR3 receptor) and CD54 (ICAM-1) antigens. The CD11a, CD18, and partially CD2 molecules were important in the A-LAK cytolytic mechanism against AML, since blocking of these structures with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) significantly decreased the antileukemia effect.

Efflux occurs primarily via a system which has a high sensitivity to prostaglandin A1, vincristine, reserpine, verapamil, and bromosulfophthalein, but evidence has also been obtained for a second efflux component with a lower response to these inhibitors. Pretreatment of L1210 cells with low concentrations of vincristine reduces methotrexate efflux by three fold and uncovers a second efflux component with an inhibitor specificity which is distinctly different from the primary efflux route. Vincristine treatment increased by 8-20-fold the concentration required for half-maximal efflux inhibition by prostaglandin A1, reserpine, bromosulfophthalein, and verapamil but had no effect on inhibition by probenecid, quinidine, or carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. A selective block in the primary efflux system and retention of the second component was also achieved in cells exposed to low concentrations of prostaglandin A1 or bromosulfophthalein. These results support prior conclusions that L1210 cells contain both a primary and secondary unidirectional efflux route for methotrexate. The second system has been difficult to detect and quantitate since it comprises only 25% of total unidirectional efflux and shows a relatively low response to various efflux inhibitors.","['Henderson, G B']",['Henderson GB'],"['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Probenecid/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins A/pharmacology', 'Quinidine/pharmacology', 'Reserpine/pharmacology', 'Sulfobromophthalein/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1992/10/05 00:00,1992/10/05 00:01,['1992/10/05 00:00'],"['1992/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(92)90350-U [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(92)90350-u [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1992 Oct 5;1110(2):137-43. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(92)90350-u.,"['0 (Prostaglandins A)', '0C2P5QKL36 (Sulfobromophthalein)', '555-60-2 (Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8B1QWR724A (Reserpine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)', 'VYR271N44P (prostaglandin A1)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carboplatin is a second-generation platinum compound that has demonstrated significant activity against acute leukemia, particularly when administered via continuous intravenous infusion in phase I clinical trials. Based on the preliminary reports of these trials, we designed a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of carboplatin via continuous infusion (300 mg/m2/d for 5 days) for remission induction in adult patients with high-risk acute leukemia. Because of the significant antileukemic activity and the scarce extrahematologic toxicity noted in this trial, in order to increase the response rate, we were encouraged to try carboplatin in combination in a similar set of patients. A phase II study of carboplatin 300 mg/m2/d for 5 days in combination with etoposide 100 mg/m2/d for 3 to 4 days was designed by our group to treat patients with high-risk acute leukemia. This combination was chosen because (1) each drug has independent activity in acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) and (2) carboplatin/etoposide has been extensively tested in patients with small and non-small cell lung cancer, and therefore the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose are known. The complete remission rate achieved was somewhat higher (40%) than with carboplatin alone despite the increased incidence of extrahematologic toxicities, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding. At present, carboplatin should be considered as a new effective agent for the treatment of ANLL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Sanz, M A', 'Sanz, G F', 'Martinez, J A', 'Senent, L', 'Lopez, F', 'Palau, J', 'Martin, G', 'Jarque, I']","['Sanz MA', 'Sanz GF', 'Martinez JA', 'Senent L', 'Lopez F', 'Palau J', 'Martin G', 'Jarque I']","['Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/annonc/3.suppl_3.s39 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1992 Aug;3 Suppl 3:39-42. doi: 10.1093/annonc/3.suppl_3.s39.,['BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)'],,,14,,,,,,,,,,,

Following recovery, the HLA-DR antigens were no longer present on the platelets. We postulated that class II had been induced on his megakaryocytes by a cytokine such as interferon gamma, and that the induced expression of class II antigens contributed to the autoimmune disorder. To substantiate this possibility we next studied class I and II antigen expression on an erythroleukaemia cell line (HEL), which has many megakaryocytic features. Following treatment of HEL cells with interferon gamma, class I expression was increased and HLA-DR antigens were induced.

CD41 and CD7 were the most frequently expressed in both disorders. CD41 was positive in six TAM and five AMKL cases, and CD7 was positive in five TAM and five AMKL cases, respectively. CD33 was detected in four TAM and five AMKL cases. Other myeloid-lineage associated antigens such as CD13 and CD11b could not be found in TAM but were expressed in five AMKL cases. Interestingly, CD56, a neural adhesion molecule, was expressed in three of four TAM and one of five AMKL cases. Cytoplasmic CD3 antigen was also noted in three of five examined cases. A short-term culture study was conducted on blasts from two TAM cases and five AMKL cases. In two cases in which CD41 was not expressed before culture, the expression of CD41 was enhanced after culture with or without 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The expression of CD7 remarkably was depressed, while that of CD13 was enhanced after culture with TPA. These findings suggest that blasts of TAM and AMKL originate from very immature cells and represent a mixed phenotype.

The aim was to find variables that could predict the response to treatment. All patients had clinical symptoms related to cytopenia. Peripheral blood values, bone marrow morphology histology and chromosomes were analysed before the start of treatment. The median survival of the patients was 9 months and a poor survival was predicted by advanced age, low platelet counts, the presence of pseudo-Pelger morphology and > or = 2 chromosomal aberrations. Thirty patients (29%) responded with either a complete remission or a significant increase in haemoglobin level. For the remaining 71%, the treatment was ineffective and in some cases hazardous. The factors associated with a poor response to treatment could be divided into two groups: one included low platelet counts and the presence of chromosomal aberrations, both signs of progressive MDS with a short survival, and the other comprised morphological findings, indicating ineffective haemopoiesis. Patients with platelet counts > 150 x 10(9)/l had a response rate of 55% compared to 23.5% in patients with subnormal platelet counts. Logistic regression identified low bone marrow cellularity, absence of ring sideroblasts and < 2 chromosomal aberrations as predictors of a favourable response in patients with platelet counts < 150 x 10(9)/l. These factors and the platelet count were combined in a predictive model which can divide patients into three groups with different probabilities of response: a favourable group, 38.6% of the patients, with a response rate of > 50%, an intermediate group, 32.7% of the patients, with a response rate of 24%, and an unfavourable group, 28.7% of the patients, with only 3% responses. While low-dose ara-C is an effective treatment for some patients, it is ineffective and hazardous for others. We present a model that can facilitate therapeutic decision making in two-thirds of patients with MDS and MDS-AML by identifying patients who should not be treated with low-dose ara-C as well as patients with a relatively high probability of response.","['Hellstrom-Lindberg, E', 'Robert, K H', 'Gahrton, G', 'Lindberg, G', 'Forsblom, A M', 'Kock, Y', 'Ost, A']","['Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Robert KH', 'Gahrton G', 'Lindberg G', 'Forsblom AM', 'Kock Y', 'Ost A']","['Department of Medicine, Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Platelet Count', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb02982.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Aug;81(4):503-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb02982.x.,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three different regimens were used sequentially to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): cyclosporin A (CsA) alone (n = 39), T-cell depletion of donor marrow (n = 51) and CsA with methotrexate (MTX) (n = 50). Eighty-four patients (61%) survive at a median of 49 months from BMT (range 3-120). The actuarial overall and leukaemia-free survivals at 5 years were 52% and 41% respectively. The actuarial probabilities of leukaemia-free survival and haematological relapse at 2 years for the CsA only group were 65% and 4%, for the T-cell depletion group 40% and 41% and for the CsA/MTX group 68% and 6% respectively. For the T-cell depletion group the probability of leukaemia-free survival was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) and the probability of relapse significantly higher (P less than 0.001) than for other methods of GVHD prophylaxis; differences between the other two groups were not significant. Previous reports that T-cell depletion with Campath-1M results in a high rate of relapse are confirmed. Patients in the CsA/MTX group have been monitored with cytogenetic and polymerase chain reaction studies for residual BCR/ABL transcripts. We conclude that the combination of CsA/MTX is currently the best available approach to prevention of GVHD after BMT for CML and in our hands it is not associated with a major risk of relapse.","['Marks, D I', 'Hughes, T P', 'Szydlo, R', 'Kelly, S', 'Cullis, J O', 'Schwarer, A P', 'Mackinnon, S', 'Apperley, J', 'Barrett, A J', 'Hows, J M']","['Marks DI', 'Hughes TP', 'Szydlo R', 'Kelly S', 'Cullis JO', 'Schwarer AP', 'Mackinnon S', 'Apperley J', 'Barrett AJ', 'Hows JM', 'et al.']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08244.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Jul;81(3):383-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08244.x.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['BCR/ABL'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA target for the PCR was the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene derived from a leukemic clone that was quantitated against a background of excess rearranged IgH genes from normal lymphocytes. The PCR was optimized to provide an all-or-none end point at very low DNA target numbers. PCR amplification of the N-ras gene was used as an internal control to quantitate the number of potentially amplifiable genomes present in a sample and hence to measure the extent of DNA degradation. A two-stage PCR was necessary owing to competition between leukemic and non-leukemic templates. Study of eight leukemic samples showed that approximately two potentially amplifiable leukemic IgH targets could be detected in the presence of 160,000 competing non-leukemic genomes. The method presented quantitates the total number of initial DNA targets present in a sample, unlike most other quantitation methods that quantitate PCR products. It has wide application, because it is technically simple, does not require radioactivity, addresses the problem of excess competing targets and estimates the extent of DNA degradation in a sample.","['Sykes, P J', 'Neoh, S H', 'Brisco, M J', 'Hughes, E', 'Condon, J', 'Morley, A A']","['Sykes PJ', 'Neoh SH', 'Brisco MJ', 'Hughes E', 'Condon J', 'Morley AA']","['Department of Hematology, Flinders Medical Center, Bedford Park, South Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biotechniques,BioTechniques,8306785,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Poisson Distribution', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Templates, Genetic']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biotechniques. 1992 Sep;13(3):444-9.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",,['N-ras'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to investigate whether strongyloidiasis, a parasitic disease common in these areas, might be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of ATL, as some reports have suggested. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: One 35-year-old HTLV-I-seropositive French West Indian man with a 7-year history of recurrent strongyloidiasis associated with episodic hyperinfestation presenting at the Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal, Villeneuve St Georges, France. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with various chemotherapeutic agents and symptomatic therapy for hypercalcaemia and antiviral therapy (zidovudine and interferon). RESULTS: The patient developed ATL and died shortly after, despite chemotherapy. Immunological and virological studies performed during the last 15 months of his life showed an increase of the percentage of peripheral ATL cells, and progression from a polyclonal to a monoclonal integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the peripheral blood mononuclear and lymph-node cells. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent strongyloidiasis appears to have been a possible cofactor associated with progression from healthy carrier state to ATL in our patient.","['Patey, O', 'Gessain, A', 'Breuil, J', 'Courillon-Mallet, A', 'Daniel, M T', 'Miclea, J M', 'Roucayrol, A M', 'Sigaux, F', 'Lafaix, C']","['Patey O', 'Gessain A', 'Breuil J', 'Courillon-Mallet A', 'Daniel MT', 'Miclea JM', 'Roucayrol AM', 'Sigaux F', 'Lafaix C']","['Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal, Villeneuve St Georges, France.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,IM,"['Adult', 'Carrier State', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/etiology', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Strongyloidiasis/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Thiabendazole/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002030-199206000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 1992 Jun;6(6):575-9. doi: 10.1097/00002030-199206000-00009.,['N1Q45E87DT (Thiabendazole)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lipophilicity, measured as log P, seemed to be important for in vitro antitumour activity in three different cell lines. The in vitro activity of this series of mitosenes in an A204 and a L1210 cell line demonstrated a clear bilinear dependence on log P with optimal activity at log P values of 2.8 and 3.3 respectively. Compounds not able to be activated to bifunctional alkylating species did not fit into this correlation. Although mitosenes have to be activated reductively to alkylating species, no correlation was found between the half-wave reduction potential (E 1/2) and the in vitro activity. This lack of correlation may be caused by the relatively small range of E 1/2-values within this series of mitosene compounds. Our results indicate that penetration of the antitumour mitosenes into the cell and the site of activation is an important process that leads to antitumour activity and that within the range of compounds studied the structural variations are less important for bioreductive activation.","['Maliepaard, M', 'de Mol, N J', 'Janssen, L H', 'van der Neut, W', 'Verboom, W', 'Reinhoudt, D N']","['Maliepaard M', 'de Mol NJ', 'Janssen LH', 'van der Neut W', 'Verboom W', 'Reinhoudt DN']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Utrecht University, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,IM,"['Animals', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism', 'Mitomycin/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', '*Mitomycins', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/drug therapy', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1992 Oct;7(5):415-25.,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual murine Fc gamma R isoforms were transfected into rat basophilic leukemia cells and after cross-linking the FcR, changes in the phosphorylation of protein tyrosines, in the level of intracellular Ca2+, in the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, and in the release of arachidonic acid metabolites and hexosaminidase were monitored. Cross-linking of Fc gamma RIII initiated all of these early and late biochemical functions, and although they were quantitatively somewhat smaller, the responses were qualitatively indistinguishable from those stimulated by the endogenous Fc epsilon RI. However, despite ample expression, neither Fc gamma RII-b1 nor Fc gamma RII-b2 stimulated these functions when cross-linked. The functional differences between Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII were studied further by assessing the responses to cross-linking of the endogenous Fc gamma R (Fc gamma RII-b1, Fc gamma RII-b2, and Fc gamma RIII) on P815 mouse mastocytoma cells that had been transfected with normal or functionally defective Fc epsilon RI. Two types of mutant subunits had previously been observed to impair the activity of Fc epsilon RI: gamma-chains missing the cytoplasmic domain, and beta-chains missing the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain. In both types of transfectants the functional inhibition of the endogenous Fc gamma R paralleled that of the transfected Fc epsilon RI. These results are consistent with the gamma subunit being associated with the functions of Fc gamma RIII as well as of Fc epsilon RI. The functional results also complement the recently reported evidence that Fc gamma RIII can interact with Fc epsilon RI beta-subunits (J. Exp.

The members of the TL antigen encoding gene pair, T3d/T18d, are expressed in only a limited number of organs, including several sites enriched for gamma delta T cells. Other Tla region genes, including T1d, T2d, T16d, and T17d, are transcriptionally silent and transcripts from the T8d/T20d gene pair do not undergo proper splicing. In general, sites that contain gamma delta T lymphocytes have Tla region transcripts.

The incidence of this disorder is unknown although preliminary studies suggest that megakaryoblasts may be found frequently in the blood of DS newborns. TL does not occur in normal newborn infants.

Adhesion was enhanced by pulse-treatment of cells with phorbolester (PMA 10(-7) M). Adhesion was induced within minutes, was fibronectin-specific, and affected up to 100% of the treated cells. This biological response to PMA resulted from the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), since PKC inhibitors (staurosporine, sphingosine, CGP 41251, and calphostin C) prevented the phenomenon. Phenotypical analysis of integrin receptor expression (particularly FN receptors VLA-4 and VLA-5) at the membrane of untreated or PMA-treated cells revealed that PMA induced no significant modification of the level of expression of these receptors. However, inhibition studies carried out with anti-VLA monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the FN-specific adhesion triggered by PKC involved the alpha 5 beta 1 FN-specific receptors (VLA-5). We showed that the binding of NB4 cells to fibronectin was RGD-dependent. PMA-induced adhesion was not correlated to phosphorylation of the VLA-5 receptor. These findings may partially explain the malignant behaviour of these cells: The loss of their capacity to adhere to stromal cells may arrest differentiation and explain the large number of leukemic cells in the circulation.","['Martin-Thouvenin, V', 'Gendron, M C', 'Hogervorst, F', 'Figdor, C G', 'Lanotte, M']","['Martin-Thouvenin V', 'Gendron MC', 'Hogervorst F', 'Figdor CG', 'Lanotte M']","['INSERM, U301, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Fibronectin', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041530113 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1992 Oct;153(1):95-102. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041530113.,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because proliferating blasts frequently express phenotypes of megakaryocytic lineage and, as a result, this disorder resembles acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), it would be of interest to determine whether myelofibrosis, a common complication of AMKL, is also present in TMD. Pathologic observations of four autopsy cases of TMD showed that myelofibrosis was not present in any of them, whereas intralobular diffuse liver fibrosis was present in all of them. Laboratory data of four additional cases showed hepatic dysfunction in all of them, suggesting a close association between hepatic lesions and TMD. From these results, we propose a hypothesis that the abnormal blasts with megakaryocytic properties in TMD originate from the fetal liver and cause liver fibrosis, as AMKL cells are thought to cause myelofibrosis by producing collagen-stimulating cytokines in the bone marrow. This hypothesis also seems to explain some other unique aspects of TMD.","['Miyauchi, J', 'Ito, Y', 'Kawano, T', 'Tsunematsu, Y', 'Shimizu, K']","['Miyauchi J', 'Ito Y', 'Kawano T', 'Tsunematsu Y', 'Shimizu K']","[""Division of Pathology, National Children's Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Autopsy', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/pathology', 'Female', 'Heart Septal Defects, Atrial/complications', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Liver/physiopathology', 'Liver Cirrhosis/*complications/etiology/pathology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/pathology', 'Transaminases/blood']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67577-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 15;80(6):1521-7.,"['EC 2.6.1.- (Transaminases)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormalities of the gene occur rarely by chromosomal translocation into the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta locus and commonly by a site-specific 95-kb deletion, SIL-SCL (tald). Analysis of the SIL-SCL deletion by Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a series of 52 immature T-cell malignancies showed a type A deletion in 21% of cases, but no type B deletions. The type A deletion correlated with malignancies of the TCR alpha beta lineage, either on the basis of TCR alpha beta expression or bilateral TCR delta deletion. Fifty percent (5 of 10) of TCR alpha beta-expressing cells demonstrated the abnormality, whereas 0% (0 of 11) of TCR gamma delta-expressing cells did so. Six of eight SIL-SCL type A cases had undergone bilateral delta deletion, whereas only one of 31 cases with an apparently normal SCL gene had done so.

To test this hypothesis, we first undertook the molecular cloning of Ca2+ATPase from human erythroleukaemia (HEL) cells, because this human cell line exhibits megakaryocytic features and expresses a Ca2+ATPase that cross-reacts with platelet Ca(2+)-ATPase. For this cloning, an HEL-cell cDNA library was screened with a rat cardiac Ca2+ATPase cDNA probe. The insert of the longest clone isolated was 3.9 kb and its sequence displayed a 100% identity with that of the non-muscle human Ca2+ATPase 2-b isoform, termed SERCA2-b (sarco-endoplasmic-reticulum Ca2+ATPase). The 3.9 kb cDNA covered a subtotal coding region and part of the 3' non-coding end of the SERCA2-b mRNA. It cross-hybridized with the 4 kb transcript species of cardiac SERCA2-a and with non-muscle SERCA2-b mRNAs, but not with fast-skeletal-muscle SERCA1 mRNA. We next confirmed that SERCA2-b was a component of the platelet Ca2+ATPase system because (1) the platelet clones isolated from a platelet cDNA library exhibited a 100% homology with HEL-cell cDNA; (2) SERCA2-b mRNA was amplified by PCR on total platelet RNA and (3) platelet Ca2+ATPase cross-reacted with a polyclonal SERCA2-b-specific antiserum. Platelets therefore contain a Ca2+ATPase definitely identified as the SERCA2-b isoform of Ca2+ATPase, thus eliminating the possibility that they only contain a single specific Ca2+ATPase.","['Enouf, J', 'Bredoux, R', 'Papp, B', 'Djaffar, I', 'Lompre, A M', 'Kieffer, N', 'Gayet, O', 'Clemetson, K', 'Wuytack, F', 'Rosa, J P']","['Enouf J', 'Bredoux R', 'Papp B', 'Djaffar I', 'Lompre AM', 'Kieffer N', 'Gayet O', 'Clemetson K', 'Wuytack F', 'Rosa JP']","['U348 INSERM, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Blood Platelets/*enzymology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/*blood/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*blood/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Muscle, Smooth/enzymology', 'Muscles/enzymology', 'Myocardium/enzymology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2860135 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1992 Aug 15;286 ( Pt 1):135-40. doi: 10.1042/bj2860135.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)']",,,,PMC1133029,,,,,,,,,,

In this initial study, we have examined DNA from leukaemic cells of 29 patients with AML, including three with FAB subtype M2 with deletion of an X or Y chromosome for evidence of gross rearrangement of this gene. We report that although the gene is highly polymorphic for a number of restriction enzymes, we have found no evidence of gross rearrangement in AML.","['Bardy, P G', 'Lopez, A F', 'Moore, S', 'Park, L S', 'Vadas, M A', 'Shannon, M F']","['Bardy PG', 'Lopez AF', 'Moore S', 'Park LS', 'Vadas MA', 'Shannon MF']","['Division of Human Immunology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'X Chromosome', 'Y Chromosome']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Sep;6(9):893-7.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of the Fc gamma RIII gamma subunit.,2155-62,"Murine mast cells produce cytokines in response to cross-linking of high affinity receptors for IgE (Fc epsilon RI). Murine mast cells also express the two types of low-affinity receptors for IgG, murine (m)Fc gamma RII, and mFc gamma RIII. We examined the ability of mFc gamma R to trigger a cytokine response such as TNF-alpha production by mast cells. We found that the mFc gamma RII- and mFc gamma RIII-positive mouse mastocytoma cells MMC-1 released TNF-alpha when challenged with F(ab')2 fragments of the rat anti-mFc gamma RII/III 2.4G2 mAb and mouse anti-rat IgG F(ab')2. The release of TNF-alpha was preceded by an increase in TNF-alpha transcripts. mFc gamma RII and mFc gamma RIII have 95% homologous extracellular domains but unrelated transmembrane and intracytoplasmic (IC) domains. mFc gamma RII are single chain receptors whereas mFc gamma RIII associate with a homodimeric gamma-chain that also associates with Fc epsilon RI and TCR. In order to analyze the ability of mFc gamma RII and III to trigger the synthesis of TNF-alpha, we studied RBL-2H3 cells transfected with corresponding cDNA. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) transfectants expressing mFc gamma RIII produced TNF-alpha in response to 2.4G2 F(ab')2, but not transfectants expressing mFc gamma RII. Non-transfected RBL cells and mFc gamma RII- or mFc gamma RIII-expressing transfectants, however, released TNF-alpha in response to a rat IgG2a mAb. The respective roles of the alpha and gamma subunits of mFc gamma RIII were examined by studying the production of TNF-alpha by RBL cells expressing deletant and chimeric mFc gamma R. The deletion of intracellular amino acids of the Fc gamma RIII alpha subunit did not prevent 2.4G2 F(ab')2 from triggering the synthesis of TNF-alpha. The substitution of the IC domain of mFc gamma RII for that of mFc gamma RIII gamma, but not that of Fc gamma RIII alpha, enabled 2.4G2 F(ab')2 to trigger the release of TNF-alpha by RBL transfectants. A cytokine response can therefore be induced in mouse and rat mast cells through Fc gamma R. This response is triggered upon cross-linking of mFc gamma RIII but not mFc gamma RII. It depends on the IC sequences of the gamma but not of the alpha subunit of mFc gamma RIII.","['Latour, S', 'Bonnerot, C', 'Fridman, W H', 'Daeron, M']","['Latour S', 'Bonnerot C', 'Fridman WH', 'Daeron M']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Clinique, INSERM U. 255, Institut Curie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'L Cells', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Sep 15;149(6):2155-62.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selection of histocompatible unrelated bone marrow donors currently relies on serological HLA identity and negative mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) between potential donor-recipient pairs. Since serological HLA-DP typing is not feasible, we used the HLA-DPB1 oligonucleotide typing method to test whether the current selection procedure can also guarantee identity for HLA-DP. In 40 consecutive patients, one-third (62/193) of the serologically HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR and -DQ identical donors were judged as MLC negative (relative response below 5%) with the presumptive recipient. HLA-DPB1 oligonucleotide typing of the MLC negative donors revealed that only one-third of these (20/62) were also identical for DP. In the majority of the pairs, we found a DPB1 disparity. A difference in the graft-versus-host direction was seen in 25/62 cases in the host-versus-graft direction in 28/62 cases and in both directions in 29/62 cases. These data indicate that, in spite of the strict MLC criteria used, the current procedure did not guarantee complete MHC class II identity. Therefore oligotyping for DPB1 can improve matching for DP and should be introduced for typing of volunteers. We suspect that DP differences may contribute to the higher incidence of graft-versus-host disease or graft rejection in unrelated donor transplants.","['Eiermann, T H', 'Fakler, J', 'Goldmann, S F']","['Eiermann TH', 'Fakler J', 'Goldmann SF']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', '*HLA-DP Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Tissue Donors']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992 Mar;9(3):157-60.,"['0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied thrombin-induced tyrosine-specific protein phosphorylation in normal platelets and those from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and other myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) using immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine (anti-P-Tyr) antibody. In resting platelets, two major phosphotyrosyl (P-Tyr) proteins with molecular masses of 120 kDa (p120) and 60 kDa (p60) were consistently detected both in normal subjects and in CML and other MPD patients. In addition to these P-Tyr proteins, a 36 kDa protein (p36) was predominantly phosphorylated only in CML platelets, using antilipocortin II antibody, we identified this p36 protein as lipocortin. Thrombin enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 and p60, not only in normal platelets, but also in CML platelets, although the response was more delayed and the duration was shorter in CML platelets than those in normal platelets. Interestingly, decreased thrombin-induced aggregation was associated with a transient stimulation of p36 phosphorylation in CML platelets. These results suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of p36, which was probably identical to lipocortin, inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation through anti-phospholipase A2 (anti-PLA2) activity.","['Shibata, K', 'Nishimura, J', 'Yufu, Y', 'Nawata, H']","['Shibata K', 'Nishimura J', 'Yufu Y', 'Nawata H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Annexins', 'Blood Platelets/*enzymology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/enzymology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1992 Apr;55(2):189-96.,"['0 (Annexins)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII were selectively engaged using the anti-Fc gamma RI mAb 197 (IgG2a) and the anti-Fc gamma RII mAb IV.3 (IgG2b). Addition to cells of mAb 197, but not addition of IgG2a mAb of irrelevant specificity, resulted in the rapid induction of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphorylation as assessed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting. A similar pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation was induced by mAb IV.3, but not by control IgG2b mAb. The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by anti-Fc gamma R mAb was not dependent on antibody Fc region-FcR interactions, because tyrosine phosphorylation was also induced by cross-linked anti-Fc gamma RI F(ab')2 fragments and by cross-linked anti-Fc gamma RII Fab fragments. To investigate the relationship of Fc gamma R-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C, which is known to follow Fc gamma R engagement, we assessed the effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A on Fc gamma R-induced Ca2+ flux. Herbimycin A strongly inhibited cellular Ca2+ flux induced by mAb 197, but did not inhibit Ca2+ flux induced by aluminum fluoride, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation may be important in regulating Fc gamma R-mediated activation of phospholipase C. Consistent with this, mAb 197 induced rapid phosphorylation of the gamma-1 isoform of phospholipase C. Finally, herbimycin A strongly inhibited the induction of TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation by Fc gamma R cross-linking. These results suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation may play an important role in the activation of phospholipase C and in the induction of monokine gene expression that follows engagement of Fc gamma R in human monocytes.","['Scholl, P R', 'Ahern, D', 'Geha, R S']","['Scholl PR', 'Ahern D', 'Geha RS']","[""Department of Medicine, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['AI21163/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI27411/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*physiology', 'Benzoquinones', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*metabolism', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Sep 1;149(5):1751-7.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual SUP-T13 cells can spontaneously switch on and off surface TCR/CD3 expression. This switching was demonstrated by culturing and analysis of single cell clones that were TCR/CD3+ or TCR/CD3-. The rate of switching is about 10(-2)/cell per generation in either direction. This is too high to be due to a spontaneous mutation event. Furthermore, switched cells can revert at similar rates, as demonstrated by repeated cloning and reanalysis. This makes it likely that a regulatory change is responsible for switching. In support of this, all known TCR/CD3 proteins are found intracellularly in TCR/CD3- cells, and they associate with each other as in TCR/CD3+ cells. Furthermore, no structural abnormalities of the TCR/CD3 chains can be seen in TCR/CD3- cells using two-dimensional electrophoresis. However, in these cells, the chains accumulate in great excess intracellularly. This accumulation is specific to the TCR/CD3 complex, as other glycoproteins are still expressed normally on the cell surface. Thus, there is regulation of TCR expression at a posttranslational level. These TCR/CD3- cells may lead to the identification of novel protein(s) involved in glycosylating, processing, or transporting the TCR/CD3 complex. Potential loss of TCR/CD3 expression may also limit the feasibility of TCR-based therapies for T cell leukemias.","['Maecker, H T', 'Jokinen, D M', 'Fisher, R I']","['Maecker HT', 'Jokinen DM', 'Fisher RI']","['Department of Biology, Loyola University of Chicago, IL 60626.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD3 Complex', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Sep 1;149(5):1619-25.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of these RNAs can be modulated in tissue culture cell lines by physiologically relevant stimuli, increasing when cells are stimulated to proliferate and decreasing when cells are induced to differentiate. Moreover, RNAs from tissues that contain few proliferating cells have no detectable hybridizing transcripts. The coordinate regulation of these RNAs with other genes that are activated during the cell division cycle and the profound similarity of the predicted amino acid sequence to those of published cyclin B homologues indicate that these genes encode a murine cyclin B1. In Southern hybridization analysis of BALB/cAnPt genomic DNA digested with EcoRI, 12 fragments hybridized with the cDNA probes. Through Southern blot analyses of DNA from backcross and cogenic mice, recombinant inbred strains, and somatic cell hybrids, the genetic loci that produce the cyclin B1-related sequences (designated loci Cycb1-rs1 to Cycb1-rs9) were mapped on mouse chromosomes 5, 1, 17, 4, 14, 13, 7, X, and 8, respectively. Cycb1-rs6 (on chromosome 13) is discussed as the most likely candidate for an expressed structural gene locus.","['Hanley-Hyde, J', 'Mushinski, J F', 'Sadofsky, M', 'Huppi, K', 'Krall, M', 'Kozak, C A', 'Mock, B']","['Hanley-Hyde J', 'Mushinski JF', 'Sadofsky M', 'Huppi K', 'Krall M', 'Kozak CA', 'Mock B']","['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'DNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0888-7543(92)90015-k [doi]'],ppublish,Genomics. 1992 Aug;13(4):1018-30. doi: 10.1016/0888-7543(92)90015-k.,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S43105', 'GENBANK/S99414', 'GENBANK/S99422', 'GENBANK/S99479', 'GENBANK/S99543', 'GENBANK/S99546', 'GENBANK/S99553', 'GENBANK/S99558', 'GENBANK/S99567', 'GENBANK/X61631']",,,,

Seven patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease received preparative treatment consisting of cyclophosphamide (1.5 g m-2, daily) administered on days 1 to 4 and BCNU (600 mg m-2) on day 5 prior to autologous bone marrow rescue (ABMR) delivered on day 7. Treatment in the remaining 12 patients consisted of cyclophosphamide (1.8 g m-2, daily) given on days 1 and 2 followed at day 4 with total body irradiation (TBI) administered in six fractions over the subsequent 3 days to a total dose of 1200 cGy prior to bone marrow transplantation. In the Hodgkin's group, significant decreases in ATase activity were seen during the cyclophosphamide treatment, and the median ATase nadir was 32% (range 0% to 57%) of pretreatment levels following 4 days of cyclophosphamide. In one patient, no ATase activity was detectable following the 4th cyclophosphamide treatment. ATase activities decreased further after BCNU administration to a median of 19% (range 0% to 32%) of pretreatment levels. Extensive cyclophosphamide-induced reduction of lymphocyte ATase levels was also seen in the other group of 12 patients treated with cyclophosphamide/TBI: postcyclophosphamide median ATase nadir was 35% (range 12% to 78%) of the pretreatment levels. No ATase depletion was seen when cyclophosphamide (up to 10 mM) was incubated for 2 h with pure recombinant human ATase in vitro whereas ATase activity was reduced by 90% on preincubation with 100 microns acrolein or with greater than 1 mM phosphoramide mustard. This suggests that a cyclophosphamide-induced decrease in ATase levels in human peripheral lymphocytes in vivo may be due to depletion mediated by the production of intracellular acrolein. Since ATase appears to be a principal mechanism in cellular resistance to the cytotoxic effects of BCNU and related alkylating agents, these observations suggest that a cyclophosphamide-induced reduction in ATase activity may be an additional factor in the effectiveness of the combined sequential therapy.","['Lee, S M', 'Crowther, D', 'Scarffe, J H', 'Dougal, M', 'Elder, R H', 'Rafferty, J A', 'Margison, G P']","['Lee SM', 'Crowther D', 'Scarffe JH', 'Dougal M', 'Elder RH', 'Rafferty JA', 'Margison GP']","['CRC Department of Carcinogenesis, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Acrolein/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/blood', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Carmustine/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/*surgery', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/enzymology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*blood/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1992.265 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1992 Aug;66(2):331-6. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1992.265.,"['0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '10159-53-2 (phosphoramide mustard)', '7864XYD3JJ (Acrolein)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",,,,PMC1977821,,,,,,,,,,

Murine Fc gamma RIIb1 and b2 are two isoforms of single-chain receptors which differ only by 47 aa in their IC domain. Murine Fc gamma RIII are composed of an IgG-binding alpha-chain, the intracellular portion of which is unrelated to that of Fc gamma RII, and of a homodimeric gamma-chain which also associates with Fc epsilon RI. Murine mast cells express Fc gamma RII, Fc gamma RIII, and Fc epsilon RI. They can be induced to degranulate by murine IgG immune complexes or by F(ab')2 fragments of the rat anti-murine Fc gamma RII/III mAb 2.4G2, complexed to mouse anti-rat (MAR) F(ab')2. In order to determine which murine Fc gamma R can activate mast cells, cDNA encoding murine Fc gamma RIIb1, Fc gamma RIIb2 or Fc gamma RIII alpha were stably transfected into RBL-2H3 cells. Murine Fc gamma RIII but not Fc gamma RIIb1 or Fc gamma RIIb2 induced serotonin release when aggregated by (2.4G2-MAR) F(ab')2 complexes. The respective roles of the IC domains of murine Fc gamma RIII subunits in signal transduction were investigated by stably transfecting cDNA encoding IC-deleted or chimeric murine Fc gamma R into RBL-2H3 cells. The substitution of the IC domain of murine Fc gamma RII for that of murine Fc gamma RIII gamma, but not that of murine Fc gamma RIII alpha, conferred the ability to trigger serotonin release. The deletion of IC sequences of the alpha subunit did not alter the ability of murine Fc gamma RIII to trigger serotonin release. It follows that 1) murine Fc gamma RIII, but not Fc gamma RII, can induce RBL cells to release serotonin, 2) the aggregation of the IC domain of the murine Fc gamma RIII gamma subunit is sufficient, but 3) the IC domain of the murine Fc gamma RIII alpha subunit is neither sufficient nor necessary for triggering serotonin release.","['Daeron, M', 'Bonnerot, C', 'Latour, S', 'Fridman, W H']","['Daeron M', 'Bonnerot C', 'Latour S', 'Fridman WH']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Clinique, INSERM U255, Institut Curie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/chemistry/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Degranulation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mast Cells/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/chemistry/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Aug 15;149(4):1365-73.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the remaining seven adult CVI patients the abnormal CD45R profiles were primarily associated with CD4+ lymphocytes in three and CD8+ lymphocytes in four. Specific increases in CD45RA- CD45RO+ fractions were found in four CVI patients and in all of these there was a concomitant reduction in circulating CD19+ B-cell numbers. Two of the CVI cases were identical twin sisters and both had the same CD45R abnormality. The two adults with XLA also showed abnormal CD45R expression (increased CD45RA+ CD45RO- components) but of particular note, in view of the fact that these were brothers, one was associated with the CD4+ subpopulation and the other with the CD8+ fraction. Similar analyses for the paediatric group revealed, in distinct contrast to the adult patients, no significant abnormalities of CD45R expression suggesting that these defects may not become apparent until a later age. Further investigations of in vitro lymphocyte proliferation (PHA and PWM) in the eight adults with CVI showed a significant correlation between abnormal responses and disordered CD45R expression. It is proposed that these abnormal patterns of CD45R expression by lymphocyte subpopulations in CVI and XLA may be of fundamental importance with respect to the pathogenesis of these particular immunodeficiencies.","['Richards, S J', 'Scott, C S', 'Cole, J C', 'Gooi, H C']","['Richards SJ', 'Scott CS', 'Cole JC', 'Gooi HC']","['Yorkshire Leukaemia Diagnostic Unit, Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agammaglobulinemia/genetics/*immunology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'X Chromosome']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08201.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Jun;81(2):160-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08201.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, immunological roles of astrocytes have been reported, especially in multiple sclerosis and experimental allergic encephalitis. One observation shows that human glioma cells, which lack CD4 molecules, can be infected with human immunodeficiency virus in vitro. Another report described that human macrophages can be infected with human immunodeficiency virus through Fc gamma receptors expressed on their cell surfaces. These results prompted us to examine the functioning molecules, especially Fc gamma receptor for immunoglobulin G, expressed on the astroglial cell line. From erythrocyte-antibody rosette assays, redirected cytolysis and flow cytometric analysis, we have shown that human astrocytoma cell lines possess Fc gamma receptors on their cell surfaces. Furthermore, primary cultured murine astrocytes express Fc gamma II receptors, reacting with 2.4G2 monoclonal antibody. Surprisingly, murine astrocytes prepared from newborn BALB/c mice demonstrate killing activity against allogeneic T cell leukemia by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. After treatment with the macrophage activating factor, interferon-gamma, expression of Fc gamma receptors and killer activity of astrocytes were augmented. From these results, it is suspected that the astroglial cell lines play an important immunological role in the brain.","['Nitta, T', 'Yagita, H', 'Sato, K', 'Okumura, K']","['Nitta T', 'Yagita H', 'Sato K', 'Okumura K']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,7802914,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*physiology', 'Astrocytes/*immunology', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/immunology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Endocytosis/*physiology', 'Glioma', 'HIV-1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Rosette Formation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1227/00006123-199207000-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurosurgery. 1992 Jul;31(1):83-7; discussion 87-8. doi: 10.1227/00006123-199207000-00012.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells mature extensively and acquire the characteristics of erythroid cells. The cells lose their cell-surface fibronectin receptors and accumulate red cell-specific membrane proteins, such as band 3, in amounts comparable to those in erythrocytes. Previous studies of MELC have shown that the presence of protein kinase C (PKC) is required for commitment to differentiation, but that the level of PKC activity declines progressively during maturation. In this study, we have established a role for PKC in the maturation of MELC committed to differentiation. Our results show that down-regulation of PKC by addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to committed MELC blocks subsequent maturation of the cells. Treatment of MELC with the PKC inhibitors H7 and sphingosine had similar effects. Down-regulation of PKC was assayed by measuring cytosolic PKC activity as well as by Western blotting using PKC antibodies. MELC maturation was monitored by loss of the cell-surface fibronectin receptor, release of cells from fibronectin plates, and accumulation of the band 3 anion transport protein. Immunoprecipitation of surface-labeled proteins by an anti-fibronectin receptor (integrin) antibody showed that PMA-treated cultures had more fibronectin receptor protein than untreated cultures 6 days post-induction. As a result, cultures of committed MELC treated with PMA remained attached to fibronectin-coated plates, whereas non-PMA-treated cells were released into the culture medium. Furthermore, PKC-depleted cells accumulated much smaller amounts of band 3 protein and band 3 mRNA than did non-PKC-depleted controls. Our results show that although PKC activity declines progressively during post-commitment maturation of MELC, its continued presence is critical for the process of cellular maturation.","['GuptaRoy, B', 'Cohen, C M']","['GuptaRoy B', 'Cohen CM']","[""Department of Biomedical Research, St. Elizabeth's Hospital of Boston, Massachusetts 02135.""]",['eng'],['HL 24382/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Globins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Fibronectin', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/05 00:00,1992/08/05 00:01,['1992/08/05 00:00'],"['1992/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)49537-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Aug 5;267(22):15326-33.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because IFNs have an antiproliferative effect, selection against the IFN alpha/beta system could play a role or accompany the development of the malignant phenotype. Although the deletion of the IFNA/B genes could interrupt an autocrine loop that controls cell proliferation, cells would still respond to exogenous IFN alpha/beta and, thus, lesions at the receptor or signal transduction level should also be present to render cells resistant to exogenous IFN alpha/beta. To test if selection against the IFN system was operating in acute leukemias, the sensitivity to the antiproliferative effect of IFN alpha 2 was studied in acute leukemia cell lines with and without alterations of the IFNA/B genes. We found that 10 of 11 acute leukemia cell lines with alterations of the IFNA/B genes were resistant to the antiproliferative effect of IFN alpha 2, whereas only two of eight cell lines with normal IFNA/B genes were IFN-resistant. We then examined the possibility that an alteration of the receptor expression could account for the lack of response to IFN alpha 2. No significant alteration in the expression or structure of the IFN alpha receptor was observed. We also studied the downmodulation of the alpha subunit of the IFN alpha receptor upon IFN alpha 2 binding. One cell line with deletion of the IFNA/B genes showed impaired downmodulation of the IFN alpha receptor. The data presented here suggest that selection against the IFN alpha/beta system could play a role or accompany the development of the malignant phenotype.","['Colamonici, O R', 'Domanski, P', 'Platanias, L C', 'Diaz, M O']","['Colamonici OR', 'Domanski P', 'Platanias LC', 'Diaz MO']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, IL 60637-1470.']",['eng'],"['2-S07-RR05893-07/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49133/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-alpha/*genetics', 'Interferon-beta/*genetics', 'Leukemia', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interferon', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70582-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Aug 1;80(3):744-9.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for the role of an ATPase obtained with inside-out plasma membrane vesicles.,14746-52,"Earlier studies from our laboratory (Dembo, M., Sirotnak F. M., and Moccio, D. M. (1984) J. Membr. Biol. 78, 9-17) suggested that methotrexate (MTX) efflux from L1210 cells was mediated predominantly by an ATP-dependent, outwardly directed, mechanism. To examine this process further, we utilized predominantly (74%) inside-out plasma membrane vesicle preparations derived from an L1210 cell variant (L1210/R24) with 15-fold reduced Vmax for [3H]MTX influx. Efflux of [3H]MTX, under nonionic buffer conditions, in these inside-out membrane vesicles was temperature and ATP dependent (apparent Km = 0.40 +/- 0.06 mM), osmotically sensitive, and unaffected by protonophores. The presence of K+, Na+, Cl-, and HCO3- at their physiological concentrations had no effect on [3H]MTX efflux. Other triphosphonucleotides (GTP and CTP), but not a nonhydrolyzable analogue, adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S), could also stimulate efflux, but to a lesser extent. Also, ATP gamma S and orthovanadate were potent inhibitors of ATP-dependent efflux of [3H]MTX. Other experiments revealed a system with low saturability for [3H]MTX during efflux (apparent Km = 46 +/- 7 microM), but extremely high capacity (106 +/- 15 pmol/min/mg protein), and a pH optimum in the range of 5.5-6. However, appreciable efflux was measured in the physiological range of pH 6.7-6.9. A number of inhibitors or copermeants for ATP-dependent [3H]MTX efflux in intact L1210 cells were inhibitors of ATP-dependent efflux in inside-out plasma membrane vesicles, including, cholate, bromosulfophthalein, verapamil, quinidine, and reserpine. These findings and other results showing that bromosulfophthalein will completely inhibit efflux are consistent with a role for an ATPase in [3H]MTX efflux, and suggest that the process under study is the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive, ATP-dependent route responsible for the majority of [3H]MTX efflux in intact L1210 cells.","['Schlemmer, S R', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Schlemmer SR', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Laboratory for Molecular Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 46673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology/metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/07/25 00:00,1992/07/25 00:01,['1992/07/25 00:00'],"['1992/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42103-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Jul 25;267(21):14746-52.,"['8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding is due to the high catalytic activity of thymidylate synthase within cells in comparison to the tetrahydrofolate cofactor pool size. In the present study, we assessed the rate of resumption of thymidylate synthase catalytic activity in terms of [3H]deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA and dihydrofolate generation from tetrahydrofolate cofactors following exposure of cells to fluorodeoxyuridine. Log phase L1210 leukemia cells, incubated with fluorodeoxyuridine to abolish thymidylate synthase catalytic activity, were suspended into drug-free medium. Resumption of [3H]deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA was negligible; by 4 hr enzyme activity was still inhibited by approximately 98%. However, this was sufficient to interconvert all available tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate (T1/2 approximately 2 hr) when dihydrofolate reductase was inhibited by the lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate. Interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate correlated with a decline, then cessation, of purine synthesis as measured by the incorporation of [14C]formate into purine bases. These data suggest that an earlier than previously expected depletion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors with consequent inhibition of purine and other folate-dependent synthetic processes is likely to occur when antifolates are administered after a fluoropyrimidine.","['Seither, R L', 'Rape, T J', 'Goldman, I D']","['Seither RL', 'Rape TJ', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Deoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Enzyme Reactivators/*pharmacology', 'Floxuridine/*pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Time Factors', 'Trimetrexate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/06/23 00:00,1992/06/23 00:01,['1992/06/23 00:00'],"['1992/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(92)90154-B [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(92)90154-b [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1992 Jun 23;43(12):2647-54. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(92)90154-b.,"['0 (Enzyme Reactivators)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '4033-27-6 (dihydrofolate)', '43ZWB253H4 (5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The highly potent radiolabeled inhibitor 2-((3-[125I]iodo-4-hydroxy)phenylmethyl)-4-N-[3-(hydroxyamino-3-oxo-1- phenylmethyl)propyl]amino-4-oxobutanoic acid ([125I]RB104; Ki = 30 pM) has been developed for the enzyme. [125I]RB104 is highly specific, its Ki for another widely distributed zinc peptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, being 15 microM. In binding studies using rat brain slices, [125I]RB104 was shown to have a high affinity (Kd = 300 +/- 20 pM) and high specific binding at the Kd concentration (90%). With rat brain homogenates the Kd of [125I]RB104 was 26.8 +/- 0.9 pM, close to the kinetically derived Kd, 7.0 +/- 0.8 pM. Using the inhibitor, we have developed a simple, rapid, and quantitative technique to detect low nanogram quantities of the endopeptidase directly from tissue extracts after SDS/PAGE. The method has been used to show the presence of low quantities of the enzyme in rabbit bone marrow. Apart from its sensitivity, ""inhibitor gel electrophoresis"" using [125I]RB104 has the advantage over immunohistochemical methods of being able to label the enzyme in all tissues and species. It will therefore be of great value in determining the exact role of this important regulatory peptidase in a number of biological systems. Moreover, this one-step characterization of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 could be extended to other zinc metallopeptidases such as angiotensin-converting enzyme or collagenases, and inhibitors with affinities as high as RB104 could open the way to visualization of zinc metallopeptidases in different tissues by electron microscopy.","['Fournie-Zaluski, M C', 'Soleilhac, J M', 'Turcaud, S', 'Lai-Kuen, R', 'Crine, P', 'Beaumont, A', 'Roques, B P']","['Fournie-Zaluski MC', 'Soleilhac JM', 'Turcaud S', 'Lai-Kuen R', 'Crine P', 'Beaumont A', 'Roques BP']","['Universite Rene Descartes, Departement de Chimie Organique, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U266, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods', 'Iodobenzenes/*pharmacology', 'Kidney/enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Neprilysin/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Protease Inhibitors', 'Rabbits', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1992/07/15 00:00,1992/07/15 00:01,['1992/07/15 00:00'],"['1992/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.14.6388 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Jul 15;89(14):6388-92. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.14.6388.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Iodobenzenes)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '145253-48-1 (RB 104)', '56-12-2 (gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,PMC49506,,,,,,,,,,

Metabolic labeling of these cells indicates striking differences between early and late erythroblasts. In early erythroblasts, spectrin and ankyrin are synthesized in large amounts in the cytosol with proportionately high levels of spectrin and ankyrin messenger RNA (mRNA). In contrast, only small amounts of these polypeptides are incorporated into the skeleton, which is markedly unstable. In late erythroblasts, however, the synthesis of spectrin and ankyrin and their mRNA levels are substantially reduced, yet the net amounts of these polypeptides assembled in the membrane skeleton are markedly increased, and the membrane skeleton becomes stable with no detectable protein turnover. The mRNA levels and the synthesis of the band 3 and 4.1 proteins are increased considerably in terminally differentiated normoblasts with a concomitant increase in the net amount and the half-life of the newly assembled spectrin and ankyrin. Thus, the increased accumulation of spectrin and ankyrin at the late erythroblast stage is a consequence of an increased recruitment of these proteins on the membrane and an increase in their stability rather than a transcriptional upregulation. This is in contrast to band 3 and 4.1 proteins, which accumulate in direct proportion to their mRNA levels and rates of synthesis. These results suggest a key role for the band 3 and 4.1 proteins in conferring a long-term stability to the membrane skeleton during terminal red blood cell differentiation.","['Hanspal, M', 'Hanspal, J S', 'Kalraiya, R', 'Liu, S C', 'Sahr, K E', 'Howard, D', 'Palek, J']","['Hanspal M', 'Hanspal JS', 'Kalraiya R', 'Liu SC', 'Sahr KE', 'Howard D', 'Palek J']","[""Department of Biomedical Research, St Elizabeth's Hospital of Boston, Tufts University School of Medicine, MA 02135.""]",['eng'],"['P01-HL-37462/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-27215/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Anemia/blood/microbiology', 'Animals', 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/biosynthesis', 'Ankyrins', 'Blood Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', '*Erythrocyte Aging', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/blood/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Neuropeptides', 'Spectrin/biosynthesis', 'Spleen/metabolism']",1992/07/15 00:00,1992/07/15 00:01,['1992/07/15 00:00'],"['1992/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70632-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jul 15;80(2):530-9.,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (Ankyrins)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane band 4.1 protein)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1-like 1)', '12634-43-4 (Spectrin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MTX resistant cell line exhibited both increased dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activity due to gene amplification as well as impaired MTX uptake. An additional mechanism of resistance to MTX was a 2-fold increase in thymidine kinase (TK).

The process is associated with three biologic changes including: (i) adherence of hematopoietic cells to stromal cells forming 'cobblestone islands'; (ii) an intermediate stage [during which the cells show proliferation in suspension in the presence in leukemogenic stromal factor (LSF), a factor similar to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) released by irradiated stromal cells, and transient hematopoietic cell surface expression of MAC-1, and c-fms (M-CSF receptor)]; and (iii) a third stage of factor-independence. A monoclonal antibody to M-CSF receptor inhibited proliferation of intermediate stage but not all factor-independent cell subclones. In the present studies, a subclonal factor-independent malignant subline of FDC-P1JL26 derived by cocultivation with gamma-irradiated stromal cells as well as the parent clone and intermediate stage cells were shown to express significant levels of M-CSF polyA+ mRNA and M-CSF of at least two sizes (23 and 15 kDa) as detected by 35S-methionine labelling and immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-M-CSF antiserum. There was no significant difference in intracellular M-CSF protein size between cells at each of the three stages of biologic change. This M-CSF was not detected on the cell surface by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In contrast, c-fms expression at the cell surface was detected by FACS analysis and c-fms polyA+ mRNA was only detected during the intermediate stage of induction of factor-independence. FDC-P1JL26 parent cells, the subclone stimulated by LSF, and the factor-independent subclone, showed little or no detectable autophosphorylation of the c-fms receptor at tyrosine.

To have a better understanding of the role of LIF, it is important to determine the level of LIF in various biological samples by developing an easy, sensitive and LIF specific assay. In this study, we have established a double monoclonal antibody (mAb) based ELISA. Four hybridoma cell lines (D3.14.1, D4.16.9, D25.1.4 and D62.3.2) secreting murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor (rHuLIF) were produced by immunization of BALB/c mice with rHuLIF and by fusing immune spleen cells with P3X63Ag8U.1 myeloma cells. These mAbs each belong to the IgG1 isotype and have unique isoelectrofocusing point patterns. All four mAbs were shown to have high affinities for rHuLIF (Kd = 7 x 10(-10) to 6 x 10(-11) M) and were able to recognize the native as well as the reduced rHuLIF in an immunoblotting assay. All these mAbs showed no cross-reactivities to IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, TNF-alpha, GCSF and GMCSF. MAb D3.14.1 showed a weak binding to Oncostatin M but not to rMuLIF whereas the other three mAbs D4.16.9, D25.1.4 and D62.3.2 showed cross-reactivity to rMuLIF but not to Oncostatin M. Data obtained from a competitive binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) suggested that these four mAbs recognized different epitopes on rHuLIF. Using mAb D4.16.9 as coat antibody and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated mAb D3.14.1 as the conjugate antibody we established a double mAb based ELISA specific for human LIF which could detect as little as 100 pg/ml and 10 pg/ml of rHuLIF in the absence and in the presence of the ELAST ELISA amplification system, respectively. The addition of serum had very minimal effect on this ELISA.","['Kim, K J', 'Alphonso, M', 'Schmelzer, C H', 'Lowe, D']","['Kim KJ', 'Alphonso M', 'Schmelzer CH', 'Lowe D']","['Department of Medicinal Analytical Chemistry, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Epitopes', 'Growth Inhibitors/*analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*analysis/immunology', 'Precipitin Tests']",1992/11/25 00:00,1992/11/25 00:01,['1992/11/25 00:00'],"['1992/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(92)90005-E [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(92)90005-e [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1992 Nov 25;156(1):9-17. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(92)90005-e.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that nude.xid bone marrow is deficient in both CD45(B220)+ and CD45(B220)- surface (s)IgM- progenitors that give rise to B cell colonies in Whitlock-Witte cultures. CD45(B220)+ precursors had normal differentiation potential in vitro. CD45(B220)- precursors differentiated into CD45(B220)+ cells at the same rate as normal controls, but acquired sIgM at a much slower rate. These results correlated with the observation that in nude.xid mice the severity of B lineage defects correlates with maturity: a profound (ninefold) deficit of sIgM+, CD45(B220)+ mature B cells, a fivefold deficit in the sIgM-, CD45(B220)+ precursors of short term B cell colonies (colonies forming within 4-5 days in Whitlock-Witte cultures), and a moderate (twofold) decrease in the frequency of sIgM-, CD45(B220)- (less mature) precursors of long term B cell colonies (colonies forming after 14 days of Whitlock-Witte culture. Thus the combination of the nude and xid mutations produces a deficiency in early B cell progenitors and the deficiency becomes more profound with further maturation. Therefore the lack of mature B cells is the result of a cascade effect. Inasmuch as bone marrow progenitors are affected, and these are the source of the vast majority of B cells, most B cells are affected by the xid mutation and the xid defect cannot be attributed to a loss of a fetal lineage of B cells. These results suggest that xid affected cells lack the capacity to progress efficiently through differentiation in the absence of an exogenous factor(s) that is dependent on the product of a normal allele at the nude locus. This product might be supplied in vivo by a T cell or T cell-dependent source and/or epithelial elements such as bone marrow stromal cells all of which are known to be affected by the nude mutation.","['Chung, H Y', 'Dong, Z', 'Wortis, H H']","['Chung HY', 'Dong Z', 'Wortis HH']","['Department of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111.']",['eng'],['R37 AI 15803-13/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Dec 1;149(11):3456-62.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior sequence analysis has shown two potential TATA box motifs in the human alpha 2A adrenergic receptor gene, TATATAT and TATAAAA, located 427 and 1037 base pairs (bp), respectively, upstream of the protein coding region. RNase protection experiments and primer extension show that transcription starts downstream of the distal TATAAAA, indicating that the 5'-untranslated region is approximately 1 kilobase in length. We have used the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and transient transfection into HT29, a human adenocarcinoma cell line that expresses the alpha 2A receptor, to show that as little as 150 bp upstream of the cap site can direct transcription. Sequence analysis shows that although this region contains the TATA box motif it lacks a CCAAT box motif. DNase I footprint analysis of a fragment from -17 to -193 (where +1 is the transcription initiation site), using nuclear extracts from HT29, showed hypersensitive sites (-68/-69) and two protected regions: -70 to -87, which includes a 10-bp palindrome, and -92 to -105, which includes a GC box, a common motif for Sp1 nuclear factor binding. Gel mobility shift assays indicate that Sp1 or a related factor may bind to this GC box. Deletion of the GC box and the palindrome from chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs abolishes transcription. We propose that these cis sequences may function in lieu of a CCAAT box to regulate transcription of the human alpha 2A adrenergic receptor gene.","['Handy, D E', 'Gavras, H']","['Handy DE', 'Gavras H']","['Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Massachusetts 02118.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Poly A/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', '*TATA Box', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/25 00:00,1992/11/25 00:01,['1992/11/25 00:00'],"['1992/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)35938-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Nov 25;267(33):24017-22.,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hypophosphorylated forms of Rb are observed in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas the hyperphosphorylated forms predominate in S and G2/M phases, suggesting that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Rb may regulate progression through the growth cycle. However, little is known about the intracellular signals that regulate phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Rb. We show that D-erythro-sphingosine potently induces early dephosphorylation of Rb. Initial dephosphorylation was observed as early as 1 h after treatment of hematopoietic cells with sphingosine, whereas complete shift to the dephosphorylated form was seen 4 h after treatment. These effects occurred at concentrations of sphingosine as low as 100-500 nM, with maximal effects observed at 1-2.5 microM. These effects were specific to sphingosine, inasmuch as other lipids, amphiphiles, and long chain amino bases, as well as structural analogs of sphingosine, failed to induce dephosphorylation of Rb.

Second, clonogenic blast cells will increase in suspension cultures. Both methods can be used to assess the sensitivity of blasts to chemotherapeutic drugs, but different dose-response curves are obtained with each. Thus cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) is more toxic to clonogenic blasts in suspension than in methylcellulose, while for 5-azacytidine (5-aza) the reverse is seen. Arabinofuranosyl-5-Azacytosine (ara-AC) combines the chemical features of the two drugs. That is, its sugar moiety has the same diastereomeric change in the furanose ring as ara-C and its pyrimidine ring has the same substitution of nitrogen for carbon at the 5' position as 5-aza. We compared the sensitivity of AML blasts with ara-Ac in suspension and in methylcellulose. As a control, the same comparison was made for the sensitivities to ara-C. Blast cells were less sensitive to ara-AC than to ara-C under all conditions; but, ara-AC sensitivity was greater for cells in methylcellulose than for cells in suspension. Thus, AML blasts respond to ara-AC in culture with a pattern similar to that of 5-aza and opposite to that of ara-C. Since ara-C is a more useful drug in the treatment of AML than 5-aza, we interpret the culture results as predicting that ara-AC may not be effective in AML.","['Yang, G S', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Yang GS', 'McCulloch EA']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1992;6(3):125-30.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5V71D8JOKK (fazarabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If purified nuclei were heated for 45 min at 37 degrees C, the final matrix exhibited well-recognizable nucleolar remnants, an inner network and a peripheral lamina. Without such incubation only the peripheral lamina was seen surrounding homogeneous, finely granular material. Similar results were obtained with both araldite-embedded and freeze-fractured nuclear matrices, although in the latter case the loose granular material was not evident. Observations of araldite-embedded, heat-treated nuclei revealed clumping of heterochromatin in small, very electron-dense masses with large interchromatin spaces. These ultrastructural aspects were even more striking in freeze-fractured nuclei. Cytochemical matrix analysis by osmium-amine staining for nucleic acids and DNase-gold labelling for DNA localization demonstrated that also matrix residual nucleic acids, mostly RNA, are stabilized by heat exposure of isolated nuclei. The results demonstrate that the morphology of heat-stabilized nuclear matrix is not artefactually affected during the preparation for conventional electron microscopy and suggest a possible involvement of nucleic acids in the heat-induced stabilization of the nuclear matrix.","['Falcieri, E', 'Gobbi, P', 'Sabatelli, P', 'Santi, S', 'Farabegoli, F', 'Rana, R', 'Cataldi, A', 'Maraldi, N M', 'Martelli, A M']","['Falcieri E', 'Gobbi P', 'Sabatelli P', 'Santi S', 'Farabegoli F', 'Rana R', 'Cataldi A', 'Maraldi NM', 'Martelli AM']","['Istituto di Anatomia Umana Normale, Universita di Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Histochemistry,Histochemistry,0411300,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Freeze Fracturing', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Matrix/*ultrastructure', 'Plastic Embedding', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00717003 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochemistry. 1992 Sep;98(2):121-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00717003.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Purification of the serum activity by anion exchange chromatography, molecular sieve HPLC, and hydroxyl apatite chromatography yielded material 82% pure with a molecular weight of 17 kDa by SDS-PAGE.

There was a 42.6% reduction in the production of spontaneous IL-1 activity in EC supernatants after coculture with 10 micrograms/ml TTR. TTR was subsequently found by ELISA to inhibit LPS-stimulated IL-1 production by cells of the human monocytic leukemia line THP-1 by 47.1 +/- 9.4%, whereas a less striking but still significant inhibition of monocyte-derived IL-1 beta production was also observed. Inhibition of IL-1 secretion correlated with increased IL-1 mRNA synthesis in both THP-1 cells and monocytes. Furthermore, TTR was associated with increased intracellular concentrations of IL-1 beta. These data suggest that TTR functions by inhibiting processing of newly synthesized peptide for secretion.

METHODS: Six bone marrow (BM) and 10 peripheral blood (PB) samples were obtained from 2 normal individuals, 3 patients with CML and 9 with ANLL. The CD34+ cell fraction was isolated using MY10 antibody, sheep anti-mouse immunomagnetic beads and the enzyme chymopapain. Indirect immunofluorescence and semisolid culture were employed to evaluate the percentage of CD34+ cells and that of clonogenic cells in each cell fraction. RESULTS: The frequency of CD34+ cells in the original unseparated populations was (mean +/- SE) 24.3 +/- 7.3%, and reached 85.0 +/- 2.7% in the isolated CD34-positive fractions; in the negative fractions it was only 2.7 +/- 1.7%. According to these results, the great majority of clonogenic cells was separated in the CD34-positive fractions and depleted in those CD34-negative. Moreover, chymopapain was shown to be non-toxic to the clonogenic cells.

However, IL-4 interacted synergistically with G-CSF to further reduce the colony number (46% +/- 8% of control colonies) and suppress the self-renewal ability (clonogenicity) of U937 cells. This synergistic effect was not eliminated by cultures containing neutralizing concentrations of anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (anti-GM-CSF), anti-interleukin 6 (anti-IL-6), anti-interferon-alpha (anti-IFN-alpha), anti-IFN-gamma, anti-transforming growth factor-beta (anti-TGF-beta) serum, and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) serum. The coexistence of IL-4 and G-CSF was required for at least 48 h to reveal the synergistic action as assessed by preincubation and delayed addition experiments. Combinations of IL-4 and G-CSF showed a significant increase in CD11b expression on U937 cells. This action was not observed with HL60, K562, ML-1, or KG-1 leukemic cell lines, and IL-4 did not show any synergistic suppression of clonogenicity of U937 leukemic cells in combination with other cytokines tested in this study. These results suggest that IL-4 in combination with G-CSF may have some capacity to synergistically suppress human leukemic cells of specific types with loss of clonogenicity.","['Maekawa, T', 'Sonoda, Y', 'Kuzuyama, Y', 'Inazawa, J', 'Kimura, S', 'Nakamichi, K', 'Abe, T']","['Maekawa T', 'Sonoda Y', 'Kuzuyama Y', 'Inazawa J', 'Kimura S', 'Nakamichi K', 'Abe T']","['Department of Hygiene, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antibodies/analysis/immunology/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Nov;20(10):1201-7.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kidney or eye tissues from 11 of 13 fish from netpens with clinical PL had reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. This RT activity was associated with virus particles of retrovirus morphology and buoyant density. In a transmission experiment, PL-positive donor fish tissues also had RT activity and virus particles of retrovirus morphology and buoyant density, as did recipient fish tissues following development of the disease 6 weeks postinjection with a tissue homogenate from the donor fish. Kidney and spleen tissues from fish that developed PL following injection with an inoculum that was passed through a 0.22-micron filter, in a separate experiment (M. L. Kent and S. C. Dawe. Further evidence for a viral etiology in the plasmacytoid leukemia of chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. Dis. Aquat. Org., in press, 1992), also exhibited RT activity.

The study was undertaken to determine if there were differences among treatments in these functional areas as a consequence of differential long-term gonadal damage in the three regimens. METHODS: Ninety-three disease-free survivors of advanced Hodgkin disease (56 men and 37 women) were studied (a minimum of 1 year after completion of treatment) by an interview conducted over the telephone. Standardized measures were used to assess their psychologic, sexual, family, and vocational functioning, including the following tests: the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale--Self Report, the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Profile of Mood States, and the Impact of Event Scale. RESULTS: Contrary to expectation, no statistically significant differences in survivors' psychosocial adaptation or psychosexual function were found by treatment arm. Infertility (based on survivors' reports of medical test results and perceptions) and lower income 1 year before the diagnosis of cancer were significant predictors of poorer adjustment. Most survivors reported a range of problems that they attributed to having had cancer: 35%, proven or perceived infertility; 24%, sexual problems; 31%, health and life insurance problems; 26%, a negative socioeconomic effect; and 51%, conditioned nausea, associated with visual or olfactory reminders of chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: No significant long-term advantage in psychosocial adaptation or psychosexual function was found for survivors of Hodgkin disease treated by the less gonadally toxic ABVD regimen 1 to 5 years after completion of treatment.","['Kornblith, A B', 'Anderson, J', 'Cella, D F', 'Tross, S', 'Zuckerman, E', 'Cherin, E', 'Henderson, E S', 'Canellos, G P', 'Kosty, M P', 'Cooper, M R']","['Kornblith AB', 'Anderson J', 'Cella DF', 'Tross S', 'Zuckerman E', 'Cherin E', 'Henderson ES', 'Canellos GP', 'Kosty MP', 'Cooper MR', 'et al.']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['CA 03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Psychological Tests', 'Self-Assessment', 'Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological/etiology', 'Social Adjustment', 'Vinblastine', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19921115)70:10<2508::aid-cncr2820701020>3.0.co;2-v [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Nov 15;70(10):2508-16. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19921115)70:10<2508::aid-cncr2820701020>3.0.co;2-v.,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study of 242 cases.,2436-43,"BACKGROUND: The French-American-British group's proposal for the classification of chronic lymphoid leukemias is unique at this time. Testing, expanding, and adding to the theory by immunophenotyping will help to additionally characterize this group of diseases. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 242 patients with chronic lymphoid leukemias were analyzed for immunologic evaluation of the following subtypes: typical chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 189; CLL with pleomorphic lymphocytes (CLL-pleo), 19; CLL of mixed cell type (CLL/PL), 20; prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), 22; hairy cell leukemia (HCL), 10; HCL-variant, 1; and splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, 1. RESULTS: The phenotype of CLL and CLL-pleo was weak surface immunoglobulin (SIg) with positive results of mouse rosettes (MR+), CD5+, and CD22-. Of PLL and HCL, it was strong SIg, MR-, CD5-, and CD22+. By analyzing the four markers and accepting the relevant results of two or more as sufficient for diagnosis, all cases (100%) of CLL, CLL-pleo, PLL, and HCL were diagnosed. CLL/PL showed the phenotype of CLL in 66.67% and of PLL in 33.33% of patients. The frequency of cases with weak fluorescence in decreasing order was CLL, CLL-pleo, CLL/PL, and PLL and HCL. The same sequence applied to the mean percentage of mouse rosette-forming cells and CD5 cells, but the sequence was reversed for CD22 cells. CONCLUSIONS: SIg intensity, MR, CD5, and CD22 constitute the minimum number of immune markers for the differential diagnosis of the subtypes of chronic lymphoid leukemia. The frequency of the four markers among the subtypes suggested that CLL and CLL-pleo have identical phenotypes and that the five subtypes follow a continuous range of B-cell differentiation from early mature (CLL and CLL-pleo) to late mature pre-plasma cell stages (PLL followed by HCL), with CLL/PL of intermediate maturity.","['Batata, A', 'Shen, B']","['Batata A', 'Shen B']","['Department of Pathology, Cox Institute, Wright State University School of Medicine, Dayton, Ohio 45429.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD5 Antigens', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Rosette Formation', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19921115)70:10<2436::aid-cncr2820701009>3.0.co;2-c [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Nov 15;70(10):2436-43. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19921115)70:10<2436::aid-cncr2820701009>3.0.co;2-c.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mean yields of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM) with cytotoxic/G-CSF mobilization were significantly higher than those with cytotoxic mobilization (18.6 vs 8.40 x 10(4)/kg). The optimal timing of collection was different between these two mobilizations; the mean number of days to a peak level of circulating CFU-GM after cytotoxic/G-CSF mobilization was less than that after cytotoxic mobilization (24.2 vs 27.7 days). The leukocyte level on the day of peak CFU-GM was significantly higher in cytotoxic/G-CSF mobilization than that in cytotoxic mobilization (mean 12.8 vs 2.7 x 10(9)/l), whereas the platelet level was not different (mean 132 vs 125 x 10(9)/l). Increasing patient age was not a major adverse factor for PBSC collection. Synchronous recovery of both leukocytes and platelets was critical for achieving a high CFU-GM yield in these two mobilizations. Following PBSC autotransplantation, the rate of trilineage hematologic reconstitution showed a significant correlation with the infused dose of CFU-GM, whether they were collected with cytotoxic or cytotoxic/G-CSF mobilization. These results suggest that G-CSF can expand the PBSC pool and that CFU-GM yield after cytotoxic/G-CSF mobilization may predict trilineage hemopoietic reconstitution after ABSCT, as well as cytotoxic mobilization.","['Teshima, T', 'Harada, M', 'Takamatsu, Y', 'Makino, K', 'Taniguchi, S', 'Inaba, S', 'Kondo, S', 'Tanaka, T', 'Akashi, K', 'Minamishima, I']","['Teshima T', 'Harada M', 'Takamatsu Y', 'Makino K', 'Taniguchi S', 'Inaba S', 'Kondo S', 'Tanaka T', 'Akashi K', 'Minamishima I', 'et al.']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Blood Cells/*drug effects/*transplantation', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia/blood/surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/surgery', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992 Sep;10(3):215-20.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings suggest a common step in receptor-mediated signal transduction leading to exocytosis and transcription and imply that immunosuppressive drugs target specific signal transduction pathways, rather than specific cell types. This hypothesis is supported by studies on the effect of rapamycin on IL-3 dependent proliferation of the rodent mast cell line PT18. Rapamycin inhibits proliferation of PT18 cells, achieving a plateau of 80% inhibition at 1 nM. This inhibition is prevented in a competitive manner by FK506, a structural analogue of rapamycin. Proliferation of rat basophilic leukemia cells and WEHI-3 cells was also inhibited, at doses comparable to those shown previously to inhibit IL-2-dependent proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte line (CTLL) cells. In contrast, proliferation of A-431 cells, a epidermoid cell line, was not affected by rapamycin. DNA histograms indicate that complexes formed between the rapamycin-FK506-binding protein (FKBP) and rapamycin arrest-proliferating PT18 cells in the G0/G1-phase. It is concluded that FKBP-rapamycin complexes may inhibit proliferative signals emanating from IL-3 receptors, resulting in growth arrest of cytokine-dependent, hematopoietic cells.","['Hultsch, T', 'Martin, R', 'Hohman, R J']","['Hultsch T', 'Martin R', 'Hohman RJ']","['Allergic Diseases Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cyclohexanols', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Polyenes/*pharmacology', 'Pyrans', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*drug effects', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus', 'Tacrolimus/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.3.9.981 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1992 Sep;3(9):981-7. doi: 10.1091/mbc.3.9.981.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclohexanols)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (immunophilin ligand 506BD)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",,,,PMC275659,,,,,,,,,,

To support observations made with the MTT assay, clonogenic assays were performed. PME, 50 mmol/L at 37 degrees C resulted in total depletion (> 5 logs) of U937 colonies. Progressive depletion of normal progenitor cells occurred when BM was incubated with PME at concentrations from 5 to 100 mmol/L. At 37 degrees C, 50 mmol/L PME reduced colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage and burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) recovery by 98%. Recombinant human mast cell factor augmented BFU-E after PME treatment but had no effect on HL-60 or U937. These studies suggest that PME deserves further study as an agent for ex vivo marrow purging.","['Rosenfeld, C S']",['Rosenfeld CS'],"['Western Pennsylvania Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phenylalanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79336-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 1;80(9):2401-5.,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '2577-90-4 (phenylalanine methyl ester)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the concerns for toxicity and increased rate of infections, treatment approaches varied considerably in the past with mixed results. However, experience on the recently completed Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) 8498 AML study suggests that DS children with AML constitute a distinct subgroup that responds well to therapy. Twelve of 285 children on POG 8498 (protocol for newly diagnosed AML) had DS. Children with DS and AML were predominantly male (9 of 12) and were quite younger at diagnosis (< 24 months in 10). The white blood cell count was less than 50 x 10(3)/microL in all 12 and French-American-British types M6 and M7 were frequent (5 of 12). An abnormal cytogenetic marker, in addition to constitutional trisomy 21, was present in 9 of 12 and involved chromosome 8 in 4 of 9. All cases studied (n = 5) were positive for myeloid cell surface markers (CD33, CD13, or CD11b) and, interestingly, were also positive for the CD7 antigen. Chemotherapy included daunorubicin, cytarabine (Ara-C), and 6-thioguanine for remission induction and featured high-dose Ara-C (3 g/m2 per dose) with or without L-asparaginase early in remission. Compared with children without DS, children with DS had a superior event-free survival (EFS at 4 years 100% v 28% +/- 6.2%; P = .003). The EFS remained superior even when compared with non-DS children less than 2 years of age with a white blood cell count less than 10 x 100,000/microL (100% v 48% +/- 17.3%; P = .01).","['Ravindranath, Y', 'Abella, E', 'Krischer, J P', 'Wiley, J', 'Inoue, S', 'Harris, M', 'Chauvenet, A', 'Alvarado, C S', 'Dubowy, R', 'Ritchey, A K']","['Ravindranath Y', 'Abella E', 'Krischer JP', 'Wiley J', 'Inoue S', 'Harris M', 'Chauvenet A', 'Alvarado CS', 'Dubowy R', 'Ritchey AK', 'et al.']","[""Children's Hospital of Michigan, Wayne State University, Detroit.""]",['eng'],"['CA-28476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79311-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 1;80(9):2210-4.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1', 'POMP protocol']",['Blood. 1993 Jun 1;81(11):3164.

The CD34+/DR- population does not express any known antigens associated with myeloid or lymphoid lineage and has been shown by us and others to contain primitive hematopoietic progenitors capable of both self-renewal and differentiation to myeloid lineage. CD34+/DR- cells obtained from normal human BM by fluorescence-activated cell sorting were plated on allogeneic, irradiated BM stromal layers. After 5 weeks of culture in the presence of media containing recombinant interleukin-2 and human serum, 147- +/- 21-fold expansion of cells with the morphologic appearance of large granular lymphocytes was observed. Cultured cells (84.8% +/- 1.5%) expressed the characteristic CD56+/CD3- phenotype of NK. A proportion of CD56+/CD3- cells expressed other markers of lymphoid lineage that have been associated with mature NK, including CD2 (7.8% +/- 1.2%), CD7 (19.5% +/- 2.8), CD8 (3.1% +/- 1.0%), and CD16 (4.5% +/- 1.3%). The cultured cells did not express other antigens associated with T-lymphocyte (CD3, CD5, T-cell receptor [TCR] alpha/beta and TCR gamma/delta), B-lymphocyte (CD19), myeloid (MY8, CD33, and CD71), or monocytoid (CD14 and CD15) lineage and did not express the CD34 antigen associated with hematopoietic progenitors present on the starting population. This NK population was cytotoxic against both K562 (E:T 20:1; 79% +/- 1.9%) and Raji (E:T 20:1; 38% +/- 5.7%) target cell lines. The NK progenitor frequency in the CD34+/DR- cell population determined by limiting dilution of CD34+DR- on stromal layers followed by a functional chromium release assay against K562 targets was 1:169 +/- 50 CD34+/DR- cells. The data suggest that human LTBMC developed to study myeloid differentiation can be modified to study the origin and development of the NK and possibly other lymphoid lineages. Modified cultures show that cells with morphologic, phenotypic, and functional characteristics of NK can be derived from a population of BMMNC with the phenotype of primitive hematopoietic progenitors and without phenotypic evidence of lymphoid- or myeloid-lineage commitment. Further studies will address the cell of origin and the ontogeny of human NK and other lymphoid lineages.","['Miller, J S', 'Verfaillie, C', 'McGlave, P']","['Miller JS', 'Verfaillie C', 'McGlave P']","['Division of Hematology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['F32-CA-09116-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-4581401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79307-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 1;80(9):2182-7.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High levels of FLT3 expression were detected in 92% of the cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tested, ranging from the M1 to the M5 stages of differentiation assessed in the French-American-British classification. Immature (MO) AML cells, biphenotypic leukemias, and AML with megakaryocytic differentiation (M7 subtype) also expressed the FLT3 transcript. FLT3 was also expressed at high levels in acute lymphoid leukemias of T and B origins. Finally, it was not expressed in chronic myeloid leukemias in chronic phase, whereas it was expressed in most blast crisis samples. This pattern of expression of FLT3 contrasts with the expression of FMS and KIT restricted to myeloid leukemias, and suggests that the FLT3 product could play a role in the expansion of the leukemic blasts of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineages.","['Birg, F', 'Courcoul, M', 'Rosnet, O', 'Bardin, F', 'Pebusque, M J', 'Marchetto, S', 'Tabilio, A', 'Mannoni, P', 'Birnbaum, D']","['Birg F', 'Courcoul M', 'Rosnet O', 'Bardin F', 'Pebusque MJ', 'Marchetto S', 'Tabilio A', 'Mannoni P', 'Birnbaum D']","[""Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Unite 119 de l'INSERM, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'DNA Probes', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, fms', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76669-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 15;80(10):2584-93.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,"['FLT3', 'FMS', 'KIT']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of membrane-associated receptors was quantified by double labeling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with monoclonal antibodies against CD19 and p55/p75 TNF receptors and flow cytometry. A high fraction of the CD19+ cells expressed the p55 receptor (44% +/- 34% [SD]) and p75 receptor (61% +/- 31%). In healthy controls, 0% to 1% of the CD19+ cells expressed the p55 receptor and 0% to 10% expressed the p75 receptor. Incubation of CD19+ cells with 10 ng/mL of TNF increased the incorporation of thymidine in 11 patients tested, and this was decreased to 65% (P < .05) by antibodies to the p55 receptor or the p75 receptor, and to 35% +/- 7% (P < .001) when both antibodies were combined. With an enzyme-linked immunoassay, we measured soluble TNF receptors in serum from CLL patients. The mean level of p55 receptors was increased to 12.9 +/- 8.9 ng/mL (P < .000001 v normal). The mean level of p75 receptors was increased to 13 +/- 24 ng/mL (P = .01 v normal). The membrane expression of the two receptors was positively correlated (r +/- 97, P < .01); however, there was no correlation between membrane expression and serum concentration of either receptor. Autologous serum containing high levels of soluble TNF receptors inhibited TNF-induced proliferation of CD19+ cells. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that neoplastic cells from patients with CLL have increased expression of p55 and p75 TNF receptors, and that both receptors mediate signal to proliferation. Furthermore, serum from CLL patients has elevated levels of soluble TNF receptors, which may counteract the proliferative effect of TNF.","['Waage, A', 'Liabakk, N', 'Lien, E', 'Lamvik, J', 'Espevik, T']","['Waage A', 'Liabakk N', 'Lien E', 'Lamvik J', 'Espevik T']","['Department of Medicine, University of Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis/immunology', 'Blood', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)76668-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Nov 15;80(10):2577-83.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include cells detected in standard colony assays as well as their more primitive precursors. The latter are referred to as long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) because of their ability to generate clonogenic cell progeny detectable after a minimum of 5 weeks incubation on competent fibroblast feeder layers. In this study, we have investigated a number of the properties of the LTC-IC and clonogenic cells present in the blood of such CML patients with high WBC counts. This included an analysis of the light scattering properties of these progenitors, as well as their expression of CD34 and HLA-DR, Rhodamine-123 staining, and in vitro sensitivity to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide. In the case of LTC-IC, the production of different types of lineage-restricted and multipotent progeny was also analyzed. Most of the circulating LTC-IC and clonogenic cells in the CML patients studied (on average approximately 70% and approximately 90%, respectively) showed features of proliferating or activated cells. This is in marked contrast to the majority of progenitors in the blood of normal individuals and most of the LTC-IC in normal marrow, all of which exhibit a phenotype expected of quiescent cells. Interestingly, a significant proportion of the circulating clonogenic cells and LTC-IC in the CML samples studied (on average approximately 10% and approximately 30%, respectively) appeared to be phenotypically similar to normal circulating progenitors, although their absolute numbers were indicative of a neoplastic origin. Both phenotypes of circulating CML clonogenic cells and LTC-IC could be obtained at approximately 10% to 20% purity by differential multiparameter sorting.

All myeloid and most lymphoid leukaemia samples tested were CR1-negative: two of the 42 leukaemia samples expressed minute amounts of CR1. Lack of CR1 in leukaemia cells was confirmed with two mAbs raised against CR1, 31R, and 243R, which recognized different epitopes and induced different degrees of CR1-mediated fluorescent shift on flow-cytometry in granulocytes and erythrocytes. MCP was increased in most chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and was also increased in majority of acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL), acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Levels of DAF were also high in CML and CLL, and were variable in other types of leukaemia: some were DAF-negative while others expressed extremely high levels of DAF. In CML patients, the high level of MCP and the lack of CR1 were normalized after medical treatment. These results are in agreement with the data obtained with human leukaemia cell lines, and support the hypothesis that CR1 is essentially a differentiated cell antigen and that a high level of MCP reflects some malignant transformation or an immature stage in blood cells.","['Hara, T', 'Kojima, A', 'Fukuda, H', 'Masaoka, T', 'Fukumori, Y', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Seya, T']","['Hara T', 'Kojima A', 'Fukuda H', 'Masaoka T', 'Fukumori Y', 'Matsumoto M', 'Seya T']","['Department of Immunology, Centre for Adult Diseases Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Blood Proteins/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'CD55 Antigens', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'Membrane Cofactor Protein', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Receptors, Complement 3b/*analysis']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06431.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Oct;82(2):368-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06431.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CD46 protein, human)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Membrane Cofactor Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Administration of G-CSF increased the numbers of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) by a median of 76-fold above basal levels. Maximal levels of PBPC were observed on days 5 and 6 after G-CSF treatment. In two patients a second cycle of G-CSF mobilised PBPC to levels comparable with those seen after the first cycle of G-CSF treatment. An earlier hemopoietic cell population (pre-CFC's) was also mobilised with levels increased up to 50-fold above basal levels. Using a standard mononuclear cell leukapheresis technique the PBPC were collected extremely efficiently (essentially 100%) and could be further successfully enriched by separation using a Ficoll gradient. For patients who underwent the optimal collection protocol (i.e. leukapheresis on days 5, 6 and 7) a total of 32 +/- 6 x 10(4) GM-CFC kg-1 were collected.

However, it is difficult to assess metastatic spread of a subcutaneously injected or inoculated cell line, since an exact detection of all microfoci of human tumour cells in the animals by usual histological procedures would require extensive sectioning of the whole animal. To overcome this problem, we transduced human breast cancer cells with a replication-defective Moloney murine leukaemia retroviral vector (M-MuLV) containing both neoR (neomycin resistance) and lacZ genes. The resulting cell lines were selected for antibiotic (G418) resistance, and cell-sorted for lacZ expression. lacZ continued to be expressed in cultured cells for at least 20 passages without further G418 selection. The lacZ gene codes for beta-D-galactosidase, and cells expressing this gene stain blue with the chromogenic substrate X-gal. The lacZ-expressing cells retained the pre-transduction ability to traverse Matrigel in vitro, to form subcutaneous tumours in nude mice, and to grow invasively with the formation of metastases. X-gal staining showed high specificity, staining the tumour cells but not the surrounding mouse tissue on either whole tissue blocks or histological sections. The staining procedure was highly sensitive, allowing detection of microfoci of human cancer cells, and quantitative estimation of the metastatic capacity of the cells. These results indicate that lacZ transduction of human tumour cells is a powerful means of studying human cancer cell invasion and metastases in vivo.","['Brunner, N', 'Thompson, E W', 'Spang-Thomsen, M', 'Rygaard, J', 'Dano, K', 'Zwiebel, J A']","['Brunner N', 'Thompson EW', 'Spang-Thomsen M', 'Rygaard J', 'Dano K', 'Zwiebel JA']","['Finsen Laboratory, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Chromogenic Compounds/analysis', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Galactosides/analysis', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Indoles/analysis', '*Lac Operon', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/pathology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(92)90245-W [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(92)90245-w [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1992;28A(12):1989-95. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(92)90245-w.,"['0 (Chromogenic Compounds)', '0 (Galactosides)', '0 (Indoles)', 'V595OG374W (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-galactoside)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoid cells within the blood comprised very few T cells, sub-normal numbers of monocytes, and 80% of B lineage cells which were at a late stage of differentiation.

In each tissue, the B lineage cells were at an earlier differentiation stage, as defined phenotypically, than the circulating B lineage cells found in blood 3 days prior to death. Analysis of B cell markers and CD45 was used to define the differentiation stage of the relevant B cell populations, revealing a series of differentiation stages. The least mature B lineage cells (CD45hi) were found in lymph node. However, the CD45 isoform expressed was CD45R0, unlike most normal lymph node B cells. More differentiated B lineage cells (CD45med) were found in the bone marrow, and three sequential stages of pre-plasma cells were found in the spleen (CD45bright, CD45moderate, and CD45low-neg), all of which were CD45R0+. The B cells in normal spleen and bone marrow are CD45RA+. The presence of monoclonal B lineage cells in spleen was confirmed by Southern blotting. The B lineage cells from peripheral blood 3 days prior to death were approaching an end-stage plasma cell stage (CD45low/-). On B lineage cells from the various myeloma tissues, a concomitant loss of CD11b and increasing density of CD29 were observed as a function of progression to terminally differentiated stages.","['Jensen, G S', 'Mant, M J', 'Pilarski, L M']","['Jensen GS', 'Mant MJ', 'Pilarski LM']","['Department of Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Autopsy', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'CD11 Antigens', 'CD18 Antigens', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1', 'Isomerism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830410311 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1992 Nov;41(3):199-208. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830410311.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under nonreducing conditions, S-HCL 2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) precipitates a glycoprotein of 80-86 kDa. Under reducing conditions, a dimer of 43 and 39 kDa, with core proteins of 40 and 36 kDa, is precipitated. CD72 expression in normal and malignant tissues is different from expression of all other previously described human B-cell antigens. In peripheral blood and bone marrow, the antigen appears to be present on all B lymphocytes, with the exception of plasma cells. In tissue, immunohistochemical staining revealed positivity for all known B-cell compartments; however, pulpa macrophages of the spleen and von Kupffer cells exhibited distinct positivity for CD72 also. Among 83 malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas examined by immunohistochemistry (alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique), all 54 B-cell lymphomas, including precursor B-cell lymphomas, Burkitt's lymphomas, germinal center lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemias, and hairy cell leukemias, were CD72 positive, but no T-cell lymphomas were. Flow cytometry study of more than 80 mainly acute leukemias (52 B-cell leukemias) showed reactivity with S-HCL 2 mAb over the full range of B-cell differentiation. In particular, very early B cells in cytoplasmic Ig (cIg)-negative, CD19-positive pre-pre-B-cell leukemias and hybrid leukemias (mixed myeloid and B-cell type) were consistently positive for CD72 on the cell surface.

It has been previously shown that in vivo treatment with large bolus doses of corticosteroid can induce a down regulation of the number of IMMC in the rat. Previous in vitro studies of the RBL cell line have shown that culture in the presence of high doses of dexamethasone can induce an increase in cellular histamine content similar to that induced by other agents known to reduce the rate of cell division such as 5-hydroxyurea or sodium butyrate. In our studies the rat mucosal mast cell like cell line RBL-2H3 was cultured in the continuous presence of dexamethasone for periods of up to 4 weeks. Cell-associated histamine levels were found not to increase significantly at the doses of the corticosteroid we used. Of greater interest was the observation that levels of the mucosal mast cell specific protease RMCPII were dramatically reduced in these dexamethasone-treated cultures even at doses that might be considered to be physiologically relevant. This effect could be observed at 3 days after dexamethasone treatment and a continued reduction of RMCPII content was noted up to 4 weeks, at which time RMCPII levels were less than 5% of the control values in 10(-7) M dexamethasone treated cells. 5-Hydroxyurea did not reduce cellular RMCPII content even at a concentration which substantially reduced the rate of cell division and significantly increased cell associated histamine content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Saunders, P R', 'Marshall, J S']","['Saunders PR', 'Marshall JS']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Virology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Agents Actions,Agents and actions,0213341,IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Rats', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01991220 [doi]'],ppublish,Agents Actions. 1992 May;36(1-2):4-10. doi: 10.1007/BF01991220.,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (cytotoxic T lymphocyte-specific serine protease)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comparative study.,305-13,"Lymphocytes leave the blood via post-capillary venules by binding initially to their specialized endothelium. CD44 is a 80-90 kDa hyaluronate-binding glycoprotein involved in binding to endothelium of high endothelial venules (HEV). LECAM-1 is a 75-85 kDa glycoprotein with lectin activity interacting with human peripheral lymph node vascular addressin (PNAd) on HEV. This immunohistochemical study shows that CD44 and LECAM-1 are essentially coordinately expressed on B-lymphocytes. The mode and level of CD44/LECAM-1 expression dissect the peripheral B-cell development into stages that are closely linked to morphologically defined B-cell compartments. Although statistically correlated in B-cell leukaemias (p < 0.0009) and extranodal B-cell lymphomas (p < 0.003), expression of both molecules was less stringently coordinated in 127 B-cell neoplasms examined. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, hairy cell leukaemia and mantle zone lymphoma were CD44/LECAM-1 positive, thus corresponding to their reactive counterparts. Correspondingly, follicular centre cell-derived lymphomas were devoid of both markers. Conversely, CD44 and LEC-AM-1 were infrequently detectable in extranodal malignant B-cell neoplasms, irrespective of their maturational state.

As these RT proteins are also deficient of RNaseH, our results suggest overlapping or identical catalytic sites for degradation of the substrates RNA/DNA and RNA/RNA.","['Ben-Artzi, H', 'Zeelon, E', 'Le-Grice, S F', 'Gorecki, M', 'Panet, A']","['Ben-Artzi H', 'Zeelon E', 'Le-Grice SF', 'Gorecki M', 'Panet A']","['BioTechnology General Ltd, Kiryat Weizmann, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['AI/GH31147-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM46623/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Endoribonucleases/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', '*Escherichia coli Proteins', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/*enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease III', 'Substrate Specificity']",1992/10/11 00:00,1992/10/11 00:01,['1992/10/11 00:00'],"['1992/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/20.19.5115 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1992 Oct 11;20(19):5115-8. doi: 10.1093/nar/20.19.5115.,"['0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (Ribonuclease III)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (ribonuclease III, E coli)']",,,,PMC334292,,,,,,,,,,

In feeder-dependent culture, PGCs will proliferate for up to 7 days, but their numbers eventually decline and their proliferative capacity is only a fraction of that seen in vivo. Here we report a further factor that stimulates PGC proliferation in vitro, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Furthermore, bFGF, in the presence of steel factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor, stimulates long-term proliferation of PGCs, leading to the derivation of large colonies of cells. These embryonic germ cells resemble embryonic stem cells, pluripotent cells derived from preimplantation embryos, or feeder-dependent embryonal carcinoma cells, pluripotent stem cells of PGC-derived tumours (teratomas and teratocarcinomas).

In addition to elevated rates of spontaneous chromosome aberrations occurring in cultured fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lines, an increased susceptibility to DNA cross-linking agents and oxygen has been found. To explain this hypersensitivity to clastogenic agents a defective function of DNA topoisomerase I or II could be invoked, a suggestion which is supported by the co-localization of the DNA topoisomerase I gene and a putative FA gene to chromosome 20q. In order to investigate the function of DNA topoisomerases in FA, the sensitivity of lymphoid B-cell lines derived from FA patients and control cell lines to inhibitors of DNA topoisomerases I and II was compared using continuous bromodeoxyuridine labeling and bivariate Hoechst/ethidium bromide flow cytometry. Both agents inhibited cell proliferation mainly by arresting cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle.

Comparison to the differentiation pathway of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells.,993-1000,"Gradual increase of CD38 on cells expressing CD34 characterizes the early cell differentiation pathway of normal human hematopoietic progenitors. In this study the coordinated expression pattern of CD34 and CD38 was assessed on leukemic blasts from bone marrow aspirates of 95 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Expression was divided into six categories analogous to the differentiation pathway of normal bone marrow. The CD38 antigen was expressed on the leukemic cells of all patients and CD34+ leukemic cells were found in 79 patients (83%). In 93 patients, the leukemic cells were found along the differentiation pathway defined by CD34 and CD38. In 33 of the 93 patients, a part of the CD34+ cells did not express the CD38 antigen (categories 1 and 2). In another 33 patients, all CD34+ cells expressed CD38 (categories 3 and 4). In the remaining 27 patients, only cells were found which dimly expressed CD34 or did not express CD34 (categories 5 and 6). Of the 93 patients, 88 were treated with intensive chemotherapy according to the protocol of the German AML Cooperative Group. Of these, 21 died early and were not evaluable for treatment response. Complete remission was achieved in 14 of 22 patients (64%) in categories 1 and 2, in 19 of 26 patients (73%) in categories 3 and 4, and in 18 of 19 patients (95%) in categories 5 and 6. The event-free survival was significantly longer in patients of categories 5 and 6 compared to patients in categories 1 and 2 (p less than 0.01) and categories 3 and 4 (p less than 0.05), respectively. We conclude that in the majority of AML patients the immunophenotype of leukemic cells follows the early cell differentiation pathways defined by coordinated expression of CD34 and CD38 similar to that of normal hematopoietic progenitors. The presence of cells in the late cell differentiation stages (CD34+/-, CD38 /+) identifies patients with a higher complete remission rate and longer complete remission duration.","['Terstappen, L W', 'Safford, M', 'Unterhalt, M', 'Konemann, S', 'Zurlutter, K', 'Piechotka, K', 'Drescher, M', 'Aul, C', 'Buchner, T', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Terstappen LW', 'Safford M', 'Unterhalt M', 'Konemann S', 'Zurlutter K', 'Piechotka K', 'Drescher M', 'Aul C', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W', 'et al.']","['Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA 95131.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Oct;6(10):993-1000.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the longevity of CLL cells injected i.p., these cells apparently do not migrate to other lymphoid tissues. Eight to sixteen weeks after receiving CLL cells, SCID mice develop human IgG autoantibodies to human red blood cells and/or high serum levels of human Ig. Soon thereafter, these animals develop lethal human B-cell tumors. In contrast to the original CLL cells, these human B-cell tumors are CD5-negative, have genomic DNA of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), express antigens associated with latent EBV infection and have distinctive Ig gene rearrangements by Southern.

These findings suggest that this leukemia originated from a stem cell and differentiated along multilineage pathways.","['Goda, H', 'Abe, Y', 'Yufu, Y', 'Muta, K', 'Katsuno, M', 'Goto, T', 'Sadamura, S', 'Nishimura, J', 'Nawata, H', 'Hirata, J']","['Goda H', 'Abe Y', 'Yufu Y', 'Muta K', 'Katsuno M', 'Goto T', 'Sadamura S', 'Nishimura J', 'Nawata H', 'Hirata J', 'et al.']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University.']",['jpn'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1992 Aug;33(8):1046-51.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 142-nucleotide RNA template (donor) primed with a specific 20-nucleotide DNA oligonucleotide was used to initiate synthesis. DNA oligonucleotides with homology to internal regions of the donor were used as acceptors. In this system, HIV RT produced strand transfer products. An HIV RT having RNase H depleted to 3% of normal (HIV RTRD) catalyzed the transfer reaction inefficiently. An RNase H-minus deletion mutant of murine leukemia virus RT was unable to catalyze strand transfer. HIV RTRD, however, efficiently catalyzed transfer when Escherichia coli RNase H was included in the reactions, while the mutant murine leukemia virus RT was not efficiently complemented by the E. coli enzyme. Evidently, RNase H activity enhances, or is required for, internal strand transfer. Two acceptors homologous to 27-nucleotide regions of the donor, one offset from the other by 6 nucleotides, were tested. The offset eliminated a sequence homologous to a prevalent DNA synthesis pause site in the donor. Strand transfer to this acceptor was about 25% less efficient, suggesting that RT pausing can enhance strand transfer. When the deoxynucleoside triphosphates in the reactions were reduced from 50 to 0.2 microM, increasing RT pausing, the efficiency of strand transfer also increased. A model for RT-catalyzed strand transfer consistent with our results is presented.","['DeStefano, J J', 'Mallaber, L M', 'Rodriguez-Rodriguez, L', 'Fay, P J', 'Bambara, R A']","['DeStefano JJ', 'Mallaber LM', 'Rodriguez-Rodriguez L', 'Fay PJ', 'Bambara RA']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Rochester, New York 14642.']",['eng'],"['AI 27054/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'HIV/*enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Templates, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.11.6370-6378.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Nov;66(11):6370-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.11.6370-6378.1992.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,,PMC240129,,,,,,,,,,

The single-channel current at +80 mV was 4.5 +/- 0.3 pA and at -80 mV, it was 1.0 +/- 0.4 pA. After activation, the probability of being open (Po) for the lymphocyte channel was voltage independent. Activation of the Cl- channel in lymphocytes was temperature dependent. Nineteen percent of i/o recordings from lymphocytes made at 20 degrees C exhibited Cl- channel activity. In contrast, 49% of recordings made at 30 degrees C showed channel activity. The number of channels in an active patch was not significantly different at the two temperatures. Channel activation in excised, depolarized patches also occurred 20-fold faster at 30 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. There was no marked change in the single-channel conductance at 30 degrees C.

The core protein and enzyme genes of the MoMuLV genome together with an amphotropic envelope gene are utilized to engineer the cell lines that generate retroviral vectors for use in current human gene therapy applications. We developed a producer clone that generates a very high concentration of retroviral vector particles to optimize conditions for gene insertion into pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. This producer cell line also generates a much lower concentration of replication-competent virus that arose through recombination. Stem cells from rhesus monkeys were purified by immunoselection with an anti-CD34 antibody, incubated in vitro for 80-86 h in the presence of retroviral vector particles with accompanying replication-competent virus and used to reconstitute recipients whose bone marrow had been ablated by total body irradiation. The retroviral vector genome was detected in circulating cells of five of eight transplant recipients of CD34+ cells and in the circulating cells of two recipients of infected, unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells. Three recipients of CD34+ cells had a productive infection with replication-competent virus. Six or seven mo after transplantation, each of these animals developed a rapidly progressive T cell neoplasm involving the thymus, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Lymphoma cells contained 10-50 copies of the replication-competent virus, but lacked the retroviral vector genome. We conclude that replication-competent viruses arising from producer cells making retroviral vectors can be pathogenic in primates, which underscores the importance of carefully screening retroviral producer clones used in human trials to exclude contamination with replication-competent virus.","['Donahue, R E', 'Kessler, S W', 'Bodine, D', 'McDonagh, K', 'Dunbar, C', 'Goodman, S', 'Agricola, B', 'Byrne, E', 'Raffeld, M', 'Moen, R']","['Donahue RE', 'Kessler SW', 'Bodine D', 'McDonagh K', 'Dunbar C', 'Goodman S', 'Agricola B', 'Byrne E', 'Raffeld M', 'Moen R', 'et al.']","['Clinical Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Genome, Viral', 'Globins/genetics', 'Helper Viruses/genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/blood/*microbiology/pathology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Time Factors', '*Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.176.4.1125 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1992 Oct 1;176(4):1125-35. doi: 10.1084/jem.176.4.1125.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,PMC2119385,,,,,,,,,,

In 14 of the 24 episodes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia, which occurred in 23 severely neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies during a three-year period, G-CSF was given subcutaneously or intravenously at daily doses of 75 micrograms/body to 200 micrograms/m2 of body surface. Overall, survival at one week after onset was observed in 13 patients (54%). Treatment with G-CSF, however, had no statistically significant association with one-week survival, although a favorable outcome was well correlated with an increase in the neutrophil count during therapy. On the other hand, septic shock and appropriate antibiotic therapy were the major prognostic factors. The frequency of shock was reduced by appropriate therapy, but not by G-CSF treatment.

In order to clarify the mechanism of action of these peptides, we examined the effects of pure IL-8, connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III), neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2), and platelet factor 4 (PF-4) on blood basophils with and without pretreatment by IL-3, which modulates mediator release. After pretreatment with IL-3, significant histamine release was observed with 10(-8) M and 10(-7) M IL-8 and 10(-7) M NAP-2, but not with the other peptides. At higher concentrations (10(-6) M), however, all IL-8 analogs, as well as the unrelated cationic peptides poly-D-lysine, histone VS, and lysozyme, induced histamine release to variable degrees. Binding and competition studies with [125I]IL-8 revealed specific IL-8R on basophils from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia and normal individuals. From 3500 to 9600 receptors with a mean Kd value of 0.15 nM were found on average per chronic myelogenous leukemia and normal basophil, respectively. NAP-2 weakly competed for IL-8 binding. IL-8 and, to a lesser extent, NAP-2 led to a transient rise of cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), which was independent of a preexposure to IL-3. IL-8 prevented the [Ca2+]i rise induced by NAP-2, but did not influence [Ca2+]i responses to other agonists, e.g. C5a, C3a, or platelet-activating factor. IL-8 induced [Ca2+]i changes and histamine release in IL-3-primed basophils were pertussis toxin sensitive. CTAP-III or PF-4 did not compete for IL-8 binding, did not induce [Ca2+]i changes, and did not influence the [Ca2+]i response to IL-8 and NAP-2. This study shows that IL-8 and NAP-2 activate human basophils by a receptor-mediated mechanism similar to that operating in neutrophils. At high concentrations histamine release can also be induced by cationic peptides by a mechanism that does not involve the IL-8R, and probably depends on cationic interactions.","['Krieger, M', 'Brunner, T', 'Bischoff, S C', 'von Tscharner, V', 'Walz, A', 'Moser, B', 'Baggiolini, M', 'Dahinden, C A']","['Krieger M', 'Brunner T', 'Bischoff SC', 'von Tscharner V', 'Walz A', 'Moser B', 'Baggiolini M', 'Dahinden CA']","['Institute of Clinical Immunology, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Basophils/*drug effects/physiology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Platelet Factor 4/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology', 'beta-Thromboglobulin']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Oct 15;149(8):2662-7.,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (PPBP protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (beta-Thromboglobulin)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', '69344-77-0 (connective tissue-activating peptide)', '69670-74-2 (low affinity platelet factor 4)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some leukemic skin infiltrates are clinically similar to reactive non-leukemic infiltrates in patients with leukemia; thus it is of great importance to distinguish them. Fifty-four cases which were thought clinically to be leukemia cutis underwent immunophenotyping with a panel of nine T, B, monocytic, and macrophage markers using paraffin sections. Immunohistochemistry helped identify 44 cases with leukemia cutis and 10 with reactive infiltrates. In all cases of leukemia cutis, the staining patterns of skin infiltrates were concordant with cell type in the bone marrow. Furthermore, the panel of markers was usually helpful in distinguishing reactive from leukemia infiltrates, especially in cases with chronic lymphatic leukemia. Immunohistochemistry is a valuable adjunct in histopathologic differentiation of skin infiltrates in most cases of leukemia.

We studied sequential biopsies of clinically normal skin of 22 thalassemic and leukemic patients undergoing allogeneic BMT who had received only chemotherapy (busulfan and cyclophosphamide) as conditioning regimen. LC were identified immunohistochemically using antibodies against CD1a and HLA-DR antigens, and their number expressed per square mm of epidermal vertical section, the latter measured by computerized image analysis. After the preparatory regimen, the number of LC decreased progressively in both leukemic and thalassemic patients. CD1a+ and HLA-DR+ epidermal cells were reduced, respectively, to 68.5% and 64.5% of their original number around Day 2, and to 23.1% and to 18.2% around Day 17. By this time, electron microscopic examination of selected biopsies confirmed the depletion of LC. Variable repopulation was observed between Days 40 and 60. Our results indicate that a conditioning regimen based exclusively on high dose chemotherapy depletes epidermal LC early after BMT, and that such depletion is not related to the development of acute graft-versus-host disease.","['Zambruno, G', 'Girolomoni, G', 'Manca, V', 'Andreani, M', 'Galimberti, M', 'Lucarelli, G', 'Giannetti, A']","['Zambruno G', 'Girolomoni G', 'Manca V', 'Andreani M', 'Galimberti M', 'Lucarelli G', 'Giannetti A']","['Clinica Dermatologica, Universita di Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD1', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Drug Therapy', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Langerhans Cells/drug effects/*pathology/radiation effects', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'beta-Thalassemia/drug therapy/pathology/surgery']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0560.1992.tb01657.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 1992 Jun;19(3):187-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.1992.tb01657.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decreased adhesion to stroma and fibronectin but increased adhesion to the basement membrane components laminin and collagen type IV.,1232-41,"We studied the adhesion of primitive and committed progenitors from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and normal bone marrow to stroma and to several extracellular matrix components. In contrast to benign primitive progenitors from CML or normal bone marrow, Ph1-positive primitive progenitors from CML bone marrow fail to adhere to normal stromal layers and to fibronectin and its proteolytic fragments, but do adhere to collagen type IV, an extracellular matrix component of basement membranes. Similarly, multilineage colony-forming unit (CFU-MIX) progenitors from CML bone marrow do not adhere to fibronectin or its adhesion promoting fragments but adhere to collagen type IV. Unlike committed progenitors from normal bone marrow, CML single-lineage burst-forming units-erythroid and granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units fail to adhere to fibronectin or its components but do adhere to both collagen type IV and laminin. Evaluation of adhesion receptor expression demonstrates that fibronectin receptors (alpha 4, alpha 5, and beta 1) are equally present on progenitors from normal and CML bone marrow. However, a fraction of CML progenitors express alpha 2 and alpha 6 receptors, associated with laminin and collagens, whereas these receptors are absent from normal progenitors. These observations indicate that the premature release of malignant Ph1-positive progenitors into the circulation may be caused by loss of adhesive interactions with stroma and/or fibronectin and acquisition of adhesive interactions with basement membrane components. Further study of the altered function of cell-surface adhesion receptors characteristic of the malignant clone in CML may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying both abnormal expansion and abnormal circulation of malignant progenitors in CML.","['Verfaillie, C M', 'McCarthy, J B', 'McGlave, P B']","['Verfaillie CM', 'McCarthy JB', 'McGlave PB']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-43924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-4581401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Basement Membrane/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Collagen/*physiology', 'Fibronectins/*physiology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Laminin/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/pathology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI115985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1992 Oct;90(4):1232-41. doi: 10.1172/JCI115985.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Laminin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",,,,PMC443164,,,,,,,,,,

Generally, the lymphomatous cells also expressed high levels of MHC class II DR protein, CD18 (LFA-1 beta chain), and CD45RO.

Radioligand binding studies using membranes from control and retinoic acid-treated HL-60 cells showed that the Bmax of InsP3 receptor increased progressively from 0.24 to 0.69 pmol/mg protein during 5 days retinoic acid treatment with no change in KD (19 nM). During this period, maximal InsP3-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization increased 2-3-fold. InsP3 receptor mRNA was present at low levels in HL-60 cells but was increased significantly after treatment with retinoic acid, reaching maximal levels of approximately 4-fold greater than untreated cells after 4 days treatment with retinoic acid. Nuclear run-on assays indicated that the elevated steady state level of InsP3 receptor mRNA in retinoic acid-treated HL-60 cells was primarily the result of enhanced transcription of the InsP3 receptor gene. Furthermore, the transcriptional enhancing effect of retinoic acid was seen in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that the InsP3 receptor gene is directly regulated by retinoic acid. The studies also demonstrate that the InsP3 receptor mRNA is rapidly degraded in HL-60 cells by a mechanism that also requires protein synthesis.","['Bradford, P G', 'Wang, X', 'Jin, Y', 'Hui, P']","['Bradford PG', 'Wang X', 'Jin Y', 'Hui P']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, State University of New York, Buffalo 14214.']",['eng'],['GM39588/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcium/*metabolism', '*Calcium Channels', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Poly A/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)36782-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Oct 15;267(29):20959-64.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (ITPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,"['c-fos', 'c-fosB', 'zif268']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients achieving complete clinical remission after three courses were given intensive consolidation and maintenance chemotherapy similar to the L10/L17M protocol designed by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Group for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma. There were 27 (64 per cent) males and 15 (36 per cent) females. The median age was 54 years (mean 53, range 15 to 68). Seven of them (17 per cent) had stage I disease, four (10 per cent) stage II, seven (17 per cent) stage III and 24 (57 per cent) stage IV. Eighteen patients (43 per cent) had B symptoms and four (10 per cent) had bulky disease. According to the Working Formulation, the histology was diffuse mixed in 16 patients (38 per cent), diffuse large cell in 18 (43 per cent), diffuse immunoblastic in four (10 per cent) and unclassifiable in four (10 per cent). According to a modified Japanese Lymphoma Study Group's classification, the histology in 24 patients (57 per cent) was the pleomorphic type, in 13 (31 per cent) immunoblastic-lymphadenopathy-like (IBL-like), and in five (12 per cent) unclassifiable. The overall complete remission rate was 67 per cent. Twenty-five per cent of the complete responders relapsed and the DFS of the CR patients was 62 per cent at three years. The overall survival of all patients at three years was 52 per cent. Patients with stage I, II and III disease had significantly better CR rate (100 per cent versus 42 per cent, p = 0.001) and overall survival (82 per cent versus 35 per cent at three years, p = 0.01) than those with stage IV disease but the relapse rate and DFS of CR patients were similar.

METHODS: In an attempt to determine whether the presence of granules or inclusions marks a biologically distinct variety of ALL with peculiar clinical features, a prospective morphological review was undertaken of children entering AIEOP protocols for ALL in the period from 1985 to 1989. RESULTS: Of 531 cases examined, 16 (3%) were found to have greater than 1% granular bone marrow blasts, with 7 cases (1.3%) having greater than 10%. The presence of granules or inclusions was associated with the immunophenotype of ""common"" ALL. There was no clear association with FAB type L1 or L2 nor with particular clinical or hematological findings at presentation. Complete remission was achieved in all cases; one patient died of infection in remission at 3 months and 2 patients relapsed after 12 and 32 months, respectively, while the others are still in remission after a minimum follow-up of 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, granular morphology seems to have no prognostic importance in children ALL.","['Invernizzi, R', 'Rosanda, C', 'Basso, G', 'Conter, V', 'di Cataldo, A', 'Fenu, S', 'Forni, M', 'Frappampina, V', 'Granchi, D', 'Locatelli, F']","['Invernizzi R', 'Rosanda C', 'Basso G', 'Conter V', 'di Cataldo A', 'Fenu S', 'Forni M', 'Frappampina V', 'Granchi D', 'Locatelli F', 'et al.']","['Clinica Medica 2, Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/chemistry', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Survival Analysis']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1992 Jan-Feb;77(1):30-4.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",,,17,,,,,,,,,,,

Such promiscuous killer cells are termed lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. We recently reported that the interaction of LAK cells with tumor cells stimulated the LAK cells to release interferon (IFN) gamma. Here, we report that the release of IFN gamma by LAK cells can be further enhanced by addition of the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), anti-CD3, anti-(T cell receptor alpha beta) (TCR alpha beta) and a mitogenic combination of anti-CD2 (T112 + T113). Other antibodies, including a non-mitogenic anti-CD2 mAb (Leu5b), that recognize T cell-associated antigens were not stimulatory. The same stimulatory mAbs also synergized with tumor cells to stimulate tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) to secrete IFN gamma. Additional experiments indicated that it was the T cell subset of LAK cells (LAK-T cells) that was stimulated by tumor cells and mAbs to release IFN gamma. Inhibition studies with specific mAbs suggest that the stimulation of IFN gamma release by LAK-T cells was dependent both on the aggregation of TCR-CD3 complexes on the LAK-T cell, and on the interaction of accessory molecules with their ligands. The accessory molecules we have identified as critical are LFA 1 and CD2/LFA-2 on LAK-T cells interacting with their respective ligands ICAM-1 and LFA3. Thus our data suggest that cytokine production in LAK-T cells can be regulated by multiple molecular interactions, involving the TCR-CD3 complex and adhesion molecules.","['Chong, A S', 'Staren, E D', 'Scuderi, P']","['Chong AS', 'Staren ED', 'Scuderi P']","[""Department of General Surgery, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612.""]",['eng'],['1 R29 CA53805-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'CD2 Antigens', 'CD3 Complex/*physiology', 'CD58 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/physiopathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/physiology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG/physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01741147 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1992;35(5):335-41. doi: 10.1007/BF01741147.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have addressed the mechanism of synergistic growth activation, at the cellular level, by SF and GM-CSF using the blast cells of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML blasts). Our data indicate that SF drastically alleviates the requirement in cell interaction for blast colony formation in most of the samples tested. Analysis of cultures performed in the presence of SF and GM-CSF at different cell concentrations, ranging from 1,000 to 20,000 cells, suggested a single limiting element, i.e., the blast clonogenic cell, while 2 or more limiting elements were found in cultures stimulated with GM-CSF alone, suggesting interacting cell populations. The presence of membrane-bound SF was detected by immunofluorescence, suggesting the possibility that secreted or membrane-bound SF may, at least in part, contribute to the density-dependent growth of AML blasts. In all samples tested, SF appears to increase the responsiveness of AML blasts to GM-CSF, as demonstrated by a 3-fold decrease of GM-CSF half efficient concentration on addition of SF to the cultures. Exposure of AML blasts to SF did not affect GM-CSF receptor expression, suggesting that this increase in GM-CSF responsiveness is likely to occur at the postreceptor level. Interestingly, 2 of 15 AML samples surveyed did not respond to SF, and were both of the myelomonocytic or monocytic subtype, classified as M4 and M5, respectively.","['Caceres-Cortes, J R', 'Hoang, T']","['Caceres-Cortes JR', 'Hoang T']","['Laboratory of Hemopoiesis and Leukemia, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Communication/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Junctions/drug effects/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/drug effects/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Oct 1;52(19):5208-12.,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,['c-kit'],,,,,,,,,,,,

One important feature of the disease is its exquisite sensitivity to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy. Because we showed earlier that the CD20 molecule is consistently hyperphosphorylated in hairy cells and because previous studies showed that CD20 is involved in regulating intracytoplasmic free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in normal B lymphocytes, we measured [Ca2+]i in tumor cell samples from patients with HCL and studied the effect of IFN-alpha on this parameter. Using the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorophore fura-2, we observed that hairy cells display a slightly but consistently higher [Ca2+]i than normal 48-hour-activated B cells or other leukemic cells. Furthermore, both in vitro preincubation of cell samples with IFN-alpha and in vivo administration of this cytokine reduced the [Ca2+]i in hairy cells. This effect was observed together with a decrease in transmembrane Ca2+ influx. However, preincubation with IFN-gamma had no effect.

CD10/NEP transcripts and enzymatic activity were primarily restricted to the subpopulation of murine lymphoid progenitors, termed pro-B cells, which were isolated from bone marrow (BM) and modified Whitlock-Witte cultures and defined by coexpression of B220 and low levels of Thy-1. CD10/NEP transcripts and cell surface enzymatic activity were also detected in BM stromal cells known to support the development of B-lymphoid progenitors. In contrast, Abelson and H-ras transformed pre-B-cell lines were CD10/NEP- as were Thy-1-B220+ pre-B cells from BM and modified Whitlock-Witte cultures and Thy-1lowLin- (B220-Mac-1-GR-1-Ly-2/3-) uncommitted hematopoietic progenitors from BM. The expression of CD10/NEP on murine pro-B cells and BM stromal cells suggests a role for the enzyme in early B-cell ontogeny. In modified Whitlock-Witte cultures in which Thy-1lowLin- progenitors plated on BM stromal cells differentiate into Thy-1lowB220+ pro-B and Thy-1-B220+ pre-B cells, the addition of specific CD10/NEP inhibitors increased the number of lymphoid colonies at days 5 through 7 by 34% (P < .001).

Acidic FGF (aFGF) stimulated the proliferation of murine megakaryocytes and human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentrations of aFGF required to elicit half-maximum and maximum effects were similar for HEL and megakaryocytic colony formation. The effect of aFGF was comparable to that of basic FGF (bFGF) in both cell types. The effect of both FGFs was found to be synergistic with interleukin-3 (IL-3), and was abrogated by a monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibody. A specific cell surface receptor complex of approximately 120 Kd was detected for FGF by crosslinking experiments on HEL cells and total bone marrow (BM) cells. Single-cell autoradiography of megakaryocytes in BM smears and BM cultures showed binding sites for 125I-aFGF. Northern blot analysis of messenger RNA (mRNA) from total BM and HEL cells showed a 4.4-kb mRNA specific for FGF receptors type 1 (flg) and type 2 (bek). This was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, which also showed the presence of FGF receptor mRNA in megakaryocytic-like cells, normal megakaryocytes, and platelets. Together, these results indicate that FGF is involved in megakaryocytopoiesis and suggest that this interaction may be mediated via FGF receptor type 1 and type 2 located on the megakaryocytic lineage or on accessory cells responsible for the release of megakaryocytic growth-promoting activities.","['Bikfalvi, A', 'Han, Z C', 'Fuhrmann, G']","['Bikfalvi A', 'Han ZC', 'Fuhrmann G']","['INSERM U 118, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 1/*pharmacology', 'Filaggrin Proteins', '*Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/15 00:00,1992/10/15 00:01,['1992/10/15 00:00'],"['1992/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)72556-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Oct 15;80(8):1905-13.,"['0 (FLG protein, human)', '0 (Filaggrin Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '104781-85-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, two distinct TNF receptors (TNF-Rs), TNF-R(p55) and TNF-R(p75), have been identified. In this study, we show that both receptor types may be expressed by AML blasts. It has been investigated whether the different effects of TNF on AML blasts can be explained by differential activation of the distinct TNF-R structures. For this purpose, we used the monoclonal antibodies HTR-1 and HTR-9, specifically recognizing TNF-R(p55), and UTR-1, specific for TNF-R(p75). TNF-(alpha and -beta) mediated synergistic activation with IL-3/GM-CSF, upregulation of IL-3/GM-CSF receptors, inhibition of G-CSF-induced growth, and rapid downmodulation of G-CSF receptors exclusively result from activation of TNF-R(p55). In certain cases in which TNF-alpha, rather than TNF-beta, induces AML growth through an autocrine mechanism, both TNF-R(p55) and (p75) are involved. These data indicate that the variety of TNF responses observed in AML can only be partially explained by differential activation of the TNF-R(p55) and (p75) structures, and that TNF-R(p55) on AML blasts can transduce both positive (synergism with IL-3/GM-CSF) and negative regulatory signals (inhibition of G-CSF-induced proliferation) following TNF activation.","['Delwel, R', 'van Buitenen, C', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Touw, I']","['Delwel R', 'van Buitenen C', 'Lowenberg B', 'Touw I']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67546-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Oct 1;80(7):1798-803.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-3 and stem cell factor/mast cell growth factor (SCF) showed only a marginal effect, and granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage CSFs (GM-CSF and M-CSF, respectively) were inactive. The induction of apoptosis by TGF-beta 1 in a different myeloid leukemia (7-M12) was inhibited by GM-CSF and IL-3 but not by the other cytokines. In the absence of TGF-beta 1, both M1 and 7-M12 leukemic cells were independent of hematopoietic cytokines for cell viability and growth. The cytotoxic compounds vincristine, vinblastine, adriamycin, cytosine arabinoside, cycloheximide, and sodium azide, some of which are used in cancer chemotherapy, induced cell death by apoptosis in both leukemias. As with TGF-beta 1, apoptosis induced by these cytotoxic compounds was inhibited by GM-CSF (7-M12 leukemia) and by G-CSF or IL-6 (M1 leukemia). Cyclosporine A decreased cell multiplication in M1 cells without inducing apoptosis, and G-CSF and IL-6 inhibited the cytostatic effect of cyclosporine A.

Both HIV reverse transcriptases (RTs) were shown to be particularly error-prone during the in vitro DNA-dependent DNA synthesis relative to other retroviral RTs. Extension of mismatched 3'-termini of the primer DNA was shown to be a major determinant in the infidelity of HIV RTs. However, reverse transcriptases generally exhibit dual template specificities.

Consequently, we examined the ability of these enzymes to extend preformed 3'-terminal A.A, A.C, and A.G mispairs by quantitating the amount and length of extended primers in a primer extension assay using ribosomal RNA as a template. The results demonstrate that the three RTs studied exhibited efficient extensions from 3'-terminal mispairs with a specificity of A.C greater than A.A greater than A.G. Nevertheless, the HIV RTs are qualitatively as well as quantitatively more error-prone than MLV RT. The mispair extension efficiency appears to be affected mainly by the increase of apparent Km values, rather than by the change in Vmax values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Bakhanashvili, M', 'Hizi, A']","['Bakhanashvili M', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],['R01-AI27035/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/enzymology', 'HIV-2/enzymology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1992/10/06 00:00,1992/10/06 00:01,['1992/10/06 00:00'],"['1992/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00154a010 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1992 Oct 6;31(39):9393-8. doi: 10.1021/bi00154a010.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These rearrangements are generated by either local DNA deletion or a (1;14)(p34;q11) chromosome translocation, and they typically result in structural alterations of the TAL1 transcription unit. In this report we present a molecular characterization of the t(1;14)(p34;q11) from a T-ALL patient. As a consequence of the translocation, TAL1 is transposed from its normal position on chromosome 1 into the T-cell receptor alpha/delta chain locus on chromosome 14. Unlike previous cases, the chromosome 1 breakpoint in this patient did not disrupt the continuity of the TAL1 transcription unit, but instead occurred approximately 25 kilobase pairs (kb) downstream of TAL1. This observation suggests that malignant alteration of TAL1 can be mediated by long-range cis-activating mechanisms that are triggered by DNA rearrangement at a distant site.

The strong reactivity for MPO and the complete absence of reactivity for CD13 and CD14 was verified by an independent assay involving alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP). Our case is of interest for at least two reasons: First, a poorly differentiated variant of AML (negative for MPO but positive for one or more of the myeloid-lineage CD antigens) has been designated FAB M0. In terms of the expression of phenotypic markers, our case may be considered as an 'MPO (+), CD antigen (-) AML'. The CD antigens are known to be expressed very early during myeloid differentiation whereas MPO (in its functional form) is viewed as being expressed relatively late in the process. It is therefore intriguing from a biological standpoint why the supposedly early antigens (CD33 and CD13) remain unexpressed; this may represent an example of 'asynchronous differentiation' in leukaemia. Second, from a practical standpoint, the use of immunophenotyping as a first-line diagnosis would fail to detect such cases. This case strengthens the notion that immunophenotyping by flow cytometry does not eliminate the necessity of performing peroxidase cytochemical staining.","['Seshi, B', 'Kashyap, A', 'Bennett, J M']","['Seshi B', 'Kashyap A', 'Bennett JM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, New York.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis/genetics', 'CD13 Antigens', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/genetics/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Peroxidase/*analysis/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08242.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Jul;81(3):374-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08242.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunocytological investigations were performed by the immunoenzymatic APAAP-technique on BM smears monoclonal antibodies against CD19, Cd3, CD10 or TdT antigens and determination of positive cells in relation to total BM leucocytes. Corresponding results were obtained for trephine histology and for the combination of cytomorphology and immunocytology in 93/100 cases. Four cases with BM involvement by trephine histology were missed by the combination of immunocytology and cytomorphology. In turn, three cases negative by trephine histology, were found to be positive by the combination of immunocytology and cytomorphology. Immunocytochemistry considerably increased the number of true positive detected BM-infiltrations by cytomorphology in low grade B-cell lymphoma from 58% to 97%. For the diagnosis of BM involvement in high-grade NHL cytomorphology of the aspirate was of equal sensitivity to the biopsy and was always confirmed by immunocytology. The high diagnostic sensitivity of immunocytology was mainly due to high B-cell counts in BM involved by B-cell lymphoma (means = 38%, s = 23) in contrast to low B-cell counts in BM not involved by NHL (means = 4.5%, s = 3.8).

Marrow from 18 patients with myeloma, two with plasma cell leukaemia (PCL), four with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) and 10 normal allogeneic bone marrow donors was studied. All plasma cells from normals and multiple myeloma patients were negative for CD2, CD11a and CD18. All normal and myeloma marrow plasma cells were positive for ICAM-1. 16/18 myeloma cases tested, and all other samples (normal, MGUS and PCL), contained plasma cells positive for H-CAM. Only one normal, but 12/16 myelomas tested were positive for N-CAM (P less than 0.02). One of four MGUS cases was moderately positive and one other weakly positive for N-CAM. Both PCLs were N-CAM negative. 12/18 myelomas were positive for LFA-3, but only two normals (P less than 0.05). All MGUS cases were negative for LFA-3, as was one PCL, the other being weakly positive. Three cases were negative for both adhesion molecules, three cases expressed only N-CAM or LFA-3 and 10 cases expressed both. LFA-3 and N-CAM are expressed significantly in myeloma rather than normal plasma cells. Cases of MGUS may express N-CAM but not, in this small series, LFA-3. Plasma cells in the peripheral blood (PCL) and plasma cell lines express little or no LFA-3 or N-CAM.","['Barker, H F', 'Hamilton, M S', 'Ball, J', 'Drew, M', 'Franklin, I M']","['Barker HF', 'Hamilton MS', 'Ball J', 'Drew M', 'Franklin IM']","['Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Medical Centre, Birmingham.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'CD11 Antigens', 'CD18 Antigens', 'CD2 Antigens', 'CD56 Antigen', 'CD58 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*blood/immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma Cells/*chemistry/immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/immunology/pathology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08236.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Jul;81(3):331-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08236.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, relationships were established between their mutagenic activities and either the nature or the position of the substituent on the quinonic nucleus. Compounds substituted in the 2 position were less mutagenic than the 3 isomers. In the second study, the mutagenic properties were compared to the in vitro antitumor activity. Interestingly, some very cytotoxic quinones were only weak mutagens. So where the cytotoxicity is similar, the less mutagenic compounds may be suitable for clinical use as antitumor drugs, in order to avoid important side effects; the Ames test can then be used guide the selection of molecules for further in vivo antitumor screening.

Stimulation of Meg-01 cells by the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (0.15-32.5 ng/ml) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (0.15-10 ng/ml) resulted in expression of the inducible, Ca+(+)-independent, NO synthase. This activity was increased by the addition of NADPH, tetrahydrobiopterin and sepiapterin as cofactors. Induction of this enzyme was accompanied by a decrease in the constitutive NO synthase activity, a phenomenon which was prevented or reversed by dexamethasone (1 microM). Thus, human early differentiated megakaryocytic cells can synthesize NO from L-arginine by both the constitutive and the inducible NO synthases.

The study was performed in a model system of HL60 cells mixed with different quantities of HeLa cells. These latter cells were sorted directly onto poly-l-lysine coated glass slides on the basis of their keratin content, a cytoskeletal component not present in HL60 cells. Overall morphology of the separated HeLa cells was excellent and, after the ISH procedure, the appropriate number of ISH spots was observed in more than 85% of the sorted cells. This percentage did not differ significantly in cell mixtures with different percentages of HeLa cells (down to 1%). Sorting of HeLa cells in different phases of the cell cycle, and subsequent ISH, revealed the same spot number for chromosome #1 in all cell cycle stages, including mitosis. In the latter phase of the cell cycle we did not find a duplication of the chromosome #1 centromere, not even after sorting of the mitotic cells on the basis of specific labeling with an antibody to mitotin. The early G2 mitotin negative fraction, however, showed a significant percentage of cells with a duplicate spot number, most likely representing a tetraploid cell fraction in this HeLa cell culture. The protocol that evolved from these model studies was applied to cell suspensions of malignant body cavity effusions as well as solid bladder carcinomas. In several of these cases numerical chromosome aberrations could be detected by ISH more evidently after sorting on the basis of keratin labeling.","['Beck, J L', 'Hopman, A H', 'Vooijs, G P', 'Ramaekers, F C']","['Beck JL', 'Hopman AH', 'Vooijs GP', 'Ramaekers FC']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Centromere', '*Chromosomes, Human', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'DNA Probes', '*Flow Cytometry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Keratins/immunology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2', 'Neoplasms/*ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Proteins/immunology', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Pleural Effusion/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/pathology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990130404 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1992;13(4):346-55. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990130404.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (MCM2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To detect possible nucleic acid contaminations in reverse transcriptase, the enzyme preparations from several commercial sources were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. The labeled material from AMV reverse transcriptase preparations comigrated with a tRNA marker in polyacrylamide gels and was found to be RNase-sensitive.

Using the human leukemic K562 cell line as a model, we explored the efficacy of phenylacetate, an amino acid derivative with a low toxicity index when administered to humans. Treatment of K562 cultures with pharmacologically attainable concentrations of phenylacetate resulted in erythroid differentiation, evident by the reduced growth rate and increased hemoglobin production. The effect was time- and dose-dependent, further augmented by glutamine starvation (phenylacetate is known to deplete circulating glutamine in vivo), and reversible upon cessation of treatment. Molecular analysis showed that phenylacetate induced gamma globin gene expression with subsequent accumulation of the fetal form of hemoglobin (HbF). Interestingly, the addition of phenylacetate to antitumor agents of clinical interest, eg, hydroxyurea and 5-azacytidine, caused superinduction of HbF biosynthesis. The results suggest that phenylacetate, used alone or in combination with other drugs, might offer a safe and effective new approach to treatment of some hematopoietic neoplasms and severe hemoglobinopathies.","['Samid, D', 'Yeh, A', 'Prasanna, P']","['Samid D', 'Yeh A', 'Prasanna P']","['Clinical Pharmacology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Phenylacetates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*metabolism']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67584-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 15;80(6):1576-81.,"['0 (Phenylacetates)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We postulate that a further enhancement in the rate of HR may be achieved by transplanting with an expanded postprogenitor cell population that can provide mature functional cells within days of infusion. In this study we investigated the ability of combinations of hematopoietic growth factors (HGF) to generate nascent granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) in a 7-day suspension culture of peripheral blood CD34+ cells. A combination of 6 HGF, ie, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1), IL-3, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), and stem cell factor (SCF), was identified as the most potent combination of those tested. Subsequently, large volume suspension cultures of CD34+ cells from the same patients using the same 6-factor combination were established and monitored for 21 days. An exponential rate of nucleated cell production (mean 1,324-fold increase) occurred during culture. CFU-GM production paralleled nucleated cell production until day 10, peaked at day 14 (mean 66-fold increase), and was then maintained until day 21. Cells produced in culture were predominantly neutrophil precursors and developed normally as assessed by morphology, immunophenotype, and superoxide generation. This stroma-free, cytokine-driven culture system can achieve a degree of amplification, which suggests the feasibility of ex vivo culture of hematopoietic progenitor cells as an adjunct to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Haylock, D N', 'To, L B', 'Dowse, T L', 'Juttner, C A', 'Simmons, P J']","['Haylock DN', 'To LB', 'Dowse TL', 'Juttner CA', 'Simmons PJ']","['Leukaemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/growth & development', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/physiology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Membrane Glycoproteins']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67561-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 15;80(6):1405-12.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of tyrosine protein kinases is counterbalanced by phospho tyrosine phosphatases that maintain constitutively low levels of protein phosphotyrosine in most cells. In this study the effect of N-ethylmaleimide on the protein tyrosine phosphorylation was tested in Jurkat T-cells. Treatment of intact cells for 5-10 mins with 50-100 microM N-ethylmaleimide resulted in a dramatic increase in phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Phosphoaminoacid analysis revealed an up to ten-fold increase in the content of phosphotyrosine.

Comparisons of the cytotoxicities of Taxotere and taxol have been studied on several murine (P388, SVras) and human cell lines (Calc18, HCT116, T24, N417, KB). Taxotere was found more potent than taxol (1.3-12 fold), a result which could be explained by its higher affinity than taxol for microtubules. In agreement with its postulated mechanism of action, Taxotere is more cytotoxic on proliferating than on non proliferating N417 cells and does not inhibit cellular DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Taxotere gives partial cross resistance on P-glycoprotein resistant P388/DOX cell line, in contrast to taxol which gives a complete cross resistance. On the other hand, no cross resistances were observed on Calc18/AM and P388/CPT5 cell lines, bearing modified activities of topoisomerase II and topoisomerase I, respectively. These results underline the higher cytotoxic activity of Taxotere compared to taxol, and the lack of cross resistance of that class of agent with the topoisomerase I and II-related multidrug resistance phenotypes.","['Riou, J F', 'Naudin, A', 'Lavelle, F']","['Riou JF', 'Naudin A', 'Lavelle F']","['Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Unite de Cancerologie, Centre de Recherche de Vitry-Alfortville, Vitry-sur-Seine, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Alkaloids/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Paclitaxel', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA/biosynthesis', '*Taxoids', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/31 00:00,1992/08/31 00:01,['1992/08/31 00:00'],"['1992/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/31 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(05)81474-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(05)81474-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1992 Aug 31;187(1):164-70. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(05)81474-3.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A plasmid containing an infectious member of the most commonly occurring FeLV subgroup (FeLV subgroup A or FeLV-A) was coexpressed with noninfectious constructs containing the envelope (env) gene of an endogenously inherited FeLV-like feline genomic element in transfected feline fibroblasts. The viruses generated were selected for their ability to propagate in human cells which are resistant to infection by the parental ecotropic FeLV-A or the noninfectious endogenous constructs. An analysis of the recombinants thus derived identified a limited number of sites in the env gene which were preferentially utilized in the generation of recombinant FeLVs under the selection conditions used. These sites were clustered in the surface glycoprotein (SU) moiety of the env gene, and it appeared that most, but not all, of the SU gene product of FeLV-A, beginning from the N-terminus, can be replaced by sequences from an endogenous element, still allowing the virus to be biologically viable. In fact, these substitutions in the env gene expanded infectivity of the parental FeLV-A from ecotropic to polytropic cell tropism. Additionally, substitutions in the SU region yielded many recombinants in which a primary neutralizing pentapeptide epitope of FeLV-A was altered because of its variance in the endogenous element. In several of the recombinants, this sequence was also found to be frequently mutated. Consistent with the changes identified in this antibody-binding domain, the recombinant viruses were only weakly inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against this epitope, while FeLV-A was highly sensitive to neutralization.","['Sheets, R L', 'Pandey, R', 'Klement, V', 'Grant, C K', 'Roy-Burman, P']","['Sheets RL', 'Pandey R', 'Klement V', 'Grant CK', 'Roy-Burman P']","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],['CA51485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(92)90924-e [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1992 Oct;190(2):849-55. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(92)90924-e.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)']",,['env'],,,,,,,,,,,,

LPS did not elevate the [Ca2+]i as measured by the Fura-2 fluorescence technique. When these cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence of the calcium ionophore A23187, a clear increase in the IL-1 beta protein production was observed in the undifferentiated THP-1 cells but not in the more differentiated cell types. This ionophore-induced increase was also seen in the IL-1 beta mRNA levels.

This proteolytic enzyme specifically cleaves glycoproteins rich in O-sialoglycans. Glycoproteins containing only N-linked glycans are not cleaved. Cleavage of the CD34 antigen results in the loss of epitopes detected by five of seven CD34-designated antibodies. In this study, we investigated the role of the P.h. glycoprotease in isolating CD34+ cells from unfractionated normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs), and determined the effect of the glycoprotease on the proliferative capacity of the progenitor-enriched fraction. CD34+ cells were isolated from MNCs using immunomagnetic beads attached via a CD34 antibody whose epitope is susceptible to removal by the cleavage with the glycoprotease. Subsequent cleavage with P.h. glycoprotease for 30 min at 37 degrees C released the CD34+ cells from the beads with a recovery of up to 78%. Using a CD34 antibody whose epitope was not removed by the glycoprotease, up to 95% of the recovered cells expressed CD34. Compared to unseparated MNCs, the CD34+ cells showed the following enrichment of committed hematopoietic progenitors, as assayed in semi-solid media: CFU-GM, 45-fold; CFU-M, 13-fold; BFU-E, 26-fold and CFU-GEMM, 81-fold. Hematopoiesis was also studied in two-stage long-term bone marrow cultures in which the CD34+ cells were co-cultured over irradiated, allogeneic adherent layers. Output of CFU-GM over a seven week period from these cultures was similar to that from control cultures with autologous adherent-cell-depleted marrow MNCs. These data suggest that the loss of O-sialo-glycosylated peptide moieties from P.h. glycoprotease-released CD34+ cells neither affects the functional capacity of committed progenitors, nor impairs the proliferation of long-term culture-generating cells. The P.h. glycoprotease can be used to facilitate the isolation and recovery of functionally competent CD34+ cells at high yield and purity, without prior removal of other adherent cells. The ability to rapidly purify CD34+ cells using this non-cytotoxic enzyme has important implications for bone marrow transplantation as well as for gene transfer studies in vitro.","['Marsh, J C', 'Sutherland, D R', 'Davidson, J', 'Mellors, A', 'Keating, A']","['Marsh JC', 'Sutherland DR', 'Davidson J', 'Mellors A', 'Keating A']","['Oncology Research Laboratories, Toronto Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*pharmacology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Sep;6(9):926-34.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.57 (O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We genetically generated a soluble form of the 80-kDa subunit of the human IL-6R (shIL-6R) in mouse fibroblasts (NIH/3T3 cells). The shIL-6R added to human hepatoma cells (HepG2) amplified the induction of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin and haptoglobin by IL-6 at the mRNA and protein level. Moreover, a model for a liver permanently exposed to high IL-6 concentrations has been developed; HepG2 cells were stably transfected with human IL-6-cDNA; 10(6) of the transfected cells (HepG2-IL-6) synthesized and secreted 2 micrograms of IL-6 within 24 h.

In order to study its mechanism of action and to explore the molecular basis for its synergistic activity we have examined the proteins that become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to SF, IL-3, and GM-CSF. We report herein that SF, but not IL-3 or GM-CSF, dramatically stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the product of the recently discovered proto-oncogene, vav, in two SF-responsive human cell lines, M07E and TF-1. Although phosphorylation is very rapid, reaching maximal levels within 2 min at 37 degrees C, co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that c-kit may either not associate directly with p95vav or bind to it with very low affinity.

Up-regulation begins within 1 min of treatment, is maximal by 30 min, is maintained for at least 3 h, and is associated with CD34 hyperphosphorylation. A specific inhibitor of PKC, 2,6-diamino-N-(1[1-(1-oxotridecyl)-2-piperadinyl]methyl)h exan-amide (NPC 15437), blocks both up-regulation and hyperphosphorylation of CD34. CD34 up-regulation is independent of transcription and/or translation and results from the recruitment of preformed intracellular CD34. The endocytosis rate of surface CD34 is unaltered by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Thus, activation of PKC mediates increased surface expression of the CD34 molecule possibly as a result of phosphorylation of CD34.","['Fackler, M J', 'Civin, C I', 'May, W S']","['Fackler MJ', 'Civin CI', 'May WS']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21231.']",['eng'],"['CA44649/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47993/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Fetal Blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Phosphopeptides/isolation & purification', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1992/09/05 00:00,1992/09/05 00:01,['1992/09/05 00:00'],"['1992/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)37076-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Sep 5;267(25):17540-6.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These levels were higher than those in B-lineage lymphoblasts from 19 children with other aneuploidy (326 and 159 to 775 pmol/10(9) cells) and 15 children with diploidy (393 and 204 to 571 pmol/10(9) cells) (P = .0015). Chromosomal trisomies in hyperdiploid cases were highly nonrandom. Chromosome 9 was not one of the chromosomes involved in trisomies, even though this chromosome contains the gene for folate polyglutamate synthetase, which is the enzyme required for MTXPG synthesis. The correlation between MTXPG level and percentage of S-phase cells was weak, suggesting that increased levels of MTXPGs could not be attributed to elevated proportions of cells in active DNA synthesis. The ability of hyperdiploid lymphoblasts to accumulate high levels of MTXPGs may increase their sensitivity to MTX cytotoxicity, accounting in part for the improved outlook for hyperdiploid patients treated with regimens that emphasize MTX as a primary component of continuation therapy.","['Whitehead, V M', 'Vuchich, M J', 'Lauer, S J', 'Mahoney, D', 'Carroll, A J', 'Shuster, J J', 'Esseltine, D W', 'Payment, C', 'Look, A T', 'Akabutu, J']","['Whitehead VM', 'Vuchich MJ', 'Lauer SJ', 'Mahoney D', 'Carroll AJ', 'Shuster JJ', 'Esseltine DW', 'Payment C', 'Look AT', 'Akabutu J', 'et al.']","[""Penny Cole Hematology Research Laboratory, McGill University-Montreal Children's Hospital Research Institute, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33587/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Diploidy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'S Phase']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67628-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 1;80(5):1316-23.,"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concentration of PMA was found to be critical and showed a sharp optimum. In most cases maximal proliferation was obtained with as little as 0.1 ng/mL PMA. In all cases tested, TNF-alpha-induced proliferation could be inhibited completely by the addition of low doses of interleukin-4 (IL-4). Maximal inhibition was already found with 400 pg/mL IL-4. Inhibition by IL-4 was not caused by a downmodulation of TNF receptors. Apart from TNF-alpha, IL-2 was also in synergy with PMA able to induce proliferation in B-CLL cells of some patients. This IL-2-induced proliferation could be inhibited both by IL-4 and by neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. This shows that TNF-alpha also can act as an autocrine growth factor.

The present study examines constitutive synthesis of transcripts in primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts and the effects of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha on c-kit mRNA expression in these cells. The c-kit transcripts were detectable at low levels in 10 of 10 different AML samples investigated. TNF treatment of AML cells was associated with enhanced c-kit mRNA expression in all specimens. Nuclear run-on transcription assays indicated that the c-kit gene was transcriptionally active in all leukemias examined and the rate of transcription was unaffected by exposure to TNF, suggesting posttranscriptional control mechanisms of c-kit mRNA accumulation. In the absence of TNF, the half-life of c-kit transcripts was 2 to 3 hours, while in TNF-treated AML cells, c-kit half-life was found to be 5 to 9 hours. Inhibition of protein synthesis reduced TNF-induced c-kit mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis, but did not affect the rate of c-kit gene transcription. In the presence of inhibition of protein synthesis, the half-life of c-kit transcripts in TNF-induced leukemia cells decreased to 2 to 4 hours. These findings indicate that levels of c-kit mRNA are controlled by a labile protein that is involved in TNF-mediated stabilization of c-kit transcripts. The effects of TNF-alpha also extended to the protein level in that TNF-alpha treatment of primary AMLs was associated with enhanced surface expression of the SCF receptor by some of these cells. While exogenous SCF induced clonogenic growth of all primary AML samples investigated, TNF-alpha failed to stimulate leukemic cells to proliferate. However, the combination of SCF and TNF-alpha resulted in synergistic growth stimulation in seven of nine different AML specimens investigated.

Colony-forming abilities by MDS progenitors were improved following costimulation with KL, particularly in refractory anemia (RA) and refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS); however, little enhancement was apparent following KL stimulation of marrow from patients with refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-t), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). These results suggest that KL responsiveness of patients with low-risk MDS may still be intact, and that with progression to high-risk MDS, erythroid progenitors lose proliferative reactivity to both KL and Epo stimulation. KL may have a therapeutic role in restoring erythropoiesis in a subset of patients with MDS.","['Backx, B', 'Broeders, L', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Backx B', 'Broeders L', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/blood', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*physiopathology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67614-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 1;80(5):1213-7.,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we tested the mitogenic activity of recombinant human SCF on myeloid leukemia cells as well as the expression of its receptor. We have investigated the proliferation of 31 myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as fresh myeloid leukemic blasts from 17 patients in a 72-hour 3H-thymidine uptake assay in the presence of various concentrations of recombinant human (rh) SCF alone or in combination with saturating concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, M-CSF, interleukin-3 (IL-3), or erythropoietin (EPO). Only five of 31 lines, but fresh leukemic blasts from 12 of 17 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), significantly responded to SCF. The responding cell lines were of the acute promyelocytic, chronic myeloid, megakaryoblastic, and erythroleukemia origin, the responding blast preparations of all French-American-British subtypes. Synergistic activities of SCF were found with G-CSF, GM-CSF, EPO, and IL-3. To determine the SCF binding sites on leukemic cells, we used 125I-radiolabeled SCF in Scatchard analysis and cross-linking studies. The leukemic cell lines responding to SCF expressed from 2,300 up to 29,000 binding sites per cell. The SCF receptor expression was downregulated in vitro by the presence of its ligand. Cross-linking studies demonstrated a 150-Kd SCF receptor on the surface of all responding myeloid leukemias. This study suggests that SCF may be an important factor for the growth of myeloid leukemia cells, either as a direct stimulus or as a synergistic factor for other cytokines. Furthermore, using polymerase chain reaction analysis of total RNA from the myeloid leukemia lines, we found expression of SCF-mRNA in 17 of 30 lines, suggesting autocrine mechanisms in the growth of a subgroup of leukemic cells by coexpression of SCF and its receptor.","['Pietsch, T', 'Kyas, U', 'Steffens, U', 'Yakisan, E', 'Hadam, M R', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Zsebo, K', 'Welte, K']","['Pietsch T', 'Kyas U', 'Steffens U', 'Yakisan E', 'Hadam MR', 'Ludwig WD', 'Zsebo K', 'Welte K']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67612-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 1;80(5):1199-206.,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A competitive displacement assay using the fluorescent lysine analogue of MTX, N-(4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroyl)-N epsilon-(4'-fluorescein-thiocarbamyl)-L-lysine (PT430), was developed as a sensitive method of detection of transport resistance to MTX in cell lines, as well as in blast cells from patients with leukemia. Rapid uptake of PT430 at high concentrations (20 mumol/L) in leukemic blasts resulted in achievement of steady-state levels within 2 hours. Subsequent incubation with the folate antagonists, MTX and trimetrexate (TMTX), which differ in the mode of carrier transport, produced characteristic patterns of PT430 displacement. Flow cytometric analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity in the human CCRF-CEM T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell line and its MTX-resistant subline clearly identified the presence of transport deficiency in the resistant subline. Analysis of blasts from 17 patients with leukemia, nine with no prior chemotherapy and eight previously treated with chemotherapy, found evidence of MTX transport resistance in two of the four patients who were treated with MTX and considered to be clinically resistant to the drug. The finding that blast cells of some patients with leukemia considered clinically resistant to MTX is due to decreased MTX transport has important implications for clinical use of this drug and for new drug development.","['Trippett, T', 'Schlemmer, S', 'Elisseyeff, Y', 'Goker, E', 'Wachter, M', 'Steinherz, P', 'Tan, C', 'Berman, E', 'Wright, J E', 'Rosowsky, A']","['Trippett T', 'Schlemmer S', 'Elisseyeff Y', 'Goker E', 'Wachter M', 'Steinherz P', 'Tan C', 'Berman E', 'Wright JE', 'Rosowsky A', 'et al.']","['Program of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],['CA 19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biological Transport', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Trimetrexate/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67606-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 1;80(5):1158-62.,"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients then received either recombinant interferon-alpha-2b (r-IFN-alpha-2b) or a unique IFN, recombinant consensus IFN (rIFN-con-1), each given at doses of 10 micrograms/m2 subcutaneously three times a week, coupled with continued daily G-CSF therapy, for 3 months. After 3 months the G-CSF was discontinued; patients continued to take IFN for 1 year. All 10 patients responded to G-CSF with normalization of neutrophil counts within 2 weeks; the increase in neutrophil counts was greater in previously splenectomized patients. Four patients were treated with r-IFN-alpha-2b, and six were treated with rIFN-con-1. No patients developed recurrent neutropenia with the initiation of IFN therapy. Nine patients are evaluable for response to IFN. Five of six patients demonstrated hematologic improvement with rIFN-con-1, with two patients obtaining complete responses. All three patients receiving r-IFN-alpha-2b demonstrated hematologic improvement; one complete response was observed. Toxicities of both IFNs included influenza-like symptoms. We conclude that G-CSF can abrogate the myelosuppressive effects of IFN, and may be a useful adjunct to this therapy in neutropenic patients.

In these cells, histamine and dimaprit increased [Ca2+]i with EC50 values of 15 microM and 30 microM, respectively. Diphenhydramine inhibited the effect of histamine (100 microM) on [Ca2+]i up to 40%, with an IC50 of 100 nM. Famotidine and cimetidine diminished the effect of histamine (100 microM) up to 75%, with IC50 values of 85 nM and 300 nM, respectively.

Diphenhydramine, famotidine, cimetidine, and impromidine showed marked noncompetitive antagonism with histamine.

We found that the level of almost all of the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins was either decreased or disappeared at a very early stage of differentiation. Addition of sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), a specific inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatases, prevented the alteration as well as erythroid differentiation. Mutant MEL cells, which are resistant to differentiation by dimethyl sulfoxide, were apparently insensitive to the alteration. These results indicate that dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues in cellular proteins is coupled with a reaction(s) which is responsible for triggering differentiation of MEL cells.","['Watanabe, T', 'Kume, T', 'Oishi, M']","['Watanabe T', 'Kume T', 'Oishi M']","['Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Sulfuric Acid Esters/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",1992/08/25 00:00,1992/08/25 00:01,['1992/08/25 00:00'],"['1992/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)41901-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Aug 25;267(24):17116-20.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Sulfuric Acid Esters)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'JW5CW40Z50 (dimethyl sulfate)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous reports had shown that CLL cells from blood were defective in locomotor capacity and that adding PMA to the cells did not restore locomotion in a short-term (30 min) assay, but did stimulate unusual non-locomotor, multipolar, morphologies in a small proportion of the cells. Here we describe experiments in which CLL cells were cultured for 48 h in PMA. Many of the cells acquired locomotor morphologies with front-tail polarity which was unlike the short-term multipolar morphology. These cultured cells were also capable of locomotion and invaded collagen gels. Autoradiography suggested that after culture in PMA, the locomotory cells were the most active cells in 3H-uridine uptake. A computer analysis suggested that the cells in locomotor morphology were the same cells that increased in size. These findings suggest that, to acquire locomotor capacity, CLL lymphocytes require an appropriate signal to allow the cells to enter the cell cycle. During G1 the lymphocytes develop the capacity for locomotion. Long-term, but not short-term, culture in PMA provides such a signal but the mechanism by which it does so is unclear.","['Islam, L N', 'Wilkinson, P C']","['Islam LN', 'Wilkinson PC']","['Immunology Department, University of Glasgow, Western Infirmary, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Invasion Metastasis,Invasion & metastasis,8202435,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoradiography', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA/biosynthesis/blood', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Invasion Metastasis. 1992;12(1):47-56.,"['10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 1.9 MAb was found to recognize a variety of subcellular components, viz., nucleus (nucleoplasm and nucleolus), cytoplasm, vimentin-type intermediate filaments (IF), stress fibers, and cell membrane. Among these components the beta-isozyme-specific MAbs (1.3 and MC-2a) recognized only the IF network, stress fibers, and edges of the cell membrane. Experiments with vimentin+ and vimentin- mutants of SW13 cells, double indirect immunofluorescence studies with anti-vimentin and anti-PKC antibodies, and drug studies confirmed that the IF network is the predominant cytoskeletal network labeled with all anti-PKC MAbs. Immunoblotting studies with the MC-2a MAb revealed that the observed staining of the IF network was not due to a cross-reaction of the MAb with IF proteins and that the MAb specifically recognizes PKC. These studies, while identifying the diverse cell components to which PKC binds, have demonstrated, for the first time, that PKC associates with the IF network in a variety of cell types. Additionally, the studies have confirmed the studies by others concerning the association of PKC with stress fibers.","['Murti, K G', 'Kaur, K', 'Goorha, R M']","['Murti KG', 'Kaur K', 'Goorha RM']","[""Department of Virology & Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filaments/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Isoenzymes/analysis/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/analysis/*metabolism']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(92)90401-S [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(92)90401-s [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1992 Sep;202(1):36-44. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(92)90401-s.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, H11 and H14 were found to be specific for MHC class I heavy chain and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2 M), respectively. Among the four commercially obtained mAbs, two mAbs for MHC class I antigen and two mAbs to beta 2 M, one mAb to MHC class I antigen and one mAb to beta 2 M were also found to be inhibitory to the syncytium formation. The functional comparison of these mAbs revealed that the syncytium-inhibitory mAbs induced strong homotypic cell adhesion particularly in the HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines. This cell adhesion was dependent on temperature, energy metabolism, and microfilament function but not on the activity of protein kinase C or divalent cations. These results suggest a novel type of LFA-1-independent cell adhesion induced by signal transduction via MHC class I antigen.","['Furuse, M', 'Fukudome, K', 'Imai, T', 'Uwabe, K', 'Hinuma, Y', 'Yoshie, O']","['Furuse M', 'Fukudome K', 'Imai T', 'Uwabe K', 'Hinuma Y', 'Yoshie O']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Fusion', 'Epitopes', 'HTLV-I Infections/*transmission', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*microbiology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*immunology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(92)90027-M [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(92)90027-m [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1992 Sep;143(2):298-309. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(92)90027-m.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify tumor cell surface antigens that cause the cross-reactive host response, the serum components were analyzed by absorption of RS with allogeneic lymphocytes. RS components were found to recognize allogeneic lymphocyte antigens including Qa-2 and Ly6.2. Specificity for the Qa-2 antigen was further tested using Qa-2-congenic mice. The expression of Qa-2 antigen was detected on the surfaces of MM2 and other tumor cells derived from H-2k mice (seven among nine cell lines tested) by a membrane immunofluorescence method using a Qa-2-specific mAb. Physical characteristics of the Qa-2-specific component in RS were determined and found to differ from those of regular IgGs but to be similar to those of IgDs. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with an IgD-specific mAb and Qa-2-lacZ fusion protein, the existence of IgD in RS with specificity for Qa-2 was confirmed.

When non-self peptides (eg., pathogen derived) are bound to the class I molecules, they form ligands for T cell receptors resulting in antigen specific lysis of the infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Therefore, an understanding of the process of antigen recognition requires the precise definition of the structural features of the bimolecular complex formed by a single well defined antigenic peptide bound to the class I molecule. A strategy using antibodies was developed to probe the structural features of the H-2Kb containing a defined peptide in the antigen cleft. We report that the binding surface area of a Kb specific monoclonal antibody (28-13-3s) includes residues in the alpha 1 (Gly56 and Glu58) and alpha 2 (Trp167) helices of Kb thus, binding across the antigen binding groove. When cells treated with the antigenic peptide of vesicular stomatitis virus, N52-59, and its alanine substituted analogs were tested for 28-13-3s binding, it was found that position 1 of the peptide also forms a part of the antibody binding site.

Here we demonstrate that this is the result of the fact that NALM-6 cells do not express the ligand for CD28, namely B7. NALM-6 transfectants that expressed high levels of B7 gained the capacity to stimulate IL-2 production by class II MHC molecule-specific alloreactive T cells and to costimulate a polyclonal population of purified T cells cultured with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb. In the presence of PMA, NALM-6 cells transfected with B7 polyclonally stimulated T cells in a cyclosporine A-resistant fashion, a property previously attributed only to agonistic anti-CD28 mAb. The gain of these functions could not be explained solely by an increased capacity of the transfectants to form conjugates with T cells, suggesting that the CD28/B7 interaction transduces a costimulatory signal in T cells.","['Norton, S D', 'Zuckerman, L', 'Urdahl, K B', 'Shefner, R', 'Miller, J', 'Jenkins, M K']","['Norton SD', 'Zuckerman L', 'Urdahl KB', 'Shefner R', 'Miller J', 'Jenkins MK']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['AI-27998/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-28365/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-42071/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/physiology', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Antigens, Surface/*physiology', 'B7-1 Antigen', 'CD28 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Sep 1;149(5):1556-61.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M. Jovin and D. J. Arndt-Jovin. 1989. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 18:271-308.) has been adapted to an ACAS 570 (laser scanning microscope) system to measure fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) on individual human peripheral blood T cells. Photobleaching was completed in approximately 100 ms in our case and it followed double-exponential kinetics. The energy transfer efficiency (E) was approximately 20% between the CD4 epitopes OKT4-FITC and Leu-3a-PE as well as between OKT4E-FITC and OKT4-PE. E was approximately 8% between OKT4-FITC and Leu-4-PE (alpha CD3) and barely detectable (approximately 4%) from OKT4-FITC to Leu-5b-PE (alpha CD2). The E values obtained by the photobleaching method were highly reproducible both in repeated measurement of identical samples and in experiments with different batches of cells and were in agreement with the flow cytometric donor quenching measurements. As expected, E measured between primary and secondary layers of antibodies increased (from approximately 14% to approximately 28%) when F(ab')2 fragments were substituted for whole antibody molecules as the donor. On a T cell line we mapped the distance between the idiotypic determinant of the T cell receptor (TcR) and the Leu-4 epitope of CD3 as proximal as E = 28%, as compared to E = 4% between a framework TcR epitope and Leu-4. In the latter case, however, approximately 40% less Leu-4 was bound suggesting that the antigen binding site of TcR is in close proximity with one of the two CD3 epsilon chains, which hence are not equivalent.","['Szaba, G Jr', 'Pine, P S', 'Weaver, J L', 'Kasari, M', 'Aszalos, A']","['Szaba G Jr', 'Pine PS', 'Weaver JL', 'Kasari M', 'Aszalos A']","['Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC 20204.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes/*analysis', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments', 'Lasers', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning/methods', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis/immunology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1992/03/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/03/11 19:15'],"['1992/03/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/03/11 19:15 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(92)81871-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(92)81871-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1992 Mar;61(3):661-70. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(92)81871-4.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",,,,PMC1260284,,,,,,,,,,

The most common presenting symptoms were skin rash (58%) and bleeding manifestations (45%). All patients had some degree of splenomegaly and in 88% this was more than 3 centimetres below the costal margin. Hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy were also frequent findings. Anaemia was common and leucocytosis an invariable finding with a white cell count above 50 x 10(9) 1-1 in 42%. Monocytosis was found in 78%. Haemoglobin F measurements were available in 31 children and above 10% in 22 (67%). No child had the Philadelphia chromosome or monosomy 7. Thirty children were treated with chemotherapy, with a variable degree of symptomatic improvement. Twenty-nine patients had died with a median survival time of 5 months. The commonest cause of death was complications of bone marrow failure and no child developed acute leukaemia. Presenting characteristics associated with a longer survival period were age less than 6 months (P = 0.02), female sex (P = 0.02), HbF less than 10% (P = 0.0004) and the absence of bleeding manifestations (P = 0.03).

An important area of investigation concerns defining the regulation of expression of such receptor/ligand pairs, since understanding such events are central in the quest to manipulate immune responses. Receptors for the neuropeptide, substance P, are present on a variety of leukocytes, and these receptor positive cells respond to in vitro stimulation with substance P in a variety of ways. Unfortunately, little is known about the regulation of expression of substance P or its receptor in leukocytes. Here we begin to address this question by examining the ability of macrophages to express mRNAs which encode substance P and its receptor. A radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to the mRNA which encodes substance P (i.e., preprotachykinin mRNA) hybridized to a 1.3 kb RNA species present in rat macrophages. In addition, the expression of this RNA could be upregulated 6 to 8 fold when macrophages were stimulated with LPS. The ability of macrophages to synthesize and secrete immunoreactive-substance P was demonstrated by incorporation of L-[35S]methionine into material from macrophage cultures which could be recognized by a monoclonal antisubstance antibody. Macrophage RNA of approximately 3.1 kb in size was capable of hybridizing with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to rat brain substance P receptors. In addition, this RNA could be upregulated when cells were exposed to LPS. Taken together, these studies suggest that the genes used by neuronal cells and macrophages to encode substance P and its receptor are similar if not identical.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Bost, K L', 'Breeding, S A', 'Pascual, D W']","['Bost KL', 'Breeding SA', 'Pascual DW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA 70112.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Reg Immunol,Regional immunology,9001013,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Endotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Lipopolysaccharides', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neuroimmunomodulation', 'Protein Precursors/genetics', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Neurokinin-1', 'Receptors, Neurotransmitter/*genetics', 'Substance P/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tachykinins/genetics']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Reg Immunol. 1992 Mar-Apr;4(2):105-12.,"['0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Neurokinin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Neurotransmitter)', '0 (Tachykinins)', '0 (preprotachykinin)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most CLL are monoclonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders characterized by the coexpression of B-cell antigens and CD5, an antigen present predominantly on T cells. Very little attention, however, has been paid to the quantitative characteristics of the expression of B-cell antigens in CLL. In this study, we used flow cytometry to analyze the expression of CD20, a well-known B-cell-associated antigen, in lymphocytes from 42 cases of CLL and its tissue counterpart, small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and compared the results with results obtained from the analysis of 21 follicular lymphomas, 20 hyperplastic reactive nodes, and 26 samples of normal peripheral blood. The intensity of CD20 expression in the CLL/SLL cells was significantly lower than that of B cells in the other categories. This antigen expression abnormality does not appear to be a universal phenomenon in CLL/SLL, since CD19, another pan-B antigen, was expressed in CLL/SLL at levels higher than those in follicular lymphomas and comparable to those in reactive lymph nodes. These results indicate that the low CD20 expression can be used as a marker for CLL/SLL. The few cases exhibiting intense CD20 expression may represent a biologically different disease. CLL/SLL cells faintly expressing CD20 also show concomitant low CD5 expression in a manner not observed in normal CD5-expressing B cells.","['Almasri, N M', 'Duque, R E', 'Iturraspe, J', 'Everett, E', 'Braylan, R C']","['Almasri NM', 'Duque RE', 'Iturraspe J', 'Everett E', 'Braylan RC']","['Department of Pathology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville 32610.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*genetics', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*immunology', 'Lewis X Antigen', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830400404 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1992 Aug;40(4):259-63. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830400404.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diameter of the isolated particles was 80 nm as determined by negative staining. Two polypeptides of 77 and 110 kDa were found to be their major polypeptide components, in agreement with the expected sizes of the Gag and Gag-Pro precursor polypeptides of the mature MMTV proteins. Both polypeptides were recognized by antibodies directed toward the matrix (p10) and capsid (p27) proteins of MMTV. Immunogold labeling of p10 on isolated A particles, visualized by negative staining, showed that this protein is located at the surface of the immature capsids, whereas p27 can be detected only in broken or disrupted particles, suggesting that it has an internal location. These observations were confirmed by immunolabeling of both proteins on thin sections of A particle-producing cells. In addition, the viral protease had a more internal position than p27. Since the sequential order of the viral proteins in the Gag precursor is p10-pp21-p27-p14 and that in Gag-Pro is p10-pp21-p27-p30-protease, our results demonstrate the radial organization of the polypeptide precursors forming the intracytoplasmic A particles.","['Menendez-Arias, L', 'Risco, C', 'Pinto da Silva, P', 'Oroszlan, S']","['Menendez-Arias L', 'Risco C', 'Pinto da Silva P', 'Oroszlan S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Carcinogenesis, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702-1201.']",['eng'],['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Capsid/immunology/*isolation & purification/ultrastructure', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Epitopes', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*immunology/isolation & purification/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Core Proteins/immunology/*isolation & purification/ultrastructure', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.9.5615-5620.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Sep;66(9):5615-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.9.5615-5620.1992.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,PMC289125,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of both amino acid sequence and gene structure has demonstrated that OSM is a member of a cytokine family that includes leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). We demonstrate that, like LIF, IL-6 and G-CSF, OSM can induce the differentiation of the myeloblastic M1 murine leukemia cells into macrophage-like cells. The morphologic and functional changes induced by OSM are more similar to those observed with LIF and IL-6 than those induced with G-CSF. OSM can also induce the differentiation of the histiocytic U937 human leukemia cells in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage CSF, a property shared with LIF and IL-6. In murine M1 cells, binding of labeled OSM is completely inhibited by excess LIF or OSM, reflecting the binding of OSM to the high affinity form of the murine LIF receptor. In contrast, the binding of labeled OSM to human U937 leukemia cells is inhibited by OSM, but the inhibition by LIF is significantly less. These results suggest that, in human leukemia cells, OSM may act through the LIF receptor and an OSM-specific receptor. The existence of an OSM-specific receptor was confirmed by both growth inhibition and competition binding assays on A375 human melanoma cells. The growth of human A375 cells was inhibited by OSM and IL-6 but not LIF or G-CSF.

H52 transfectants were brightly stained with the antibody, and the 80-kDa molecule was immunoprecipitated from the transfectants. Northern blot analysis showed that this transcript was detected in mouse melanoma cells of C57BL/6 and DBA/2 origin, C1300 A/J neuroblastoma, L cell (C3H) and EL-4 T lymphoma (C57BL/6), faintly in BW5147 (AKR) T lymphoma, but not in other tumors, such as S913 fibrosarcoma (C57BL/10), NIH3T3, 70 Z/3 pre-B lymphoma, and P3U1 plasmacytoma (BALB/c). Since the transcripts were not found in normal C57BL/6 tissues of fetus, newborn, and adult origin, the H52 expression is associated with transforming phenotypes. However, no tissue- or cell type-specific expression was observed. Nucleotide sequence analysis has clearly demonstrated that H52 cDNA encodes the full length of the env gene and long terminal repeat region of endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia provirus of AKV-type, which is defective in C57BL/6. The H52 envelope protein has several amino acid changes compared to those of AKV, one of which is in the env 14 peptide region preferentially associated with MHC molecule, suggesting the possible reason for the difference of antibody reactivity even in H52-positive tumors. We also demonstrate that CTL against H52 transfectant kills B16 melanoma. Thus, the above results are direct evidence that even the endogenous self molecule, when constitutively expressed, does act as a tumor Ag.","['Hayashi, H', 'Matsubara, H', 'Yokota, T', 'Kuwabara, I', 'Kanno, M', 'Koseki, H', 'Isono, K', 'Asano, T', 'Taniguchi, M']","['Hayashi H', 'Matsubara H', 'Yokota T', 'Kuwabara I', 'Kanno M', 'Koseki H', 'Isono K', 'Asano T', 'Taniguchi M']","['Division of Molecular Immunology, Chiba University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Epitopes', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*immunology', 'Genes', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Melanoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transfection']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Aug 15;149(4):1223-9.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,['env'],,,,,,,,['GENBANK/D10049'],,,,

NK cells do not express CD3/TCR complexes and the membrane receptors participating in MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity are largely unknown. We demonstrate that YT2C2, a human NK leukemia cell line, expresses the CD28 differentiation Ag and can spontaneously lyse both murine and human cell lines expressing B7, a B cell- activation Ag that is a ligand for CD28. The participation of CD28/B7 interactions in MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity mediated by YT2C2 cells was demonstrated by correlation of target sensitivity with levels of B7 expression, inhibition of cytotoxicity by anti-CD28 or anti-B7 mAb, and by making both murine and human cell lines susceptible to YT2C2-mediated lysis by genetic transfection with expression vectors containing B7 cDNA. However, CD28/B7 interactions alone were insufficient to initiate cytotoxicity. mAb inhibition experiments and selection of CD54- (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) deficient B cell targets indicated that CD11a/18 (lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1) also cooperated in CD28/B7-dependent cytotoxicity. The requirement for both CD28/B7 and lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1/intercellular adhesion molecule-1 interactions in YT2C2-mediated MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity was confirmed by demonstrating that efficient lysis of murine L cells required cotransfection with both B7 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. These findings support the concept that MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity may not be due to a unique receptor, but may result from interactions between an appropriate array of ""adhesion"" molecules with their ligands.","['Azuma, M', 'Cayabyab, M', 'Buck, D', 'Phillips, J H', 'Lanier, L L']","['Azuma M', 'Cayabyab M', 'Buck D', 'Phillips JH', 'Lanier LL']","['Department of Immunology, DNAX Research Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Palo Alto, CA 94304.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen', 'CD28 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Aug 15;149(4):1115-23.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells differentiated into a T-lymphoid cell line (TALL-103/2) upon removal of IL-3 and incubation in IL-2. Despite the different phenotype, the two cell lines remained karyotypically and genotypically identical. Here, we have analyzed the phenotypic changes and the signaling events induced by these two lymphokines in TALL-103/3 cells by switching them to temporary growth in IL-2 and returning them to IL-3. All four sublines obtained (the myeloid in IL-3 and the lymphoid in IL-2) expressed RNA for CD3, IL-2 receptor (R) alpha, and T-cell receptor (TCR)-gamma and -delta chains. However, cells cultured in IL-3 failed to express detectable levels of the IL-2R beta chain at both the protein and RNA levels, whereas cells exposed to IL-2 always expressed IL-2R beta. In parallel with the changes in IL-2R beta expression, the SRC-like protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) p56 LCK could not be detected in IL-3-dependent cells, but was abundant in the IL-2-dependent cells and underwent markedly increased autophosphorylation in response to IL-2. In contrast, p53/p56 LYN was highly expressed in IL-3-dependent cells, and greatly decreased when these cells were switched to growth in IL-2. LYN kinase autophosphorylation modestly increased in response to IL-3. None of the other kinases in the SRC family that were tested underwent increased autophosphorylation after lymphokine stimulation, indicating the specificity of IL-2 for LCK and of IL-3 for LYN.

The diagnosis of myelodysplasia is often based on quantitative and qualitative findings in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. These findings are often shared by other disorders. There is a need for sensitive and inexpensive laboratory tests to determine clonality and karyotypic abnormalities in this disorder. Future classifications of these syndromes will need to be based on morphologic and biologic markers that are closely linked to disease progression, response to treatment, and survival. Our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of MDS decreases the specificity and effectiveness of our therapeutic interventions. Agents that are minimally toxic such as CRA, danazol, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, androgens, and pyridoxine are seldom useful. Antileukemic therapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation have a major role to play in patients younger than 45 years of age; in older patients these treatment modalities remain controversial because of their toxicity. Hematopoietic growth factors, used alone or in combination, may improve the quality of life and improve survival of patients with MDS. Growth factors may also decrease treatment-related mortality associated with chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation and render these treatment modalities available for a higher percentage of patients. The development of more specific differentiating agents may permit hematopoietic differentiation while minimizing side effects.","['Noel, P', 'Solberg, L A Jr']","['Noel P', 'Solberg LA Jr']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Calcitriol/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Danazol/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",1992/01/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/01/11 19:15'],"['1992/01/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/01/11 19:15 [entrez]']",['10.1016/1040-8428(92)90054-t [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1992;12(3):193-215. doi: 10.1016/1040-8428(92)90054-t.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'N29QWW3BUO (Danazol)']",,"['GPD', 'HPRT', 'Ha-ras', 'Ki-ras', 'N-ras', 'PGK', 'c-FMS', 'ras', 'v-FMS']",296,,,,,,,,,,,

The direct cause of activation during mitosis appears to be temporally correlated partial dephosphorylation of Tyr-527, a residue whose phosphorylation strongly suppresses pp60c-src activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of the serine/threonine phosphorylation sites blocks half the mitosis-specific decrease in Tyr-527 phosphorylation and half the increase in pp60c-src kinase activity. We conclude that p34cdc2 partially activates pp60c-src by a two-step process in which its serine/threonine phosphorylations either sensitize pp60c-src to a Tyr-527 phosphatase or desensitize it to a Tyr-527 kinase. Furthermore, additional events, independent of these p34cdc2-mediated phosphorylations, participate in mitotic activation of pp60c-src.","['Shenoy, S', 'Chackalaparampil, I', 'Bagrodia, S', 'Lin, P H', 'Shalloway, D']","['Shenoy S', 'Chackalaparampil I', 'Bagrodia S', 'Lin PH', 'Shalloway D']","['Department of Pathology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853.']",['eng'],"['CA01139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32317/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47333/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Codon', 'Genes, src', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', '*Mitosis', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphopeptides/isolation & purification', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Trypsin']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.15.7237 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Aug 1;89(15):7237-41. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.15.7237.,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",,['c-src'],,PMC49681,,,,,,,,,,

Following G1 arrest, the cells die via apoptosis, an active process of cell elimination. Cell synchronization and temperature-shift experiments show that G1 arrest reflects the requirement for a functional v-abl protein during early G1 and that the molecule is not required at other phases of the cell cycle.

The cellular basis of this cytotoxicity is not understood. Using two murine cancer cell lines (the EL4 lymphoma and the K36 leukemia cell line) and two oxygenated sterols (7-ketocholestanol and 25-hydroxycholesterol), our laboratory attempted to determine whether the cytotoxic action of oxysterols was mediated by a mechanism requiring protein or RNA synthesis. The addition of 5 microM 7-ketocholestanol or 25-hydroxycholesterol to the culture medium regularly caused the viable cell count to fall below 10-20% of control within 48-72 h. In the presence of inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis, however, cell viability was consistently and significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner. For cultures of EL4 cells grown in the presence of 5 microM 7-ketocholestanol, for example, the addition of appropriate concentrations of cycloheximide, puromycin, emetine, and actinomycin increased the percentage of viable cells from a control value of less than 6% to 66%, 28%, 76% and 42%, respectively. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with the K36 cell line. Additional studies revealed that macromolecular synthesis inhibitors, while effective in inhibiting protein or RNA synthesis to varying degrees, did not affect the cellular uptake of 7-keto[3H]cholestanol, suggesting that their ability to protect cells against oxysterol-induced cytotoxicity was not due to an inhibition of the cellular oxysterol uptake. These observations suggest that the cytotoxicity of oxygenated sterols may be mediated by mechanisms requiring de novo protein or RNA synthesis and that oxysterol-induced cytotoxicity may provide a useful system for the identification of proteins involved in cell death.","['Hwang, P L']",['Hwang PL'],"['Department of Physiology, National University of Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Emetine/pharmacology', 'Hydroxycholesterols/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Ketocholesterols/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Puromycin/pharmacology', 'RNA/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/07/22 00:00,1992/07/22 00:01,['1992/07/22 00:00'],"['1992/07/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/22 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(92)90077-O [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(92)90077-o [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1992 Jul 22;1136(1):5-11. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(92)90077-o.,"['0 (Hydroxycholesterols)', '0 (Ketocholesterols)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '767JTD2N31 (25-hydroxycholesterol)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'O7676FE78M (7-ketocholesterol)', 'X8D5EPO80M (Emetine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TNF produced by the malignant clone may also inhibit normal haematopoiesis thereby contributing to the cytopenias observed in patients with the disease. We have studied the effects of infusing a murine monoclonal anti-TNF antibody in three patients with HCL. In two patients receiving 0.5 mg of antibody/kg on alternate days for 12 d, the drug was well tolerated. The third patient received 2 mg/kg on alternate days and developed symptoms of serum sickness by day 9. In two patients with severe B-lymphocytopenia, circulating CD19 and CD20 positive, B-cells were restored to normal, the majority of which were negative for the HCL-associated marker CD11c. B-lymphocyte recovery was associated with a rise in serum immunoreactive IL-6 and with an early rise in immunoreactive TNF. These short courses of anti-TNF MAb treatment had modest effect on the tumour burden, producing a reduction in splenomegaly in one patient. Exploration of the effects of more prolonged administration of higher dose anti-TNF antibody will only be feasible when less immunogenic MAbs are available.","['Huang, D', 'Reittie, J E', 'Stephens, S', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Brenner, M K']","['Huang D', 'Reittie JE', 'Stephens S', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Brenner MK']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD11 Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immunoradiometric Assay', 'Interleukin-6/analysis', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/*immunology']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08212.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Jun;81(2):231-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08212.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, both unspecific binding of beads to cells as well as the effectiveness of detachment of beads from cells may represent significant problems. We used an anti-Fab antiserum (DETACHaBEAD, Dynal) for rapid and effective detachment of immunomagnetic beads from the positively selected cells. By this detachment technique, the cells remained phenotypically unaltered. To reduce unspecific binding, we have coated various anti-CD34 monoclonal antibodies directly to paramagnetic beads M450 (Dynal). Use of beads coated with BI-3C5 was found to be optimal with regard to yield and purity of the isolated cells. The yield was on average 1.5% (range 0.5-2.5%) of bone marrow mononuclear cells and the purity was usually greater than 95% CD34+ cells of the isolated cells. Subpopulations of the cells expressed myeloid markers (CD13, CD33, and to a lesser extent CD15 and CD14) or early B-lineage markers (CD19 and CD10). Most of the cells expressed CD38, and a majority of the cells also expressed CD41. In general, most of the CD34+ cells with low forward scatter expressed B-lineage markers, as was also the case for the few contaminating CD34- cells which were found to be predominantly CD37+ mature B cells. Reactivity with antibodies against T-lineage markers (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD7, and CD8) was generally detected only on 1-2% of the cells or less. Isolated cells responded to interleukin 3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, mast cell growth factor, and/or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor alone or in combinations in short-term liquid cultures. The cells were also markedly enriched for granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units as well as for early progenitor cells capable of forming blast colonies on preformed stromal feeder layers. Moreover, the CD34- population was depleted of 70-80% of CFU-GM and cells capable of blast colony formation. Thus, we conclude that the isolated cells are phenotypically unaltered after isolation, and show a normal response in various in vitro assays.","['Smeland, E B', 'Funderud, S', 'Kvalheim, G', 'Gaudernack, G', 'Rasmussen, A M', 'Rusten, L', 'Wang, M Y', 'Tindle, R W', 'Blomhoff, H K', 'Egeland, T']","['Smeland EB', 'Funderud S', 'Kvalheim G', 'Gaudernack G', 'Rasmussen AM', 'Rusten L', 'Wang MY', 'Tindle RW', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Egeland T']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Montebello, Oslo.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Magnetics']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Aug;6(8):845-52.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like other tyrosine kinase oncogenes, BCR/ABL can abrogate the interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependence of lymphoid cell lines. To investigate the ability of BCR/ABL to generate growth factor independence in myeloid cells, the IL-3 dependent myeloid cell line NFS/N1.H7 (H7) was transfected with the p210BCR/ABL-containing plasmid, pGD210. Stable clones A54 and A74 were capable of IL-3 independent growth and tumor formation in syngeneic mice. Relief of growth factor dependence was not mediated by autocrine release of IL-3. The baseline proliferation rate of the BCR/ABL transformed cells was greater than that of the parental H7 cells maximally stimulated by IL-3. Abundant constitutive expression of c-myc, c-jun, and c-fos was observed in the p210BCR/ABL transfectants even in low serum conditions. In contrast, c-myc expression in H7 cells was dependent upon IL-3 stimulation, and neither c-jun nor c-fos was highly expressed following IL-3 stimulation in H7 cells. Thus, BCR/ABL transformation and relief of IL-3 dependence involve not only pathways that can substitute for IL-3 induced growth via tyrosine kinase mediated signals, but also pathways that recruit constitutive c-jun and c-fos expression.","['Mandanas, R A', 'Boswell, H S', 'Lu, L', 'Leibowitz, D']","['Mandanas RA', 'Boswell HS', 'Lu L', 'Leibowitz D']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianpolis.']",['eng'],"['CA 44028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 45571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, fos/genetics', 'Genes, jun/genetics', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Poly A/analysis', 'RNA/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Signal Transduction']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Aug;6(8):796-800.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,['BCR/ABL'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Production of IFN induced by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), pokeweed mitogen (PWM), Corynebacterium parvum, Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and interleukin 2 (IL-2) were studied in the peripheral leukocytes from the patients and from 21 control persons by means of a whole blood technique.

As NDV and C. parvum induce mainly IFN-alpha and the mitogens PHA and Con A mainly IFN-gamma, our results suggest that there is a deficiency in the IFN-alpha response in the patients with NHL but normal response in IFN-gamma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Ho, A D', 'Moritz, T', 'Rensch, K', 'Hunstein, W', 'Kirchner, H']","['Ho AD', 'Moritz T', 'Rensch K', 'Hunstein W', 'Kirchner H']","['Medizinische Universitats-Poliklinik, Heidelberg, FRG.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Interferon Res,Journal of interferon research,8100396,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Inducers/*pharmacology', 'Interferons/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Reference Values']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1992.1992.61 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Res. 1992 May;Spec No:61-9. doi: 10.1089/jir.1992.1992.61.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Interferon Inducers)', '0 (Mitogens)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 promyelocytes and terminally differentiated macrophages express a K(+)-selective ion channel which is activated by intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations above 10(-7) M. Because of its voltage independence, this channel can be distinguished from the voltage- and Ca(2+)-activated family of outward-rectifying channels. The channel is selective for K+ against Na+ and is blocked by Ba2+, thus it may be similar to the Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel previously described in human macrophages. In its sensitivity to block by charybdotoxin, this channel also resembles a Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel of lymphocytes, which plays a role in activation-dependent hyperpolarization. In contrast to promyelocytes and macrophages, functional expression of the Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel is suppressed to nearly undetectable levels in granulocytes derived from HL-60 cells by retinoic acid-induced differentiation. These data suggest that signals which produce elevation of intracellular Ca2+ will hyperpolarize promyelocytes and differentiated macrophages by activating this conductance; however, signals which elevate free Ca2+ in granulocytes must act on other effectors, which may produce a different final influence on membrane potential.","['Wieland, S J', 'Gong, Q H', 'Chou, R H', 'Brent, L H']","['Wieland SJ', 'Gong QH', 'Chou RH', 'Brent LH']","['Department of Anatomy, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Charybdotoxin', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/physiology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Scorpion Venoms/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1992/08/05 00:00,1992/08/05 00:01,['1992/08/05 00:00'],"['1992/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)49551-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Aug 5;267(22):15426-31.,"['0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Scorpion Venoms)', '115422-61-2 (Charybdotoxin)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of LacZ DNA could not be obtained before 30-36 hpf, although synthetic LacZ RNA was translated from 12 hpf at the least. The onset of expression of microinjected DNA correlated with the 8- to 16-cell stage. This suggests that before this stage, there is a general negative control of gene expression. The arrest of in vitro development at the 2- to 8-cell stages did not inhibit LacZ expression, which still occurred at 33 hpf. In addition the inhibition of the first cleavage by nocodazole resulted in LacZ expression in 1-cell embryos. Expression of microinjected DNA thus occurs at a fixed time after fertilization and is independent of cleavages and of the second and subsequent DNA replications. Therefore, the changes in permissiveness for the expression of microinjected DNA in rabbit embryos are reminiscent of those in mouse embryos. Transcriptional selectivity in rabbit embryos was compared to that in early mouse embryos. In both species, Sp1-sensitive promoters were active and the promoter of simian virus 40 did not require far upstream enhancers before late cleavage stages; genes driven by the -447, +563 region of murine leukemia virus were repressed. In rabbit, however, the H-2Kb promoter active in mouse was silent. Altogether, the results illustrate a remarkable conservation of the characteristics of the transcription in early rabbit and mouse embryos and the independence of its resumption from the pattern of cleavage.","['Delouis, C', 'Bonnerot, C', 'Vernet, M', 'Nicolas, J F']","['Delouis C', 'Bonnerot C', 'Vernet M', 'Nicolas JF']","['Station de Physiologie Animale, INRA, Jouy-En-Josas, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Animals', 'Cleavage Stage, Ovum/*physiology', 'DNA/administration & dosage', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Lac Operon', 'Microinjections', 'RNA/administration & dosage', 'Rabbits', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'beta-Galactosidase/analysis']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0014-4827(92)90275-d [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1992 Aug;201(2):284-91. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(92)90275-d.,"['63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activated B lymphocytes and plasma cells are present in the synovial tissue and are thought to contribute to the immunopathology of the rheumatoid joint. To investigate rheumatoid synovial B lymphocytes, we have generated B cell hybridomas from synovial tissue of an RA patient. Here we describe the immunoglobulin VH gene repertoire of eight IgM- and 10 IgG-secreting synovial-derived hybridomas. The VH4 gene family is highly represented (38.5%) in this panel of hybridomas compared with the frequency of VH4 gene expression in circulating B lymphocytes reported previously (19-22%) and with the VH4 gene frequency we observed in a panel of hybridomas derived in the same manner from the spleen and tonsil of normal individuals (19%). The increased frequency of VH4 gene expression was not due to the expansion of a single B cell clone in vivo as none of these hybridomas was clonally related. Two synovial-derived hybridomas secreted autoantibodies; one (VH3+) secreted an IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF) and the other (VH4+) secreted IgM with polyreactive binding to cytoskeletal proteins and cardiolipin. The antibodies secreted by the remaining synovial-derived hybridomas were not reactive with the autoantigens tested. The VH gene usage in a proportion (5/17) of synovial-derived hybridomas that expressed CD5 antigen provided preliminary evidence that CD5+ B cells in RA synovium have a similar increase of VH4 gene expression reported for CD5+ B cells from normal individuals and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.","['Brown, C M', 'Longhurst, C', 'Haynes, G', 'Plater-Zyberk, C', 'Malcolm, A', 'Maini, R N']","['Brown CM', 'Longhurst C', 'Haynes G', 'Plater-Zyberk C', 'Malcolm A', 'Maini RN']","['Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, Hammersmith, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Synovial Membrane/*immunology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.1992.tb06937.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1992 Aug;89(2):230-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.1992.tb06937.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,,,PMC1554435,,,,,,,,,,

In blocked ricin, the galactose-binding sites of the ricin B-chain which mediate nonspecific binding to cells are blocked by covalently linked affinity ligands prepared from N-linked oligosaccharides of fetuin. Blocked ricin consists of two species, one with two covalently attached ligands and one with three covalently attached ligands. In a Phase I dose escalation clinical trial, Anti-B4-bR was administered to patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell neoplasms by 7-day continuous infusion. Although several different lots of Anti-B4-bR had similar IC37 values as determined by in vitro cytotoxicity testing on cultured human cell lines, these lots differed in their in vivo toxicity when administered to patients. Thus, IC37 values alone were not sufficient to predict in vivo toxicity. We report that the degree of cell kill at concentrations of drug that saturate the B4 antigen and murine 50% lethal dose values provide additional parameters that may be predictive of in vivo cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we performed detailed cytotoxicity studies of the ricin species containing two and three covalently attached ligands, respectively. In vitro cytotoxicity testing using these samples revealed that Anti-B4-bR made with blocked ricin containing two covalently attached ligands is capable of depleting five logs of target cells in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay, while Anti-B4-bR comprised of blocked ricin with three ligands can deplete only one log of cells. Log cell kill at antigen saturating concentration, murine 50% lethal dose and biochemical analysis of the composition of blocked ricin are therefore important considerations for establishing the potential efficacy and safety of Anti-B4-bR.","['Grossbard, M L', 'Lambert, J M', 'Goldmacher, V S', 'Blattler, W A', 'Nadler, L M']","['Grossbard ML', 'Lambert JM', 'Goldmacher VS', 'Blattler WA', 'Nadler LM']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Ricin/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha-Fetoproteins']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Aug 1;52(15):4200-7.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interest intensified when durable complete remissions were observed in patients with hairy cell leukemia after IFN treatment; modest, but reproducible activity also was found against tumors such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma which are unresponsive to conventional chemotherapy. Observations of synergy between IFN and cytotoxic drugs in vitro and in vivo suggested that IFN may have additional utility as modulating agents. METHODS: Reports of major clinical trials using IFN either alone or in combination with other agents were reviewed. Activity was identified by disease site. Correlations were made with important preclinical studies. RESULTS: IFN has reproducible, but modest, single-agent activity against melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related Kaposi sarcoma. IFN may be useful in the treatment of a number of benign, in situ, or low-grade tumors. IFN in combinations with cytotoxic agents have demonstrated activity in solid tumors. Clinical trials using combinations of IFN and 5-fluorouracil or dacarbazine suggested a potential benefit for the combination compared with single-agent chemotherapy. These are preliminary findings that require confirmation, but they suggest that combination therapy should be investigated further. In early preclinical and clinical studies, combinations of IFN and other biologic agents, hormonal agents, and radiation therapy appear to be interesting. CONCLUSIONS: The role of IFN in the treatment of solid tumors may be evolving from that of single-agent therapy to combination therapy with other active agents. Additional studies are required to determine the optimal doses, schedules, and sequencing of these combination therapies.","['Wadler, S']",['Wadler S'],"['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York 10467.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Aug 15;70(4 Suppl):949-58.,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],,,97,,,,,,,,,,,

Although IFN are effective as single agents in certain clinical situations, increasing experience with these cytokines suggests that their greatest therapeutic potential may be in combination with other biologic response-modifying, cytotoxic, or antiviral drugs. Trials combining alpha-IFN with 5-fluorouracil to treat colorectal carcinoma or with zidovudine to treat acquired immune deficiency syndrome have shown the significant impact that IFN administered in conjunction with other carefully selected agents can have.

Purified biosynthetic GM-CSF and IL-5 enhanced cell proliferation and induced eosinophilic differentiation in the eosinophilic subline in both liquid and agar cultures. IL-3 and IL-6 stimulated cell proliferation but had no effect on cell differentiation, whereas IL-1 and G-CSF affected neither differentiation nor proliferation of Eos-HL-60 cells under the conditions tested. GM-CSF-, IL-3-, and IL-5-treated Eos-HL-60 cells showed increased O2- production in response to phorbol esters (PMA), enhanced phagocytosis of Candida albicans, and release of the enzymes arylsulfatase, beta-glucuronidase and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO). The degranulation of eosinophils induced by GM-CSF, IL-5, and IL-3 may have relevance to the potential clinical toxicity of these hematopoietins, which also stimulate eosinophilopoiesis. G-CSF had no effect on enzyme release, oxidative metabolism, or phagocytic capacity of Eos-HL-60 cells. IL-5 did not affect proliferation, differentiation, or enzyme release in promyelocytic HL-60 cells. These results indicate the specificity of IL-5 for the eosinophil lineage, confirm the effects of GM-CSF and IL-3 on eosinophilopoiesis and mature eosinophil function in a model system, and indicate the absence of G-CSF and IL-1 stimulation of eosinophils.

In the present study, the effects of various recombinant human (rh) growth regulators on IL-3-dependent growth of eosinophils and basophils were studied in a bone marrow (BM) suspension culture system (normal donors, n = 13). We found that type beta transforming growth factors (TGFs) lead to a significant increase in the absolute numbers of basophils in BM cultures grown in the presence of IL-3 (day 14 of culture; IL-3: 133 +/- 20 v IL-3 + TGF-beta 1: 231 +/- 28 x 10(3)/mL [P less than .01]) and to an increase in the total histamine values (IL-3: 72.6 +/- 22.2 v IL-3 + TGF-beta 1: 142.9 +/- 37.3 ng/mL [P less than .015]) compared with rhIL-3 alone.

The effect of TGF-beta 1 (and TGF-beta 2) on IL-3-dependent differentiation of basophils and eosinophils was dose- and time-dependent (maximum effects observed with 1 to 10 ng/mL of rhTGF-beta 1 or TGF-beta 2) and could be neutralized by an antibody specific for TGF-beta 1. In contrast to the TGFs, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-gamma were found to downregulate IL-3-dependent formation of both basophils (IL-3: 167 +/- 33 v IL-3 + IFN-alpha: 67 +/- 25 v IL-3 + IFN-gamma: 65 +/- 33 x 10(3)/mL [P less than .01]) and eosinophils (IL-3: 239 +/- 5 v IL-3 + IFN-alpha: 81 +/- 4 v IL-3 + IFN-gamma: 67 +/- 17 x 10(3)/mL [P less than .05]) in our culture system.

Together, these results show that type beta TGFs and IFNs are potent regulators of cytokine-dependent growth and differentiation of human allergic effector cells.","['Sillaber, C', 'Geissler, K', 'Scherrer, R', 'Kaltenbrunner, R', 'Bettelheim, P', 'Lechner, K', 'Valent, P']","['Sillaber C', 'Geissler K', 'Scherrer R', 'Kaltenbrunner R', 'Bettelheim P', 'Lechner K', 'Valent P']","['Medical Department, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Basophils/*cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Eosinophils/*cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70569-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Aug 1;80(3):634-41.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ProMMP-9 in these culture media is non-covalently complexed with the 29 kDa tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP), but free proMMP-9 was separated from the TIMP-proMMP-9 complex by chromatography on Green A Dyematrex gel. The final product was homogeneous on SDS/PAGE, with a molecular mass of 88 kDa without reduction and 92 kDa with reduction. Treatment of proMMP-9 with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate converted the 88 kDa precursor into 80 kDa and 68 kDa forms. Gelatin-containing zymographic analysis showed zones of lysis associated with all three species. However, only the 68 kDa species was shown to be catalytically active by its ability to bind to alpha 2-macroglobulin. In the presence of an equimolar amount of TIMP, only the 80 kDa species was generated by treatment with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate, but no enzyme activity was detected. This indicates that TIMP binds to the 80 kDa intermediate and inhibits the generation of the active 68 kDa species. Eight endopeptidases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, plasma kallikrein, thrombin, cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase and thermolysin) were tested for their ability to activate proMMP-9. Of them, trypsin was the most effective activator of proMMP-9. Only partial activation (10-30%) was observed with plasmin, cathepsin G and chymotrypsin. The active forms generated by trypsin were identified as 80 kDa, 74 kDa and 66 kDa by their abilities to bind to alpha 2-macroglobulin. In the presence of an equimolar amount of TIMP, proMMP-9 was also converted into the same molecular-mass species by trypsin, but they were not proteolytically active. This suggests activated MMP-9 is inhibited by TIMP. Activated MMP-9 digested gelatin, type-V collagen, reduced carboxymethylated transferrin and, to a lesser extent, type-IV collagen and laminin A chain. The specific activity against gelatin was estimated to be 15,000 units/mg (1 unit = 1 microgram of gelatin degraded/min at 37 degrees C) by titration with alpha 2-macroglobulin. Comparative studies on digestion of gelatin and collagen types IV and V by MMP-9 and MMP-2 indicated that both enzymes degrade these substrates into similar fragments. However, the susceptibilities of laminin, fibronectin and reduced carboxymethylated transferrin to these two MMPs were sufficiently different to indicate differences in substrate specificities between these two closely related proteinases.","['Morodomi, T', 'Ogata, Y', 'Sasaguri, Y', 'Morimatsu, M', 'Nagase, H']","['Morodomi T', 'Ogata Y', 'Sasaguri Y', 'Morimatsu M', 'Nagase H']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City 66160-7421.']",['eng'],"['AR39189/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR40994/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Precursors/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Fibrosarcoma/*enzymology', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Metalloendopeptidases/metabolism', 'Microbial Collagenase/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phenylmercuric Acetate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Sulfhydryl Reagents/pharmacology', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases', 'Trypsin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*enzymology', 'alpha-Macroglobulins/metabolism']",1992/07/15 00:00,1992/07/15 00:01,['1992/07/15 00:00'],"['1992/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2850603 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1992 Jul 15;285 ( Pt 2):603-11. doi: 10.1042/bj2850603.,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Reagents)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '0 (alpha-Macroglobulins)', '6283-24-5 (4-aminophenylmercuriacetate)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.3 (Microbial Collagenase)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'OSX88361UX (Phenylmercuric Acetate)']",,,,PMC1132831,,,,,,,,,,

Both cell lines lack EBV as detected by the EBNA-1 gene probed Southern-blots. Neither cell line expressed the B-cell-specific CD20 antigen on the cell membrane. However surface expression of CD20 was induced by phorbol ester (TPA) on both LiLa-1 and LK63 cell lines. Other pre-B and B-cell lines, such as Reh, Nalm-1, and BALL-1 did not exhibit these changes in phenotype. Previous immunoprecipitation studies have noted that a broad 50-55 kD band co-precipitates with the characteristic 33-37 kD CD20 protein. We demonstrate that, while the 33-37 kD CD20 species was undetectable on resting LiLa-1 and LK63 cells, in each case a 50-55 kD protein was immunoprecipitated by the CD20 antibody. However, the failure to detect any cell surface CD20-associated antigen on the control cells by immunophenotyping indicated that the CD20 epitope of the 50-55 kD molecule was not expressed on the cell surface. Following exposure to TPA the 50-55 kD species was reduced over 48-72 h while the level of the p33-37 CD20 protein was increased. Northern-blot analysis showed that the 50-55 kD protein was not a cryptic form of CD20 as the uninduced cells contained no detectable CD20 mRNA. The decrease of the 50-55 kD protein and the acquisition of the mature CD20 molecule were paralleled by a decline in proliferative activity in both cell lines. As expression of CD20 by normal pre-B cells also coincides with the cessation of cell division and maturation towards a mature B-cell phenotype, these cell lines appear to represent models for a discrete stage of B-cell differentiation which may be valuable in defining the signals regulating pre-B-cell proliferation.","['Salvaris, E', 'Novotny, J R', 'Welch, K', 'Campbell, L', 'Boyd, A W']","['Salvaris E', 'Novotny JR', 'Welch K', 'Campbell L', 'Boyd AW']","['Lions Clinical Cancer Research Laboratory, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(92)90016-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(92)90016-z [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992 Jun-Jul;16(6-7):655-63. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90016-z.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to increase the therapeutic efficacy of RA, we have measured the capacity of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance the differentiation inducing activity of RA in WEHI-3B D+ monomyelocytic leukemia cells. Combinations of G-CSF and RA produced a supra-additive increase in the percentage of WEHI-3B D+ cells reducing nitro blue tetrazolium and expressing Mac-1 (CD11b) antigen on the cell surface, two markers of the mature state. In the presence of 50 ng/ml of G-CSF, which produced only 12% differentiation when used alone, 0.5 microM RA induced the same degree of cellular differentiation as the optimum concentration of RA (i.e. 7 microM) employed alone. The supra-additive differentiation produced by this combination was prevented by the presence of G-CSF monoclonal antibody in the culture medium, resulting in a degree of maturation comparable to that produced by the retinoid alone. When cells were sequentially exposed to G-CSF followed by RA, a much higher level of differentiation was obtained than when the order was reversed, suggesting that WEHI-3B D+ cells were primed to enter a differentiation pathway by G-CSF.

Impairment of MTX-polyglutamate formation, with membrane transport alteration, in the resistant cells was demonstrated in the previous studies (Koizumi, S. (1988) Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 79, 1230). Further analysis of sensitivity of the cells to trimetrexate (TMQ), which is not polyglutamated and does not require the reduced folate transporter, but is a potent inhibitor of human DHFR, revealed a modest decrease in sensitivity to TMQ (2.4- to 15-fold). Enzyme studies showed that the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activities of these resistant subclones were very similar to that of the parent cells. The number of binding sites of these subclones for MTX calculated from Scatchard analysis was increased up to 7-fold in the K562/MTX-1 and -4 subclones and up to 3-fold in the other 3 subclones as compared to the parent cells. KD values of MTX for the DHFR in the K562/MTX-1 and -4 subclones also appeared to be altered relative to the parent cell line. Further, thymidylate synthase (TS) activity of the resistant subclones was reduced to 50% in K562/MTX-1 and -4 cells, and to 11-25% in the other subclones as compared to the parent cell line. These findings suggest that antifolate resistance in the newly established K562/MTX subclones in multifactorial with polyglutamation and transport defects accounting for the majority of resistance to MTX, and that alteration in the binding affinity of DHFR for MTX and diminished levels of TS may contribute to the 'residual' drug resistance to TMQ and have importance with respect to MTX.","['Koizumi, S', 'Allegra, C J']","['Koizumi S', 'Allegra CJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism', 'Trimetrexate/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(92)90003-P [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(92)90003-p [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992 Jun-Jul;16(6-7):565-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90003-p.,"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various synthetic peptides corresponding to antigenic regions of HTLV-1 gag and env proteins were used for the screening of antibodies in ELISA. In our study, four IgG mAb to the gag p19 amino acids 100 to 130, and 5 IgG mAb to the env p46 amino acids 175 to 199 were characterized. An immunofluorescence assay showed that all of these mAb specifically bound to the surface of HTLV-1-bearing cell lines. Among these mAb, one anti-gp46 mAb, designated KE36-11, neutralized the infectivity of HTLV-1 as determined by both the inhibition of HTLV-1-induced syncytium formation and transformation assays in vitro. An antibody-binding assay using overlapping oligopeptides revealed that KE36-11 recognized a new epitope locating between the gp46 amino acid sequence 187-193 (Ala-Pro-Pro-Leu-Leu-Pro-His). Another anti-gp46 mAb, designated KE36-7, showed antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against HTLV-1-bearing cell line. KE36-7 bound strongly to the 10-mer peptide-gp46 187-196, and weakly to peptides containing the gp46 amino acid sequence 191-196 (Leu-Pro-His-Ser-Asn-Leu). These two epitopes, which are associated with HTLV-1 neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, are thus the first epitopes identified in human HTLV-1 infection. It is possible that passive immunization of humans with these two human mAb are effective on the protection of HTLV-1 infection in vivo.","['Kuroki, M', 'Nakamura, M', 'Itoyama, Y', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Shiraki, H', 'Baba, E', 'Esaki, T', 'Tatsumoto, T', 'Nagafuchi, S', 'Nakano, S']","['Kuroki M', 'Nakamura M', 'Itoyama Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Shiraki H', 'Baba E', 'Esaki T', 'Tatsumoto T', 'Nagafuchi S', 'Nakano S', 'et al.']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/*immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/*immunology', 'Epitopes', 'Gene Products, env/immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/immunology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Peptides/chemistry/immunology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Aug 1;149(3):940-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Peptides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This substrate represents an intermediate in the reverse transcription process where the tRNA(Lys3) primer has not yet been removed after (+)-strand strong stop DNA synthesis. The substrate consists of an RNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the 3'-terminal 17 nucleotides of the tRNA(Lys3) linked to U5 DNA and annealed to single-stranded DNA containing the U5 and the primer-binding site. Upon incubation with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase p66/p51 heterodimer, the minus-strand DNA product resulting from RNase H cleavage retained the 3'-rA from the model tRNA primer. Changing the 3'-terminal AMP of the model tRNA primer from rA to dA did not alter the RNase H cleavage site. Further, the retention of AMP was not dependent on recognition of adjacent U5 sequences or the CCA terminus of the model tRNA(Lys3). The synthetic RNA primer was released as an intact species by a single endonucleolytic cleavage 5' of the rA. The cleavage patterns of Moloney murine leukemia virus and avian myoblastosis virus RNase H activities on the HIV-1 model substrate were more heterogeneous compared to HIV-1 RNase H. This specificity of HIV-1 RNase H would result in linear DNA molecules with a single rA at the U5 terminus and would provide two bases adjacent to the conserved CA dinucleotide to be cleaved away during the integration process.","['Smith, J S', 'Roth, M J']","['Smith JS', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway 08854.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Transfer, Lys/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1992/07/25 00:00,1992/07/25 00:01,['1992/07/25 00:00'],"['1992/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42147-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Jul 25;267(21):15071-9.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Lys)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extension of mismatched 3' termini of the primer DNA was shown to be a major determinant of the infidelity of HIV-1 RT. Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) also shows extensive genetic variations. Therefore, we have analyzed the fidelity of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of HIV-2 RT and compared it with those of RTs of HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus (MLV). Like other retroviral RTs, the HIV-2 RT was shown to lack a 3'----5' exonuclease activity. The ability of HIV-2 RT to extend preformed 3'-terminal A:A, A:C and A:G mispairs was examined by quantitating the amount and length of extended primers. The results demonstrate a relatively efficient mispair extension by HIV-2 RT with a specificity of A:C much greater than A:A greater than A:G. The mispair extension appears to be affected mainly by the increase of apparent Km values rather than by the change in Vmax values. The relative extension frequencies from all mispairs with HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs was 6- to 9-fold greater than that of MLV RT, suggesting that the HIV enzymes are substantially more error-prone than MLV RT.","['Bakhanashvili, M', 'Hizi, A']","['Bakhanashvili M', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],['N0 RO1-AI27035/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Genetic Variation', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-2/*enzymology/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism']",1992/07/20 00:00,1992/07/20 00:01,['1992/07/20 00:00'],"['1992/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(92)80988-S [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(92)80988-s [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1992 Jul 20;306(2-3):151-6. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(92)80988-s.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, constitutively high amounts of protein kinase activity were observed in Epo receptor complexes isolated from autonomously growing cells coexpressing the Epo receptor and the leukemogenic glycoprotein gp55. The dominant phosphotyrosylprotein found associated with the Epo receptor was 97 kDa. An Epo receptor-associated protein of identical molecular mass was also found to bind ATP, a characteristic critical for protein kinases.

The TNF activity of culture supernatants was measured by L cell cytotoxic assay, and a neutralization test using anti-TNF and/or anti-LT antibodies determined whether the cytotoxic activity was due to TNF or LT. The results show that LAK cells secrete both TNF and LT during monoculture and release increased amounts of TNF and LT with non-gliomatous tumor cell stimulation, but PBMC secrete only TNF with tumor cell stimulation. Glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma cells, however, did not stimulate cytokine secretion from either LAK cells or PBMC.

A similar observation was made with murine amphotropic retrovirus particles. It is therefore likely that all retroviruses contain partial reverse transcripts.","['Trono, D']",['Trono D'],"['Infectious Disease Laboratory, Salk Institute, La Jolla, California 92037-1099.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Genome, Viral', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/drug effects/enzymology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Virion/*genetics', 'Zidovudine/pharmacology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.8.4893-4900.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Aug;66(8):4893-900. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.8.4893-4900.1992.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,PMC241327,,,,,,,,,,

However, when infected cells are cultured, they are stimulated to produce virus. We studied viral transcription in PBMCs taken from BLV-infected sheep because the pattern of transcriptional activation in these cells should closely mimic activation of virus expression within mononuclear cells in vivo. BLV transcription was activated as early as 30 min after PBMCs were cultured. Expression was characterized by early and late stages, each distinguished by a unique pattern of cytoplasmic RNAs. In early expression, cytoplasmic viral RNA was exclusively the doubly spliced tax/rex transcript, although all transcripts were present in the nucleus. Early expression gave way rapidly to late expression, in which all viral transcripts accumulated in the cytoplasm. The polyclonal B-cell activator lipopolysaccharide increased the amount of viral RNA by at least twofold but did not alter the pattern of transcription. The transition from early to late expression required new protein synthesis and was blocked by the inhibitor cycloheximide. This requirement reflects the essential role of the viral Rex protein in the transition, but synthesis of cellular factors may be required as well. These results provide the first demonstration of staged viral expression in lymphocytes naturally infected by either BLV or the closely related human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) and validate the model of BLV and HTLV gene expression that previously was derived from transfection experiments performed mainly in nonlymphoid cells.","['Powers, M A', 'Radke, K']","['Powers MA', 'Radke K']","['Department of Avian Sciences, University of California, Davis 95616-8532.']",['eng'],['CA-46374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Capsid/analysis/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Genes, Regulator', '*Genes, Viral', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/growth & development/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Poly A/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Sheep', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Activation']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.8.4769-4777.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Aug;66(8):4769-77. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.8.4769-4777.1992.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,PMC241304,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has not been possible to demonstrate, in vivo or in vitro, specific binding of viral RNA sequences by NC. To determine whether specific packaging of viral RNA is mediated by NC in vivo, we have constructed RSV mutants carrying sequences of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV). Either the NC coding region alone, the psi RNA packaging sequence, or both the NC and psi sequences of MoMuLV were substituted for the corresponding regions of a full-length RSV clone to yield chimeric plasmid pAPrcMNC, pAPrc psi M, or pAPrcM psi M, respectively. In addition, a mutant of RSV in which the NC is completely deleted was tested as a control. Upon transfection, each of the chimeric mutants produced viral particles containing processed core proteins but were noninfectious. Thus, MoMuLV NC can replace RSV NC functionally in the assembly and release of mature virions but not in infectivity. Surprisingly, the full-deletion mutant showed a strong block in virus release, suggesting that NC is involved in virus assembly. Mutant PrcMNC packaged 50- to 100-fold less RSV RNA than did the wild type; in cotransfection experiments, MoMuLV RNA was preferentially packaged. This result suggests that the specific recognition of viral RNA during virus assembly involves, at least in part, the NC protein.","['Dupraz, P', 'Spahr, P F']","['Dupraz P', 'Spahr PF']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Capsid/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chimera', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Fibroblasts', '*Genome, Viral', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Transfection', 'Viral Core Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.8.4662-4670.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Aug;66(8):4662-70. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.8.4662-4670.1992.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,PMC241290,,,,,,,,,,

P-selectin binds to a limited number of protease-sensitive sites on myeloid cells, but the protein(s) that carry the glycans recognized by P-selectin are unknown. Blotting of neutrophil or HL-60 cell membrane extracts with [125I]P-selectin and affinity chromatography of [3H]glucosamine-labeled HL-60 cell extracts were used to identify P-selectin ligands. A major ligand was identified with an approximately 250,000 M(r) under nonreducing conditions and approximately 120,000 under reducing conditions. Binding of P-selectin to the ligand was Ca2+ dependent and was blocked by mAbs to P-selectin. Brief sialidase digestion of the ligand increased its apparent molecular weight; however, prolonged digestion abolished binding of P-selectin. Peptide:N-glycosidase F treatment reduced the apparent molecular weight of the ligand by approximately 3,000 but did not affect P-selectin binding. Western blot and immunodepletion experiments indicated that the ligand was not lamp-1, lamp-2, or L-selectin, which carry sialyl Le(x), nor was it leukosialin, a heavily sialylated glycoprotein of similar molecular weight. The preferential interaction of the ligand with P-selectin suggests that it may play a role in adhesion of myeloid cells to activated platelets and endothelial cells.","['Moore, K L', 'Stults, N L', 'Diaz, S', 'Smith, D F', 'Cummings, R D', 'Varki, A', 'McEver, R P']","['Moore KL', 'Stults NL', 'Diaz S', 'Smith DF', 'Cummings RD', 'Varki A', 'McEver RP']","['Department of Medicine, St. Francis Medical Research Institute, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City 73104.']",['eng'],"['CA 38701/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 34363/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 45510/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism', 'Glucosamine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'P-Selectin', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.118.2.445 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1992 Jul;118(2):445-56. doi: 10.1083/jcb.118.2.445.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)']",,,,PMC2290037,,,,,,,,,,

Blastic cells from all patients were positive for the stem cell-associated antigens, CD34 and HLA-DR, and the immature myeloid antigens, CD13 and CD33. The nonblastic leukemic cells expressed the more mature myeloid antigens, CD11b and CD15, with loss of the immature phenotype. The incidence of positivities for the stem cell-associated antigens, CD34 and HLA-DR, in t(8;21) AML cells was significantly higher in comparison with those in other AML showing granulocytic differentiation (M2 or M3). AML cells with t(8;21) also showed some phenotypic abnormalities. Frequent expression of CD19 was found in the blastic population of t(8;21) AML (18 of 23 cases) without other B-cell antigens and Ig gene rearrangements. CD19 expression was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and Northern blotting. The CD19+ blastic cells coexpressed both CD34 and HLA-DR. In addition, CD33+ cells among the blastic fraction in t(8;21) AML cells were fewer in number than in those of M2 or M3 AML without t(8;21).

Because of their ability to inhibit autocrine growth, antibodies directed against the growth factor or its receptor may have therapeutic potential. However, these agents may also inhibit normal cell development. We have developed two monoclonal antibodies, 4G8 and 2F2, directed against a protein of 110 to 150 Kd that interacts with the interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor (R) complex. These antibodies inhibit IL-3-induced proliferation of nonleukemic and leukemic IL-3-dependent cell lines, as well as the autonomous growth of WEHI-3B in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest the possibility that anti-IL-3R antibodies may be useful in the treatment of some leukemias. However, the effect of anti-IL-3R antibodies on normal myeloid development in vitro has not been examined. We examined the effect of 4G8 and 2F2 on the growth in vitro of colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies induced by IL-3, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and macrophage-CSF (M-CSF). Our results show that while 4G8 and 2F2 inhibited CFU-GM colony formation induced by IL-3, they augmented colony formation induced by the other hematopoietins. 4G8 and 2F2 also enhanced G-CSF-induced proliferation of 32Dc13 and GM-CSF-induced proliferation of PT18, confirming that the effect on CFU-GM was a direct effect. Finally, 4G8 and 2F2 inhibited G-CSF-induced differentiation of 32Dc13, similar to low levels of IL-3; yet, neither 4G8 nor 2F2 blocked binding of G-CSF to its receptor. These results indicate that, in the absence of IL-3 and in the presence of other hematopoietins, 4G8 and 2F2 can function as weak IL-3 agonists. These studies suggest that antibodies such as 4G8 and 2F2, directed against components of the IL-3R, could potentially augment myeloid growth in vivo, rather than inhibit myeloid growth.","['Tweardy, D J', 'Morel, P A', 'Mott, P L', 'Glazer, E W', 'Zeh, H J', 'Sakurai, M']","['Tweardy DJ', 'Morel PA', 'Mott PL', 'Glazer EW', 'Zeh HJ', 'Sakurai M']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA.']",['eng'],['HL-01763/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*immunology/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1992/07/15 00:00,1992/07/15 00:01,['1992/07/15 00:00'],"['1992/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70609-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jul 15;80(2):359-66.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deduced T. parva CK II catalytic subunit sequence shows, over 321 residues comprising the C-terminus of the molecule, extensive identity with CK II alpha and alpha' sequences from both vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. The T. parva CK II subunit amino acid sequence displays 68% identity with the Drosophila alpha subunit and 67% with the Caenorhabditis elegans alpha subunit but only 58% and 56% sequence identity with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha and alpha' subunits, respectively. Comparison of the T. parva sequence with higher eukaryotic alpha and alpha' sequences reveals that it is most identical with the alpha subunit.

Stimulatory activity was significantly greater than in the presence of GM-CSF and was comparable to that of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), and 5637 cell line supernatant (SN). Conversely, the ability of SCF to induce primary colony formation by AML clonogenic cells (CFU-L) was lower than that of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and 5637 SN in all but four cases. However, SCF potentiated the stimulatory effect of GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IL-3 on both 3H-TdR incorporation and colony formation. In a 7-day liquid culture SCF enhanced CFU-L recovery in all cases to a significantly greater extent than the other growth factors. A further increment was obtained by combinations of SCF with GM-CSF, G-CSF, or IL-3, and this was significantly more effective than 5637 SN. SCF did not induce leukemic cell differentiation. Human recombinant SCF is therefore highly efficient in stimulating AML cell proliferation and expanding the CFU-L pool.

We examined the adherence of RBL-2H3 cells to different extracellular matrix proteins and the effect of such attachment on secretion. The cells bound to fibronectin-coated surfaces with maximum binding by 1 h at 37 degrees C. There was less attachment to laminin, collagen type I, and collagen type IV. There was no adherence to uncoated surfaces or in the absence of Ca2+. Binding to fibronectin was blocked by a synthetic peptide containing the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp. Therefore, the binding of RBL-2H3 cells to fibronectin may be mediated by surface molecules that belong to the integrin family. Adherence to fibronectin-coated surfaces resulted in cell spreading, a reorganization of the cytoskeletal elements, and a redistribution of the secretory granules. Attachment to fibronectin also dramatically enhanced high affinity IgE receptor-mediated histamine release. This enhancement was maximum by 1 h of adherence and lasted for at least 6 h. There was also enhanced secretion by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Thus, adherence to fibronectin can enhance both receptor and non-receptor-mediated release. Addition of soluble fibronectin to RBL-2H3 cells in suspension had no effect on secretion. Therefore, enhanced histamine release required cell attachment to immobilized fibronectin. These results suggest that secretion from mast cells/basophils may be modulated by their interaction with the extracellular matrix.","['Hamawy, M M', 'Oliver, C', 'Mergenhagen, S E', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Hamawy MM', 'Oliver C', 'Mergenhagen SE', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/physiology', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Fibronectins/*physiology', 'Histamine Release', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/07/15 00:00,1992/07/15 00:01,['1992/07/15 00:00'],"['1992/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Jul 15;149(2):615-21.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As it occurs with normal human monocytes, IL-4 induces the expression of HLA-DR surface antigens on HL-60 cells as well. The second messenger pathway(s) involved after the IL-4 stimulation leading to class II up-regulation has not been fully examined. Here we show that IL-4-induced class II antigen expression on the HL-60 cell line or normal human monocytes is calcium/calmodulin-independent since theophylline (TPH, a calmodulin inhibitor) does not block the IL-4 effect. In addition, the pyruvate kinase C (PKC) pathway does not seem to participate in the process either because in our system activation of PKC by 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) is insufficient by itself to induce HLA-DR. We found, however, that a second messenger pathway can be mediated by a G protein system since IL-4 concomitantly induces class II and p21ras expression which can be successfully blocked by a highly specific anti-p21ras monoclonal antibody. In addition, using another p21ras inducer, the 5-azacytidine C (5-AzaC), we showed that this agent can also induce the expression of p21ras and class II, both of which can be inhibited by the same antibody. Thus, it appears that IL-4 selects the G protein system as a signaling pathway in order to exert its action for the induction of HLA-DR on human normal monocytes or M2 leukemia target cells. Since monocytes and macrophages participate in virtually all immune reactions, the regulation of class II induction is of obvious importance.","['Vassiliadis, S', 'Papamatheakis, J']","['Vassiliadis S', 'Papamatheakis J']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(92)90302-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(92)90302-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1992 Jul;142(2):426-33. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(92)90302-6.,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (HRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typically, most of the affected chromosomes in the abnormal clone are present in three copies. We have studied two patients with hyperdiploid ALL whose leukemic cells were atypical in that all or most of the chromosomes were present in either two or four copies, raising a suspicion that the observed karyotype arose through duplication of chromosomes in a precursor cell with a near-haploid chromosome number. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms confirmed that both cases arose from a near-haploid cell; all informative disomic chromosomes tested had loss of heterozygosity. Furthermore, the hyperdiploid karyotypes did not arise via a perfect haploid cell with exactly 23 chromosomes, because tetrasomic chromosomes remained heterozygous. These two patients probably are classified best as near-haploid cases, which often are observed to have a co-existing hyperdiploid clone with a duplicated chromosome set. The distinction between typical hyperdiploidy and hyperdiploidy arising via a near-haploid cell may be clinically important, because the prognosis for patients with a hyperdiploid karyotype is favorable in comparison to that of patients with a near-haploid karyotype.","['Onodera, N', 'McCabe, N R', 'Nachman, J B', 'Johnson, F L', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Rowley, J D', 'Rubin, C M']","['Onodera N', 'McCabe NR', 'Nachman JB', 'Johnson FL', 'Le Beau MM', 'Rowley JD', 'Rubin CM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637.']",['eng'],['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', '*Ploidies', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.2870040410 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1992 Jun;4(4):331-6. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870040410.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleotide sequence and methylation pattern in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and T-lymphoblast Molt-4 cells.,13558-63,"The complete nucleotide sequence of the 16.7-kb human gene that encodes the peptide core (serglycin) of a secretory granule proteoglycan was determined, thus representing the first proteoglycan peptide core gene to be sequenced in its entirety. The exons, intron 1, and intron 2 comprised 7, 53, and 40% of the gene, respectively. Nineteen Alu-repetitive DNA sequences were interspersed in the gene, accounting for 28% of the total nucleotides in intron 1 and 40% of the nucleotides in intron 2. The nucleotide sequence was then used in an examination of the methylation pattern of the human serglycin gene in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells that contain serglycin mRNA and in T-lymphoblast Molt-4 cells that do not. With polymerase chain reaction methodology, 13 DNA probes of 250-880 base pairs in length were generated that corresponded to unique, non-Alu sequences spaced throughout the entire human serglycin gene. When blots containing genomic DNA digested with HpaII or MspI were examined with these genomic probes, it was discovered that the 5'-flanking region and intron 1 of the serglycin gene in HL-60 cells were both substantially less methylated than intron 2. In contrast, the entire serglycin gene in Molt-4 cells was highly methylated. Because hypomethylated genes generally are transcribed more efficiently than hypermethylated genes, the high level of serglycin mRNA in HL-60 cells probably is a consequence of the low level of methylation of intron 1 and the 5'-flanking region of the serglycin gene in these cells.","['Humphries, D E', 'Nicodemus, C F', 'Schiller, V', 'Stevens, R L']","['Humphries DE', 'Nicodemus CF', 'Schiller V', 'Stevens RL']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['AI-23483/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-36110/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05950/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'DNA', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteoglycans/*genetics', 'RNA/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins']",1992/07/05 00:00,1992/07/05 00:01,['1992/07/05 00:00'],"['1992/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42248-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Jul 5;267(19):13558-63.,"['0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '0 (serglycin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M63383', 'GENBANK/M86615', 'GENBANK/M86616', 'GENBANK/M86617', 'GENBANK/M86618', 'GENBANK/M86619', 'GENBANK/M86620', 'GENBANK/M90058', 'GENBANK/M90360', 'GENBANK/X62322']",,,,

The aim of this study was to characterize the basophil PG-binding sites by means of radioreceptor assays using 3H-labeled PGs. Scatchard analysis for pure (greater than 95%) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) basophils revealed two classes of PGE1-binding sites differing in their affinity for the natural ligand (Bmax1 = 217 +/- 65 fmol/10(8) cells; Kd1 = 0.5 +/- 0.2 nM; Bmax2 = 2462 +/- 381 fmol/10(8) cells; Kd2 = 47 +/- 20 nM; IC50 = PGE1 less than PGI2 less than PGD2 less than PGE2 less than PGF2 alpha) as well as two classes of PGI2 (iloprost)-binding sites (Bmax1 = 324 +/- 145 fmol/10(8) cells; Kd1 = 0.5 +/- 0.3 nM; Bmax2 = 2541 +/- 381; Kd2 = 27 +/- 6 nM; IC50 = PGI2 less than PGE1 less than PGD2 less than PGE2 less than PGF2 alpha. In addition, CML basophils exhibited a single class of PGD2-binding sites (Bmax = 378 +/- 98 fmol/10(8) cells; Kd = 13 +/- 4 nM; IC50: PGD2 less than PGI2 less than PGE1 less than PGE2 less than PGF2 alpha). In contrast, we were unable to detect specific saturable PGE2-binding sites. Primary and immortalized (KU812) CML basophils revealed an identical pattern of PG receptor expression. Basophils (KU812) expressed significantly (p less than 0.001) lower number of PGE1 (PGI2)-binding sites (Bmax1: 9% (20%) of control; Bmax2: 36% (50%) of control) when cultured with recombinant interleukin 3 (rhIL-3), a basophil-activating cytokine, whereas rhIL-2 had no effect on PG receptor expression. Functional significance of binding of PGs to basophils was provided by the demonstration of a dose-dependent increase in cellular cAMP upon agonist activation, with PGE1 (ED50 = 1.7 +/- 1.1 nM) and PGI2 (ED50 = 2.8 +/- 2.3 nM) being the most potent compounds. These findings suggest that human basophils express specific receptors for PGE1, PGI2 as well as for PGD2.","['Virgolini, I', 'Li, S', 'Sillaber, C', 'Majdic, O', 'Sinzinger, H', 'Lechner, K', 'Bettelheim, P', 'Valent, P']","['Virgolini I', 'Li S', 'Sillaber C', 'Majdic O', 'Sinzinger H', 'Lechner K', 'Bettelheim P', 'Valent P']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Alprostadil/metabolism', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Epoprostenol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iloprost/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Interleukins/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Prostaglandin D2/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins/*metabolism', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Receptors, Epoprostenol', '*Receptors, Immunologic', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E']",1992/06/25 00:00,1992/06/25 00:01,['1992/06/25 00:00'],"['1992/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42333-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Jun 25;267(18):12700-8.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Receptors, Epoprostenol)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin E)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'JED5K35YGL (Iloprost)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'XZF106QU24 (prostaglandin D2 receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ara-C-triphosphate was not a substrate for CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity under the conditions employed, whereas CTP and dCTP were utilized to form CDP-choline and dCDP-choline, respectively. When presented together, ara-C-triphosphate and CTP inhibited the enzymatic conversion of CTP to CDP-choline in the presence of phosphocholine, with a Ki of 6 mM. Since CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase did not appear to be responsible for the increased levels of ara-CDP-choline, we next studied the other enzyme in the pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis that could form ara-CDP-choline, CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase. CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase activity present in microsomes isolated from L5178Y murine leukemia cells exhibited a reversal of its normal catalytic activity, using CMP and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-monophosphate (ara-CMP) along with phosphatidylcholine to produce either CDP-choline or ara-CDP-choline, plus diradylglycerol. The Vmax and Km values for CMP were 0.78 +/- 0.04 nmol/min/mg and 340 +/- 20 microM, respectively, whereas the Vmax and Km for ara-CMP were 0.22 +/- 0.06 nmol/min/mg and 1410 +/- 540 microM, respectively. A Ki value of 3 mM was obtained for ara-CMP under the cell-free assay conditions used. These results indicate that ara-CDP-choline most likely arises from a reversal of the CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase utilizing ara-CMP, rather than from the catalysis of ara-C-triphosphate plus phosphocholine to ara-CDP-choline by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase. It is speculated that this mechanism may explain, in part, the rapid cellular lysis observed with high dose ara-C therapy.","['Kucera, G L', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Kucera GL', 'Capizzi RL']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157.']",['eng'],['CA 12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Cytidine Diphosphate Choline/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Diacylglycerol Cholinephosphotransferase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178/metabolism', 'Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1992/07/15 00:00,1992/07/15 00:01,['1992/07/15 00:00'],"['1992/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Jul 15;52(14):3886-91.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '3714-60-1 (ara-ATP)', '536BQ2JVC7 (Cytidine Diphosphate Choline)', '67463-73-4 (1 beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine diphosphate choline)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.15 (Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.8.2 (Diacylglycerol Cholinephosphotransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFN induction was identified at oral doses as low as 3 mg/kg. The 10% lethal dose for daily treatment with imiquimod was 200 mg/kg. Oral treatment with 30 mg/kg imiquimod once every three days significantly inhibited MC-26 colon carcinoma. Delay of treatment from day 1 to day 5, when tumors were easily palpable, did not reduce benefits. Ten daily treatments were slightly more effective than five. However, delivery of the same total dose of imiquimod either once every day for 20 days, once every 4 days, once every 7 days, or once every 10 days inhibited tumor growth to the same level. The antitumor effects of imiquimod were significantly abrogated by an antiserum to murine IFN-alpha, suggesting that the antitumor effect was to a substantial extent mediated by IFN induction. Imiquimod also significantly reduced the number of lung colonies in mice inoculated i.v. with MC-26 tumor cells. Combination of treatment with imiquimod and cyclophosphamide was significantly (P less than 0.01) better than treatment with either drug alone. Combination treatment with cyclophosphamide led to cures in some of the mice inoculated either s.c. or i.v. with MC-26 cells. Treatment with imiquimod also inhibited the growth of RIF-1 sarcoma and Lewis lung carcinoma but was ineffective for P388 leukemia.

In vivo studies for chromosome breaking activity gave clearly negative, equivocal or weakly positive results. In particular two reports have indicated that human volunteers taking a maximum daily dose of paracetamol (3 x 1000 mg over 8 h) exhibited significantly elevated frequencies of chromatid breaks in their peripheral lymphocytes 24 h later. In the one study evaluating the time course, levels returned to normal between 3 and 7 days later.

Simultaneous exposure of cells to both agents was required for maximum efficacy of the combination. Novobiocin also produced supra-additive toxicity to A549 human lung carcinoma cells when combined with VM-26 or VP-16. At concentrations above the peak plasma levels achievable in patients, novobiocin lost its potentiating activity. Exposure of WEHI-3B D+ cells to novobiocin did not modify the cytotoxicity produced by the topoisomerase II inhibitor m-AMSA, whereas, in contrast, novobiocin antagonized the cytotoxicity of m-AMSA in A549 cells. Although it has been suggested that inhibitors of the syntheses of DNA and RNA interfere with the cytotoxic activity of the epipodophyllotoxins, maximum potentiation of the cytotoxicities of VP-16 and VM-26 occurred at novobiocin concentrations that decreased the rates of synthesis of both DNA and RNA in WEHI-3B D+ cells by about 50%. The number of DNA-topoisomerase-II covalent complexes stabilized by VM-26 in WEHI-3B D+ cells was greatly increased when cells were exposed simultaneously to VM-26 and novobiocin for 1 hr, but not when cells were treated with m-AMSA and novobiocin for the same period of time. Novobiocin did not affect the amount of covalent complexes produced by VM-26 in isolated nuclei, suggesting that the potentiating activity of novobiocin was not due to its direct interaction with the nuclear topoisomerase II enzyme. Our findings suggest that therapeutic levels of novobiocin may be capable of enhancing the clinical activities of VP-16 and VM-26.","['Rappa, G', 'Lorico, A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Rappa G', 'Lorico A', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Novobiocin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Teniposide/*administration & dosage', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/07/09 00:00,1992/07/09 00:01,['1992/07/09 00:00'],"['1992/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910510519 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1992 Jul 9;51(5):780-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910510519.,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease occurred predominantly in young and middle-aged men (mean age, 40 years) who often presented with swinging fever, skin rash, and/or hepatosplenomegaly, usually in the absence of peripheral lymphadenopathy. There was frequent involvement of the skin and mucosal sites, such as the salivary gland, lungs, and small intestine. The disease pursued a highly aggressive course, with most patients dying within weeks despite cytotoxic therapy. Although the cytologic appearances and immunophenotypic profile varied from case to case, the group of tumors could be unified by two morphologic features, namely, the presence of azurophilic granules in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells and the frequent occurrence of angiocentric and angiodestructive infiltrates.

A review of its pharmacological properties and prospective role in the management of myelosuppression.,516-60,"Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) is a polypeptide hormone produced through recombinant DNA technologies in glycosylated (yeast or mammalian expression systems) or nonglycosylated (Escherichia coli expression system) form. It is a multilineage haematopoietin which stimulates proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow myeloid progenitors and increases peripheral white blood cell counts when administered systemically. Treatment is generally well tolerated, although mild to moderate flu-like symptoms are common and rGM-CSF-induced fever and fluid retention may be problematic in occasional patients. rGM-CSF accelerates recovery of peripheral neutrophil counts after bone marrow transplantation, and results of a placebo-controlled randomised trial correlate this with reduced infectious episodes and shortened length of hospitalisation in patients with lymphoid malignancies. A substantial number of patients with graft failure after bone marrow transplantation also respond to rGM-CSF. The duration of myelosuppression secondary to cancer chemotherapy can be significantly reduced by rGM-CSF which has permitted investigation of antineoplastic dose-intensity escalation. In some haematopoietic disorders (e.g. aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia and neutropenia secondary to HIV infection and antiviral therapy), rGM-CSF produces clinically useful increases in peripheral blood granulocyte counts, although the effect is generally not sustained after drug withdrawal. The potential for rGM-CSF to stimulate proliferation of the abnormal clone in myelodysplasia and in acute myelogenous leukaemia following induction therapy is of concern. Available data suggest, however, that with appropriate monitoring and exclusion of high-risk patients this serious potential risk can be avoided, and that myelopoiesis is enhanced in such patients by rGM-CSF treatment. Recombinant colony-stimulating factors are a new therapeutic modality; hence many aspects of their use remain to be clarified. Nonetheless, as one of a small group of novel agents rGM-CSF has major potential in the management of myelosuppression secondary to cytoreductive therapy with or without bone marrow transplantation, and in amelioration of disturbed myelopoiesis. It represents an important application of biotechnology to a difficult area of therapeutics.","['Grant, S M', 'Heel, R C']","['Grant SM', 'Heel RC']","['Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/drug therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199243040-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1992 Apr;43(4):516-60. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199243040-00008.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,325,,,,,,,,,,,

SCF receptors (c-kit receptors) were quantitated by equilibrium binding studies with 125I-SCF, and binding parameters were estimated using the ligand program. The cellular distribution of c-kit receptors was determined by autoradiography. Our results show that SCF alone or in combination with IL-3 or GM-CSF increased both the number and size of colonies in 10 of the patients. Receptors for SCF were identified on the blasts from all 20 AML patients. The number of receptors ranged from 600 to 29,000 per cell. In the majority of patients, both high- and low-affinity binding sites were identified. Neither the number of receptors per cell nor the finding of one or two classes of receptors correlated with growth response to SCF. Autoradiographic analysis of 125I-SCF binding to normal marrow mononuclear cells revealed grains associated with blasts and megakaryocytes. Grain counts on blasts from 10 AML patients and on normal marrow blasts suggested that high-affinity c-kit receptor expression on AML blasts is lower than or similar to that of normal blasts. These results identify c-kit receptors on human AML blasts, and indicate that SCF acts synergistically with IL-3 or GM-CSF to stimulate colony growth from the marrow cells of a portion of patients with AML.","['Broudy, V C', 'Smith, F O', 'Lin, N', 'Zsebo, K M', 'Egrie, J', 'Bernstein, I D']","['Broudy VC', 'Smith FO', 'Lin N', 'Zsebo KM', 'Egrie J', 'Bernstein ID']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['CA39492/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK31232/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Autoradiography', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70655-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jul 1;80(1):60-7.,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When UT-7 cells were exposed to Epo, tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (with molecular weight equivalent to that of p85, p110, and p145) was observed. Protein phosphorylation occurred in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. p85 showed a marked increase in phosphotyrosine content within 30 seconds; maximal phosphorylation was observed at 1 minute. Subsequently, tyrosine phosphorylation of p110 and p145 was observed, beginning at 1 minute and reaching plateau at 5 minutes. The degree of phosphorylation of these three proteins gradually decreased thereafter. In addition, in UT-7/Epo cells, Epo induced tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins that were not observed in Epo-induced UT-7 cells. The concentration of Epo required to induce tyrosine phosphorylation was in the same range of concentration required to stimulate cell growth. Epo was also able to activate p21ras as measured by exchange of guanosine diphosphate for guanosine triphosphate.

One hundred fifty-nine CLL patients with either advanced Rai stage III or IV (81 patients) or progressive Rai stage 0 to II (78 patients) were treated with fludarabine (30 mg/m2/d intravenously every day for 5 days) plus prednisone (30 mg/m2/d orally daily for 5 days). Thirty-six patients were previously untreated. The response rates were 12% complete response (CR), 30% nodular complete response (nCR), and 18% partial response (PR). In all patients who achieved a complete response (both CR and nCR) less than 30% of nucleated cells were lymphocytes on marrow aspirate differential analysis; however, nCR patients had residual nodular and/or interstitial lymphocyte involvement on marrow biopsy examination. There was no evidence of leukemic infiltration on marrow biopsy examination in CR patients. With a median follow-up of 35 months, comparison of time to progression in the CR and nCR groups at 2 years showed a projected 87% versus 55% progression-free survival (P less than .03). Residual disease assessment by flow cytometry using simultaneous dual-color staining on blood and marrow lymphocytes was also performed on each patient. Residual disease was determined by the expression of CD5 on B lymphocytes and the monoclonality of surface light-chain expression. After six courses of fludarabine plus prednisone, no residual disease was detected by flow cytometry in 89% of the CRs, 51% of the nCRs, and 19% of the PRs. Clinical residual disease in PR patients with no residual disease detectable by flow cytometry was limited to lymph-adenopathy. Time to progression at 2 years was longer in CR and nCR patients having no residual disease detected by flow cytometry (84% v 39% 2-year progression-free survival, P less than .001).

Recently, molecular analyses of a number of these translocations revealed simple reciprocal translocations between the T-cell receptor delta chain gene (TCRD) and a region of 10q24. We have characterized, at the molecular level, a t(10;14)(q24;q11) in a patient with T-ALL. The translocation in this case, in contrast to the previous cases, is part of a complex genetic rearrangement. In addition to a reciprocal translocation between the D delta 3 gene segment of TCRD and a region of 10q24, a local inversion occurred within TCRD, involving the D delta 2 and V delta 2 gene segments. As a consequence, the entire joining and constant regions and most of the diversity regions of TCRD are located on the derivative 14 chromosome, whereas the joining and constant regions of TCRA are positioned on the derivative 10 chromosome. The chromosome 10 breakpoint in our patient, as in other t(10;14), clusters within a 9 kb breakpoint region. The occurrence of seven breakpoints within a localized region of chromosome 10 implies the existence of a nearby gene whose activation may have conferred a selective advantage on the leukemia cells. Moreover, as in the previous cases, the translocation in the present study exhibits recombination signal sequences or signal-like sequences adjacent to the breakpoint junction. The presence of such motifs suggests the involvement of the recombinase enzyme system in the generation of this genetic alteration.","['Park, J K', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Shows, T B', 'Rowley, J D', 'Diaz, M O']","['Park JK', 'Le Beau MM', 'Shows TB', 'Rowley JD', 'Diaz MO']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637.']",['eng'],"['CA 38725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*ultrastructure', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.2870040105 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1992 Jan;4(1):32-40. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870040105.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",,"['FOS', 'IGK', 'RBTN1', 'TAL1', 'TCRA', 'TCRD']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, preliminary studies using a sequential combination of MTX, LV, and 5-FU showed no additional potentiation. PURPOSE: We hypothesized that the lack of additional cell kill with this combination could be due to competition of LV with MTX for cellular uptake and reduced folate polyglutamylation. We have tested this possibility by comparing the cytotoxicity of drug combinations containing MTX with that of drug combinations containing trimetrexate (TMTX), an antifolate that does not compete with LV for uptake or polyglutamylation. METHODS: Human lymphocytic leukemia CCRF-CEM cells were exposed to MTX or TMTX for 24 hours and to 5-FU during the last 4 hours of antifolate exposure. LV was administered 30 minutes before 5-FU. RESULTS: After 20 hours of exposure to TMTX or MTX, intracellular levels of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate were elevated to a similar degree, and these levels did not decrease after a 30-minute exposure to LV. No additional cell kill was observed when LV was added to the MTX/5-FU combination, but cytotoxicity was enhanced when LV was added to the TMTX/5-FU combination. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesis that the lack of additional cell kill when high-dose LV is added to the MTX/5-FU combination may be due to competition of MTX with LV for cellular uptake and/or competition of MTX or its polyglutamates with polyglutamylation of reduced folates. Inasmuch as TMTX does not compete with LV and reduced folates for uptake and polyglutamylation, the synergy obtained with the combination of TMTX plus 5-FU and high-dose LV further supports this hypothesis.","['Romanini, A', 'Li, W W', 'Colofiore, J R', 'Bertino, J R']","['Romanini A', 'Li WW', 'Colofiore JR', 'Bertino JR']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate/metabolism', 'Trimetrexate/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/84.13.1033 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992 Jul 1;84(13):1033-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/84.13.1033.,"['7540-64-9 (Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human basophils exposed to HRA-N released 25% of total histamine but no leukotriene C4 (LTC4). To confirm this phenomenon, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells were exposed to HRA-N as well as anti-IgE, or calcium ionophore A23187. RBL cells incubated with A23187 released 44% of available serotonin and 59 and 124 pmol/10(6) cells of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and LTC4, respectively. Anti-IgE stimulation resulted in 34% serotonin release and the generation of 34 pmol PGD2 per 10(6) cells and 72 pmol LTC4 per 10(6) cells. In contrast, HRA-N (2 U/ml) induced 20% serotonin release, 4 pmol PGD2 per 10(6) cells, and 0.6 pmol LTC4 per 10(6) cells. Neither increasing the dose nor the incubation time of HRA-N enhanced the generation of AA metabolite. Additionally, the spectrum of AA metabolites generated by RBL cells in response to those agents was examined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. RBL cells stimulated with A23187 released PGD2, LTB4, and its isomers, LTC4, and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. In contrast, HRA-N stimulation resulted in only minimal PGD2 generation and no other discernable AA metabolites. Thus, HRA-N causes selective release of serotonin without inducing AA metabolites.

These results suggested that bovine lymphoblastoid B-cell lines might release and respond to the growth-promoting factor for in vitro proliferation of its own cell line, BL2M3.","['Yang, M P', 'Goitsuka, R', 'Tsujimoto, H', 'Hasegawa, A']","['Yang MP', 'Goitsuka R', 'Tsujimoto H', 'Hasegawa A']","['Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1292/jvms.54.255 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 1992 Apr;54(2):255-9. doi: 10.1292/jvms.54.255.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NSW Therapeutic Assessment Group.,869-72,"OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical information on the use of alpha, beta and gamma interferons and to classify the use of alpha interferons in Australia according to approved indications, indications for which there is good supporting evidence and indications where therapy is under investigation; and to estimate the cost of therapy with alpha interferons in New South Wales in 1991. DATA SOURCES: Data were obtained from computerised literature searches. DATA EXTRACTION: A position paper was drafted on behalf of the NSW Therapeutic Assessment Group (NSWTAG). This was circulated to clinicians identified as having a particular interest in the use of the interferons in major NSW teaching hospitals, for comment and amendment where necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Two forms of alpha interferon, interferon alfa-2b and interferon alfa-2a have been approved for use in Australia, interferon alfa-2b for use in the management of hairy cell leukaemia and condylomata acuminata and interferon alfa-2a for use in the management of hairy cell leukaemia and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related Kaposi's sarcoma. Applications have been lodged for the use of interferon alfa-2b in HIV related Kaposi's sarcoma, cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and hepatitis B and C and for the use of interferon alfa-2a in the management of hepatitis B, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and metastatic renal cancer. Interferon alfa-n1 is not available in Australia except for use in a clinical trial in patients who are HIV seropositive. The use of the alpha interferons is currently under investigation in a wide variety of other diseases, with the likelihood that other indications will soon be established. However, the alpha interferons are generally not regarded as first line agents. Beta and gamma interferons have been studied less intensively than the alpha interferons, but it is likely that selected applications for their use will also be defined with the passage of time.","['Stuart-Harris, R C', 'Lauchlan, R', 'Day, R']","['Stuart-Harris RC', 'Lauchlan R', 'Day R']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Palliative Care, Westmead Hospital, NSW.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,IM,"['Australia', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Condylomata Acuminata/therapy', 'Drug Costs', 'Hepatitis B/therapy', 'Hepatitis C/therapy', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-beta/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/therapeutic use', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/therapy', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/therapy']",1992/06/15 00:00,1992/06/15 00:01,['1992/06/15 00:00'],"['1992/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med J Aust. 1992 Jun 15;156(12):869-72.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",['Med J Aust. 1992 Jun 15;156(12):821-2.

The virus particles encode a reverse transcriptase with a preference for magnesium, have a density of 1.16 g/ml in sucrose, and induce syncytia in permissive cell lines such as Himalayan tahr ovary and canine fetal thymus. CIV replicates to high titer and highly purified virus can readily be prepared. The ultrastructure and morphogenesis of CIV is strikingly similar to that displayed by other lentiviruses, while immunoblot analysis failed to demonstrate close immunological relatedness to any other lentivirus or oncovirus. These findings suggest that this canine virus, representing the first isolation of a canine retrovirus, belongs to the lentivirus subfamily but is not closely related to other known members.","['Perk, K', 'Safran, N', 'Dahlberg, J E']","['Perk K', 'Safran N', 'Dahlberg JE']","['Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Lentivirus/classification/enzymology/*growth & development/isolation & purification', 'Lentivirus Infections/transmission/*veterinary', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992;6 Suppl 3:155S-157S.,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, IL3 treatment did not alter the LAK cell-mediated killing of CD34+ hemopoietic progenitors present in normal bone marrow. Increased 3H-thymidine uptake was generally observed after IL3 treatment. However, failure to proliferate in response to IL3, observed in some cases, did not prevent changes in LAK susceptibility. Enhanced lysis of IL3-treated leukemic cells was accompanied by a moderate increase of the effector-target binding. Increased LAK susceptibility was already observed at 18 h, while optimal cytolysis and expression of the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) LFA-3 (CD58) by IL3-treated AML cells were concomitantly observed at later culture times. In contrast, the CAM ICAM-1 (CD54) was not modulated by IL3, nor were significant changes in the expression of either CAMs observed in normal hemopoietic cells. Blocking experiments with the anti-CD58 monoclonal antibody demonstrated a variable neutralizing effect on the IL3-induced increase of LAK activity, depending on the leukemia cell studied. The effect described here, together with the known role of IL3 in normal hemopoiesis makes it a factor of potential therapeutic value for the treatment of leukemic patients.","['Cesano, A', 'Lista, P', 'Bellone, G', 'Geuna, M', 'Brizzi, M F', 'Rossi, P R', 'Pegoraro, L', 'Oberholtzer, E', 'Matera, L']","['Cesano A', 'Lista P', 'Bellone G', 'Geuna M', 'Brizzi MF', 'Rossi PR', 'Pegoraro L', 'Oberholtzer E', 'Matera L']","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD58 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism/pathology']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Jun;6(6):567-73.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously identified four groups of AML blasts based upon their growth characteristics in vitro, in particular the degree of autonomous growth. We have now measured the production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) by AML cells with different growth characteristics, using two sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Our results show a correlation between the capacity of AML blasts to produce GM-CSF and IL-1 beta and the ability to grow autonomously in vitro. Blasts from cells with no autonomous growth (n = 5) secreted low or undetectable amounts of GM-CSF and IL-1 beta. Blasts with totally autonomous growth (n = 10) secreted the highest levels of GM-CSF (mean 2469 pg/10(3) cells) and IL-1 beta (mean 3156 pg/10(6) cells). Whereas blasts with partially autonomous growth (n = 9) secreted intermediate levels of GM-CSF (mean 270 pg/10(6) cells) and IL-1 beta (mean 931 pg/10(6) cells). In order to determine whether GM-CSF production was autocrine or the consequence of paracrine secretion by differentiated leukemic cells, we studied the degree of autonomous growth and production of GM-CSF by CD34-positive blasts from eight patients whose unfractionated cells produced GM-CSF. We found that CD34-positive blasts from six of these cases grew autonomously to a degree comparable to that of the unfractionated cells, and that CD34-positive blasts produced GM-CSF either autonomously or in response to recombinant IL-1 beta. Our data suggests that in the majority of cases, CD34-positive blasts are capable of autonomous growth and autocrine GM-CSF production, however this is variably regulated by the paracrine production of IL-1 beta by CD34-negative cells.","['Bradbury, D', 'Rogers, S', 'Reilly, I A', 'Kozlowski, R', 'Russell, N H']","['Bradbury D', 'Rogers S', 'Reilly IA', 'Kozlowski R', 'Russell NH']","['University Department of Haematology, City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Interleukin-1beta', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Jun;6(6):562-6.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '106021-96-9 (interleukin-1beta (163-171))', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of interferon therapy on loss of Ph+ clonogenic cells in LTMC was also investigated. Of 16 patients who had not previously received interferon, complete loss of Ph+ progenitors was documented by 4-5 weeks in the LTMCs from two (12.5%). Ph+ progenitors persisted at 4-5 weeks in the LTMC derived from 12 patients. Marrows from nine patients treated with interferon were also established in LTMC. Cultures from four patients did not yield colonies with detectable metaphases at 3-5 weeks, while Ph+ clones were present in the cultures initiated with marrows from five patients. Mean hematopoietic colony yields from the adherent layer at 2-4 weeks, and from the supernatant layer at 1-3 weeks, of cultures derived from interferon-treated patients were significantly lower than in LTMCs of patients not treated with interferon (p less than 0.05).

Furthermore, 4C9 reactivity is enriched in the synovial fluid of three of five RA patients compared with serum, suggesting that 4C9-reactive IgM RF are synthesized within the joint.

B-CLL is a type of leukemia most often occurring among close relatives and is partly associated with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a finding relevant to autoimmune disease. We established MHC (H-2)-congenic NZB x NZW (NZB/W) F1 mice (H-2d/z, H-2z/z, and H-2d/d), in that only H-2d/z heterozygotes developed severe SLE, associated with IgG anti-DNA antibodies, as the animals aged. Such age-associated changes occurred in parallel with the decrease in the splenic, but not peritoneal, CD5+ B cells. By contrast, H-2z/z homozygotes did not develop SLE but, in turn, a marked clonal proliferation of CD5+ B cells resembling B-CLL did occur. H-2d/d homozygotes also did not develop the typical SLE, and a moderate CD5+ B frequency persisted. Despite the finding that all the three H-2-congenic NZB/W F1 strains produced IgM anti-DNA antibodies, only the H-2d/z heterozygotes produced IgG antibodies. Whereas the surface phenotype of major IgM producers was CD5+ sIgM+, that of IgG producers was CD5-sIgM-. Genetic and cellular analyses supported our thesis that in the heterozygotes IgM to IgG isotype switching probably emerges in CD5+ B cells and that this event is associated with the loss of CD5 molecules. Because of the lack of genetic elements required for differentiation, only signals for proliferation would be functioning in CD5+ B cells in the H-2z/z homozygotes. These observations infer that certain different, but related, MHC haplotypes may predispose either to B-CLL or to autoimmune disease in close relatives.","['Shirai, T', 'Okada, T', 'Hirose, S']","['Shirai T', 'Okada T', 'Hirose S']","['Department of Pathology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Autoantibodies/biosynthesis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1992/05/04 00:00,1992/05/04 00:01,['1992/05/04 00:00'],"['1992/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1992.tb24658.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1992 May 4;651:509-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1992.tb24658.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)']",,,81,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotypic and clinicopathologic data, however, are required to distinguish subtypes that apparently have a different cytogenesis than that of conventional CLL or SLL. In addition to expressing CD5, neoplastic cells of the latter are also distinctive in that they frequently coexpress surface immunoglobulin (Ig), bearing one or more cross-reactive idiotypes (CRIs) (e.g. 17.109, G6,) that commonly are found on monoclonal IgM autoantibodies. The frequent occurrence of such CRIs reflects both the biased rearrangement and subsequent selected expression of Ig V genes with little or no somatic mutation. IgM/L CLL, for example, frequently (8/33) harbor abortive Ig rearrangements involving Humkv325, the VK gene encoding the 17.109-CRI. Also, the VH1 gene(s) encoding the G6 CRI accounts for over 10% of all VH genes and over 60% of all the VH1 genes used in randomly selected common CLL/SLL. Furthermore, comparison with the Ig expressed by nonmalignant G6 CRI+ B cells reveals an apparent restriction in the CDR3 of IgH expressed by G6 CRI+ CLL. Coupled with the observed potential bias in antibody light chain and heavy chain pairing in B-CLL, these data suggest that the autoantibodies expressed in this disease are selected based on antigen-binding activity. Collectively, our studies indicate that nonstochastic Ig V gene rearrangement and subsequent selection may influence the Ig repertoire expressed in this common B-cell malignancy.","['Kipps, T J', 'Rassenti, L Z', 'Duffy, S', 'Johnson, T', 'Kobayashi, R', 'Carson, D A']","['Kipps TJ', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Duffy S', 'Johnson T', 'Kobayashi R', 'Carson DA']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0945.']",['eng'],"['AG04100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR07144/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mutation']",1992/05/04 00:00,1992/05/04 00:01,['1992/05/04 00:00'],"['1992/05/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/04 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1992.tb24638.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1992 May 4;651:373-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1992.tb24638.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,,93,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of 10 mM L-cysteine significantly increased LTC4 release compared with that in its absence (about 1.7 times, in terms of mean value). E6080 inhibited antigen-stimulated LTB4 and LTC4 release from passively sensitized human (IC50: LTB4 0.08 microM, LTC4 0.2 microM) and guinea-pig lung fragments (IC50: LTC4 1.1 microM). The LTB4 and LTC4 releases from healthy human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (calcium ionophore A23187) and from allergic patients' leukocytes (basophils, antigen) were inhibited by E6080 with IC50 values of below 1.0 microM. Furthermore, the LTC4 release from rat alveolar macrophages (silica particles) was inhibited by E6080 with an IC50 of 0.2 microM. The potent inhibition by E6080 might be a result of the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, since 5-lipoxygenase in rat basophilic leukemia cell was inhibited by E6080 with an IC50 of 0.2 microM.

Autografts were depleted of CD19+ B-cell precursors by an immunochemopurging protocol that combines B43-PAP, a potent anti-CD19 immunotoxin, and the cyclophosphamide congener 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC). A marked interpatient variation was observed in the appearance and expansion of B-cell precursors repopulating the posttransplant marrow. The expression of CD10 and CD19 antigens during early B-cell ontogeny post-BMT preceded the expression of CD20, CD21, CD22, CD40, and sIgM. The surface antigen profiles of the emerging B-cell precursors were similar to those of fetal liver or fetal bone marrow B-cell precursors. Our comparisons of BM and PBL samples from patients in the early post-BMT period demonstrated that (1) PBL initially contains fewer B-lineage cells than does BM, and (2) circulating B-lineage lymphoid cells have a more mature immunophenotype than do BM B-lineage lymphoid cells. Comparison of the surface antigen profiles of day 30 versus day 100 or year 1 BM or PBL lymphoid cells showed an increase in the percentages of CD10+CD22- undifferentiated lymphocyte precursors, as well as CD19+sIgM- B-cell precursors (pre-pre-B), consistent with a time-dependent expansion of these B-cell precursor populations post-BMT. Importantly, the percentages of CD10+CD22+ and CD19+sIgM+ B-cell precursor (pre-B) populations also increased between 30 days and 1 year post-BMT, confirming the ability of emerging immature B-cell precursors to differentiate along the B-precursor pathway. The acquisition and expression of B-lineage differentiation antigens at different stages of the post-BMT B-cell ontogeny support the notion that the expression of these antigens is developmentally programmed. Similar to patients in previous autologous BMT studies, recipients of B-cell precursor-depleted autografts had normal or nearly normal serum immunoglobulin levels, suggesting that the maturing B-cell/plasma cell populations can produce and secrete immunoglobulins. The development of a functional CD19+ B-lineage lymphoid compartment in recipients of autografts which were depleted of CD19+ B-cell precursors corroborates the previously postulated existence of CD19- B-lineage lymphoid progenitor cells.","['Uckun, F M', 'Haissig, S', 'Ledbetter, J A', 'Fidler, P', 'Myers, D E', 'Kuebelbeck, V', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Gajl-Peczalska, K', 'Kersey, J H', 'Ramsay, N K']","['Uckun FM', 'Haissig S', 'Ledbetter JA', 'Fidler P', 'Myers DE', 'Kuebelbeck V', 'Weisdorf D', 'Gajl-Peczalska K', 'Kersey JH', 'Ramsay NK']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-44114/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-51425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/embryology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/blood', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotoxins', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Plant Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1992/06/15 00:00,1992/06/15 00:01,['1992/06/15 00:00'],"['1992/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71199-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jun 15;79(12):3369-79.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (pokeweed antiviral protein)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The small cells were reported to be small lymphocytic or small cleaved lymphoma cells. We have detected, by kappa-lambda imaging (KLI) with delta-curves, using a flow cytometer, small lymphoma cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of 41 untreated patients with various B-cell lymphomas expressing surface Ig (sIg+BCL), and evaluated their clinical and prognostic significance. Small cells were found in approximately 90% (37 of 41) of sIg+BCL patients when either PB or BM was analyzed and, overall, the presence of small cells correlated well with the disease activity. However, in some patients, a few cells remained in the PB (16%) or BM (27%) even when they were in remission, whereas in others, the cells were presented in the PB or BM several months before relapse. These results suggest that the detection of small cells in PB or BM by KLI may be helpful for screening and monitoring patients with sIg+BCL. When the patients were subdivided into three groups (normal, low, and high amplitude), according to the abnormal grade criteria of the delta-curves, which were based on the results of both PB-KLI and BM-KLI, the survival of the high-amplitude group tended to be shorter than that of the normal group (P = .068), which was particularly marked when the follow-up period exceeded 2 years. Moreover, as the group grading worsened (normal less than low less than high), the complete response rates deteriorated (100%, 71%, and 60%, respectively) and the respective relapse rates after complete remission increased (17%, 40%, and 67%). Thus, the determination of the proportion of small lymphoma cells in PB and BM by KLI may be useful for predicting the prognoses of patients with sIg+BCL.","['Nakano, M', 'Kawanishi, Y', 'Kuge, S', 'Kuriyama, Y', 'Kuwabara, S', 'Yaguchi, M', 'Toyama, K']","['Nakano M', 'Kawanishi Y', 'Kuge S', 'Kuriyama Y', 'Kuwabara S', 'Yaguchi M', 'Toyama K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1992/06/15 00:00,1992/06/15 00:01,['1992/06/15 00:00'],"['1992/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71183-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jun 15;79(12):3253-60.,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CHOP protocol', 'MACOP-B protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B43-PAP plus CPA was superior to either the immunotoxin or drug alone, and combined immunochemotherapy markedly improved the event-free survival (EFS) of SCID mice challenged with NALM-6-UM1 pre-B ALL cells.

The advantage was particularly evident in mice inoculated with 5 x 10(6) leukemia cells.

In 19 cases the PML-RAR-alpha isoform referred to here as long was identified. A short isoform, which in comparison with the long form lacks three PML exons, was detected in 11 other cases. A third PML-RAR-alpha mRNA isoform, in which the most 3' PML exon present in the long-type isoform was truncated in its sequences lying immediately upstream of RAR-alpha B region, was found and characterized in a single patient.

Genomic and PCR analysis showed that the different PML-RAR-alpha isoforms found in APL patients arise as a result of distinct translocation breakpoints. In each case the exons encoding the B-F regions of RAR-alpha are expressed and are spliced downstream from variable PML gene exons.

The majority of peripheral blood lymphocytes displayed a CD3-, CD8-, CD16+, CD56(NKH1)- phenotype. The patient's cells showed high spontaneous cytotoxic activity against K562 targets and developed the ability to kill the natural killer (NK)-resistant target Daudi following activation with interleukin 2 (IL-2). Simultaneously, IL-2 induced proliferation of these cells, albeit to a low level. The effects of IL-2 are likely to be mediated through the IL-2R beta chain (p70) which is expressed on these cells in the absence of the IL-2R alpha chain (p55, Tac). IL-4 was demonstrated to be inhibitory of both the cytotoxic and proliferative effects of IL-2. Thus, despite an unusual CD56- phenotype, the expanded lymphocyte population in this patient display functional and phenotypic properties of normal, non-activated NK cells. These cells probably represent the counterpart of a minor NK cell subpopulation, present in normal individuals at a low frequency, and which has never been fully characterized functionally. In addition, we show that the cytolytic activity of this NK cell population can be blocked in vitro in the presence of a cAMP analog or of theophylline, possibly providing new means of investigating the role of NK cell cytotoxicity on the pathogenesis of associated symptoms in such patients.","['Bayle, C', 'Vitte-Mony, I', 'Lang, P', 'Pico, J', 'Hercend, T', 'Bertoglio, J']","['Bayle C', 'Vitte-Mony I', 'Lang P', 'Pico J', 'Hercend T', 'Bertoglio J']","['Haematology Laboratory, Institute Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis/drug effects', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis/drug effects', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis/drug effects', 'CD3 Complex', 'CD56 Antigen', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'Receptors, Fc/*analysis/drug effects', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Theophylline/*pharmacology']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 May;6(5):470-6.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study effects of cryopreservation, we compared the cell phenotypes of adherent layers of fresh and frozen-thawed bone marrows. To characterize stromal cells we used monoclonal antibodies reacting with components of these cells (CGA-7 alpha SM and gamma SM actin isoforms; HHF-35, all muscle actin isoforms; BMS-1, stromal cell lysosomes). The other components studied were: fibronectin (BMS-2 monoclonal antibody) and hematopoietic cells (monoclonal antibodies against CD45, CD33, and CD14). Results show a decrease of cells positive for CGA-7, HHF-35, and BMS-1, in adherent layer of HLTBMC of frozen-thawed bone marrows. Expression of BMS-2 is unchanged, and CD45 and CD14-positive cells proportionately increased. These results are consistent with an impairment of stromal cell proliferation in frozen-thawed marrows, without impairment of most stromal cell functions.

Both cell lines produced substantial levels of IL-6 and steel factor (SLF) which is reportedly a stem-cell factor. Northern blot analysis revealed that SLF but neither c-kit nor interleukin 3 (IL-3) mRNA was detectable in these cell lines, although IL-3-like activity was found in the supernatant of MS-5 cell culture. These observations suggest that the hemopoietic-supportive function of stromal cells may reside in adherence of stem cells, and production of GM-CSF probably in combination with SLF.

Recently developed techniques to enzymatically disperse skin mast cells from human skin have shown that skin mast cells are somehow different from those of other organs such as lung and intestine. In this report, we have isolated and partially purified human skin mast cells from human neonatal foreskins by collagenase and hyaluronidase digestion. These mast cells are morphologically intact by histological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic criteria. These human skin mast cells secrete histamine significantly (max. net histamine release, 20-30%) in a dose-related, temperature- and time-dependent fashion following stimulation with purified human C5a and C3a (over the ranges of 5 x 10(-8) M to 10(-7) M and 3 x 10(-7) M to 6 x 10(-6) M, respectively). On the other hand, interactions between human skin mast cells and other leukocytes have long been suspected of playing a very important role in cutaneous inflammation. Recently, a human neutrophil-derived histamine-releasing activity termed HRA-N was partially purified. HRA-N has been shown to cause human and rat basophil leukemia cells to degranulate. This study was also undertaken to assess the ability of HRA-N to directly induce histamine release from isolated human skin mast cells. HRA-N causes dose- and time-dependent histamine release as do human anaphylatoxins. These results suggest that HRA-N may lead to a better comprehension of allergic and inflammatory reactions and their modulation in the skin.","['Kubota, Y']",['Kubota Y'],"['Department of Dermatology, Yamanashi Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,IM,"['Anaphylatoxins/*physiology', 'Cell Separation', '*Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Penis/cytology', 'Skin/metabolism/*ultrastructure']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1346-8138.1992.tb03174.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 1992 Jan;19(1):19-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1346-8138.1992.tb03174.x.,['0 (Anaphylatoxins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, human leukemic cells have proven difficult to establish in immunosuppressed mice except as solid tumors. We report here the establishment of a murine model for human leukemia displaying features of human disease, such as growth of malignant cells and localization of such cells to lymphoid compartments, and the effective depletion of leukemic cells from these mice by an immunoconjugate. Human T-leukemia cells (CEM) injected into cyclophosphamide-pretreated NIH-III mice engrafted in all mice (n = 41), with CEM cells detected in the bone marrow, spleen, and blood 4 weeks after injection. There was no evidence of solid tumors. Treatment of CEM-engrafted mice with 4A2-RTA30, an immunoconjugate of an anti-CD7 monoclonal antibody and ricin A chain (RTA30), resulted in a 100- to 200-fold overall depletion of CEM cells from the spleen and the bone marrow (P less than 0.02). This depletion was specific and toxin-dependent, as a control immunoconjugate had no demonstrable effect (P greater than 0.5). Depletion of CEM cells was also observed after treatment with unconjugated anti-CD7 mAb, but this effect was not significantly different from controls (P greater than 0.1). Therefore, significant depletion of CEM cells required the presence of the ricin A chain moiety. Further investigations revealed that CEM cells recovered from NIH-III mice expressed less CD7 antigen, but remained sensitive to subsequent in vitro exposure to 4A2-RTA30. In conclusion, we have established a model for studying the efficacy of immunoconjugates and have successfully depleted human T-leukemic cells from lymphoid tissues in immunodeficient mice by treatment with an anti-CD7-RTA30 immunoconjugate.","['Fishwild, D M', 'Aberle, S', 'Bernhard, S L', 'Kung, A H']","['Fishwild DM', 'Aberle S', 'Bernhard SL', 'Kung AH']","['Department of Immunology, XOMA Corporation, Berkeley, California 94710.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/methods', 'Ricin/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Jun 1;52(11):3056-62.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, CD34+ marrow leukocytes were isolated by immune adherence using immunomagnetic microspheres, and analyzed for coexpression of the following pairs of membrane antigens: CD34 CD22; CD34 CD20; and CD10 CD22. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase expression was not assessed. All three antigen combinations were found on small percentages of the CD34-enriched cell population. Second, unseparated normal low density marrow leukocytes were examined by 'gating' on cells with the right-angle light scatter of lymphoid cells, plus either CD34+ or CD10+ immunofluorescence. This independent approach confirmed that rare subsets of normal cells coexpress 'immature' and 'mature' differentiation antigens. In addition, remission marrow cells were examined from two children who had completed therapy for ALL two and four months earlier. Both specimens had a more than threefold increase in CD34+ cells over normal marrow, and cells coexpressing immature and mature cell surface antigens were easily detected.

The hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen, CD34, which is heavily glycosylated with both N- and O-linked glycans, is readily cleaved by this protease. In this study, we demonstrate that the epitopes detected by five of the seven CD34 monoclonal antibodies are removed by the glycoprotease. The differential sensitivity of the CD34 epitopes to cleavage with either neuraminidase and/or glycoprotease establishes three classes of epitopes: 1) (class I) those identified by MY10, B1.3C5, 12.8, and ICH3 that are differentially affected by neuraminidase and removed by the glycoprotease; 2) (class II) the epitope detected by QBEND 10 that is removed only by the glycoprotease; and 3) (class III) those identified by TUK3 and 115.2 that are not removed by either enzyme. Cleavage of the 110-kd CD34 structure by the glycoprotease generates a major cell-bound fragment of about 75 kd, identified by the class III antibodies. We have also used the enzyme to improve the rapid recovery of CD34+ cells selected by immunomagnetic affinity techniques. In a preclinical model, we separated CD34+ KG1 cells with high yield (90%-95%) and high purity (94%-98%) from sham mixtures containing 50% CD34- cells. We also separated CD34+ blast cells from a patient in megakaryoblastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. In this case, the purity and yield were 93% and 94%, respectively. Enzyme treatment had no detrimental effect on cell viability, and the treated cells showed a normal quantitative expression and distribution of CD34 antigen as assessed with class III antibodies. We conclude that the P. haemolytica glycoprotease has potential to improve the isolation, from human bone marrow, of primitive hematopoietic cells that carry the CD34 antigen.","['Sutherland, D R', 'Marsh, J C', 'Davidson, J', 'Baker, M A', 'Keating, A', 'Mellors, A']","['Sutherland DR', 'Marsh JC', 'Davidson J', 'Baker MA', 'Keating A', 'Mellors A']","['Oncology Research Laboratory, Toronto Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Blast Crisis/immunology', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Epitopes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Magnetics', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Vibrio cholerae/enzymology']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Jun;20(5):590-9.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Epitopes)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.57 (O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have compared the expression of bcl-2 transcripts and protein in B-CLL cells in their normal equivalent CD5+ B cells and in normal B-cell populations representative of different in vivo and in vitro stages of activation and proliferation. We report here that bcl-2 was expressed in 11 of 11 cases of CD5+ B-CLL clones, contrasting with the absent expression in normal CD5+ B cells. Activation of 173 and 183 B-CLL cells by phorbol esters (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate [TPA]) to IgM secretion without concomitant DNA synthesis resulted in a rapid but transient downregulation of bcl-2 expression. In contrast, the reduction of bcl-2 at both the messenger RNA and protein levels was sustained after mitogenic stimulation, suggesting that bcl-2 expression and proliferation are inversely related in these cells. This notion was further supported by immunocytochemical analysis showing that bcl-2 was primarily expressed in small resting lymphocytes and in cells differentiating to the plasma cell stage, but less expressed in Ki67-positive proliferating B blasts. Moreover, it was also supported by the low level of bcl-2 in exponentially growing Epstein-Barr virus-carrying lymphoblastoid and B-CLL cell lines. The regulation of bcl-2 expression in B-CLL resembled that of normal tonsillar follicular B cells, in which a high level of expression was found in resting mantle zone B cells but not in the proliferating germinal center B cells. Based on these findings and the role of bcl-2 in maintaining B-cell memory, we propose that the phenotype of B-CLL cells corresponds to a mantle zone memory-type B cell.","['Schena, M', 'Larsson, L G', 'Gottardi, D', 'Gaidano, G', 'Carlsson, M', 'Nilsson, K', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F']","['Schena M', 'Larsson LG', 'Gottardi D', 'Gaidano G', 'Carlsson M', 'Nilsson K', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cell Division', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71231-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jun 1;79(11):2981-9.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['bcl-2'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that the inhibition of HB24 expression in CD34+ bone marrow cells via antisense (AS) oligonucleotides impaired the proliferation of these cells in response to interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The treatment of CD34+ cells with HB24 AS oligonucleotides also reduced the levels of c-fos, c-myc, c-myb, cyclin B, and p34cdc2 messenger RNAs compared with cells treated with control oligonucleotides. Conversely, the transient transfection of HB24 into a subpopulation of CD34 cells inhibited their differentiation into mature hematopoietic cell types. In addition, HB24 messenger RNA transcripts were elevated in bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia compared with normal controls. These data suggest that HB24 is an important transcription factor during hematopoietic progenitor proliferation and that differentiation to specific cell types requires its downregulation.

The T-SCL subset showed a significantly higher median age, a more frequent incidence of extramedullary leukemia, a morphology L1 in most cases, and a poor response to treatment in terms of either complete remission rate or median survival duration. In addition, significant differences between the two groups were found in evaluating the number of days of blast disappearance from peripheral blood, of CR achievement, and of neutrophils and platelets recovery. We conclude that T-SCL represents a distinct clinical entity, characterized by a poor response to ALL conventional chemotherapy.

The NOR-related protein becomes visible in nucleus by a silver-staining technique under a light microscope, and it has been named argyrophilic protein of NOR (Ag-NOR). In various malignancies, the correlation between the proliferation potential of tumor cells or histological grade and the number of Ag-NORs has been reported. In this study, we investigated the Ag-NOR of acute leukemic cells and its relation to the in vivo proportion of bone marrow leukemic cells in DNA synthetic phase. The number of Ag-NORs in bone marrow leukemic cells was more than that in peripheral blood (means values 2.78 and 2.48, respectively, p less than 0.01). This result shows that the number of Ag-NORs reflects the vigorous proliferative potential of bone marrow leukemic cells. However, no significant correlation was obtained between the number of Ag-NORs and the bromodeoxyuridine-labeling indices (r = 0.2064). These results suggest that Ag-NOR might be one of the markers for cellular proliferation in leukemia, while DNA synthesis of leukemic cells do not seem to be directly related to Ag-NOR.

The present study of subcellular localization of this protein shows it to be a cytoplasmic component not associated with the plasma membrane. Most of the cellular p40 was found to be associated with polyribosomes as well as with 40S to 60S cytoplasmic particles. Conditions that lead to polysome disruption also caused release of the polysomal form of p40 as smaller particles, and polysome reconstitution was accompanied by uptake of p40 into these structures. Because of the large abundance of this protein in the cells (six to eight copies per ribosome), it is unlikely that it represents a factor that associates with the 40S preinitiation complex. The p40-containing particles appear to represent a newly discovered structure involved in the process of polysome formation.","['Auth, D', 'Brawerman, G']","['Auth D', 'Brawerman G']","['Department of Biochemistry, Tufts University Health Sciences Campus, Boston, MA 02111.']",['eng'],['GM 17973/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Polyribosomes/metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Laminin', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism', 'Sarcoma 180/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/15 00:00,1992/05/15 00:01,['1992/05/15 00:00'],"['1992/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.10.4368 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 May 15;89(10):4368-72. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.10.4368.,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)']",,,,PMC49083,,,,,,,,,,

An electrophysiologic analysis of the consequences of neuron/RBL cell contacts showed that neurite contact with RBL cells reduced the control input resistance (Ro) of 61.8 +/- 3.2 (n = 110) M omega to 22.4 +/- 4.8 (n = 13) M omega (P less than 0.01) without change in the membrane potential. Time course studies showed that Ro of RBL cells with neurite contact was always lower by 30 to 54% than adjacent RBL cells lacking such contact. This effect was not seen in RBL cells cultured on rat fibroblasts. Direct application of SP, bradykinin, and somatostatin, but not acetylcholine, noradrenaline, or the putative neurotransmitter ATP, could partly mimic the effect of neurite contact. Therefore, neurotransmitter release from sympathetic neurons in contact with RBL cells may decrease RBL cell membrane resistance, possibly leading to activation.","['Blennerhassett, M G', 'Janiszewski, J', 'Bienenstock, J']","['Blennerhassett MG', 'Janiszewski J', 'Bienenstock J']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University Health Sciences Centre, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Electric Conductivity', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mice', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substance P/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/*physiology']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1165/ajrcmb/6.5.504 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 1992 May;6(5):504-9. doi: 10.1165/ajrcmb/6.5.504.,"['0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to minimise the number of manual manipulations required for processing large numbers of samples, we attempted to design a system whereby all the reagents required for both reverse transcription and amplification can be added to one tube and a single, non-interrupted thermal cycling program performed. Whilst attempting to set up such a one-tube system with Taq polymerase (Taq; Biotech International) and avian myoblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (RT), we noticed a substantial decrease in the sensitivity of detection of viral RNA. Investigation of this phenomenon has revealed direct interference of RT with Taq polymerase. Evidence supporting this conclusion includes the following observations: (1) increasing the ratio of Taq to RT improves sensitivity; (2) adding non-homologous RNA improves sensitivity; (3) RT that has been heat inactivated prior to Taq addition does not exert this effect; (4) the effect is not sequence restricted; (5) the Mg2+ ions are not sequestered by RT. In addition, the effect is not limited to AMV RT, Moloney murine leukaemia virus RT also affects Taq activity.","['Sellner, L N', 'Coelen, R J', 'Mackenzie, J S']","['Sellner LN', 'Coelen RJ', 'Mackenzie JS']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Western Australia, Nedlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/*enzymology', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Amplification', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', '*Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Taq Polymerase', 'Temperature']",1992/04/11 00:00,1992/04/11 00:01,['1992/04/11 00:00'],"['1992/04/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/11 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/20.7.1487 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1992 Apr 11;20(7):1487-90. doi: 10.1093/nar/20.7.1487.,"['0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Taq Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",,,,PMC312227,,,,,,,,,,

Some principal similarities of karyotypic evolution were noted in at least two different systems. They include: (i) appearance at the first selection step of a new chromosomal arm bearing the resident gene copy followed at the next selection steps by the formation in these specific chromosomal arms of amplified DNA tandem arrays; (ii) translocations of amplified DNA from its initial site to other, also non-random, chromosomal sites; and (iii) emergence in the cell variants with high degrees of gene amplification of multiple extra-chromosomal elements. The most prominent distinctions among the systems were as follows: (i) different structures, evidently containing amplified DNAs, appeared at the initial steps of amplification of different genes--additional heterogeneously staining regions in specific chromosomal segments in the case of amplification of dhfr or CAD genes in DM-15 cells, and mini-chromosomes in the case of mdr1 gene amplification in both DM-15 and P380 cells; (ii) distinct patterns of location of the amplified mdr1 gene copies are characteristic of Djungarian hamster DM-15 and murine P388 cell derivatives after subsequent steps of selection--at the site of resident gene localization or in some other, also non-random, chromosomal sites in DM-15 sublines, and predominantly extra-chromosomal in P388 sublines. We propose that different mechanisms are responsible for the initial steps of amplification of dhfr and CAD genes on the one hand and the mdr1 gene on the other: non-equal sister-chromatid exchanges and autonomous replication of the extra-chromosomal elements. It seems, however, that both mechanisms may be involved in further rounds of amplification of each of these three genes.","['Kopnin, B P', 'Sokova, O I', 'Demidova, N S']","['Kopnin BP', 'Sokova OI', 'Demidova NS']","['Institute of Cancerogenesis, All-Union Cancer Research Centre, Moscow, U.S.S.R.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Glutamine-Hydrolyzing)/*genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia P388', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1110(92)90006-U [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1110(92)90006-u [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1992 May;276(3):163-77. doi: 10.1016/0165-1110(92)90006-u.,"['EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 6.3.5.5 (Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Glutamine-Hydrolyzing))']",,"['CAD', 'dhfr', 'mdr1']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Simultaneous continuous infusions of ara-C and VP-16 (cycle 1) given at individualized doses to achieve drug plasma concentrations of 1 microM and 30 microM, respectively, produced complete remission (CR) in 26 of 61 patients (43%); an additional 17 patients entered CR after Dauno/ara-C (cycle 2), and one patient required 4 cycles of chemotherapy to achieve CR (total CR rate = 72%). The preliminary 2-year event-free survival (EFS) for patients with FAB-M1 and -M2 AML was only 15% versus 40% for those with FAB-M4 and -M5 AML. Overall, 21 of the 61 patients remain in CR (2-yr EFS = 29%).

Two peaks of platelet PKC activity were resolved by hydroxylapatite chromatography; immunoblot analysis revealed that these two peaks represented the alpha and beta isozymes of PKC. In contrast, HEL cells produced only a single peak that contained the beta isozyme. None of the other PKC isozymes were detected in these fractions. The cytosol of platelets and HEL cells, however, were both found to contain the PKC-delta isozyme. Northern hybridization analyses and mRNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction demonstrated the presence of mRNA encoding the alpha, beta, and delta PKC isozymes in platelets, but only the beta and delta isozymes in HEL cells. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), thrombin, or an endoperoxide analog induced the phosphorylation of the 47-kDa substrate of PKC (pleckstrin) found in platelets and HEL cells; preincubation of either HEL cells or platelets with PMA reduced the intracellular Ca2+ rise induced by thrombin. Thus, although both HEL cells and platelets contain PKC-beta and the recently described PKC-delta isozymes, the widely distributed alpha isozyme of PKC is absent in HEL cells; however, isozymes other than PKC-alpha are sufficient for some PMA-mediated functions that are similar to those seen in stimulated platelets.","['Grabarek, J', 'Raychowdhury, M', 'Ravid, K', 'Kent, K C', 'Newman, P J', 'Ware, J A']","['Grabarek J', 'Raychowdhury M', 'Ravid K', 'Kent KC', 'Newman PJ', 'Ware JA']","['Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['HL02271/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL38820/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blood Platelets/*enzymology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography', 'Durapatite', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyapatites', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'RNA/blood/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thrombin/pharmacology']",1992/05/15 00:00,1992/05/15 00:01,['1992/05/15 00:00'],"['1992/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)50192-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 May 15;267(14):10011-7.,"['0 (Hydroxyapatites)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '91D9GV0Z28 (Durapatite)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutralization was measured both by inhibition of Epo-induced differentiation in Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells and by inhibition of Epo-induced proliferation in normal murine splenic erythroid precursors. Characterization of the structural epitopes recognized by each of these four reagent MoAbs should provide us with important information concerning the requirements for hormone-receptor interaction.","['Feldman, L', 'Heinzerling, R', 'Hillam, R P', 'Chern, Y E', 'Frazier, J G', 'Davis, K L', 'Sytkowski, A J']","['Feldman L', 'Heinzerling R', 'Hillam RP', 'Chern YE', 'Frazier JG', 'Davis KL', 'Sytkowski AJ']","['Department of Medicine, New England Deaconess Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215.']",['eng'],"['DK 38841/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 41395/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Erythropoietin/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Spleen/cytology/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology/ultrastructure']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Jan;20(1):64-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At low concentrations He-PC stimulated the CSF-dependent progenitor cell colony growth of three patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and of three of six patients without hematological disorders. The stimulating effect was up to eight times that of the control using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and twofold in the case of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), whereas only slight effects were noted when interleukin 3 (IL-3) or the combination of the CSFs was used as an additive. The stimulatory effects observed are far below the He-PC concentrations that are usually required for the in vitro growth arrest of cancer cells. At higher concentrations He-PC displayed suppressive effects, most pronounced in the case of G-CSF-dependent colony growth. At the concentrations investigated, He-PC failed to show any changes in the composition and distribution of specific colonies. He-PC by itself had no mitogenic activity. This indicates that He-PC acts as a co-stimulator. In the cases of myeloproliferative diseases and in the case of a patient without known hematological disorder, removal of accessory cells did not abrogate the He-PC-enhanced colony growth by CSFs. Thus, the stimulatory effect of low-dose He-PC seems not to be mediated by accessory cells.","['Vehmeyer, K', 'Eibl, H', 'Unger, C']","['Vehmeyer K', 'Eibl H', 'Unger C']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/classification', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Jan;20(1):1-5.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '53EY29W7EC (miltefosine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of biochemical mechanisms have been described, one of them being a lower accumulation of drugs in resistant cells. The accumulation of Ho33342 in sensitive and resistant Friend leukemia cells was studied by quantitative fluorescence image analysis, a method which allows investigations to be made on living tissues and cells. The intensity of fluorescence is related to the amount of Ho33342 accumulated into the cells and has been found to be more intense in sensitive cells than in resistant ones. Moreover, the retention of this vital dye was inversely related to the degree of resistance in the three resistant cell lines. The addition of verapamil, which is known to reverse resistance to anthracyclines, resulted in an increase of the amount of Ho33342 accumulated in the resistant cells. Ho33342 presents a higher quantum yield than any other anthracyclines, such as adriamycin and can be used as a microfluorimetric probe to identify the resistant cells in a heterogeneous cell population.","['Lahmy, S', 'Salmon, J M', 'Vigo, J', 'Viallet, P']","['Lahmy S', 'Salmon JM', 'Vigo J', 'Viallet P']","['Microfluorimetrie Quantitative et Pharmacocinetique Cellulaire, URA CNRS 1289, Universite de Perpignan, Perpignan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,IM,"['Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbf.290100103 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 1992 Mar;10(1):9-17. doi: 10.1002/cbf.290100103.,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of the present study was to examine the potential antiretroviral activities of novel mechanism-based irreversible AdoHcy-nase inhibitors. (Z)-4',5'-didehydro-5'-deoxy-5'-fluoroadenosine (ZDDFA), (E)-4',5'-didehydro-5'-deoxy-5'-fluoroadenosine (EDDFA), (Z)-4',5'-didehydro-5'-deoxy-5'-chloroadenosine (ZDDCA) and 5'-deoxy-5'-acetylenic adenosine (DAA) inhibited AdoHcy-nase activity with Ki values of 0.55, 1.04, greater than 10.0 and 3.30 microM, respectively. These four compounds were tested for antiviral activity in vitro against Moloney leukemia virus (MoLV) in the XC-plaque assay. MoLV replication in murine fibroblasts (SC-1) was inhibited by ZDDFA, EDDFA and DAA with IC50 values of 0.05, 0.25 and 3.30 micrograms/ml, respectively. ZDDCA did not inhibit MoLV infection at the concentrations tested. Antiviral activity correlated with the ability of the individual compounds to maintain sustained elevations in intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) concentrations in the SC-1 cells. ZDDFA, the most potent inhibitor of AdoHcy-nase and MoLV was also the most active in maintaining sustained elevations in intracellular AdoHcy levels. The antiviral activity of ZDDFA was also examined in murine C3H1OT1/2 fibroblasts which constitutively produce MoLV. Pretreatment with ZDDFA (1.0 microgram/ml) for 24 hr inhibited virus production by 88%. Similar to the SC-1 cells, and concomitant with enzyme inhibition, there was a 300-fold increase in AdoHcy levels in ZDDFA (1.0 microgram/ml) treated C3H1OT1/2 cells. Incorporation of a [3H]methyl group from tritiated S-adenosylmethionine into total RNA in C3H1OT1/2 cells was inhibited by ZDDFA without affecting cell viability. These results suggest that mechanism-based inhibitors of AdoHcy-nase, such as ZDDFA, may have potential as antiretroviral agents.","['Prakash, N J', 'Davis, G F', 'Jarvi, E T', 'Edwards, M L', 'McCarthy, J R', 'Bowlin, T L']","['Prakash NJ', 'Davis GF', 'Jarvi ET', 'Edwards ML', 'McCarthy JR', 'Bowlin TL']","['Marion Merrell Dow Research Institute, Cincinnati, Ohio 45215.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosylhomocysteinase', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Hydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*drug effects', 'RNA/metabolism', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/metabolism']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0024-3205(92)90261-M [pii]', '10.1016/0024-3205(92)90261-m [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 1992;50(19):1425-35. doi: 10.1016/0024-3205(92)90261-m.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', ""122289-05-8 (4',5'-didehydro-5'-deoxy-5'-fluoroadenosine)"", '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.1.1 (Adenosylhomocysteinase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority (90%) of V beta 10+ beta-chains dominated in TIL used homogeneous V beta 10D beta 2.1 sequences identical to that used in the T cell clones with cytotoxic functions. The homogeneous TCR beta-chain expression was dominant and found to be about 10% of the total TCR beta-chains in the TIL population, which was a greater than 300-to 900-fold increase than in the regional lymph nodes. This is in good agreement with the in vitro data showing that about 11% CTL clones used the homogeneous V beta 10D beta 2.1+ beta-chain. However, the J beta segment does not seem to contribute greatly to the recognition and selection of this TCR because some of homogeneous VD+ beta-chains were associated with J beta segments other than J beta 2.7 of the CTL clones. The frequency of the V alpha 1J alpha 112-2+ alpha-chain expression of the CTL type was much less (3- to 80-fold increase compared to that of lymph node) and also varied in sample materials, indicating the lower contribution of the alpha-chain for the oligoclonality of the TCR. The results were also confirmed by quantitative PCR and RNase protection assays. This suggests that the dominant expression of the homogeneous TCR beta-chain is due to the expansion of the particular anti-FBL-3 CTL in the tumor in situ. Also, the TCR beta-chain, especially the V beta D beta region, rather than alpha-chain is more important for the recognition and selection of the anti-FBL-3 TIL with cytotoxic functions.","['Suzuki, M', 'Koseki, H', 'Mizutani, Y', 'Kuribayashi, K', 'Kanno, M', 'Taniguchi, M']","['Suzuki M', 'Koseki H', 'Mizutani Y', 'Kuribayashi K', 'Kanno M', 'Taniguchi M']","['Division of Molecular Immunology, School of Medicine, Chiba University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'RNA/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 May 1;148(9):2968-73.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Repopulation of B and T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and myeloid cells was assessed by phenotypic analysis using two-color cytofluorography of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) at several time points up to 2 years post-transplantation. In spite of removal of the majority of monomyeloid cells of the autograft by purging with anti-CD14 and anti-CD 15, engraftment occurred rapidly. The myeloid cells appeared normal by surface phenotype. An early rise in NK cells, characterized by expression of CD57 and CD 16, was seen. The CD4:CD8 ratio remained low throughout the study period, primarily due to a persistently low CD4 level. ABMT using bone marrow purged with the anti-myeloid MoAbs PM-81 and AML-2-23 and C' resulted in prompt engraftment of neutrophils. Although there was a prolonged time for recovery of lymphocyte subsets, this did not result in an increased risk of early infectious complications. Late infectious complications post-transplantation were limited to herpes zoster infection in one patient 18 months post-transplantation, and bacterial meningitis in that same patient 2 months later. This study demonstrates that ABMT in patients with AML using bone marrow purged with the anti-myeloid MoAbs PM81 (anti-CD15) and AML-2-23 (anti-CD14) and C' results in rapid hematologic engraftment and delayed phenotypic immunologic reconstitution without significant acute or chronic clinical toxicities.","['Ericson, S G', 'Colby, E', 'Welch, L', 'Ball, E D']","['Ericson SG', 'Colby E', 'Welch L', 'Ball ED']","['Department of Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover.']",['eng'],['CA 31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lewis X Antigen', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', '*Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992 Feb;9(2):129-37.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we report prolonged survival of B-lineage leukemic cells on 'feeder layers' of bone marrow (BM)-derived stromal cells in a serum-free environment. In 15 of 18 cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), there was a greater than 50% decrease in the number of viable cells after 72 hours of culture in medium alone. Cell loss was preceded by molecular and cellular changes characteristic of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, and was not suppressed by adding interleukin-7 to the tissue culture medium. By contrast, the use of allogeneic BM stromal cells as feeder layers prevented apoptosis in 10 of 12 cases of ALL, leading to extended survival of the blast cells. This method was not successful when the allogeneic marrow cells were replaced with established cell lines. In six of eight cases in which the numbers of intact CD19+ lymphoblasts were counted by flow cytometry after 7 days of culture, the proportion of such cells recovered in the presence of BM stromal cells was 68.8% to 124.7% (median, 95.3%) of that originally seeded, as opposed to the 0.3% to 15.9% fraction (median, 0.7%) obtained in the absence of stromal cells. Survival requirements of the B-lineage lymphoblasts appeared to be heterogeneous, as cells from 3 of the 18 cases studied showed no signs of apoptosis in serum-free tissue culture medium that lacked BM stromal cells. The only cells not giving rise to viable cultures were from two hyperdiploid (greater than 50 chromosomes) cases with identical karyotypes. The serum-free assay described here can be used to compare the survival requirements of normal and leukemic B-cell progenitors as well as to identify the molecules involved in the interaction between BM stroma and immature B cells.","['Manabe, A', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Behm, F G', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Campana, D']","['Manabe A', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Behm FG', 'Raimondi SC', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],['P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', '*Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fetal Blood/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)72990-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 May 1;79(9):2370-7.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Interleukin-7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An intravenous challenge with 1 x 10(6) (NALM-6-UM1 cells caused 15 of 27 (56%) SCID mice to become paraplegic at 31 +/- 2 days (median = 33 days) and 27 of 27 (100%) mice to die of disseminated leukemia at 38 +/- 1 days (median = 39 days). We used this SCID mouse model of aggressive human pre-B ALL to evaluate the in vivo antileukemic efficacy of B43 (anti-CD19)-pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) immunotoxin. A 3-day treatment with nontoxic doses of B43-PAP markedly reduced the incidence of paraplegia and improved event-free survival (EFS) in SCID mice challenged with 1 x 10(6) NALM-6-UM1 pre-B ALL cells, as reflected by significantly higher cumulative proportions of mice free of paraplegia or alive at 1 to 7 months, as compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treated control mice. The Kaplan-Meier estimates and standard errors of the probability of developing paraplegia after inoculation of 1 x 10(6) NALM-6-UM1 cells was 64% +/- 10% for PBS-treated mice (median time to paraplegia = 37 days) (N = 27), 18% +/- 8% for mice treated with 15 micrograms B43-PAP (5 micrograms/mouse/d x 3 days) (N = 23) and 5% +/- 5% for mice treated with 30 micrograms B43-PAP (10 micrograms/mouse/d x 3 days) (N = 21). While 27 of 27 PBS-treated control SCID mice died of leukemia at 38 +/- 1 days (range = 24 to 54 days), only 16 of 44 B43-PAP-treated mice developed leukemia at 74 +/- 12 days (range = 30 to 182 days), consistent with greater than or equal to 6 logs kill of clonogenic NALM-6-UM1 cells in 64% of SCID mice.

First CD34+ cells isolated by panning were further separated on the basis of absence of HLA-DR expression by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Second, CD34+ HLA-DR- cells were isolated by nonadherence to soybean agglutinin, negative immunomagnetic bead selection with lineage-specific antibodies, and two-color cell sorting. Progenitors in either cell population were unable to form colonies in the presence of interleukin (IL)-3 alone but yielded a substantial number of colonies, including multilineage colonies, in the presence of combinations of IL-3 and IL-6. Similarly, IL-3 plus any one of the other synergistic factors, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and steel factor, effectively supported colony formation from CD34+ HLA-DR- progenitors. Sequential observation of colony formation from single CD34+ HLA-DR- cells provided definitive evidence that the synergistic factors trigger cell divisions of dormant cells. Studies with delayed addition of factors to the cultures provided evidence that this population of cells also requires IL-3 or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to survive even while dormant. In contrast, none of the synergistic factors were able to replace IL-3 or GM-CSF in this function.

We have cloned and characterized the translocation breakpoints to examine the possibility that an oncogene contributed to the pathogenesis of these cases of CLL. Sequence analysis of AS and LH breakpoints established that the chromosome 2 breakage in the two patients occurred only 38 bp apart and within a strong non-methylated CpG island. Furthermore, human probes from the region cross-hybridized to other species, indicating strong evolutionary conservation. Northern analysis using the chromosome 2 probes detected a 2.85-kb transcript in the tumor cells and in a CD5+ B-cell line.

The apparent discrepancy between these findings is still largely unknown. PURPOSE: We report on a unique case of ATL in which the leukemia cells were positive for both T-cell and myeloid cell antigens. To characterize these cells, we isolated cell lines from this patient with ATL. METHODS: The fresh leukemia cells were cultured without the addition of interleukin-2. Cell cloning was carried out by limiting dilution. RESULTS: A cell line (MU) and its clonal sublines were established. MU cells showed the same chromosomal abnormalities and T-cell receptor beta-chain gene rearrangement pattern as those of fresh leukemia cells. MU cells were exclusively positive for a myeloid cell marker (CD13) but not for T-cell markers, despite the presence of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. CONCLUSION: The established ATL cell line showed both T-cell and myeloid cell characteristics, which seems to be the first evidence for the close association of ATL cells with both lymphoid and myeloid features. The cell line may provide a new insight for the targets of HTLV-1 infection and transformation in vivo.","['Koizumi, S', 'Iwanaga, M', 'Imai, S', 'Yamashiro, K', 'Mikuni, C', 'Abe, S', 'Kakinuma, M', 'Saito, N', 'Takami, T', 'Fukazawa, Y']","['Koizumi S', 'Iwanaga M', 'Imai S', 'Yamashiro K', 'Mikuni C', 'Abe S', 'Kakinuma M', 'Saito N', 'Takami T', 'Fukazawa Y', 'et al.']","['Department of Virology, Cancer Institute, School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/06 00:00,1992/05/06 00:01,['1992/05/06 00:00'],"['1992/05/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/06 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/84.9.690 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992 May 6;84(9):690-3. doi: 10.1093/jnci/84.9.690.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an established human myeloid leukemia cell line (NKM-1) which can grow in serum-free medium in response to G-CSF or M-CSF, we examined expressions of the jun family genes, c-jun, junB, and junD, which are coexpressed by various growth factors in many tissues. In parallel with regrowth from the G0/G1 resting state by addition of recombinant human G-CSF or M-CSF after serum deprivation, NKM-1 cells showed the transient expression of the junB gene with a peak of ninefold above the basal level between 40 and 60 min. In contrast, c-jun expression was not stimulated by these CSFs. JunD expression was constitutively observed at detectable levels. Furthermore, c-fos mRNA was rapidly induced to a peak of 14-fold after CSF stimulation. Transcriptional run-on assays revealed that treatment of serum-starved NKM-1 with 50 ng/ml G-CSF or M-CSF increased the transcription rate of the junB gene and the c-fos gene by 1.8-fold and 2.9-fold, respectively, but did not induce any transcript of the c-jun gene. The results indicate that the expression of the junB and c-fos genes is activated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level in response to these CSFs. These findings suggest that the signal activating c-jun expression might not be involved in the proliferative action of G-CSF and M-CSF but junB may be one of important elements in early response events of the signal transduction system in human CSF-responsive hematopoietic cells.","['Adachi, K', 'Saito, H']","['Adachi K', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, fos', '*Genes, jun', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI115763 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1992 May;89(5):1657-61. doi: 10.1172/JCI115763.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,PMC443043,,,,,,,,,,

In studies described in this report we investigated the effects of a novel anti-CD33 immunotoxin on the clonogenic potential of normal human CD34+ marrow cells and on the ability of these cells to initiate hematopoiesis in two-stage Dexter cultures (long-term marrow cultures, LTMC). This immunotoxin (anti-CD33-bR), shown previously to kill both clonogenic myelogenous leukemia cells and normal mature myeloid progenitor cells (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-GM), consists of an anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody conjugated to purified ricin that has been modified by blocking the carbohydrate binding domains of the ricin B-chain to eliminate nonspecific binding. For our studies, normal CD34+ human marrow cells were isolated from the light-density (less than 1.070 g/ml) cells of aspirated marrow by positive selection with immunomagnetic beads linked to the monoclonal antibody K6.1. These cell isolates were highly enriched with both multipotential and lineage-restricted clonogenic, hematopoietic progenitors (mixed lineage colony-forming units, CFU-Mix; CFU-GM; and erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-E) which constituted greater than or equal to 20% of the cells. Recovery of clonogenic progenitors from these CD34+ cell preparations, following treatment with anti-CD33-bR (10 nM), was reduced by greater than or equal to 85% for CFU-GM and 20%-40% for CFU-Mix and BFU-E. However, the capacity of these cells to initiate hematopoietic LTMC was preserved. Indeed, the production of high proliferative potential (HPP) CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-Mix in cultures seeded with 10(5) anti-CD33-bR-treated CD34+ marrow cells was substantially greater than that observed in LTMC seeded with equivalent numbers of untreated CD34+ cells. Moreover, concentrations of long-term culture initiating cells in CD34+ cell isolates, quantified by a limiting dilution technique, were found to be increased following anti-CD33-bR treatment. These findings support the potential usefulness of anti-CD33-bR for in vitro marrow purging or in vivo treatment to eliminate CD33+ leukemic clones, while sparing normal CD34+/CD33- stem cells that support normal hematopoiesis and hematopoietic reconstitution in vivo.","['La Russa, V F', 'Griffin, J D', 'Kessler, S W', 'Cutting, M A', 'Knight, R D', 'Blattler, W A', 'Lambert, J M', 'Wright, D G']","['La Russa VF', 'Griffin JD', 'Kessler SW', 'Cutting MA', 'Knight RD', 'Blattler WA', 'Lambert JM', 'Wright DG']","['Department of Hematology, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, DC 20307-5100.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Ricin/administration & dosage', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Time Factors']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 May;20(4):442-8.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The -198 T----C mutation (British type HPFH) was demonstrated upstream of the A gamma gene on one allele. On the other allele, a 4-deletion was identified -222 to -225 bp upstream from the cap site. The 4-bp deletion allele was associated with a number of variations in the A gamma gene sequence: anA gamma T transition, in the second exon (T----C at +402 relative to the cap site); a HindIII polymorphism in the second intron; and a G gamma-like sequence in the 3' untranslated region (TCAC in place of CTCT, creating a SacI site). An association between the -222 to -225 deletion, the A gamma T polymorphism, and the second intron HindIII polymorphism has previously been reported. In addition, linkage of the HindIII polymorphism with the G gamma-like sequence in the 3' untranslated region of A gamma has also been described. The case described here is unique, with all four changes present in the one A gamma gene. It is also noteworthy because there is simultaneous occurrence of high (HPFH) and low (-222 to -225 deletion) expression mutants in the same patient. Despite the presence of the 4-bp deletion, the resulting hematological phenotype remained that of HPFH. When the 4-bp deletion promoter was studied in a K562-cell transient expression assay, there was found to be no statistically significant reduction in activity compared to the control A gamma promoter.

This form of leukemia/lymphoma is endemic in southwestern islands of Japan, although at present the number of HTLV-I seropositive individuals has greatly increased, with a worldwide diffusion, following the expansion wave of the AIDS-associated HIV retrovirus. In fact, double seropositivity for both HIV and HTLV is frequently found among intravenous drug users. Although ATL leukemia or lymphoma occurs with a low frequency among HTLV-I seropositive individuals, it is likely that the evolution from a latent phase of infection to acute leukemia could be favoured by depression of immunosurveillance levels in the host. Therefore, special attention is required to prevent the diffusion of this retrovirus in adults, taking into consideration that newborn babies from seropositive mothers have to be considered at high risk for development of HTLV-I associated disease, on the basis of their immature immunocompetence.","[""D'Onofrio, C"", 'Bonmassar, E']","[""D'Onofrio C"", 'Bonmassar E']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale e Scienze Biochimiche, II Universita degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata.']",['ita'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Clin Ter,La Clinica terapeutica,0372604,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Epoprostenol/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*HTLV-I Infections/immunology/prevention & control', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Prostaglandins A/therapeutic use']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Ter. 1992 Feb;140(2):155-67.,"['0 (Prostaglandins A)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)']",,,65,,Eziopatogenesi e prospettive terapeutiche nella leucemia a cellule T mature associata al retrovirus HTLV-I.,,,,,,,,,

Phenotypic characterizations showed that all three cell lines had receptors for peanut agglutinin (PNA) and soybean agglutinin (SBA) while HPB-MLT and HPB-ALL, but not PEER, expressed the cortical thymocyte-specific marker, CD1. The majority of HPB-MLT cells (88%) expressed only CD4 but not CD8 antigen while most HPB-ALL cells (81%) co-expressed CD8 and CD4 antigens. PEER cells were negative for both CD8 and CD4. These three T cell lines showed differential sensitivity to dAdo plus dCoF in consequent tests. dAdo or dAdo plus dCoF (1 microM) had no effect on the growth, or DNA and RNA synthesis of HPB-MLT cells while the combination of dAdo and dCoF partially inhibited cellular growth and DNA and RNA synthesis of HPB-ALL cells. Further, the growth and DNA and RNA synthesis of PEER cells were strongly inhibited by the combination of dAdo and dCoF. This high sensitivity to dAdo plus dCoF reflected an immature phenotype of PEER cells despite its expression of CD3. Flow cytometric analysis of PEER cells demonstrated disappearance of the G2/M phase cells from the cell cycle after treatment with dAdo plus dCoF. Measurements of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) activities in all three cell lines, however, did not establish correlations between purine metabolizing enzyme activities and the differential sensitivities to dAdo plus dCoF.

An unusually high incidence of spontaneous thymic lymphoma development was observed after transfer of this mutation from the C.B-17 congenic strain background onto the diabetes-susceptible nonobese diabetic (NOD) background. Thymomagenesis in the NOD-scid/scid mouse was associated with expression of an NOD mouse-unique endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia provirus locus (Emv-30, mapped to proximal region of chromosome 11) not expressed in the standard substrain NOD/Lt thymus. All tumors exhibited insertions of ecotropic proviruses, whereas only a subset also exhibited proviral integrations of mink cell focus-forming retrovirus. Neither class of retrovirus was associated with consistent integration into genes previously associated with activation of oncogenesis.

We therefore investigated the effect of soluble IL-1 receptors (sIL-1R) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) on the growth of AML bone marrow blast progenitors from 25 patients. In the AML blast colony culture assay, sIL-1R and IL-1RA inhibited blast colony-forming cell replication in a dose-dependent fashion, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 ng/mL (sIL-1R) and 10 to 1,000 ng/mL (IL-1RA), and their inhibitory effect was partially reversed by IL-1 beta. A similar inhibitory effect was also noted with the use of anti-IL-1 beta neutralizing antibodies. When AML blast progenitors were grown either in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) alone or with one of the following: phytohemagglutinin leukocyte-conditioned medium (PHA-LCM), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, interleukin-3 (IL-3), or stem cell factor (SCF), addition of 100 ng/mL sIL-1R or IL-1RA inhibited blast colony formation by 3% to 96% and 2% to 97%, respectively. In sharp contrast, neither of these IL-1-inhibitory molecules significantly inhibited proliferation of normal marrow hematopoietic progenitors. Lysates of 2 x 10(7) low-density AML marrow cells were tested for intrinsic IL-1 beta content using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbant assay (ELISA). Samples from five of six patients showed high concentrations (ranging from 501 to 2,041 pg), whereas 2 x 10(7) cells from two normal marrow aspirates yielded 54.6 pg of IL-1 beta. AML blast colony-forming cells from all six patients were inhibited by sIL-1R, IL-1RA, or both. Incubation of nine samples of AML low-density cells with either sIL-1R or IL-1RA reduced GM-CSF concentrations in cell lysates, and supernatants from nine (P less than .01) and six samples (P less than .037), respectively, and G-CSF concentration in lysates from six of nine samples (P less than .03), and in supernatants from five of six samples (P less than .06) when studied by ELISAs.

Inhibition of 3H-leucine uptake by target cells was used as the parameter of cellular cytotoxicity. Used singly against HSB-2 cells in the presence of varied concentrations of saporin, an anti-CD7 BsAb, (HB2 x DB7-18) and an anti-CD38 BsAb (OKT10 x RabSap), gave 435- and 286-fold increases in saporin toxicity, respectively. For HPB-ALL cells the anti-CD7 BsAb performed poorly giving only an eight-fold increase in toxicity whilst on the same cell line the anti-CD38 BsAb was highly potent giving an 80,000-fold increase in saporin toxicity. A combination of both BsAb used together against HSB-2 cells was ten times more effective, than the best single BsAb HB2 x DB7-18 used alone. Kinetic studies conducted with HSB-2 cells revealed that the BsAb combination also gave an increased rate of protein synthesis inactivation in comparison to either BsAb used alone. These investigations clearly demonstrate a synergistic action when both BsAb are used in combination to target saporin against CD7 and CD38 expressed on the surface of the HSB-2 cell line.","['Flavell, D J', 'Cooper, S', 'Morland, B', 'French, R', 'Flavell, S U']","['Flavell DJ', 'Cooper S', 'Morland B', 'French R', 'Flavell SU']","['Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, University Department of Pathology, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments', 'Immunotoxins/administration & dosage', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Plant Proteins/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Ribosomes/drug effects', 'Saporins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1992.112 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1992 Apr;65(4):545-51. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1992.112.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,PMC1977556,,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular metabolism of 6-MP to 6-thioguanosine nucleotides (TGN) via 6-thioinosine 5'-monophosphate (TIMP) is crucial for its cytotoxic effect. MTX inhibits purine de novo synthesis and thereby increases the intracellular PRPP being a substrate for the phosphoribosylation of 6-MP to TIMP. Hypoxanthine has been shown to inhibit the uptake of 6-MP over the cell membrane and the phosphoribosylation of 6-MP to TIMP. We have previously shown that the conversion of TIMP to TGN decreases at 6-MP concentrations above 5 microM in vitro. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the effect of MTX increasing the PRPP and TIMP concentrations and of hypoxanthine decreasing the TIMP concentration on the formation of TGN from TIMP. Murine myelomonocytic leukemia cells (WEHI-3b) were treated with 6-MP in vitro. The drug concentration was kept constant by continuous addition of 6-MP during the experiment. With this technique, the concentration of TGN begins to decrease already at 6-MP concentrations above 2 microM. The addition of 0.2 microM MTX 6 h before 6-MP strongly inhibited the purine de novo synthesis, decreased the ATP, and increased the PRPP concentration 4-fold. The intracellular concentrations of TIMP and to a lesser extent TXMP also increased. The concentrations of the TGN were, however, basically unaffected by the preincubation with MTX. Simultaneous addition of 20-50 microM hypoxanthine and 6-MP decreased the accumulation of all cellular 6-MP metabolites. It is concluded that the synergistic cytotoxic effect of the combination of 6-MP and MTX is not based on biochemical modulation of the 6-MP metabolism by MTX.","['Liliemark, J', 'Pettersson, B', 'Peterson, C']","['Liliemark J', 'Pettersson B', 'Peterson C']","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Interactions', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'Inosine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mercaptopurine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate/metabolism', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xanthines/metabolism']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(92)90065-f [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992;16(3):275-80. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90065-f.,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (Xanthines)', '131-99-7 (Inosine Monophosphate)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', ""3237-49-8 (6-thioxanthine 5'-monophosphate)"", '7540-64-9 (Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate)', '76CK4YA5ZP (thioinosinic acid)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I-specific CD8+ CTL lines established from two HTLV-I carriers with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy or Sjogren syndrome were previously demonstrated to kill predominantly the target cells expressing HTLV-I Tax. The CTL from two patients showed significant levels of cytotoxicity to autologous target cells pulsed with a synthetic peptide of 24 amino acids corresponding to the amino-terminal sequences of the Tax protein. Allogeneic target cells were also sensitized for CTL by this peptide when the target cells have HLA-A2. Tax-specific cytotoxicity, detected as cytolysis of the target cells infected with vaccinia virus-HTLV-I recombinant expressing Tax protein, was almost completely inhibited by competitor cells pulsed with the synthetic peptide. This indicates that a major CTL epitope is present in this peptide. Further analysis using shorter peptides revealed that the core sequence of the CTL epitope was LLFGYPVYV at positions 11 through 19.

In the present study, although pp72 tyrosine phosphorylation was induced only by antigen triggering, stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells by either antigen or the calcium-ionophore A23187 led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 110-kDa protein (pp110). This tyrosine phosphorylated protein was also observed when RBL-2H3 cells were transfected with the G protein-coupled m3 muscarinic receptor and then stimulated to secrete with carbachol. In contrast to tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72, antigen-induced pp110 tyrosine phosphorylation required extracellular calcium, was absent in cells depleted of protein kinase C, and was detected between 1 and 5 min after stimulation. The protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocked both histamine release and tyrosine phosphorylation induced by A23187. Altogether, the data suggest a role for pp110 in secretion. However, protein kinase C activation induced pp110 tyrosine phosphorylation but not histamine release demonstrating that pp110 tyrosine phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for degranulation. We conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72 is associated with the early steps of IgE receptor-generated signaling, whereas pp110 tyrosine phosphorylation occurs secondary to calcium influx and protein kinase C activation.","['Benhamou, M', 'Stephan, V', 'Robbins, K C', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Benhamou M', 'Stephan V', 'Robbins KC', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Genistein', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1992/04/15 00:00,1992/04/15 00:01,['1992/04/15 00:00'],"['1992/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42520-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Apr 15;267(11):7310-4.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some patients, the involved stem cells manifest pluripotent differentiative expression, whereas in others, the involved progenitors manifest differentiative expression mainly restricted to the granulocytic pathway. This is in contrast to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) which is a clonal disease known to arise in a pluripotent stem cell. Therefore, we tested whether these leukemias could be distinguished with respect to their involvement of immature precursors by studying colony-forming cells (CFC) and their precursors from four glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) heterozygous patients with AML and five patients with CML. CFC were separated from their precursors by FACS for expression of CD33 and CD34 followed by growth in a long-term culture (LTC) system. The vast majority of CFC express both the CD33 and CD34 antigens, but their less mature precursors, detected by their ability to give rise to CFC in LTC, express only CD34. In three of the four patients with AML, the CD33-CD34+ cells produced CFC in LTC that appeared to be predominantly or completely normal (ie, nonclonal) in origin. In the fourth patient, a significant enrichment of nonclonal progenitors was obtained in the CD33-CD34+ population, but these cells may also have included significant numbers of clonal cells. In contrast, in four of five patients with CML, cultures of both the CD33-CD34+ and CD33+CD34+ populations produced CFC in LTC that were almost entirely clonal in origin, whereas in the fifth patient a substantial number originated from nonclonal stem cells. These data indicate that granulocyte/monocyte progenitors are predominantly clonally derived in CML and AML. In CML, their precursors are also predominantly clonal, but in some cases of AML they are not. These findings may have implications for understanding the success or failure of current therapies of AML and CML.","['Bernstein, I D', 'Singer, J W', 'Smith, F O', 'Andrews, R G', 'Flowers, D A', 'Petersens, J', 'Steinmann, L', 'Najfeld, V', 'Savage, D', 'Fruchtman, S']","['Bernstein ID', 'Singer JW', 'Smith FO', 'Andrews RG', 'Flowers DA', 'Petersens J', 'Steinmann L', 'Najfeld V', 'Savage D', 'Fruchtman S', 'et al.']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['CA10382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39492/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL31782/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73677-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Apr 1;79(7):1811-6.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFNs have demonstrated important clinical activity in hairy cell leukemia, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma as monotherapy. Shortly after their introduction into clinical trials, however, preclinical studies demonstrated synergistic interactions between IFNs and cytotoxic drugs. Numerous preclinical trials have demonstrated a broad spectrum of interactions between IFNs and at least 20 cytotoxic agents both in vitro and in vivo.

This distinct translocation results in a fusion mRNA detected by Northern analysis. Two cDNAs have been isolated that differ in the extent of 3' PML nucleic acid sequence contained. This study describes a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the PML/RAR-alpha fusion transcript, which amplifies PML/RAR-alpha mRNA from APL cells with either reported breakpoint. DNA sequencing of the predominant RT-PCR products from 6 patients showed identical RAR-alpha exonic breakpoints and two PML breakpoints. This RT-PCR assay was positive in leukemic cells from 30/30 APL patients with the molecular rearrangement confirmed by cytogenetics or Northern analysis. In leukemic cells of patients with a morphologic diagnosis of APL lacking the t(15;17) by routine cytogenetics, a positive RT-PCR assay predicted clinical response to all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) therapy. Dilutional studies with leukemic cells that express (NB4) or do not express (HL-60) a PML/RAR-alpha fusion mRNA reveal that this RT-PCR assay detects the transcript from as little as 50 pg of total RNA. In APL cells from 5/6 patients treated with RA alone, a complete response by clinical and cytogenetic criteria accompanied a persistently positive RT-PCR assay. This preceded relapse by 1-6 months. RT-PCR for PML/RAR-alpha mRNA provides a more-sensitive test for the t(15;17) than routine cytogenetics or Northern analysis.

This will allow two primary antibodies of the same isotype of IgG and specifically the nuclear antigen bromodeoxyuridine (BRdU) to be evaluated with a cell surface antigen identifier. METHOD: Sequential applications of the APAAP method showed two antigen sites by different dye couplings to a common alkaline phosphatase substrate, producing blue and red reaction products on the same slide. Antigens on different cell populations as well as those in different compartments of the same cell were analysed. The method allowed a surface antigen monoclonal to be revealed first, using an optimal fixative, before alcohol/gluteraldehyde fixation was used to start the second (BRdU) staining sequence. RESULTS: An analysis of double staining of T lymphocyte subsets (CD4 and CD8) showed no significant difference in the order of application of the primaries (n = 10) and no significant difference from their corresponding single stain results (n = 50), confirming the validity of the technique where antigens are exclusively distributed. Other examples, including antigens distributed in different compartments of the same cell, displayed discrete staining which implied validity. CONCLUSION: Double staining by APAAP with this technique seems to be applicable to those cases where antigens are exclusively distributed and includes cases where different compartments of the same cell are stained. It is especially useful in revealing antigens that require different fixation and preparation--that is DNA incorporated BRdU with a surface antigen. But it does seem to have a limited ability to produce a dual colour at a common site.","['Burgess, R', 'Hyde, K', 'Maguire, P J', 'Kelsey, P R', 'Yin, J A', 'Geary, C G']","['Burgess R', 'Hyde K', 'Maguire PJ', 'Kelsey PR', 'Yin JA', 'Geary CG']","['University Department of Clinical Laboratory Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Oxford.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Male', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.45.3.206 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1992 Mar;45(3):206-9. doi: 10.1136/jcp.45.3.206.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,PMC495471,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All cases were classified according to the criteria of the FAB group and immunophenotyped with a panel of monoclonal antibodies reactive with myeloid and lymphoid differentiation antigens. DNA analysis was performed by the method of Southern using probes for the Ig JH, TCR-C beta 1, and TCR-J tau 1 regions. RESULTS: Phenotypic analysis showed that in addition to myeloid markers, 10 cases expressed lymphoid antigens: CD7 in seven (of which three were TdT positive, one CD2 positive, and one CD19 positive) and CD19 in three. Southern blot analysis showed that bands with sizes different from the germ line control were present in the TCR beta genes in 11 cases: in six of 30 with pure myeloid phenotype and in five of 10 of those expressing lymphoid markers. A close observation of the size and patterns of those bands, however, showed that they could be artefactual. Indeed, further analysis showed that they were either due to resistant Eco RI/Hind III sites at the beta locus or to plasmid contamination. Rearranged genes were eventually found in only two of the 40 cases: at the Ig JH region in one of the 30 with pure myeloid phenotype (3.3%) and at the TCR gamma genes in one of 10 with lymphoid markers (10%). CONCLUSIONS: These observations showed that Ig/TCR gene rearrangements were rare in this AML series (overall incidence of 5%) and that they were not significantly more common in cases with aberrant expression of lymphoid markers. The size and pattern of the potential non-germline bands that can be found in these loci must be carefully evaluated.","['Parreira, L', 'Carvalho, C', 'Moura, H', 'Melo, A', 'Santos, P', 'Guimaraes, J E', 'Parreira, A']","['Parreira L', 'Carvalho C', 'Moura H', 'Melo A', 'Santos P', 'Guimaraes JE', 'Parreira A']","['Instituto de Histologia e Embriologia da Faculdade de Medicina Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.45.3.193 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1992 Mar;45(3):193-200. doi: 10.1136/jcp.45.3.193.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,PMC495467,,,,,,,,,,

A review of their uses in selected immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases.,6-14,"Intravenous immune globulin (IGIV) was introduced a decade ago as a therapy for primary immunodeficiency diseases. It proved to be a valuable therapeutic substance for this purpose and is now considered to be the treatment of choice. The intent was to supply ubiquitous anti-infectious agent antibodies through passive immunisation to replace deficient circulating antibody content. During such therapy, unexpected benefits were noted in thrombocytopenic patients. Since that time, the therapeutic indications for IGIV infusions have greatly increased, with a particular interest in infectious, haematological and autoimmune diseases. This review summarises the status of IGIV therapy in haematological diseases within the categories of primary immunodeficiency diseases, secondary immunodeficiency states and autoimmune syndromes. The majority of firm data have been gathered on the treatment of patients with primary immunodeficiency disease. These data are reviewed from the aspect of anticipated therapeutic response and side effects. Emphasis should be placed on the IgG circulating blood levels as there is a need for individualizing therapy because of marked interindividual patient variation. The use of IGIV therapy in primary and secondary immunodeficiency states should consider the potential benefits to be attained in haematological malignancies and related complications which may be magnified by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The mode of action of IGIV in autoimmune diseases, although not yet precisely determined, may involve establishing reticuloendothelial blockade or immunomodulation by supplying anti-idiotype antibodies.","['Pirofsky, B', 'Kinzey, D M']","['Pirofsky B', 'Kinzey DM']","['Department of Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199243010-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1992 Jan;43(1):6-14. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199243010-00002.,"['0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",,,78,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of altering the ionic environment of murine L5178Y lymphoblasts was investigated in order to determine not only the direct effects of hydrogen and calcium ions on these transport systems, but also the indirect effects of agents or modulators known to alter intracellular calcium. Melphalan transport followed a bell-shaped distribution curve over a pH range from 3 to 9 with a pH optimum of 4.3 and 4.6 for transport by systems ASC and L, respectively. Those agents that could cause a decrease in cytosolic calcium such as the calcium channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem and nitrendipine, the calcium chelator (ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethylether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and reduction of pH were found to augment melphalan uptake, whereas conditions that would elevate intracellular calcium such as the calcium ionophore A23187, the calcium channel agonist (-) Bay K 8644, elevation of extracellular calcium and the calcium pump inhibitor trifluoperazine were all found to decrease melphalan uptake.

As S-phase--specific drugs, such as the inhibitors of DNA synthesis, only reach the cycling part of their target populations, dormant cells are left mainly unaffected. Their survival, however, is largely responsible for later disease relapse. This paper reports experiments that show that cell kinetic manipulations by hematopoietic growth factors may help to overcome the problem of cytokinetic and pharmacologic resistance. Hematopoietic growth factors synergize with inhibitors of DNA synthesis given at low doses to induce a more mature phenotype or to enhance leukemia cell kill when combined with high doses of DNA inhibitors.

To analyse normal B-cells representative of different stages of activation and proliferation in vivo, we purified germinal centre (GC)-B blasts and mantle B (M-B) cells from tonsils. To compare malignant B lymphocytes with their closest normal equivalent cells, we separated malignant CD5+B lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and normal CD5+B lymphocytes from cord blood. The expression of interleukins (IL) IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 genes was analysed using Northern and Western blotting techniques. TNF-alpha mRNA is produced by resting (M-B) and actively proliferating (GC-B) normal B lymphocytes. TGF-beta mRNA is present at high levels in resting normal M-B cells, while the transcript levels are lower in proliferating GC-B and in activated CD5+B lymphocytes. IL-2 production is limited to the actively proliferating GC-B blasts, IL-1 beta and IL-6 to resting M-B cells. The cytokine production profile of CD5+ malignant B-CLL cells differs from that of their putative normal counterparts and is more like the profile of M-B cells, since B-CLL cells produce IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, and IL-6. These observations lead to the following conclusions: among normal B lymphocyte populations, resting M-B lymphocytes are the most active cytokine producers, and B-CLL malignant B cells reflect the production pattern of normal resting B lymphocytes.","['Schena, M', 'Gaidano, G', 'Gottardi, D', 'Malavasi, F', 'Larsson, L G', 'Nilsson, K', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F']","['Schena M', 'Gaidano G', 'Gottardi D', 'Malavasi F', 'Larsson LG', 'Nilsson K', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Sezione Clinica, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Interleukin-4/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/blood/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Feb;6(2):120-5.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The culture medium contained either fetal bovine or human serum from normal donors. CFU-L recovery after 7 days was compared to that observed in control cultures. Of AML cases and HL60 cells, 11/15 displayed greater than 50% CFU-L reduction in response to one or more inducers. In 8/9 responsive cases that underwent the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test, an increase in the percentage of functionally mature (NBT-positive) cells was detected. The combination of retinoic acid with interferon gamma was most effective in reducing CFU-L recovering (8 responsive/15 AML cases), G-CSF and M-CSF displayed either inhibitory or stimulatory activity in different AML cases. The type of serum employed generally did not affect the response to inducers of differentiation. No significant inhibition of the recovery of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units was determined by the five inducers in experiments with three normal bone marrow samples.

The murine cell line NFS-60 was found to respond well to rcG-CSF and the human cell line TALL-101 to rcGM-CSF, and these responses were neutralized by antibodies to these recombinant proteins.

Sciatic nerve extract, a rich source of CNTF, increased levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P, and somatostatin severalfold while significantly reducing levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY). No change was observed in the levels of leu-enkephalin (L-Enk). These effects were abolished by immunoprecipitation of CNTF-like molecules from the extract with an antiserum raised against recombinant CNTF, and recombinant CNTF caused changes in neuropeptide levels similar to those of sciatic nerve extract. Alterations in neuropeptide levels by CNTF were dose-dependent, with maximal induction at concentrations of 5-25 ng/ml. Peptide levels were altered after only 3 days of CNTF exposure and continued to change for 14 days. Depolarization of sympathetic neuron cultures with elevated potassium elicited a different spectrum of effects; it increased VIP and NPY content but did not alter substance P, somatostatin, or L-Enk. Depolarization is known to block cholinergic induction in response to heart cell conditioned medium and we found that it blocked the induction of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and peptides by recombinant cholinergic differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor (CDF/LIF). In contrast, it did not antagonize the effects of CNTF on either ChAT activity or neuropeptide expression. Thus, while CNTF has effects on neurotransmitter properties similar to those previously reported for CDF/LIF, the actions of these two factors are differentially modulated by depolarization, suggesting that the mechanisms of cholinergic and neuropeptide induction for the two factors differ. In addition, in contrast to CDF/LIF, CNTF did not alter levels of ChAT, VIP, substance P, or somatostatin in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons. These observations indicate that CNTF and depolarization affect the expression of neuropeptides by sympathetic neurons and provide evidence for an overlapping yet distinct spectrum of actions of the two neuronal differentiation factors, CNTF and CDF/LIF.","['Rao, M S', 'Tyrrell, S', 'Landis, S C', 'Patterson, P H']","['Rao MS', 'Tyrrell S', 'Landis SC', 'Patterson PH']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']",['eng'],"['GM 07250/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 25681/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Enkephalin, Leucine/metabolism', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*physiology', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic/*physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/drug effects/*physiology', 'Neurons, Afferent/drug effects/*physiology', 'Neuropeptide Y/metabolism', 'Neuropeptides/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sciatic Nerve/*physiology', 'Somatostatin/metabolism', 'Substance P/metabolism', 'Tissue Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/metabolism']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0012-1606(92)90242-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0012-1606(92)90242-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1992 Apr;150(2):281-93. doi: 10.1016/0012-1606(92)90242-9.,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tissue Extracts)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', '58822-25-6 (Enkephalin, Leucine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CYL2 is considered to encode a D-type cyclin because (i) there is cross hybridization with CYL1 (a murine homolog of human cyclin D1) and the encoded protein has 64% amino acid sequence identity with CYL1 and (ii) murine erythroleukemia cell-derived CYL2 contains an amino acid sequence identical to that previously reported for the C-terminal portion of a partially sequenced CYL2. Transcripts of murine erythroleukemia cell CYL2 undergo alternative polyadenylylation like that of human cyclin D1. A major 6.5-kilobase CYL2 transcript changes its expression during the cell cycle with a broad peak through G1 and S phases and a decrease in G2/M phases.

This view has been tested in our studies of the mechanism of recombination within homologous sequences of two retroviral genomes during a single round of virus replication and in the absence of helper virus. The recombination substrates were Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vectors, each of which contains an altered defective neomycin gene (neo) under the transcriptional control of the 5' long terminal repeat; the 3' sequences of each construct contain either the Moloney murine leukemia virus or simian virus 40 large-T polyadenylation sequence. One neo gene contained a linker insertion mutation at the 5' end (neo minus), and the other contained a deletion and linker insertion at the 3' end (neo delta 3). Each of the mutant neo constructs was introduced into the packaging helper cell line psi 2 by sequential cotransfection, and individual psi 2 double transformants were selected. Supernatant fluids from the cloned psi 2 double transformants were used to infect NIH 3T3 cells, and recombinant neo+ proviruses were detected by their ability to confer G418 resistance during infection of NIH 3T3 cells. Our results show that (i) recombination between a homologous sequence of about 560 bp occurred with a frequency of about 10(-4) per virus replication cycle; (ii) recombination occurred only after the viral RNAs had been packaged into particles, i.e., recombination between the two vector DNAs or between viral RNAs prior to packaging was not detected; and (iii) copackaging of two different genomic RNAs as a heterodimer is a prerequisite for recombination. Furthermore, our results indicate that recombination can occur during the DNA negative-strand synthesis of reverse transcription.","['Stuhlmann, H', 'Berg, P']","['Stuhlmann H', 'Berg P']","['Department of Biochemistry, Beckman Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305-5307.']",['eng'],['GM-13235-24/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial/genetics', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.4.2378-2388.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Apr;66(4):2378-88. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.4.2378-2388.1992.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",,['neo'],,PMC289033,,,,,,,,,,

The synthetic peptides, representing the entire HIV-1 p17 protein sequence were: HGP-33 (aa 1-33), HGP-19 (aa 34-52), HGP-35 (aa 51-85), HGP-30 (aa 85-114), and HGP-17 ala (aa 114-131). The presence of one or more peptide-specific antibodies in the sera of all of the HIV-1 p17-positive subjects indicated that all five peptides contain B-cell epitopes. No antibodies were found in the sera of heterosexual controls, HIV-1 seronegative high-risk men, or asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositive but p17 antibody-negative study subjects. Significant differences in antibody recognition profiles to the peptide epitopes were found among the various study groups. A significantly higher proportion of HIV-1 seropositive IVDA had antibodies specific to HGP-17 ala (aa 114-131), HGP-35 (aa 51-85), and HGP-33 (aa 1-33) compared to the HIV-1 p17-positive asymptomatic homosexuals. The epitope-specific antibody responses reflected the clinical status of the HIV-1-infected study subjects, and declined to nondetectable levels as the patient progressed to ARC/AIDS.

One might also speculate that the more widespread, common-place and 'normal' a chemical exposure is perceived to be then the less likely it will be that the exposure is recognised, let alone be considered to cause cancer. Widespread contamination of air by chemicals associated with internal combustion may be an example of one such 'invisible' carcinogenic exposure. Yet evidence is available which suggests that many leukaemia and lymphoma cases, as well as other cancers, may be caused by this mundane and ubiquitous environmental contamination.

We now show that the expression of the HOX 2.2 gene decreases during erythropoietin-induced differentiation of the erythroid cell line MB02. In order to study the role of the HOX 2.2 homeobox gene in hematopoiesis, vectors producing sense or antisense transcripts were introduced into K562 and HEL cells, pluripotent lines with erythroid and myeloid features. Overexpression of HOX 2.2 is associated with loss of erythroid features in both lines and an increase in certain myelomonocytic markers in K562 cells. Expression of antisense HOX 2.2 is associated with an increase in erythroid features in HEL cells and a mild decrease in myeloid characteristics in K562 cells. Overexpression of the adjacent HOX 2.1 gene in K562 cells does not produce similar phenotype changes. These data demonstrate that modulation of a specific HOX 2 homeobox gene can change the phenotype of somatic cells and suggest that certain HOX 2 genes play a role in blood cell differentiation.","['Shen, W F', 'Detmer, K', 'Mathews, C H', 'Hack, F M', 'Morgan, D A', 'Largman, C', 'Lawrence, H J']","['Shen WF', 'Detmer K', 'Mathews CH', 'Hack FM', 'Morgan DA', 'Largman C', 'Lawrence HJ']","['Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, CA 94121.']",['eng'],['CA 47866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Globins/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Heme/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', '*Phenotype', 'RNA/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1992 Mar;11(3):983-9.,"['42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,"['HOX2.1', 'HOX2.2']",,PMC556539,,,,,,,,,,

We provide direct evidence for the internalization of T101 MoAb and the corresponding IT. Both the MoAb and IT were internalized at a relatively low rate. This slow internalization process could be related to the partial recycling of the MoAb/Ag or IT/Ag complexes. Analysis of the internalized molecules showed that their molecular weight was only partially altered after internalization and that no free A-chain could be found inside the cells, indicating that lysosomal degradation and cleavage of disulfide-linked conjugates is a quantitatively minor phenomenon compared with the localization of internalized anti-CD5 ITs in an endosomo-Golgi compartment, followed by their recycling to the cell surface. We believe that this is the major factor explaining the low efficacy of anti-CD5 IT when assayed in the absence of potentiating substances. Finally, we showed that the presence of ammonium chloride and monensin, which both dramatically enhance the kinetics of IT activity, did not affect the rate of internalization or the intracellular localization of the conjugate, suggesting that these activators could act at the postendocytotic level on a limited number of IT molecules.","['Ravel, S', 'Colombatti, M', 'Casellas, P']","['Ravel S', 'Colombatti M', 'Casellas P']","['Department of Immunology, Sanofi Recherche, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Ricin/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/ultrastructure']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73710-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Mar 15;79(6):1511-7.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to confirm the previous result, we extended the cases and compared the PO activities in blood films taken from several leukemic subjects, which were fixed with various kinds of fixatives, using DAB and 3AC as substrates. Their peroxidase activities were also determined through electron microscopy (EM-PO). There were no differences among fixatives and substrates in staining normal granulocytic cells (neutrophils and monocytes) and cells in 13 cases of leukemia, except for two cases, one with M4 and the other with relapse of M2. These showed the highest PO activity with 3AC staining and 10% formaldehyde acetone buffer for fixation. Besides, all types manifested the highest positivity in EM-PO, except for the relapse of M2 that showed a higher positivity in the peroxidase stain by 3AC staining, 10% formaldehyde acetone buffer fixation than the EM-PO. Unlike other leukemic blasts PO reaction products of blast cells of the two cases showed a scattered distribution of microscopic granules. These findings suggested the difference, which was seen in the previous reports, of the PO stain between two substrates might be due not only to sensitivity for staining but to the presence of some heterogeneity such as isoenzyme in the myeloperoxidase.","['Okano, K', 'Yonehara, Y', 'Matsumura, K', 'Noriyasu, H', 'Araki, M', 'Yamamoto, K']","['Okano K', 'Yonehara Y', 'Matsumura K', 'Noriyasu H', 'Araki M', 'Yamamoto K']","['School of Allied Health Sciences, Yamaguchi University, Ube.']",['jpn'],,"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

We report here that stimulation of platelets by cross-linking antibodies to Fc gamma RII or by treatment with an anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody, which acts through Fc gamma RII, causes an induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple platelet proteins. Although the profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced by stimulation of this Fc receptor was similar to that induced by thrombin, an additional 40-kDa phosphorylated protein was also detected. This protein co-migrated with Fc gamma RII and was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to Fc gamma RII. In addition, after the cross-linking of Fc gamma RII in HEL cells or in COS-1 cells transfected with Fc gamma RII cDNA, the 40-kDa protein immunoprecipitated with anti-Fc gamma RII was also phosphorylated on tyrosine. These data strongly suggest that Fc gamma RII itself is a substrate for a tyrosine kinase(s) activated when Fc gamma RII is stimulated. Fc gamma RII was phosphorylated by the Src protein in vitro, suggesting that this kinase may be responsible for phosphorylation of Fc gamma RII in vivo. These studies establish that activation of platelets and human erythroleukemia cells through Fc gamma RII and CD9 involves an induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins including Fc gamma RII itself and suggest that these phosphorylation events may be involved in Fc gamma RII-mediated cell signaling.","['Huang, M M', 'Indik, Z', 'Brass, L F', 'Hoxie, J A', 'Schreiber, A D', 'Brugge, J S']","['Huang MM', 'Indik Z', 'Brass LF', 'Hoxie JA', 'Schreiber AD', 'Brugge JS']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['AI22193/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA27951/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL40387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/blood', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', '*Platelet Aggregation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*blood', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42789-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Mar 15;267(8):5467-73.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for a novel signal transduction pathway unrelated to G protein activation and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis.,5434-41,"Recently, we demonstrated that aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells results in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a 72-kDa protein (pp72). Here we investigated the relationship of pp72 phosphorylation to guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) activation and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. The activation of G proteins by NaF in intact cells or by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) in streptolysin O-permeabilized cells induced both phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and histamine release without tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72. Similarly, in RBL-2H3 cells expressing the G protein-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, carbachol activated phospholipase C and induced secretion without concomitant pp72 phosphorylation. Therefore, pp72 phosphorylation was not induced by G protein activation or as a consequence of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. To investigate whether pp72 tyrosine phosphorylation precedes the activation of phospholipase C, we studied the effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Preincubation of cells with genistein decreased, in parallel, antigen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72 (IC50 = 34 micrograms/ml) and histamine release (IC50 = 31 micrograms/ml). However, genistein at concentrations of up to 60 micrograms/ml did not inhibit phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis nor did it change the amount of the secondary messenger inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate.

The resulting cloned cells showed deficiencies of both DAF and GPI-anchored CD59, some (designated group A) exhibiting total absence and some (designated group B) exhibiting approximately 10% levels of surface expression of the two proteins. In heterologous cell fusions, group A clones complemented defective Thy-1 expression by class A, B, C, E, and I Thy-1-negative lymphoma lines, but not H or D lines, the latter of which is defective in the Thy-1 structural gene. In contrast, group B clones complemented all previously described GPI anchor pathway-defective lymphoma classes. Immunoradiomatic assays of cells and supernatants and 35S biosynthetic labeling showed that group A cells degraded DAF protein while group B cells secreted it but failed to attach a GPI anchor structure. [3H]Man labeling of intact cells and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc and GDP-[3H]Man labeling of broken cell preparations demonstrated that group A cells failed to synthesize GlcNAc- and GlcN-PI (GPI-A and -B) as well as more polar mannolipids, whereas group B cells showed accumulation of GlcNAc-PI with approximately 10-fold diminished levels of GlcN-PI and more polar mannolipids. The failed assembly of GlcNAc-PI in group A cells and the reduced conversion of this intermediate to GlcN-PI in group B cells indicates that the former harbors a defect in UDP-GlcNAc transferase or in assembly of its PI acceptor, while the latter harbors a defect in GlcN-PI deacetylase activity.","['Hirose, S', 'Mohney, R P', 'Mutka, S C', 'Ravi, L', 'Singleton, D R', 'Perry, G', 'Tartakoff, A M', 'Medof, M E']","['Hirose S', 'Mohney RP', 'Mutka SC', 'Ravi L', 'Singleton DR', 'Perry G', 'Tartakoff AM', 'Medof ME']","['Institute of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],['P01DK38181/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'CD55 Antigens', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Glycolipids/*metabolism', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols', 'Guanosine Diphosphate Mannose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Lymphoma', 'Mannose/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Tritium', 'Uridine Diphosphate N-Acetylglucosamine/metabolism']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42762-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Mar 15;267(8):5272-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '3123-67-9 (Guanosine Diphosphate Mannose)', '528-04-1 (Uridine Diphosphate N-Acetylglucosamine)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the monoclonal antibody MRK-20 was found to be reactive to human peripheral mononuclear cells. In order to investigate the molecular function of the 85-kDa protein, we carried out flow cytometric analysis of the expression of the 85-kDa protein during monocytic differentiation of the hematopoietic cells. Human myelomonocytic leukemia THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate into macrophage-like cells by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). A maximum of 55% of the cells expressed the 85-kDa protein along with the CD-14 antigen, which is a surface marker of monocytes and macrophages. The kinetic analysis revealed that the 85-kDa protein appeared prior to the expression of the CD-14 antigen. The 85-kDa protein was also coexpressed with CD-14 in THP-1 cells that were induced to differentiate by recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which is one of the physiological inducers of monocytic differentiation. In human erythroleukemia, HEL cells, the 85-kDa protein was constitutively coexpressed with CD-14. The expression of both the 85-kDa protein and CD-14 was drastically reduced during the megakaryocytic differentiation of the HEL cells with TPA. These results suggest that the 85-kDa protein could be expressed on monocytic cells as well as CD-14 and that the expression of the 85-kDa protein might be regulated at an earlier stage of monocytic differentiation of hematopoietic cells than the expression of CD-14.","['Ishii, S', 'Naito, M', 'Masuda, M', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Ishii S', 'Naito M', 'Masuda M', 'Tsuruo T']","['Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1992.tb02359.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1992 Jan;83(1):107-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1992.tb02359.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,PMC5918650,,,,,,,,,,

CD34 reactivity was also evaluated in nine chronic leukemia cases, 27 malignant lymphoma cases (Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), six normal bone marrow specimens, and three benign, hyperplastic lymph node specimens. All cases that were CD34 positive by flow cytometry (11 of 19 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases, one of six T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases, and seven of 21 acute myeloblastic leukemia cases) were also CD34 positive in paraffin sections. Both cell membrane and cytoplasmic staining was seen. The positivity percentage and fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry correlated with the estimated number of stained cells and the intensity of immunoperoxidase staining in 18 of 19 CD34-positive cases. The remaining bone marrow and lymph node cases studied were CD34 negative; prominent endothelial cell staining, however, was noted. This is the first report of anti-CD34 staining of acute leukemia in paraffin-embedded sections.

This stimulatory effect was further enhanced by dexamethasone. alpha 1-Microglobulin is synthesized as a precursor also containing bikunin, and the precursor protein is cleaved shortly before secretion. Our results therefore suggest that both alpha 1-microglobulin and bikunin are acute phase reactants in rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, we found that retinoic acid, previously shown to be involved in the regulation of cell differentiation and development, also stimulated alpha 1-microglobulin synthesis. Only free, uncomplexed alpha 1-microglobulin (28,000 Da) was detected in the hepatocyte media, suggesting that the complex between alpha 1-microglobulin and alpha 1-inhibitor 3, found in rat serum, is formed outside the hepatocyte.","['Pierzchalski, P', 'Rokita, H', 'Koj, A', 'Fries, E', 'Akerstrom, B']","['Pierzchalski P', 'Rokita H', 'Koj A', 'Fries E', 'Akerstrom B']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['Alpha-Globulins/*biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1992/02/24 00:00,1992/02/24 00:01,['1992/02/24 00:00'],"['1992/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-5793(92)80047-K [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(92)80047-k [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1992 Feb 24;298(2-3):165-8. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(92)80047-k.,"['0 (Alpha-Globulins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (alpha-1-microglobulin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 44 of 62 patients CSA was maximum approximately 7 days after chemotherapy/radiotherapy, whereas in 18 of 62 patients CSA was maximum between 9 and 20 days after therapy and decreased thereafter. The time course of CSA was not dependent on disease and was not affected by recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) given as a continuous infusion for 14 days after therapy; however, serum from patients receiving rhGM-CSF produced significantly more colonies from donor bone marrow than serum from patients who did not receive the cytokine (p = 0.013). Despite the early peak in CSA in the majority of patients, there was no correlation between the time at which CSA was maximum and the return of patients' neutrophils to 500/microliters. Recombinant human interleukin 4 (IL-4) increased the number of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit colonies, principally granulocyte colony-forming unit colonies, from normal bone marrow exposed to patients' serum after intensive therapy and antibody to GM-CSF reduced colony numbers.

Active virus (either free or within infected cells) was quantified by using a limiting dilution assay that involved cocultivation of test samples with naive 3201 cells, after which either the polymerase chain reaction or a reverse transcriptase assay was used to detect the presence of virus. It was shown that 61E-infected T cells in culture were slightly more sensitive to photodynamic killing than were uninfected cells.

Therefore, we examined KIT mRNA expression in normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) and used antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (oligomers) to disrupt KIT function. KIT mRNA was detected with certainty only in growth factor-stimulated MNC. Expression was essentially abrogated by making MNC quiescent or by inhibiting myb gene function. Oligomers blocked KIT mRNA expression in a dose-response and sequence-specific manner, thereby allowing functional examination of the KIT receptor. In experiments with either partially purified or CD34(+)-enriched MNC, neither granulocyte nor megakaryocyte colony formation was inhibited by oligomer exposure. In contrast, KIT antisense oligomers inhibited interleukin 3/erythropoietin-driven erythroid colony formation approximately 70% and ""stem cell factor""/erythropoietin-driven colony formation 100%. The presence of erythroid progenitor cell subsets with differential requirements for KIT function is therefore suggested. Growth of hematopoietic colonies from chronic myeloid leukemia and polycythemia vera patients was also inhibited, while acute leukemia colony growth appeared less sensitive to KIT deprivation. These results suggest that KIT plays a predominant role in normal erythropoiesis but may be important in regulating some types of malignant hematopoietic cell growth as well. They also suggest that KIT expression is linked to cell metabolic activity and that its expression may be regulated by or coregulated with MYB.","['Ratajczak, M Z', 'Luger, S M', 'DeRiel, K', 'Abrahm, J', 'Calabretta, B', 'Gewirtz, A M']","['Ratajczak MZ', 'Luger SM', 'DeRiel K', 'Abrahm J', 'Calabretta B', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['CA 54384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA01324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Base Sequence', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Gene Expression', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Antisense', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.5.1710 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Mar 1;89(5):1710-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.5.1710.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,PMC48522,,,,,,,,,,

OM acted in a dose-dependent fashion (ED50 5 to 10 ng/ml) in stimulating APP synthesis in human HepG2 cells, rat H35 cells, and primary rat hepatocyte cultures, but not human Hep3B cells. Human OM induced equivalent to or greater responses than IL-6 in HepG2 cells, however, it was less effective than human IL-6 in stimulating rat cells. Northern analysis showed that OM stimulated mRNA levels of haptoglobin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin in HepG2 cells. OM induced CAT activity in HepG2 cells transfected with CAT constructs containing IL-6-responsive elements, suggesting that OM induces transcription of native proteins through mechanisms involving IL-6-responsive element-like sequences in gene promoters. OM was also shown to act additively with IL-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor and synergistically with glucocorticoid or IL-1 in the induction of specific APP.

It was first identified with mAb 44G4, produced against the pre-B acute lymphoblastic HOON cell line. We now report that four mAbs independently produced against human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, or U-937 pro-monocytic cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate also react with endoglin. High levels of reactivity of all mAbs were observed with HUVEC, while intermediate levels were seen with HOON and U-937 cells. By sequential immunoprecipitation from HUVEC and U-937 cell extracts, it was established that RMAC8, HEC-19, 8E11, and 1G2 mAbs react with the same protein as 44G4. Three distinct epitopes recognized by 44G4, RMAC8, and 1G2 mAbs were identified by competitive radioimmunoassay and flow cytometry. The HEC-19 epitope is spatially related to the 44G4 epitope, whereas the 8E11 epitope is most closely related to the 1G2 epitope. Western blot analysis showed that all antibodies react with the endoglin dimer (Mr = 170,000) purified from placenta. Immunostaining of sections of full-term placenta revealed reactivity not only with fetal vessels but also with the syncytiotrophoblast, the fetal cell layer which interfaces with maternal blood. When HUVEC monolayers were treated with the different mAbs to endoglin, prior to incubation with U-937 cells, a 5- to 10-fold stimulation of adhesion was observed. A fibronectin hexapeptide containing RGD, but not the corresponding RGE peptide, was capable of inhibiting the increased adhesion, when tested with mAb 44G4 and RMAC8. However, the same peptides had no effect on the binding of any of the five anti-endoglin mAbs to cells. Since 44G4 and RMAC8 recognize two distinct epitopes of endoglin, and since all five mAbs stimulated adhesion, the results suggest that a signal has been triggered through endoglin on HUVECs. Endoglin might be implicated either directly, by binding to a specific integrin-like ligand, or indirectly, by regulating the level of adhesion between certain integrins and their receptors.","['Gougos, A', 'St Jacques, S', 'Greaves, A', ""O'Connell, P J"", ""d'Apice, A J"", 'Buhring, H J', 'Bernabeu, C', 'van Mourik, J A', 'Letarte, M']","['Gougos A', 'St Jacques S', 'Greaves A', ""O'Connell PJ"", ""d'Apice AJ"", 'Buhring HJ', 'Bernabeu C', 'van Mourik JA', 'Letarte M']","['Division of Immunology and Cancer Research, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Endoglin', 'Endothelium, Vascular/immunology', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Trophoblasts/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology', '*Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/4.1.83 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1992 Jan;4(1):83-92. doi: 10.1093/intimm/4.1.83.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (ENG protein, human)', '0 (Endoglin)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using recombinant env proteins and synthetic peptides as mapping antigens, it was determined that the most immunogenic region represented a central portion of the retroviral surface protein (domain 2; amino acids 165 to 191). However, only a single MAb was able to react strongly with native viral proteins. This antibody (clone 6C2) was directed to an epitope within domain 4 (amino acids 210 to 306) of the retroviral env gene and reacted with envelope proteins in both HTLV-I and HTLV-II, as determined by immunoprecipitation, solid-phase binding, and immunoblotting. No reactivity against envelope components of other human retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, was present. Flow cytometry data demonstrated that MAb 6C2 reacted with cell lines chronically infected with HTLV-I or HTLV-II and also with surface antigens expressed on fresh adult T-cell leukemia cells, following up-regulation with interleukin-2. By a chemiluminescence immunoassay procedure, picogram amounts of viral surface protein could be detected in the unconcentrated supernatants of HTLV-infected cell lines and in diagnostic cultures. Levels of env and gag proteins released by cells into culture supernatants were not directly related to percent expression of cell surface viral-coat proteins. Further, the molar ratio of p19 to gp46 in conditioned media varied from strain to strain, possibly reflecting differences in viral assembly or packaging mechanisms. MAb 6C2 will be of value in characterizing the biochemical and immunological behavior of retroviral env gene proteins and in studying the interaction of HTLV-I and HTLV-II with their receptors.","['Papsidero, L D', 'Dittmer, R P', 'Vaickus, L', 'Poiesz, B J']","['Papsidero LD', 'Dittmer RP', 'Vaickus L', 'Poiesz BJ']","['Cellular Products, Inc., Buffalo, New York.']",['eng'],"['N01HB67021/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL43602/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/*analysis/genetics', 'Epitopes/genetics', 'Gene Products, env/*analysis/genetics/*immunology', 'Genes, env', 'HTLV-I Antigens/analysis/genetics', 'HTLV-II Antigens/analysis/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/*methods', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/genetics/immunology']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jcm.30.2.351-358.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1992 Feb;30(2):351-8. doi: 10.1128/jcm.30.2.351-358.1992.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (HTLV-II Antigens)', '0 (Peptides)']",,['env'],,PMC265059,,,,,,,,,,

The events resulting in tumour cell killing by lymphocytic effectors have not been completely clarified, and the same target cell determinants regulating responsiveness to immune cytolysis have not yet been identified. Indeed, changes in the differentiative status of leukemia cells as well as in the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens have been described to modulate sensitivity to cytotoxic effectors; moreover surface expression of adhesion factors or extracellular matrix proteins by the cancer cells can promote the activation of the cytolytic effectors and has been described to correlate with tumour cell sensitivity to cytolytic cells. We reasoned that treatment with differentiation inducers could modulate melanoma cell sensitivity to NK and LAK cells. The present study demonstrates that human melanoma GLL-19 cells, when treated with the phorbol diester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in vitro, undergo growth inhibition and neuron-like differentiation. Moreover, PMA treatment induces an evident inhibition of GLL-19 cell sensitivity to NK- and LAK-mediated cytotoxicity. GLL-19 cells express constitutively MHC class I antigens. PMA treatment, however, does not modify the expression of MHC class I and class II DR antigens in human melanoma GLL-19 cells. We have finally evaluated the effects of PMA on the expression at the cell surface of adhesion factors such as ICAM-1, and extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen IV, laminin and fibronectin; we have also studied the expression of the integrin vitronectin receptor, a membrane receptor for adhesive proteins. While adhesion factors and extracellular matrix proteins appear to play an important role in the interaction between immune effector and tumour target, it can be supposed that the modulation of such membrane-associated proteins or glycoproteins induces NK and LAK resistance in cancer cells. We indeed found that PMA treatment induced in GLL-19 a marked reduction of membrane expression of collagen IV and ICAM-1; moreover PMA reduced the cell membrane expression of the integrin vitronectin receptor. On the other hand, membrane expression of fibronectin and laminin was not affected by PMA. These data indicate that the acquisition of a NK- and LAK-resistant phenotype by GLL-19 cells occurs together with cell differentiation, down-regulation of membrane expression of collagen IV, ICAM-1 and vitronectin receptor, but in the absence of changes in MHC antigens.","['Correale, P', 'Procopio, A', 'Celio, L', 'Caraglia, M', 'Genua, G', 'Coppola, V', 'Pepe, S', 'Normanno, N', 'Vecchio, I', 'Palmieri, G']","['Correale P', 'Procopio A', 'Celio L', 'Caraglia M', 'Genua G', 'Coppola V', 'Pepe S', 'Normanno N', 'Vecchio I', 'Palmieri G', 'et al.']","['Cattedra di Oncologia Medica, II Facolta di Medicina, Universita Federico II di Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Polarity/drug effects', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Melanoma/*immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vitronectin', 'S100 Proteins/metabolism', 'Synaptophysin/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01741796 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1992;34(4):272-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01741796.,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Vitronectin)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (Synaptophysin)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate mechanisms of c-myc dysregulation in AML cells, we studied c-myc RNA turnover in peripheral blood blasts from eight patients using actinomycin D transcription blockade. Rapid c-myc RNA turnover was seen in cells from six patients, with half-lives of approximately 30 minutes, similar to those reported in normal myeloid cells, in HL-60 cells, and in other cell lines. c-myc RNA turnover was prolonged in cells of the other two patients, with half-lives of greater than 75 minutes. c-fos RNA turnover was rapid in blasts from all eight patients, with half-lives of approximately 15 minutes. Stabilization of GM-CSF transcripts was not observed. In contrast, c-myb RNA half-lives were greater than 75 minutes in cells of the two patients with prolonged c-myc RNA turnover, as compared to 30 minutes in cells of the other six patients. Enhanced stability of both c-myc and c-myb RNA species suggests that a defect exists in a trans-acting factor that destabilizes both of these normally labile RNAs.

Using a mouse G-CSF receptor probe, we cloned and sequenced a cDNA for hGCSFR from an HL-60 cDNA library in plasmid and used it to identify 31 additional clones from an HL-60 cDNA library in phage. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the 31 phage clones established that 29 were derived from class I hGCSFR mRNA, one was derived from class III mRNA, and one was derived from class IV mRNA. In addition, the hGCSFR gene was chromosomally localized by Southern blot analysis of its segregation pattern in a panel of rodent-human hybrid DNAs using the radiolabeled cDNA probe. The hGCSFR locus was present in hybrids retaining the distal short arm of human chromosome 1 and absent in hybrids that did not retain this region.

Jurkat. Substances that elevate the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), such as ionomycin or the mitogenic lectin phytohemagglutinin (PHA), as well as whole-cell dialysis with pipette solutions containing elevated [Ca2+]i, activate a voltage-independent K+ conductance. Unlike the voltage-gated (type n) K+ channels in these cells, the majority of K(Ca) channels are insensitive to block by charybdotoxin (CTX) or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but are highly sensitive to block by apamin (Kd less than 1 nM). Channel activity is strongly dependent on [Ca2+]i, suggesting that multiple Ca2+ binding sites may be involved in channel opening. The Ca2+ concentration at which half of the channels are activated is 400 nM. These channels show little voltage dependence over a potential range of -100 to 0 mV and have a unitary conductance of 4-7 pS in symmetrical 170 mM K+. In the presence of 10 nM apamin, a less prevalent type of K(Ca) channel with a unitary conductance of 40-60 pS can be observed. These larger-conductance channels are sensitive to block by CTX. Pharmacological blockade of K(Ca) channels and voltage-gated type n channels inhibits oscillatory Ca2+ signaling triggered by PHA. These results suggest that K(Ca) channels play a supporting role during T cell activation by sustaining dynamic patterns of Ca2+ signaling.","['Grissmer, S', 'Lewis, R S', 'Cahalan, M D']","['Grissmer S', 'Lewis RS', 'Cahalan MD']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['GM-41514/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-14609/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Gen Physiol,The Journal of general physiology,2985110R,IM,"['4-Aminopyridine/pharmacology', 'Apamin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Charybdotoxin', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Scorpion Venoms/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1085/jgp.99.1.63 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Physiol. 1992 Jan;99(1):63-84. doi: 10.1085/jgp.99.1.63.,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Scorpion Venoms)', '115422-61-2 (Charybdotoxin)', '24345-16-2 (Apamin)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'BH3B64OKL9 (4-Aminopyridine)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,PMC2216598,,,,,,,,,,

A cloned murine leukemia retrovirus with an ecotropic host range (Moloney murine leukemia virus), rendered defective by a large deletion encompassing the three viral gag, pol, and env open reading frames, was marked with this indicator gene and introduced by transfection into heterologous feline cells. No beta-galactosidase activity could be detected among the clonal cell population, unless the defective provirus was complemented in trans by the gag-pol gene products. Under these conditions, cell variants which disclosed an easily detectable nuclear blue coloration upon in situ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside staining were observed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of the beta-galactosidase-positive cells, followed by Southern blot analysis, demonstrated an unambiguous correlation between nlsLacZRT activation and retrotransposition of the marked provirus. Transposition occurs at a high frequency (up to 10(-4) events per cell per generation), which is dependent on the level of expression of the gag-pol gene and is concomitant with the release of noninfectious retroviruslike particles which are the hallmarks, but not the intermediates, of the intracellular transposition process.","['Tchenio, T', 'Heidmann, T']","['Tchenio T', 'Heidmann T']","['Unites de Biochimie-Enzymologie et de Physicochimie Macromoleculaire, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique U147, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/physiology', 'Gene Products, pol/physiology', 'Genes, gag', 'Genes, pol', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Virus Integration', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.3.1571-1578.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Mar;66(3):1571-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.3.1571-1578.1992.,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,,PMC240883,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene expression in FTO-2B rat hepatoma cells was inhibited by treatment with LiCl. Lithium was also able to counteract the increased PEPCK mRNA levels caused by both Bt2cAMP and dexamethasone, in a concentration-dependent manner. A chimeric gene containing the PEPCK promoter (-550 to +73) linked to the amino-3-glycosyl phosphotransferase (neo) structural gene was transduced into FTO-2B cells using a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retrovirus. In these infected cells, 20 mM LiCl decreased both the concentration of neo mRNA transcribed from the PEPCK-neo chimeric gene and mRNA from the endogenous PEPCK gene. Lithium also inhibited the stimulatory effect of Bt2cAMP and dexamethasone on both genes. The stability of neo mRNA was not altered by lithium, since in cells infected with retrovirus containing only the neo gene transcribed via the retroviral 5'-LTR and treated with 20 mM LiCl, no change in neo mRNA levels was observed. The intraperitoneal administration of LiCl to rats caused a decrease in hepatic PEPCK mRNA, indicating that lithium could also modify gene expression in vivo. The effects of lithium were not due to an increase in the concentration of insulin in the blood but were correlated with an increase in hepatic glycogen and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels. These results indicate that lithium ions, at concentrations normally used therapeutically for depression in humans, can inhibit glucose synthesis in the liver by a mechanism which can selectively modify the expression of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.","['Bosch, F', 'Rodriguez-Gil, J E', 'Hatzoglou, M', 'Gomez-Foix, A M', 'Hanson, R W']","['Bosch F', 'Rodriguez-Gil JE', 'Hatzoglou M', 'Gomez-Foix AM', 'Hanson RW']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Veterinary Medicine, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.']",['eng'],"['DK 21859/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 24451/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorides/*pharmacology', 'DNA Probes', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gluconeogenesis/*drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase/metabolism', 'Insulin/blood', 'Kinetics', 'Lithium/blood/*pharmacology', 'Lithium Chloride', 'Liver/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Liver Glycogen/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Male', 'Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP)/*genetics', 'Phosphofructokinase-2', 'Phosphorylase b/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/metabolism', 'Pyruvate Kinase/metabolism', 'RNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Reference Values', 'Theophylline/pharmacology', '*Transfection']",1992/02/15 00:00,1992/02/15 00:01,['1992/02/15 00:00'],"['1992/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)50669-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Feb 15;267(5):2888-93.,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Liver Glycogen)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Phosphorylase b)', 'EC 2.4.1.11 (Glycogen Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.105 (Phosphofructokinase-2)', 'EC 2.7.1.40 (Pyruvate Kinase)', 'EC 4.1.1.32 (Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP))', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we evaluated methods for establishing and therapy of a human T-ALL cell line (MT-ALL) in 73 SCID mice. MT-ALL is a T-cell receptor alpha/beta +, CD3+, and CD7+ leukemia cell line, derived from a patient with refractory disease and early death. Injection of 5 x 10(7) MT-ALL cells i.v. caused disseminated human leukemia in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic organs in 100% of SCID mice (n = 9) leading to death or terminal disease at 65 to 70 days after a uniform clinical course. To study possible therapeutic approaches for disseminated leukemia we utilized an immunotoxin, DA7, constructed by chemically linking the mouse IgG2b anti-CD7(3A1E) monoclonal antibody which recognizes a pan-T-cell marker expressed on almost all T-cell leukemias to deglycosylated ricin A-chain, a catalytic plant toxin and inhibitor of protein synthesis. Administration of DA7 led to greater than 5 log kill of clonogenic MT-ALL cells in vitro and selectively inhibited protein synthesis. DA7 was administered to mice at a dose of 10 micrograms/mouse/day for 5 consecutive days starting 8 days after i.v. inoculation of leukemia. The immunotoxin therapy resulted in significant long term survival over 348 days compared to untreated or control mice treated with anti-CD7 antibody and deglycosylated ricin A-chain which were all dead by day 70 (P less than 0.001). Even after more than 11 months there was no evidence of disease in 82% of the DA7 treated animals. SCID mice given i.p. injections (n = 9) developed an i.p. tumor mass but demonstrated metastasis outside the peritoneum with disseminated leukemia in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic organs, a finding different from most conventional nude mouse models. The leukemia was fatal in 100% and killed the animals at 68-95 days. SCID mice given i.p. injections of MT-ALL completely responded to therapy with DA7, resulting in survival of 100% of the animals (n = 10) at 216 days (P less than 0.001 compared to untreated animals). Anti-CD7 antibody, deglycosylated ricin A-chain, and a control anti-melanoma immunotoxin (IND1-RTA) showed no therapeutic effect. We conclude that DA7 is an effective in vivo therapeutic agent against human MT-ALL in the SCID mouse system, suggesting potential usefulness for therapy of humans with poor prognosis T-cell leukemia.","['Jansen, B', 'Vallera, D A', 'Jaszcz, W B', 'Nguyen, D', 'Kersey, J H']","['Jansen B', 'Vallera DA', 'Jaszcz WB', 'Nguyen D', 'Kersey JH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine/Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ricin/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Mar 1;52(5):1314-21.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is, however, controversial as to whether T lymphocytes of CML patients carry this gene rearrangement. An answer to this question would clarify whether the translocation in CML occurs in a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell or in a precursor cell already committed to certain lineages, but not the T-cell lineage. To address this question, we established T-cell clones from peripheral venous blood cells of four patients with CML and screened these clones for bcr-abl fusion transcripts by means of polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis. In four T-cell clones of three of these patients, the bcr-abl transcript could be detected. None of 12 T-cell clones of the fourth patient disclosed detectable bcr-abl amplification product.

Profoundly granulocytopenic patients are at increased risk of developing Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia, often with a fatal outcome. Therapy with one or two anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotics and an aminoglycoside in combination that were effective in vitro against the infecting organism proved to be superior, by one-week survival, to therapy with either one in vitro effective beta-lactam or aminoglycoside or inadequate drugs. On the other hand, treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor had no significant association with longer survival, although a favorable outcome was well correlated with an increase in the granulocyte count during therapy. An active mycobacteriosis was documented in 2% of all patients with hematologic malignancy. Dissemination occurred in half of them. The prognosis of tuberculosis was depended mainly on early diagnosis and treatment, while that for the atypical variety was largely influenced by the underlying disease. The frequency of deep fungal infection in patients with acute leukemia at autopsy increased progressively from 10% in 1970-1974 to 38% in 1983-1986, but it decreased somewhat to 29% in 1987-1989 after the introduction of empiric amphotericin B therapy in 1986. Early empiric antifungal therapy should therefore be started in granulocytopenic patients with fever refractory to antibacterial therapy, because of unreliability of the current serodiagnosis. A total protective isolation for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was associated with a reduced incidence of pneumonia, especially due to Aspergillus, and to a lesser extent, bacteremia. Cytomegalovirus pneumonia complicating BMT continues to have a poor prognosis, although the frequency has gradually been decreasing with the introduction of effective preventive measures. An early diagnosis and treatment as well as preventive measures is thus necessary for infection control in patients with hematologic malignancy.","['Funada, H']",['Funada H'],"['Protected Environment Unit, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

The corresponding DNA template was used to examine errors by reverse transcriptase during second-strand DNA synthesis. With both templates, the mutations introduced by reverse transcriptase were identified by their mutant phenotypes in an M13 lacZ alpha-complementation assay.

In the present study we have used a cDNA of human vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit C (SC-H(+)-ATPase) to analyze expression of this gene in HL60 cells isolated for resistance to adriamycin or vincristine. The results demonstrate that development of resistance to either agent results in a major increase in the levels of SC-H(+)-ATPase mRNA. Furthermore in resistant cells which have partially reverted to drug sensitivity there is a parallel reduction in SC-H(+)-ATPase mRNA levels. Southern blot analysis shows that the SC-H(+)-ATPase gene is not amplified in the resistant cells.

A primer to detect a wide variety of enteroviral genomes and a coxsackievirus type B3 genome-specific primer were demonstrated to be efficient in IST assays. Transcription times greater than 10 to 30 min did not significantly improve the acquisition of a specific signal, whereas the signal-to-noise ratio decreased with time. Inclusion of actinomycin D to suppress DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity in reverse transcriptase decreased the signal that was obtained without improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Use of RNase H-free murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in the IST reaction increased the signal versus that obtained by use of the avian myeloblastosis virus enzyme, which contains endogenous RNase H activity. Exogenous RNase H added to the transcription reaction ablated the signal. Background transcription because of poorly hybridized (mismatched) primers was reduced after primer hybridization and prior to the transcription reaction by rinsing fixed cells with 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride at temperatures which dissociate mismatched primer-template duplexes. The rapid detection time and the simplicity of application suggest that IST can be performed with a high specificity for the detection of enteroviral genomic sequences in cultured cells and may be more useful than in situ hybridization for the detection of enteroviral genomes.","['Carstens, J M', 'Tracy, S', 'Chapman, N M', 'Gauntt, C J']","['Carstens JM', 'Tracy S', 'Chapman NM', 'Gauntt CJ']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198.']",['eng'],['HL40303/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,IM,"['Animals', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Enterovirus B, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'RNA', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jcm.30.1.25-35.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1992 Jan;30(1):25-35. doi: 10.1128/jcm.30.1.25-35.1992.,"['0 (RNA primers)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,PMC264991,,,,,,,,,,

BLV is a type C retrovirus in the Oncovirinae subfamily. It is most closely related to human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) and type II (HTLV-II). Since the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides rapid and efficient amplification of DNA sequences, primers were designed to amplify regions of the polymerase (pol) and pX genes specific for BLV targets. These sets of primers consistently amplified as few as 10 copies of BLV DNA contained in a plasmid in the background of 1 microgram of either human or bovine chromosomal DNA. In addition, no amplification products were detected from cell lines infected with HTLV-I, HTLV-II, or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 by the BLV PCR systems. Samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 18 cows, previously determined to be serologically positive or negative, were correctly identified in a blind study as containing proviral DNA by use of the BLV primers and probes. Cloning and sequencing of amplified products revealed finite sequence variations among a previously cloned BLV isolate, the wild-type virus, and the published genome. Reverse transcriptase-directed PCR with the primers for both BLV pol and BLV pX was performed on plasma from a BLV-infected cow and detected in vivo BLV RNA expression. In summary, we have developed a specific and sensitive assay using PCR for the detection and identification of BLV infections; this assay can now be applied to clinical and basic research questions in veterinary medicine.","['Sherman, M P', 'Ehrlich, G D', 'Ferrer, J F', 'Sninsky, J J', 'Zandomeni, R', 'Dock, N L', 'Poiesz, B']","['Sherman MP', 'Ehrlich GD', 'Ferrer JF', 'Sninsky JJ', 'Zandomeni R', 'Dock NL', 'Poiesz B']","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York Health Science Center, Syracuse 13210.']",['eng'],['N01HB67021/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*microbiology', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Leukemia/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jcm.30.1.185-191.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1992 Jan;30(1):185-91. doi: 10.1128/jcm.30.1.185-191.1992.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,PMC265018,,,,,,,,,,

Reactivity profiles of various anti-type 2 chain monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) with leukemic blasts from 12 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and those from two patients with acute unclassified leukemia (AUL) show that anti-sialosyl-Le(x) MoAb SNH3 reacted strongly with greater than 95% of leukemic blast leukocyte populations from all patients (14 of 14). Another anti-sialosyl-Le(x) MoAb, FH6, showed less reactivity than SNH3 (12 of 14 patients), while anti-Le(y) MoAb AH6 showed reactivity with only 8 of 14 patients. On the other hand, none of the anti-type 2 chain MoAbs reacted with CD34+ normal adult bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells obtained independently from three healthy volunteers. MoAb SNH3, but not FH6 or AH6, showed complement-mediated cytotoxicity to leukemic blasts from these patients, as well as to myelogenous leukemia cell line HL60. Colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), but not burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), was incompletely inhibited by treatment of normal BM mononuclear cells with SNH3 and complement. The absence of type 2 chain antigen expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells and in in vitro hematopoietic colonies (CFU-GM and BFU-E) strongly suggests that application of anti-carbohydrate MoAbs, particularly anti-sialosyl-Le(x) could be useful for elimination of leukemic myeloblasts infiltrating in BM, for purging of leukemic blasts in BM, and for facilitation of autologous BM transplantation.","['Muroi, K', 'Suda, T', 'Nojiri, H', 'Ema, H', 'Amemiya, Y', 'Miura, Y', 'Nakauchi, H', 'Singhal, A', 'Hakomori, S']","['Muroi K', 'Suda T', 'Nojiri H', 'Ema H', 'Amemiya Y', 'Miura Y', 'Nakauchi H', 'Singhal A', 'Hakomori S']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],['CA42505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/chemistry/*immunology', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lewis Blood Group Antigens/chemistry/immunology', 'Lewis X Antigen/chemistry/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sialic Acids/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75000-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Feb 1;79(3):713-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Lewis Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Sialic Acids)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, there is evidence that uncommitted, HLA-DR-negative progenitor cells and committed erythroid precursors (BFU-E) bind to fibronectin. However, fibronectin is not known to mediate binding of committed myeloid (granulocyte-macrophage) progenitors, raising the possibility that other ECM proteins may be involved in this process. We investigated the binding of the MO7 myeloid cell line to a variety of ECM proteins and observed significant specific binding to collagen type I (56% +/- 5%), minimal binding to fibronectin (18% +/- 4%) or to laminin (19% +/- 5%), and no binding to collagen type III, IV, or V. Similarly, normal bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM) demonstrated significant specific binding to collagen type I (46% +/- 8% and 47% +/- 12% for day 7 CFU-GM and day 14 CFU-GM, respectively). The ability of collagen to mediate binding of progenitor cells was not restricted to the myeloid lineage, as BFU-E also showed significant binding to this ECM protein (40% +/- 10%). The binding of MO7 cells and CFU-GM was collagen-mediated, as demonstrated by complete inhibition of adherence after treatment with collagenase type VII, which was shown to specifically degrade collagen. Binding was not affected by anti-CD29 neutralizing antibody (anti-beta-1 integrin), the RGD-containing peptide sequence GRGDTP, or divalent cation chelation, suggesting that collagen binding is not mediated by the beta-1 integrin class of adhesion proteins. Finally, mature peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes were also found to bind to collagen type I (25% +/- 8% and 29% +/- 6%, respectively). These data suggest that collagen type I may play a role in the localization of committed myeloid and erythroid progenitors within the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Koenigsmann, M', 'Griffin, J D', 'DiCarlo, J', 'Cannistra, S A']","['Koenigsmann M', 'Griffin JD', 'DiCarlo J', 'Cannistra SA']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cations, Divalent/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Collagen/*metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Integrin beta1', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Microbial Collagenase/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Oligopeptides/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74993-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Feb 1;79(3):657-65.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '78VO7F77PN (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.4.24.3 (Microbial Collagenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach allowed the detection of EpR-positive cells in all bone marrow samples studied. Most of the EpR-positive cells in normal bone marrow were found to be CD45-dull, CD34-negative, transferrin-receptor-positive and glycophorin-A-intermediate to -positive. This phenotype is characteristic of relatively mature erythroid precursors, ie, colony-forming units-erythroid and erythroblasts recognizable by classic staining procedures. Approximately 5% of normal EpR-positive cells displayed an intermediate expression of CD45, suggesting that these represented precursors of the CD45-dull EpR-positive cells. Some EpR-positive cells in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) bone marrow had a phenotype similar to the major EpR-positive phenotype in normal bone marrow, ie, CD34-negative and CD45-dull. However, there was a disproportionate increase in the relative number of EpR-positive/CD45-intermediate cells in CML bone marrow. Even more striking differences between normal individuals and CML patients were observed when EpR-expression on CD34-positive marrow cells was analyzed. Very few EpR-positive cells were found in the CD34-positive fraction of normal bone marrow, whereas a significant fraction of the CD34-positive marrow cells from five of five CML patients expressed readily detectable EpR. These findings suggest that control of EpR expression is perturbed in the neoplastic clone of cells present in patients with CML. This may be related to the inadequate output of mature red blood cells typical of CML patients and may also be part of a more generalized perturbation in expression and/or functional integrity of other growth factor receptors on CML cells.","['Wognum, A W', 'Krystal, G', 'Eaves, C J', 'Eaves, A C', 'Lansdorp, P M']","['Wognum AW', 'Krystal G', 'Eaves CJ', 'Eaves AC', 'Lansdorp PM']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, B.C.

Addition of ATP to human leukemic lymphocytes loaded with the Ca2+ indicator, fura-2, induced a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration which was attenuated or absent in NaCl media compared with KCl, choline Cl, or NMG Cl media. In contrast, anti-immunoglobulin antibody gave similar Ca2+ transients in NaCl and KCl media. A half-maximal inhibition of peak ATP-induced Ca2+ response was observed at 10-16 mM extracellular Na+. Basal 45Ca2+ influx into lymphocytes was stimulated 9.6-fold by ATP added to cells in KCl media, but the effect of ATP was greatly reduced for cells in NaCl media. Hexamethylene amiloride blocked 74% of the ATP-stimulated Ca45 uptake of cells in KCl media. Flow cytometry measurements of fluo-3-loaded cells confirmed that the ATP-induced rise in cytosolic Ca2+ was inhibited either by extracellular Na+ or by addition of hexamethylene amiloride. Extracellular ATP stimulated 86Rb efflux from lymphocytes 10-fold and this increment was inhibited by the amiloride analogs in a rank order of potency 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)amiloride greater than 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride greater than 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride greater than amiloride.

In all three cases the inhibitory effect was either reduced (NaF, dAMP) or totally abolished.

Microsequencing of the purified material revealed a single NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, identical to that of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a glycoprotein originally identified by its ability to inhibit the growth of MT1 mouse leukemia cells and subsequently found to have numerous effects. Recombinant human LIF inhibited the growth of ABAE cells as effectively as transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta 1). However, it failed to inhibit markedly the growth of ACCE cells, whereas TGF beta 1 dramatically inhibited their growth. Recombinant human LIF also failed to induce a significant angiogenic response in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane, indicating that, unlike TGF beta, LIF probably does not induce the release of direct-acting angiogenic factors from inflammatory cells. The presence of LIF in follicular cells may relate to the peculiar vascular organization of the pituitary gland, where no arteries reach the pars distalis and all of the blood supply to this area is by capillaries.","['Ferrara, N', 'Winer, J', 'Henzel, W J']","['Ferrara N', 'Winer J', 'Henzel WJ']","['Department of Cardiovascular Research, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Pituitary Gland/cytology/*physiology']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.2.698 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Jan 15;89(2):698-702. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.2.698.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,PMC48306,,,,,,,,,,

In the rat basophilic leukaemia cell line RBL-2H3, which is a model system for the analysis of Fc epsilon RI-mediated signal transduction, surface engagement of Fc epsilon RI induces histamine release and the tyrosine phosphorylation of several distinct proteins. Although the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of Fc epsilon RI lack intrinsic tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) activity, a kinase that copurifies with Fc epsilon RI phosphorylates the beta and gamma subunits of the receptor on tyrosine residues. We report here that in RBL-2H3 cells, p56lyn and pp60c-src are activated after Fc epsilon RI crosslinking, and p56lyn coimmunoprecipitates with Fc epsilon RI. In the mouse mast-cell line PT-18, another cell type used to study FC epsilon RI-mediated signalling, tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins is also an immediate consequence of receptor crosslinking. Notably, the only detectable src protein-related TPK in PT-18 cells is p62c-yes, and it is this TPK that is activated on Fc epsilon RI engagement and coimmunoprecipitates with the receptor. Therefore, it seems that different src protein-related TPKs can associate with the same receptor and become activated after receptor engagement.","['Eiseman, E', 'Bolen, J B']","['Eiseman E', 'Bolen JB']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical, Research Institute, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['2,4-Dinitrophenol', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Immunoglobulin E/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis', '*src-Family Kinases']",1992/01/02 00:00,2000/06/01 00:00,['1992/01/02 00:00'],"['1992/01/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/01 00:00 [medline]', '1992/01/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/355078a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1992 Jan 2;355(6355):78-80. doi: 10.1038/355078a0.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'Q13SKS21MN (2,4-Dinitrophenol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This deletion was based on improved RNase H homology alignments made possible by the recently solved three-dimensional structure for Escherichia coli RNase H. This mutant Moloney murine leukemia virus RT was fully active in the oligo(dT)-poly(rA) DNA polymerase assay and retained nearly all of wild-type RT's RNase H activity in an in situ RNase H gel assay. However, proviruses reconstructed to include this deletion were noninfectious. Minus-strand strong-stop DNA was made by the deletion mutant, but the amount of minus-strand translocation was intermediate to the very low level measured with RNase H-null virions and the high level seen with wild-type RT. The average length of translocated minus-strand DNA was shorter for the deletion mutant than for wild type, suggesting that mutations in the RNase H domain of RT also affect DNA polymerase activity.","['Telesnitsky, A', 'Blain, S W', 'Goff, S P']","['Telesnitsky A', 'Blain SW', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],['CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Structural', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Virion/genetics/physiology', '*Virus Replication']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.2.615-622.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Feb;66(2):615-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.2.615-622.1992.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,,PMC240759,,,,,,,,,,

Some of the gangliosides are located close to the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI), and binding of mAb AA4 inhibits Fc epsilon RI-mediated histamine release. In the present study, mAb AA4 was found to bind exclusively to mast cells in all rat tissues examined. In vitro, within 1 min of mAb AA4 binding, the cells underwent striking morphologic changes. They lost their normal spindle shaped appearance, increased their ruffling, and spread over the surface of the culture dish. These changes were accompanied by a redistribution of the cytoskeletal elements, actin, tubulin, and vimentin, but only the actin was associated with the membrane ruffles. Binding of mAb AA4 also induces a rise in intracellular calcium, stimulates phosphatidyl inositol breakdown, and activates PKC. However, the extent of these changes was less than that observed when the cells were stimulated with antigen or antibody directed against the Fc epsilon RI. None of these changes associated with mAb AA4 binding were seen when the cells were exposed to nonspecific IgG, IgE, or four other anti-cell surface antibodies, nor were the changes induced by binding mAb AA4 at 4 degrees C or in the absence of extracellular calcium. Although mAb AA4 does not stimulate histamine release, it enhances the effect of the calcium ionophore A23187 mediated release. The morphological and biochemical effects produced by mAb AA4 are similar to those seen following activation of the cell through the IgE receptor. Therefore, the surface gangliosides which bind mAb AA4 may function in modulating secretory events.","['Oliver, C', 'Sahara, N', 'Kitani, S', 'Robbins, A R', 'Mertz, L M', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Oliver C', 'Sahara N', 'Kitani S', 'Robbins AR', 'Mertz LM', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Cytoskeleton/ultrastructure', 'Gangliosides/immunology/*physiology', 'Histamine Release', '*Immunoglobulin E', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/chemistry/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microtubules/ultrastructure', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tubulin/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vimentin/analysis']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.116.3.635 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1992 Feb;116(3):635-46. doi: 10.1083/jcb.116.3.635.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Vimentin)', '19553-76-5 (ganglioside, GD1b)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,PMC2289326,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated in human acute lymphocytic leukemia the relationship between acquired drug resistance and susceptibility to cytolysis mediated by endogenous, interferon-activated, and interleukin-2-activated natural cytotoxic cells. Eight human leukemia drug-resistant/sensitive cell line pairs were evaluated; drug-resistant sub-lines included those selected for primary resistance to adriamycin, etoposide, teniposide, vincristine, and vinblastine. A majority of P-glycoprotein-positive MDR sub-lines displayed slight but statistically significant resistance to endogenous and/or interferon-activated natural-killer(NK)-cell-mediated lysis, as compared with the drug-sensitive parental type. P-glycoprotein-negative sub-lines displayed variable NK susceptibility; within this group, the variants selected for primary etoposide resistance were more susceptible to NK cytolysis than parental cells. Results of cold-target-inhibition experiments suggest that altered NK susceptibility does not arise solely from modulation of NK target recognition and adherence structures. IL2-activated killer (LAK) cells lysed both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant lines. Two MDR lines selected for primary etoposide resistance displayed enhanced LAK susceptibility. In contrast, the 2 variants selected for resistance to adriamycin exhibited partial resistance to LAK-mediated killing, which could be overcome at high effector-to-target ratios. Our results support the development of interleukin-2/LAK immunotherapy for the treatment of leukemias with acquired drug resistance.","['Treichel, R S', 'Olken, S']","['Treichel RS', 'Olken S']","['Department of Biology, Oberlin College, OH 44074-1082.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*pathology/therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology/therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/21 00:00,1992/01/21 00:01,['1992/01/21 00:00'],"['1992/01/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/21 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910500223 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1992 Jan 21;50(2):305-10. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910500223.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
