CD1 is a specific marker of Langerhans cells. By immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, CD1a antigen and myeloid markers (CD11, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, HLA-DR) were studied in 53 cases of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and 3 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). The 11 ANLL without monocytic component were CD1a negative. 2/5 of acute myelomonocytic leukemias (AML4) and 9/37 of acute monocytic leukemias (AML5) were positive. All 3 ALL were negative. No correlation was found between CD1a and myeloid markers. CD1a+ AML did not differ from CD1a- AML with regard to cytogenetics or response to therapy. The CD1a positive cells may originate from an abnormal proliferation of CD1a positive cells which are present in bone marrow and which may differentiate into Langerhans cell precursors.","['Misery, L', 'Campos, L', 'Dezutter-Dambuyant, C', 'Guyotat, D', 'Treille, D', 'Schmitt, D', 'Thivolet, J']","['Misery L', 'Campos L', 'Dezutter-Dambuyant C', 'Guyotat D', 'Treille D', 'Schmitt D', 'Thivolet J']","['Laboratoire de Recherche Dermatologique et Immunologie, Unite Inserm 209, Hopital Edouard Herriot, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD1', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Langerhans Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/immunology/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Prognosis']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb01789.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1992 Jan;48(1):27-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb01789.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The B7 antigen is the natural ligand for CD28 on T cells.

We have now mapped the B7 gene to human chromosome 3 using the technique of polymerase chain reaction on a panel of hamster x human somatic cell hybrid DNAs. We have further localized the gene to 3q13.3-3q21 using in situ hybridization on human metaphase chromosomes. Trisomy of chromosome 3 is a recurrent chromosome change seen in various lymphomas and lymphoproliferative diseases, particularly diffuse, mixed, small, and large cell lymphomas, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I-induced adult T-cell leukemia, and angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy. A number of chromosomal defects involving 3q21 have been described in acute myeloid leukemia and also in myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative syndromes.

Other surface markers (CD13, CD14, CD15, and CD34) were studied by the same technique. A marker was considered positive when 20% or more cells were stained. Of 150 samples, 71 were P-170-positive.

Complete remission (CR) rates were significantly lower in P-170-positive (23/71, 32%) than in P-170-negative cases (64/79, 81%) (P less than 10(-5)).

The receptor for SCF is encoded by the protooncogene c-kit. After immunizing mice with the human erythroleukemia cell line OCIM1, we obtained a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that recognizes the human c-kit receptor. This MoAb, designated SR-1, blocks binding of 125I-human SCF to the c-kit receptor, and neutralizes the biologic effects of SCF in hematopoietic colony assays. With few exceptions, c-kit expression was identified on all hematopoietic and lymphoid cell lines tested by indirect immunofluorescent analysis using SR-1 and by binding studies with 125I-SCF. SR-1 recognizes a small fraction of normal bone marrow mononuclear cells, and these cells have the morphologic appearance of blasts. Colony assays show that BFU-E and CFU-GM display the c-kit receptor. SR-1 does not cross-react with murine c-kit protein, indicating that the binding epitopes of the human and murine c-kit receptors are antigenically distinct. This MoAb may be useful to characterize the spectrum of cells that display the c-kit receptor and to further define the role of SCF in hematopoiesis.","['Broudy, V C', 'Lin, N', 'Zsebo, K M', 'Birkett, N C', 'Smith, K A', 'Bernstein, I D', 'Papayannopoulou, T']","['Broudy VC', 'Lin N', 'Zsebo KM', 'Birkett NC', 'Smith KA', 'Bernstein ID', 'Papayannopoulou T']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/chemistry', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocytes/chemistry', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Macrophages/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75033-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 15;79(2):338-46.,"['CA39492/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK31232/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'MO1 RR00037/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Evi-1 gene product is a nuclear, DNA-binding zinc finger protein of 145 kDa. On the basis of the properties of the myeloid cell lines in which the Evi-1 gene is activated, it has been hypothesized that its expression blocks normal differentiation. To explore this proposed role, we have constructed a retrovirus vector containing the gene and examined its effects on an interleukin-3-dependent myeloid cell line that differentiates in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Expression of the Evi-1 gene in these cells did not alter the normal growth factor requirements of the cells. However, expression of the Evi-1 gene blocked the ability of the cells to express myeloperoxidase and to terminally differentiate to granulocytes in response to G-CSF. This effect was not due to altered expression of the G-CSF receptor or to changes in the initial responses of the cells to G-CSF. These results support the hypothesis that the inappropriate expression of the Evi-1 gene in myeloid cells interferes with the ability of the cells to terminally differentiate.","['Morishita, K', 'Parganas, E', 'Matsugi, T', 'Ihle, J N']","['Morishita K', 'Parganas E', 'Matsugi T', 'Ihle JN']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.12.1.183-189.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Jan;12(1):183-9. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.1.183-189.1992.,"['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA51020/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Evi-1'],PMC364082,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we report that the combination of IFN-alpha and 5-FU has a significant effect not only on the inhibition of tumor cell growth but also on the regulation of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (NK-CMC). The addition of 5-FU to effector cell population neither affects NK cell activity nor activation of NK cells by IFN or by interleukin (IL)-2. However, pretreatment of target cells with 5-FU increased their susceptibility to NK activity and abolished the protective effect induced by IFN against NK-CMC. This dual effect of IFN-alpha and 5-FU was found to be applicable to target cells of different origins including a cervical carcinoma cell line (ME-180), a hairy cell leukemia-like cell line (Eskol), a CML cell line (K-562) and a primary culture of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma cells. Similar results were found with IL-2 treatment of Eskol cells but not other cells. Combination of IL-2 with 5-FU resulted in enhancement of the sensitivity of the cells to NK activity and abolished the protection against NK-CMC. Based on these results we propose that the combination of IFN-alpha and 5-FU not only has a direct growth inhibitory effect on tumor cells but also has a regulatory role on the immunological arm of the NK-CMC. Moreover, since the combination gave the same pattern of response in different tumor cells, both NK-sensitive and NK-resistant, this combination treatment may be a candidate for clinical trials in various types of tumors.","['Reiter, Z', 'Ozes, O N', 'Blatt, L M', 'Taylor, M W']","['Reiter Z', 'Ozes ON', 'Blatt LM', 'Taylor MW']","['Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington 47405.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'RNA/metabolism']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0090-1229(92)90029-n [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1992 Jan;62(1 Pt 1):103-11. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(92)90029-n.,['CA53783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of this genetic component has been hindered by the fact that disease onset normally occurs after age 50. We report here the aged NZB mouse as an animal model for CLL. NZB mice have a genetically regulated, age-dependent onset of clonal, aneuploid cells which are IgM+ and Ly1+ (CD5+ B-cells). Peripheral blood smears from old NZB mice show an increase in circulating lymphocytes and ""smudged"" or ruptured cells, often seen in human CLL. Electron microscopic examination of these cells shows them to be mature lymphocytes. Light microscopy of the spleen shows infiltration of small lymphocytes and is consistent with CLL pathology. These long-lived, CLL-like cells can be serially passaged into recipient animals. This continued passage occasionally results in the development of a large cell lymphoma detectable in the spleen, lymph nodes, and liver. The histology of this lymphoma is quite distinct from that of the CLL-like cells, but the phenotype is that of an aneuploid CD5+, IgM+ cells. This apparently represents a continued transformation of the CLL-like clone similar to the development of Richter's syndrome in human CLL. Therefore, the NZB mouse can be a valuable tool for the determination of the genetic basis of CLL ontogeny and the conversion of CLL into Richter's syndrome.","['Phillips, J A', 'Mehta, K', 'Fernandez, C', 'Raveche, E S']","['Phillips JA', 'Mehta K', 'Fernandez C', 'Raveche ES']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Albany Medical College, New York 12208.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Ly/metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Spleen/pathology']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Jan 15;52(2):437-43.,['AI29740/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard Giemsa, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and reticulin stains were used for morphologic assessment. To identify the cell lineage precisely, chloroacetate esterase staining and an indirect immunoperoxidase technique using mouse monoclonal antibodies CD15, CD68, HLA-DR, and rabbit polyclonal CD3 and UEA-1 (lectin) was developed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded bone marrow biopsies (BMB). The immunohistochemical assessment permitted accurate identification of dysplastic features such as mononuclear and binuclear megakaryocytes, Pelger-Huet neutrophils, and binuclear erythroblasts. Additional bone marrow histologic and immunohistochemical features observed were heterogeneity of immunohistochemical staining in various cell lineages, megakaryocytic emperipolesis, alteration of bone marrow microarchitecture, intravascular clusters of hematopoietic cells, and the types of benign lymphoid aggregates. The nature of abnormally localized immature precursors (ALIP) was discerned. Three types of clusters of immature cells were found that were difficult to distinguish on Giemsa and H&E morphology, these were erythroid aggregates (n = 18); megakaryocytic aggregates (n = 4), and immature granulocytic and monocytic aggregates (n = 32). The bone marrow histologic and immunohistologic patterns permitted the identification of four groups of clinical relevance: Group 1, cases with predominant erythroid hyperplasia and without ALIP (n = 15); group 2, cases with prominent myeloid hyperplasia and presence of ALIP (n = 32); group 3, cases with hypoplastic MDS (n = 10); and group 4, cases with hyperfibrotic MDS (n = 6). Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in survival and leukemic transformation between groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, with cases in group 2 showing the worst prognosis with early death due to increased propensity to leukemic transformation and cytopenia-related complications (P less than .0001). We conclude that immunohistochemistry is feasible on routinely processed BMB and the information obtained is of diagnostic and prognostic importance in P-MDS. The phenotype of ALIP varies with the morphologic and histologic subtypes of MDS and the term should be reserved for cases in whom the clusters in the intertrabecular region are of myeloid (granulocytic and monocytic) lineage on immunohistochemistry.","['Mangi, M H', 'Mufti, G J']","['Mangi MH', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Erythroblasts/pathology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Staining and Labeling']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75387-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 1;79(1):198-205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the role of CD2/CD58 and CD11a/18/CD54 interactions in cellular immune responses directed towards freshly recovered human T-cell leukemias. The data support the notion that downregulation of CD54 and CD58 correlates with enhanced numbers of blasts in circulation and unsusceptibility to killing by autologous cytotoxic lymphocytes. Importantly, after induction of CD54 and CD58 expression on leukemic cells by recombinant cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tumor cells become highly susceptible to lymphocyte-mediated lysis in vitro. Our findings, therefore, stress the point that successful immunotherapy of malignant disease may be facilitated by influencing not only the immune response itself, but also adhesion molecules on the malignant tumor targets.","['Schirren, C A', 'Volpel, H', 'Meuer, S C']","['Schirren CA', 'Volpel H', 'Meuer SC']","['Abteilung Angewandte Immunologie, Institut fur Radiologie und Pathophysiologie, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'CD11 Antigens', 'CD18 Antigens', 'CD2 Antigens', 'CD58 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*immunology', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)75379-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jan 1;79(1):138-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of CHO cells with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin rendered these cells susceptible to infection by retroviral vectors with ecotropic, xenotropic, and amphotropic host ranges and increased the titer of gibbon ape leukemia virus pseudotyped vectors 10-fold. Vectors having a polytropic host range did not infect CHO cells in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, showing that the effect of tunicamycin was specific and related to the pseudotype of the vector. We present evidence for three mechanisms of resistance to infection: lack of viral receptors on CHO cells, the presence of nonfunctional receptors which can be made functional by treatment with tunicamycin, and the secretion of a protein factor that blocks retroviral infection of CHO cells. Several criteria indicate that the secreted inhibitor is not an interferon, and secretion of this factor was not detected in several other cell lines that were examined.","['Miller, D G', 'Miller, A D']","['Miller DG', 'Miller AD']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Cricetinae', 'Defective Viruses/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferons/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tunicamycin/*pharmacology', 'Virus Replication']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.1.78-84.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Jan;66(1):78-84. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.1.78-84.1992.,,,,PMC238262,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K6-1 cells showed resistance in drug-induced DNA strand breaks (single strand breaks) determined by the alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation method. Dot-blot analysis of RNA extracted from 2 cell lines showed that the mRNA levels of DNA topoisomerase II in K6-1 cells decreased slightly compared with that of parent cells. However, Topo II activities were similar in wild-type and K6-1 cells. In addition, K6-1 cells exhibited cross-resistance only to VM-26.

Hep G2 cells (a human hepatoma cell line) were cultivated in an Acusyst-P (Endotronic) with a total fiber surface area of 7.2 m2 6 x 1.2m2) to produce Hep G2 crude conditioned medium (CCM). Pretreatment of the cellulose acetate hollow fibers with collagen enhances the attachment of the anchorage-dependent cells. We have succeeded in growing the Hep G2 cells in an antibiotics- and serum-free IMDM medium, supplemented with 50 micrograms/ml of Hep G2 CCM protein at inoculation. The Hep G2 cells replicate and secrete CCM protein in quantities comparable to those produced in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The highest CCM protein productivity during the 80-day cultivation was 1.1 g/day with a total of 30 g of protein accumulated. Hep G2 CCM (20-40 micrograms protein/ml) was comparable to or even better than 10% FCS in supporting the growth of Molt-4 (a human T leukemia cell line) and FO (a mouse myeloma cell line) cells in vitro. The availability of this large amount of Hep G2 CCM will aid the further purification and characterization of growth factor(s) which could be used as serum substituents.","['Liu, J J', 'Chen, B S', 'Tsai, T F', 'Wu, Y J', 'Pang, V F', 'Hsieh, A', 'Hsieh, J H', 'Chang, T H']","['Liu JJ', 'Chen BS', 'Tsai TF', 'Wu YJ', 'Pang VF', 'Hsieh A', 'Hsieh JH', 'Chang TH']","['Development Center for Biotechnology, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,"['0 (Culture Media)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Collagen', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Time Factors', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00365429 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytotechnology. 1991 Feb;5(2):129-39. doi: 10.1007/BF00365429.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differential expression of the enzymes during human embryonic development and in adult tissues.,265-76,"The use of synthetic trisaccharides as acceptors led to the definition of five main (1----3)-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase activity patterns in human adult tissues: (I). Myeliod cells, granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphoblasts, transfer an alpha-L-fucopyranosyl group to O-3 of a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucosyl residue of H blood-group Type 2 oligosaccharide [alpha-L-Fucp-(1----2)-beta-D-Galp-(1----4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc----R] with Mn2+ as activator. (II) Brain has the same acceptor specificity pattern as myeloid cells, but can also use Co2+ as activator. (III) Plasma and liver transfer an alpha-L-furopyranosyl group to H blood-group Type 2 and to sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine [alpha-NeuAc-(2----3)-beta-D-Galp-(1----4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc----R]. (IV) Intestine, gall bladder, kidney, and milk have the same activity as (III), but also transfer an alpha-L-fucopyranosyl group to O-4 of a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose residue of H blood-group Type 1 [alpha-L-Fucp-(1----2)-beta-D-Galp-(1----3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc----R] and sialyl Type 1 [alpha-NeuAc-(1----3)-beta-D-Galp-(1----3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc----R]. (V) Stomach mucosa is not able to use sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine, but can transfer an alpha-L-fucopyranosyl group to the other Type 1 and Type 2 acceptors. Unlike in adult tissue, a single myeloid-like pattern of (1----3)-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase activity was found at early stages of development in all tissues tested. This embryonic enzyme is later progressively replaced by enzymes or mixtures of enzymes having the corresponding adult patterns of enzyme expression. All lymphoblastoid cell lines and half of the tumor epithelial cell lines tested expressed the myeloid-like pattern of enzyme found in normal embryonic tissues. The remaining tumor epithelial cell lines expressed different forms of (1----3/4)-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase acceptor specificity patterns.","['Mollicone, R', 'Candelier, J J', 'Mennesson, B', 'Couillin, P', 'Venot, A P', 'Oriol, R']","['Mollicone R', 'Candelier JJ', 'Mennesson B', 'Couillin P', 'Venot AP', 'Oriol R']","['INSERM U. 178, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Carbohydr Res,Carbohydrate research,0043535,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '28RYY2IV3F (Fucose)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.152 (galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.1.65 (3-galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminide 4-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/physiology', 'Fucose/*metabolism', 'Fucosyltransferases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Oligosaccharides/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/10 00:00,1992/04/10 00:01,['1992/04/10 00:00'],"['1992/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0008-6215(00)90564-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0008-6215(00)90564-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Carbohydr Res. 1992 Apr 10;228(1):265-76. doi: 10.1016/s0008-6215(00)90564-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction by peptide regulatory factors and differential effects of dexamethasone and retinoic acid.,488-96,"Monocyte influx and activation in synovial joints are important in the pathogenesis of both degenerative and inflammatory arthropathies. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of articular cartilage to directly modulate these events. IL-1-stimulated human articular chondrocytes transcribed 0.7-kb monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA. In situ hybridization of cartilage organ cultures revealed MCP-1 transcripts in chondrocytes in the superficial tangential zone within 2 h of stimulation with IL-1. Chondrocytes in deeper layers responded by 4 h and reached maximum MCP-1 mRNA levels by 8-12 h. IL-1-stimulated cartilage organ and chondrocyte monolayer cultures released functional monocyte chemotactic activity. This was neutralized by a monoclonal antibody specific for MCP-1, and was associated with the synthesis and secretion of immunoreactive 13-kD and 15-kD isoforms of MCP-1. Regulators and signal transduction pathways involved with the expression of the MCP-1 gene in chondrocytes were analyzed. Steady-state mRNA levels were increased by the known chondrocyte activators IL-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, LPS, platelet-derived growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta. In addition, leukemia inhibitory factor induced MCP-1 gene expression and protein synthesis, identifying this cytokine as a new regulator of chondrocyte function. Dexamethasone blunted the induction of MCP-1 gene expression by IL-1 and by activators of protein kinase A as well as protein kinase C signal transduction pathways. In contrast, retinoic acid strongly increased phorbol myristate acetate-induced MCP-1 expression and potentiated the effects of IL-1 and LPS. In conclusion, chondrocytes express MCP-1 in response to factors that are present in cartilage or synovium. This provides a mechanism by which cartilage can play an active role in the initiation and progression of arthritis.","['Villiger, P M', 'Terkeltaub, R', 'Lotz, M']","['Villiger PM', 'Terkeltaub R', 'Lotz M']","['Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cartilage, Articular/*physiology', 'Chemokine CCL2', 'Chemotactic Factors/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI115885 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1992 Aug;90(2):488-96. doi: 10.1172/JCI115885.,"['AG-00776/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-39799/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-36702/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC443125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the 13-wk studies, doses for rats and mice ranged from 25 to 400 mg/kg. At those doses showing some indication of toxicity in the 14-day and 13-wk studies, the central nervous system, forestomach and liver were identified as target organs in both species and renal toxicity was observed in rats. Based on these results, 2-yr studies were conducted by administering 0, 25 or 50 mg hydroquinone/kg in deionized water by gavage to groups of 65 rats of each sex, 5 days/wk. Groups of 65 mice of each sex were given 0, 50 or 100 mg/kg on the same schedule. 10 rats and 10 mice from each group were killed and evaluated after 15 months. Mean body weights of high-dose male rats and high-dose mice were approx. 5-14% lower than those of controls during the second half of the study. No differences in survival were observed between dosed and control groups of rats or mice. Nearly all male rats and most female rats in all vehicle control and exposed groups had nephropathy, which was judged to be more severe in high-dose male rats. Hyperplasia of the renal pelvic transitional epithelium and renal cortical cysts were increased in male rats. Tubular cell hyperplasia of the kidney was seen in two high-dose male rats, and renal tubular adenomas were seen in 4/55 low-dose and 8/55 high-dose male rats; none was seen in vehicle controls or in female rats. Mononuclear cell leukaemia in female rats occurred with increased incidences in the dosed groups (vehicle control, 9/55; low dose, 15/55; high dose, 22/55).

We have prepared murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAb 22 and MoAb 32) that bind to Fc gamma RI outside the ligand binding site and thus bind to and trigger cytotoxicity that is not competed by other immunoglobulins. Because of these properties, it seemed that these MoAbs would be very useful for the development of bispecific antibodies (BsAb) for targeting normal cellular immune defense mechanisms as a new form of immunotherapy for treatment of cancer. BsAbs incorporate into a single molecule the binding specifities of two different antibodies, and, thus, can be used to target myeloid cells to tumors, ensure activation of cellular cytotoxic mechanisms, and target cell lysis and/or phagocytosis. BsAbs were prepared using anti-Fc gamma RI MoAb and an anti-myeloid cell MoAb, PM81, reactive with the CD15 antigen, for studies of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Conjugates were made by cross-linking sulfhydryl groups of Fab fragments of MoAb 32 or 22 (both IgG1) and sulfhydryl groups added to intact PM81 (an IgM) using N-succinimdyl-acetyl-S-thioacetate (SATA). The resulting product was purified by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography. The ability of the BsAbs to mediate attachment of human monocytes to tumor target cells was confirmed in a microtiter well assay of binding of MTT-labeled U937 cells (a human Fc gamma RI-bearing cell line) to SKBR-3 (PM81-reactive breast carcinoma) target cells. The ability of the BsAbs to mediate killing of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells was studied using a 6-hour Chromium-51 release assay. Effector cells were monocytes obtained by cytopheresis and cultured for 18 hours with IFN-gamma. Monocytes alone caused minimal killing (5-20%), monocytes plus BsAb caused moderate killing (20-50%), and monocytes plus BsAb plus human serum resulted in maximal killing (50-80%). Experiments were performed to test the ability of the BsAb to purge bone marrow of small numbers of leukemia cells using bone marrow mononuclear phagocytes treated for 18 hours with IFN-gamma prior to adding target cells. Without the addition of human serum as a source of complement, a 90% depletion of clonogenic HL-60 cells could be demonstrated. With human complement, up to 95% depletion was seen. Thus, this BsAb possessed the ability to lyse tumor cell targets by two different mechanisms, complement and cell-mediated lysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Ball, E D', 'Guyre, P M', 'Mills, L', 'Fisher, J', 'Dinces, N B', 'Fanger, M W']","['Ball ED', 'Guyre PM', 'Mills L', 'Fisher J', 'Dinces NB', 'Fanger MW']","['Department of Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', '*Antibody Specificity', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lewis X Antigen/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Receptors, IgG/*immunology', 'Risk Factors']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.1.1992.1.85 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother. 1992 Spring;1(1):85-94. doi: 10.1089/scd.1.1992.1.85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of novel synthetic retinoids (called retinobenzoic acids), which include retinoid antagonists, have been developed and have been shown to be useful tools to investigate retinoidal action molecular mechanisms. Retinoids elicit their biological effects by binding to specific nuclear receptors (RARs) belonging to a steroid/thyroid nuclear receptor superfamily. RARs act as retinoid-dependent transcription factors which bind to a specific gene site and control the gene's expression. The diversity of retinoidal actions can possibly be interpreted by considering the following characteristics, all of which are quite diversified: the structure and spatial/temporal distribution of RARs, the base sequences which interact with RARs, the cell type specifically determined hierarchy of gene expression, and the nuclear coregulators which interact with RARs.

In some cases, the genes encoding these proteins have been shown to confer resistance on transfer to drug-sensitive cell lines. This is true for the efflux pump product of the MDR1 gene, P-170. Upregulation of enzymes such as GST has been observed, although the contribution of this enzyme in drug resistance expressed by malignant haematopoietic cells is still uncertain. Cells also appear to be able to downregulate enzymes which are drug targets. Examples include the decrease in Topo II which accompanies the resistance shown by cells to VP-16 and VM-26. Although many reports include both presentation and relapsed patients, there are few data on samples drawn from the same patients before and after chemotherapy. While P-170 and GST appear to be raised more often in cells from resistant and relapsed disease, it is quite clear that such mechanisms can be active in de novo malignancy and do not necessarily emerge as a consequence of prior chemotherapy. Methods of detecting drug resistance are reviewed here; these include in vitro cellular assays for drug toxicity, and molecular, immunological and functional detection of P-170 or Topo II. The clinical evaluation of such assays is only just beginning and some of the data are contradictory. To some extent, this may reflect the complex way in which the various resistance mechanisms may interact. Nevertheless, there are some encouraging early signs that the application of these assays to clinical material will yield valuable data on the relative contributions of these mechanisms and on ways in which they may be overcome. At present, much attention has focused on the potential of agents which prevent the P-170 efflux pump from exporting cytotoxics from the cell. This is likely to be only the first of new therapies arising from an improved understanding of multidrug resistance. More immediately, assays for multidrug resistance and its parameters may find their place as routine diagnostic and prognostic tools in the laboratory.","['Baines, P', 'Cumber, P', 'Padua, R A']","['Baines P', 'Cumber P', 'Padua RA']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chloride Channels)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chloride Channels', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/drug effects', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Point Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80053-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1992 Oct;5(4):943-60. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80053-3.,,,['MDR1'],,,,153,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the human leukemic cell line, CCRF-CEM, and its derivatives that express either P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-associated multidrug resistance (MDR) (CEM/VLB100) or altered topoisomerase II-associated MDR (at-MDR) (CEM/VM-1), we assessed antitumor effects of these drugs in a 48-hr growth inhibition assay. We also measured drug-topoisomerase II interactions in an intact cell assay that permits quantitation of drug-stabilized DNA-topoisomerase II complexes. We found that among the tested compounds, amsacrine has an intermediate effect on cell growth in all three cell lines. The CEM/VM-1 cells were 8.6-fold cross-resistant to m-AMSA, and the cross-resistance to the analogs was from 3.0- to 10.5-fold. In the CEM/VLB100 cells, the resistance pattern was different: several analogs, including amsacrine, showed little or no cross-resistance (0.5- to 2.8-fold), whereas for those compounds with substituents at position 3 on the acridine ring, resistance was relatively higher (9.9- or 16.2-fold). Substituents at this position substantially decrease the lipophilicity of the two compounds examined, probably because they both contain amino groups that would be charged at physiologic pH. Compound 12489, having a 1'-NHSO2C6H4NH2 substituent, was very potent in the three cell lines, showing only a slightly higher IC50 value in the CEM/VM-1 line and a lower IC50 value in the CEM/VLB100 and in the CEM cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Granzen, B', 'Graves, D E', 'Baguley, B C', 'Danks, M K', 'Beck, W T']","['Granzen B', 'Graves DE', 'Baguley BC', 'Danks MK', 'Beck WT']","[""Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Amsacrine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1992;4(11-12):489-96.,"['CA-30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both agents are known to reverse multidrug resistance in cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein. In this investigation, we have examined the effects of cyclosporin A and verapamil on multidrug resistance in HL60/AR cells that lack P-glycoprotein. In addition, a correlation was sought between an alteration in plasma membrane potential as measured with cationic dye DIOC5 and overexpression of P-glycoprotein. HL60/AR cells accumulated 3 fold less daunorubicin than HL60 cells. The drug accumulation defect and drug resistance in HL60/AR cells were partially corrected by verapamil and buthionine sulfoximine. However, cyclosporin A had no detectable effect on daunorubicin accumulation or drug resistance in HL60/AR cells. The multidrug resistant P338/ADR cell line overexpressed P-glycoprotein and exhibited depolarization of plasma membrane when compared to its corresponding drug sensitive parental cell line. In contrast, HL60/AR cells lacked P-glycoprotein and plasma membrane potentials were similar to those of drug sensitive HL60 cells. These results suggest that [1] verapamil modulates daunorubicin transport by a mechanism independent of P-glycoprotein, [2] the mechanisms of reversal of multidrug resistance by verapamil and cyclosporin A are distinct, and [3] the plasma membrane depolarization in multidrug resistant cell lines that overexpress P-glycoprotein, as determined by DIOC5, may be due to an increased efflux of cationic dye by P-glycoprotein, rather than a true measurement of plasma membrane potential in multidrug resistant cells.","['Gollapudi, S', 'Gupta, S']","['Gollapudi S', 'Gupta S']","['Division of Basic and Clinical Immunology, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1992 Nov-Dec;12(6B):2127-32.,['AI-26465/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cloning of genes encoding this enzyme and the advent of technologies for gene transfer have introduced the possibility of somatic gene therapy for this disorder. Gene therapy may require replacement of the defective enzyme in hepatocytes, which have a greater capacity for propionate metabolism than other somatic cells and represent the principle physiological site of propionate metabolism. We describe construction of an amphotropic retroviral vector containing the human methylmalonyl-CoA mutase cDNA. This vector is shown to transduce primary MCM-deficient fibroblasts and restore levels of [14C]propionate metabolism by cultures of nonselected cells to normal. This vector will transduce primary human hepatocytes and direct transcription of recombinant human MCM from the integrated provirus.

Highly purified CD4+ T cells, depleted of antigen presenting cells (APCs), do not proliferate in response to the superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). However, CD4+ T cells do respond to SEB in the presence of the LFA-3, ICAM-1, and B7 positive erythroleukemic cell line K562, murine L cells, human B7 transfected L cells or CD28 mAb. The K562 plus SEB induced response can be inhibited by combinations of mAbs to CD2 and LFA-1, and to LFA-3, ICAM-1, and B7. Addition of CD28 mAb to the CD2 and LFA-1 inhibited cultures could restore the response. Furthermore, soluble CD28 mAb alone is able to synergize with SEB to induce a proliferative CD4+ T cell response. CD4+ T cells depleted of APCs could also be activated by a pool of four mAbs directed to the V beta 5, V beta 6, V beta 8, and V beta 12 region of the TCR when a co-stimulatory signal was provided by the CD28 mAb, while the V beta mAbs alone or in combination are unable to activate CD4+ T cells in the absence of APCs. In contrast, addition of soluble mAbs to CD2 and LFA-1 molecules failed to co-stimulate SEB activated CD4+ T lymphocytes. The kinetics of the different modes of activation are distinct. SEB induced proliferation is most efficient in the presence of autologous APCs with maximal proliferation at a log4 lower SEB concentration than when CD28 mAbs were used. SEB plus K562 activation peaks on day 7, while SEB plus CD28 mAb induced proliferative responses do not peak until day 9. Thus, superantigen mediated activation of CD4+ T cells requires co-stimulatory signals, among which CD28 has distinct and unique effects.","['Goldbach-Mansky, R', 'King, P D', 'Taylor, A P', 'Dupont, B']","['Goldbach-Mansky R', 'King PD', 'Taylor AP', 'Dupont B']","['Laboratory of Human Immunogenetics, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '39424-53-8 (enterotoxin B, staphylococcal)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'CD28 Antigens', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enterotoxins/*immunology', 'Humans', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staphylococcus aureus/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/4.12.1351 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1992 Dec;4(12):1351-60. doi: 10.1093/intimm/4.12.1351.,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49096/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These elevations were still evident at the completion of the 5 month study. A second group of cats that had been infected with FIV for almost 5 years, and with either normal or abnormally low levels of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, had similar elevations in MHC II expression, suggesting that such abnormalities are lifelong. Cats with chronic (2 year) feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection or dual FIV/FeLV infections also showed similar alterations in MHC II expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, suggesting that these alterations were not FIV specific. Feline T-lymphocytes expressed more MHC II antigen and interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor following stimulation in vitro with conconavalin A and IL-2, demonstrating that feline T-lymphocytes respond to activation signals in a manner similar to T-lymphocytes of other species. However, changes in MHC II expression on T-cells of FIV infected cats were not explainable by viral induced T-cell activation alone, because FIV infected cats with elevated MHC II expression did not have coincident elevations in IL-2 receptor expression.","['Rideout, B A', 'Moore, P F', 'Pedersen, N C']","['Rideout BA', 'Moore PF', 'Pedersen NC']","['Department of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cats', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*blood', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Up-Regulation']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(92)90122-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(92)90122-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1992 Dec;35(1-2):71-81. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(92)90122-7.,"['5T32RR07038/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI25802-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA50179-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A group of 15 SPF cats served as FIV negative controls. Nine cats of each group were vaccinated with a recombinant feline leukemia virus (FeLV) vaccine, six cats in each group with a placebo vaccine. All vaccinated cats developed high antibody titers to FeLV and were protected against subsequent FeLV challenge infection. In both control groups five of six cats became persistently infected with FeLV. Unexpectedly, the primary immune response to the vaccine antigen was significantly higher in the FIV positive group than in the FIV negative. The secondary response was stronger in the FIV negative cats. The goal of the present investigation was to further study the immune response in these 30 cats. They were immunized twice with the synthetic peptide L-tyrosine-L-glutamic acid-poly(DL-alanine)-poly(L-lysine) (TGAL) 21 days apart. Blood samples were collected on four occasions during the immunization process. They were tested for antibodies to TGAL, complete blood cell counts and CD4+, CD8+ and pan-T-lymphocyte counts. The following observations were made: (1) in contrast to the FeLV vaccine experiment, the primary immune response to TGAL was not significantly stronger in the FIV positive cats when tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (2). The absolute size of the CD4+ lymphocyte population was distinctly smaller in the FIV positive than in the FIV negative cats. The lowest CD4+ values were found in the dually FIV/FeLV infected cats. (3) A population of CD8+ lymphocytes was identified that was characterized by a distinctly weaker fluorescence. The size of this population increased in FIV positive and decreased in FIV negative cats during the TGAL immunization experiment. (4) The CD4+:CD8+ ratio increased in FIV negative cats during TGAL immunization from 1.9 to 2.3. In contrast, in FIV positive animals the CD4+:CD8+ ratio decreased significantly from 1.9 to 1.3 during the same period. From these and earlier data it was concluded that in short-term FIV infection the immune response to T-cell dependent antigens may be increased over that of the controls. Immune suppression develops gradually with duration of the infection. The significant drop of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio over a 5 week immunization period suggests that antigenic stimulation may accelerate the development of immune suppression in FIV positive cats. If this is a general feature, FIV infection may provide a particularly interesting model for studying the pathogenesis of AIDS.","['Lehmann, R', 'von Beust, B', 'Niederer, E', 'Condrau, M A', 'Fierz, W', 'Aubert, A', 'Ackley, C D', 'Cooper, M D', 'Tompkins, M B', 'Lutz, H']","['Lehmann R', 'von Beust B', 'Niederer E', 'Condrau MA', 'Fierz W', 'Aubert A', 'Ackley CD', 'Cooper MD', 'Tompkins MB', 'Lutz H']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (feline leukemia virus vaccine)', '28704-27-0 ((T,G)-A-L)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', '*CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cats', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Immunization', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/immunology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(92)90132-A [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(92)90132-a [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1992 Dec;35(1-2):199-214. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(92)90132-a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore the advantage of PMEA in clinical and immunologic improvement was diminished by the hematologic disorders, which do not allow long term treatment with this drug in the dose used.","['Hartmann, K', 'Donath, A', 'Beer, B', 'Egberink, H F', 'Horzinek, M C', 'Lutz, H', 'Hoffmann-Fezer, G', 'Thum, I', 'Thefeld, S']","['Hartmann K', 'Donath A', 'Beer B', 'Egberink HF', 'Horzinek MC', 'Lutz H', 'Hoffmann-Fezer G', 'Thum I', 'Thefeld S']","['I.

Through the binding to its ligand(s) CD54 plays a key role in cell to cell interactions leading to the immune response. Recently, CD54 expression has been investigated on hematopoietic cells: the antigen is predominantly expressed in the early stages of normal hematopoiesis and during the activation of blood cells. As regards to hematological malignancies, CD54 is strongly expressed on neoplastic cells from ""stem cell derived"" neoplasms. In AML, CD54 expression is related with other differentiation-linked molecules such as CD34 and HLA-DR and is significantly correlated with FAB morphological classification. In lymphoproliferative disorders, a high CD54 expression is associated with germinal centre lymphomas. This review summarizes our current understanding of CD54 with emphasis on recent advances and reference to unresolved issues such as its prognostic role in the clinical outcome of oncohematological diseases.","['Maio, M', 'Del Vecchio, L']","['Maio M', 'Del Vecchio L']","['Division of Experimental Oncology 2, Immunology Section, C.R.O., Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/physiology', 'CD11 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis/*physiology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199209049814 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Sep;8(1-2):23-33. doi: 10.3109/10428199209049814.,,,,,,,76,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effect of IFN-alpha on natural killer (NK) cell and lymphokine-activated cell (LAK) activity in patients with B-CLL. In vitro, IFN-alpha (500 U/ml for 18 hours) induced LAK activity in patients with B-CLL (27.7 +/- 9.9%, n = 20), and IL-2 (500 U/ml for 5 days) produced similar activity (35.9 +/- 8.8%, n = 7). Despite the induction of LAK activity by IFN-alpha and IL2 in patients with B-CLL, the malignant cells remained resistant to both allogeneic and autologous LAK effectors. NK activity in patients with B-CLL is also low (23.1 +/- 7.2%, n = 20), and B-CLL cells were resistant to NK cell activity. In cold target competition assays, CLL cells did not compete with labelled K562 or Daudi targets in the NK and LAK assays, suggesting that the malignant cells are not recognised by the effector cells, and this may be related to low level of expression of the adhesion receptors, LFA-1 and ICAM-1. Finally, CLL cells were also resistant to antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity, but were susceptible to antibody dependent complement mediated lysis. These results suggest that it is unlikely that the effects of IFN-alpha in B-CLL are due to the enhancement of NK or LAK activity.","['Jewell, A P', 'Worman, C P', 'Giles, F J', 'Goldstone, A H', 'Lydyard, P M']","['Jewell AP', 'Worman CP', 'Giles FJ', 'Goldstone AH', 'Lydyard PM']","['Department of Haematology, University College, Middlesex School of Medicine, London, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199209049804 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Aug;7(5-6):473-80. doi: 10.3109/10428199209049804.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are few data to support the conclusion that the reduction in the duration of neutropenia is associated with a superior survival. This attests to the excellent supportive care that has been developed for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.

There were no deaths related to VZV infection and only one patient had disseminated disease and post-herpetic neuralgia. These preliminary results suggest that the incidence and outcome of VZV infection after ABSCT largely parallel those reported in marrow transplant patients and that long-term acyclovir prophylaxis delays but does not prevent VZV infection.

The pneumonia resolved gradually, and he was free from symptoms within two weeks. The only significant side effect was moderately severe myelosuppression which was reversible after discontinuation of ganciclovir.

A class of bestatin sensitive N-exoaminopeptidases and a dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV-like enzyme specifically inhibited by DFP and diprotin A were detected at the surface of intact cells, as well as in highly purified HL-60 cell membranes. Cell surface proteolytic activities were investigated in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate into granulocytes or macrophages as well as on normal human myeloid cells. It was found that membrane expression of serine and N-aminopeptidases significantly increased following maturation of the HL-60 cell line and normal monocytes toward the macrophage pathway. In contrast, N-aminopeptidase expression was mainly down-regulated on HL-60 cells differentiated into granulocytes and low activity was paralleled with that expressed by normal blood granulocytes. HL-60 maturation into the granulocyte lineage however did not cause any modulation in membrane DPP IV-like enzyme. Thus, selective expression of cell surface proteases along the myeloid lineage provides a useful model system for determining the possible influence of such enzymes on normal and malignant myeloid cells.","['Laouar, A', 'Bauvois, B']","['Laouar A', 'Bauvois B']","['Unite 196 INSERM, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Aminopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*enzymology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2478(92)90222-A [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(92)90222-a [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1992 Dec;34(3):257-65. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(92)90222-a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Yorkshire Leukaemia Group.,494-501,"In a study of 870 individual patients with either lymphocytosis (excluding known lymphoproliferative disease), increased proportions of blood lymphocytes with granular morphology (LGL), or neutropenia, 14 cases were found with abnormally increased CD3+CD4+CD8+ components. Eleven of these were further investigated and 10 shown in follow-up studies to be persistent in nature. Morphological assessments revealed increased LGL in 9/11 cases, and in seven of these > 50% lymphocytes had discernable cytoplasmic granulation. Immunophenotypic studies indicated that CD8 expression by CD4+ lymphocytes in these patients was of low density (CD8dim+), and that both the CD4+CD8- and CD4+CD8dim+ fractions in each patient was characterized by a CD11b+CD16-CD56+CD57+ composite NK-associated (NKa) phenotype (in contrast to normal CD4+CD8- blood lymphocytes and CD4+CD8+ thymocytes which were consistently CD11b-CD16-CD56-CD57-). TCR genotypic studies revealed rearranged components (beta plus gamma, or beta alone) in 5/11 cases, but there were no obvious relationships between TCR configuration (including rearranged band densities) and immunophenotypes, absolute lymphocyte or neutrophil numbers, the proportions of blood LGL, or the proportions of CD4+ cells coexpressing CD8. The occurrence of identical NKa phenotypic profiles in both germline and rearranged TCR cases does, however, suggest the possibility of an evolutionary process from a non-clonal expansion to a clonal state. Serum studies, including soluble CD4, CD8 and IL2-R concentrations and autoantibody investigations, of representative germline and rearranged TCR cases failed to indicate any consistent abnormalities, but there was some suggestion for the existence of a chronic reactive process in some of the patients with germline TCR. These findings suggest that expanded LGL/NKa+ components with phenotypic evidence of CD4/CD8 coexpression should be regarded as a distinct diagnostic category and that persistent CD4+CD8+ abnormalities with germline TCR should be monitored for possible clonal transition.","['Richards, S J', 'Sivakumaran, M', 'Parapia, L A', 'Balfour, I', 'Norfolk, D R', 'Kaeda, J', 'Scott, C S']","['Richards SJ', 'Sivakumaran M', 'Parapia LA', 'Balfour I', 'Norfolk DR', 'Kaeda J', 'Scott CS']","['Leukaemia Diagnostic Unit, Cookridge Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Lymphocytosis/blood/*immunology', 'Neutropenia/blood/*immunology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06458.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Nov;82(3):494-501. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06458.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper the incidence of such co-expression, together with its biologic features and clinical relevance, was evaluated in a large series of childhood ""common"" acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) cases. METHODS: This analysis was performed retrospectively on 306 cases of childhood non-T ALL. CD2 and/or E-rosette co-expression with other non-T markers was usually shown by a clear overlap between the percentages of T and non-T markers, by the great difference between positivity for CD2 or E-rosette and other T markers, and by double staining for CD2 and CD10 in one case. Two cases were further studied by a panel of nine different CD2 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) representative of different epitopes. DNA analysis for the configuration of Ig and TCR genes (beta, gamma, and delta locus) was carried out in three cases. RESULTS: Eleven out of 306 cases (3.6%) showed CD2 and/or E-rosette co-expression in otherwise typical cALL. Data obtained in two cases with the use of nine different CD2 Mabs showed a different pattern of reactivity between leukemic B cells and normal T cells. The configuration of Ig and TCR genes was compatible with B-lineage ALL. CONCLUSIONS: CD2 and/or E-rosette co-expression was observed in a small subset of acute leukemias showing immunophenotypic and genotypic features of B-lineage ALL. A pattern of reactivity different from that seen in normal T cells was observed in the two cases tested with a large panel of CD2 MAbs. No association was found with other known prognostic factors, and 8 of these 11 patients have been in first continuous remission for 36-93 months.","['Cantu-Rajnoldi, A', 'Putti, M C', 'Schiro, R', 'Biondi, A', 'Cattoretti, G', 'Valeggio, C', 'Castagni, M', 'Basso, G']","['Cantu-Rajnoldi A', 'Putti MC', 'Schiro R', 'Biondi A', 'Cattoretti G', 'Valeggio C', 'Castagni M', 'Basso G']","['Laboratorio di Richerche Cliniche, Istituti Clinici di Perfezionamento, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'CD2 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/mortality/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Rosette Formation', 'Survival Analysis']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1992 Sep-Oct;77(5):384-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous studies have proposed putative target molecules, but have examined their role in the modulation of sensitivity to NK-mediated lysis one independently of each other. We examined the simultaneous expression of various surface molecules and the susceptibility of K562 cells to NK attack. We have previously shown that adriamycin (40 nM) and aclacinomycin (15 nM) can induce, in vitro, an increase of glycophorin A (GPA) on K562 cells, a modulation of transferrin receptor (TfR) and CD15 antigen expression and a significant resistance of cells to NK-mediated lysis. In the present work, Fc gamma receptor II (CD32) expression at the K562 cell membrane was clearly decreased after aclacinomycin-treatment but was unaltered by adriamycin-treatment. Four K562 cell clones were studied. Two clones (F and G) expressed a higher level of CD32 at the membrane (62% and 70% of erythrocyte antibody (EA) rosettes respectively) and two clones (9 and 19) expressed lower a level (18% and 7% EA rosettes respectively) than the original population (43%). The sensitivity to lysis by NK cells was increased in clones F, G and 9 but decreased in clone 19 (without alteration in the binding capacity). Relationships between the sensitivity to NK attack and the levels of simultaneous expression of CD32, TfR, CD15, glycophorin A (GPA) and MHC class I monomorphic antigens were studied. In addition, the presence at the membrane of some cellular adhesion molecules (CD54, CD58, CD29, CD18, CD56) was examined in anthracyclin-treated cells and in the four clones.

Routine CSF analysis and magnetic resonance imaging of the two patients were only partially characteristic of MS. Testing for antibodies to human T-cell leukemia virus type I [HTLV-I] in serum using a radioimmune precipitation assay revealed antibodies to HTLV-I in both patients. The infection with HTLV-I was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and liquid hybridization analysis using primers to the tax/rex region and a corresponding probe, demonstrating proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of both patients. On the basis of these findings demonstrating the presence of proviral HTLV-I DNA in the two Iranian patients, the initial diagnosis of MS was corrected to that of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM). In contrast, several patients with definite MS (nine from Germany, two from Iran) with a relapsing and remitting form of the disease were tested for HTLV-I infection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PCR, which yielded negative results. However, the mother of one HAM patient was found to be infected with HTLV-I. To support an association between HTLV-I infection and CNS disease in the two HAM patients, we analyzed the production of specific IgG antibodies within the CNS based on a simple enzyme immunoassay for viral IgG antibodies in CSF and serum.

The present studies used flow cytometric cell cycle analysis, indirect immunofluorescence staining of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and thymidine incorporation assay of cell proliferation to study the effects of activin A on the cell cycle during differentiation in K562 cells. Activin A-treated K562 cells were found to undergo a transient block in cell cycle, temporarily halting progression from G1 to S phase. The latter can be observed after approximately 24 hr of incubation with activin A and then disappears after this early stage of induction of differentiation. Cell cycle kinetics analysis using synchronized K562 cells also confirms that in the presence of activin A, K562 cells progress normally through various phases of cell cycle, except that there is prolongation of the G1 phase between 10 to 24 hr of culture. Furthermore, this transient arrest in G1 is correlated with dephosphorylation of a nucleoprotein, the RB gene product, which occurs within 9-24 hr of incubation with activin A; and phosphorylation of RB protein then develops afterward. In addition, these cell cycle-related events are observed to occur earlier than the accumulation of hemoglobins in K562 cells. It is concluded that transient dephosphorylation of RB protein and prolongation of G1 phase of cell cycle precede and accompany erythroid differentiation caused by activin A and chemical inducers, thus constituting part of the mechanism for induction of differentiation in the erythroleukemia cells.","['Sehy, D W', 'Shao, L E', 'Yu, A L', 'Tsai, W M', 'Yu, J']","['Sehy DW', 'Shao LE', 'Yu AL', 'Tsai WM', 'Yu J']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Activins', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240500306 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1992 Nov;50(3):255-65. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240500306.,['DK40218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to examine the role of target cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; CD54), a ligand of lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) (CD11a/CD18), we exposed the human leukemia cell line, HL-60, to a variety of agents implicated in modulating ICAM-1 expression and/or sensitivity to lymphocyte cytolysis. Exposure of HL-60 cells to retinoic acid (RA), interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma induced protection from lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cytolysis. Only RA and IFN-gamma induced ICAM-1 expression. Tumor necrosis factor and vitamin D3, which also induced ICAM-1 expression, increased HL-60 sensitivity to LAK lysis. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor also increased sensitivity to LAK lysis; ICAM-1 was not induced. The state of cellular differentiation and expression of class I and II MHC antigens also did not correlate with sensitivity to LAK cytolysis. Exposure of untreated HL-60 cells and HL-60 cells expressing ICAM-1 to monoclonal antibody (mAb) versus ICAM-1 did not modulate LAK sensitivity. Exposure of LAK cells to mAb versus LFA-1 partially inhibited cytolysis; mAb versus CD18 inhibited cytolysis more completely. HL-60 cells were resistant to natural killer lysis; exposure to the various experimental agents did not alter sensitivity. We conclude that leukemic cell sensitivity to LAK cytolysis can be modulated by a variety of agents. Although our results suggest a role for leukocyte CD11/CD18 adhesion molecules in LAK cytolysis, the poor correlation between ICAM-1 expression and sensitivity to LAK lysis suggest that interactions other than LFA-1/ICAM-1 conjugation may be more central to the processes involved.","['Triozzi, P L', 'Eicher, D M', 'Smoot, J', 'Rinehart, J J']","['Triozzi PL', 'Eicher DM', 'Smoot J', 'Rinehart JJ']","['Department of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/*physiology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*pathology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/drug effects/pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Oct;20(9):1072-6.,['2P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the long latency period between infection and development of ATLL, as well as the small fraction of the infected population that actually develops this disease, suggest that additional factors are involved in its pathogenesis. Therefore, we performed a molecular analysis of 10 cases of ATLL presenting in a nonendemic area that were shown to have HTLV-I sequences by polymerase chain reaction as well as clonal T-cell receptor beta gene rearrangements. We analyzed these cases for alterations in some of the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes frequently involved in hematopoietic neoplasia. Specifically, we used a single-strand conformation polymorphism assay to determine the presence of mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, as well as the K-RAS, N-RAS, H-RAS, and c-myc oncogenes. In addition, we studied the c-myc gene for rearrangements by Southern blotting and assessed expression of the retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53 genes by immunostaining. Analysis of the c-myc gene and the RAS family of oncogenes did not show any alterations. Also, the Rb gene was expressed in all cases analyzed. However, we found mutations of the p53 gene in 3 of the 10 cases and these results were confirmed by sequence analysis. In two of these cases, we showed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of chromosome 17p sequences that the p53 mutations were accompanied by a loss of heterozygocity. Also, these mutations correlated with an altered pattern of p53 expression. Thus, mutations in the p53 locus may be a cofactor for the development of ATLL in some cases, whereas the c-myc, Rb, and RAS genes do not appear to be involved in these neoplasms.","['Cesarman, E', 'Chadburn, A', 'Inghirami, G', 'Gaidano, G', 'Knowles, D M']","['Cesarman E', 'Chadburn A', 'Inghirami G', 'Gaidano G', 'Knowles DM']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Exons', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, myc', '*Genes, p53', 'Genes, ras', 'Genotype', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/blood/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/genetics']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85922-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Dec 15;80(12):3205-16.,"['CA48236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['H-RAS', 'K-RAS', 'Ki-67', 'N-RAS', 'RAS', 'Rb', 'c-myc', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The wide variety of TFs involved in these translocations and the different stages of cellular maturation argue against a unifying mechanism. Recombinases, active during B-cell and T-cell development, have been implicated in gene arrangements involving TCR genes and in the SIL/SCL rearrangement, which involves two genes not normally rearranged. However, other mechanisms must clearly be active in generating these molecular abnormalities and perhaps they relate to the multistep maturation and differentiation processes and continuous cell turnover seen in hematopoietic cells. The difficulties in obtaining human solid tumor samples may make it more difficult to identify translocations involving TF genes in solid tumors. Recently, the cytogenetic analysis of solid tumors has improved and specific cytogenetic abnormalities have been associated with specific types of tumors. With advanced techniques, such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (a technique that does not depend on cell growth) and PCR, abnormalities involving TF genes will be discovered. Abnormalities of TF genes, other than translocations, have been seen in a broad variety of nonhematopoietic malignancies. The p53 protein has been shown to bind DNA in a sequence-specific fashion and interact with a variety of DNA tumor virus oncoproteins. The broad range of cell types that harbor p53 abnormalities suggests that TF abnormalities will likely be implicated in many solid tumors. We have detailed several examples of how gene rearrangements that accompany chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia can alter the expression or activity of cellular TFs. Several translocations generate fusion RNA transcripts and fusion TF proteins with altered functional characteristics. Other translocations result in the expression of a gene not normally detectable in hematopoietic cells or alter the level of its expression, or affect the promoter usage or exon structure of the gene (Table 2). Studies are underway in many laboratories to characterize the biologic activity of these abnormal TFs and it remains to be proven that these molecular abnormalities are directly linked with leukemogenesis. The identification of abnormal fusion transcripts and proteins may allow specific therapies to be directed against ""tumor-specific"" DNA, mRNA, or protein targets. Therapeutic strategies based on antisense or ribozyme technology may be used to turn off expression of these genes and inhibit leukemia cell growth. Immunologic methods can also be used to direct therapy against the malignant cells.","['Nichols, J', 'Nimer, S D']","['Nichols J', 'Nimer SD']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Oncogenes', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85893-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Dec 15;80(12):2953-63.,['DK43025/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,"['E2A', 'HOX 1', 'Hox 2.3', 'Hox 2.4', 'MyoD', 'PBX', 'Ttg-1', 'Ttg-2', 'c-fos', 'c-jun', 'c-myc', 'fos', 'jun', 'lyl-1', 'myc', 'tal-1', 'v-jun']",,,,118,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have been generally well tolerated in large clinical trials; however, each of them is myelosuppressive and immunosuppressive.

Resistance of cultured tumor cells to major classes of cytotoxic drugs is frequently due to expression of a plasma membrane P-glycoprotein encoded by MDR genes. We have demonstrated that liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is more toxic than the free drug and that it modulates MDR in Chinese hamster LZ cells and human colon cancer cells. PURPOSE: To investigate further the association between expression of P-glycoprotein and modulation of MDR by liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin, we studied vincristine-resistant HL-60/VCR leukemia cells, which express P-glycoprotein, and doxorubicin-resistant HL-60/ADR leukemia cells, which do not. METHODS: Cells were exposed to various concentrations of free doxorubicin and liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin. The cellular content of doxorubicin was determined by fluorescence analysis, and cytotoxicity was determined by cell growth inhibition. Photoaffinity-labeling studies of P-glycoprotein binding were performed on HL-60/VCR and HL-60/ADR cells and KB-GSV2 cells transfected with the MDR1 gene (also known as PGY1). RESULTS: The concentrations that caused 50% inhibition of growth (IC50) for free doxorubicin in HL-60, HL-60/ADR, and HL-60/VCR cells were 30 nM, 9 microM, and 0.9 microM, respectively. The values for liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin in parental HL-60 cells and HL-60/ADR cells were 20 nM and 9 microM, respectively, indicating little or no sensitization. In contrast, HL-60/VCR cells were fivefold more sensitive to liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin than to free doxorubicin, and IC50 was reduced to 0.17 microM. In HL-60 cells exposed to liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin, intracellular doxorubicin accumulation was less than that seen with free drug. In contrast, in HL-60/VCR cells, accumulation was twofold to threefold higher than that with free doxorubicin. Liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin completely inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein by azidopine in membrane vesicles of HL-60/VCR cells, with a potency comparable to that of azidopine, suggesting that circumvention of MDR by liposomes is related to their specific interaction with P-glycoprotein. The studies with KB-GSV2 cells indicated that blank liposomes can directly inhibit photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin in overcoming resistance in the multidrug-resistant phenotype of HL-60/VCR cells by direct interaction with P-glycoprotein. Furthermore, they indicate that liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin may be an effective treatment for human cancers.","['Rahman, A', 'Husain, S R', 'Siddiqui, J', 'Verma, M', 'Agresti, M', 'Center, M', 'Safa, A R', 'Glazer, R I']","['Rahman A', 'Husain SR', 'Siddiqui J', 'Verma M', 'Agresti M', 'Center M', 'Safa AR', 'Glazer RI']","['Department of Medicine, Vincent T.

In our attempts to obtain a panel of cell lines demonstrating differential patterns in sensitivity, we have developed three SCLC lines exhibiting different types of multidrug resistance (MDR). In the present investigations we compared the sensitivity patterns shown by five wild-type SCLC lines and three MDR lines in response to six different types of drugs: doxorubicin, cytarabine, carmustine, cisplatin, vincristine, and etoposide. In the wild-type SCLC cell lines, the range of variation in sensitivity to all drugs was within a factor of 10. Cell lines showing low sensitivity to doxorubicin also exhibited low sensitivity to etoposide and vincristine, and vice versa. In contrast, the pattern of sensitivity to carmustine was almost the opposite of that to doxorubicin. A tendency to an inverse relationship between doxorubicin and carmustine sensitivity was also observed when doxorubicin sensitivity was reduced in near stationary cells and in cells exposed to the metabolic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose. In agreement with the pattern observed for the wild-type lines, all of the MDR sublines demonstrated collateral sensitivity to carmustine. As to cytarabine, the wild-type lines expressed a sensitivity pattern similar to that shown in response to doxorubicin. Interestingly, the opposite pattern was found in the MDR lines, as all three demonstrated cytarabine hypersensitivity. The combination of alkylating agents and ""MDR"" drugs are of proven clinical benefit in the treatment of solid tumors, as is the combination of anthracycline and cytarabine in acute myeloid leukemia. The experimentally derived sensitivity data on cytarabine, alkylating agents, and MDR drugs (i.e., etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine) thus resemble the clinical experience with these drugs, and we conclude that the use of a clonogenic assay on the described panel of SCLC cell lines can give valuable information for the selection of agents for combination therapy.","['Jensen, P B', 'Roed, H', 'Sehested, M', 'Demant, E J', 'Vindelov, L', 'Christensen, I J', 'Hansen, H H']","['Jensen PB', 'Roed H', 'Sehested M', 'Demant EJ', 'Vindelov L', 'Christensen IJ', 'Hansen HH']","['Department of Oncology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Carmustine/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00695993 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1992;31(1):46-52. doi: 10.1007/BF00695993.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rapid, highly sensitive, and nonradioactive technique based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for that purpose. In this technique, called differential PCR, the target (MDR 1) and a reference gene (beta 2-microglobulin) are co-amplified by PCR from random hexamer-primed cDNA in the same reaction vessel. The level of target gene expression is reflected in the ratio between the intensities of the two resulting PCR product bands, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). MDR 1 gene expression was detectable in 29/30 (97%) patients with CLL, with a median expression level of 0.36 U (human placenta = 1 U). There was no correlation between expression of the MDR 1 gene and clinical stage, time from diagnosis, absolute lymphocyte count, several lymphocyte surface markers, or prior treatment in the patients analyzed. Immunocytochemical studies of the same material using the monoclonal antibody C219 showed a very low or undetectable expression of the P-glycoprotein in the lymphocytes of all patients studied, whereas granulocytes were significantly more immunoreactive. We conclude that the level of expression of the MDR 1 gene in CLL is generally low, that the removal of granulocytes is important in studies of expression of MDR 1 mRNA in CLL, and that differential PCR provides a rapid and reliable method for quantifying the amount of a specific mRNA, even in very small samples of total RNA.","['Rochlitz, C F', 'de Kant, E', 'Neubauer, A', 'Heide, I', 'Bohmer, R', 'Oertel, J', 'Huhn, D', 'Herrmann, R']","['Rochlitz CF', 'de Kant E', 'Neubauer A', 'Heide I', 'Bohmer R', 'Oertel J', 'Huhn D', 'Herrmann R']","['Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie, Freien Universitat, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01836067 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1992 Dec;65(6):241-6. doi: 10.1007/BF01836067.,,,['MDR1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of verapamil (VRP) as a chemosensitizer was studied in relation to the expression of the membrane efflux pump P-glycoprotein (PGP) as determined by a semiquantitative flow-cytometric proceder. A slight positive correlation was found between the fraction of cells expressing PGP and the ID50 values for ADM and VCR, but not between cellular PGP content and sensitivity to IDA. The overall data showed no significant sensitization effect of VRP. However, in specimens with more than 10% cells expressing PGP, 2 microM VRP sensitized cells to ADM and VCR significantly. The median of sensitization ratios (SRs), i.e., the ratios of cytotoxic drug ID50 in the absence/presence of VRP, were 1.89 and 2.0, respectively. No sensitizing effect of VRP on the cytotoxicity of IDA was observed. Related to the clinical status, the median fraction of PGP-positive blasts was elevated fourfold in pretreated patients (n = 16) in comparison to patients with de novo AML (n = 19). No differences in ID50 values were observed between newly diagnosed and pretreated patients. However, SRs for ADM and VCR were higher in samples of pretreated patients compared with de novo AML. PGP-mediated cellular drug resistance may thus be circumvented in leukemic blasts by application of chemosensitizers or, potentially, alternative anthracyclines.","['Muller, M R', 'Lennartz, K', 'Boogen, C', 'Nowrousian, M R', 'Rajewsky, M F', 'Seeber, S']","['Muller MR', 'Lennartz K', 'Boogen C', 'Nowrousian MR', 'Rajewsky MF', 'Seeber S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, West Germany Cancer Center Essen, University of Essen Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Colorimetry', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01703946 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1992 Nov;65(5):206-12. doi: 10.1007/BF01703946.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a 1 h incubation with daunorubicin (DNR), the right angle scatter (RAS), forward angle scatter (FAS), and specific fluorescence (Fluo) were measured in sensitive and resistant cells; only Fluo was related qualitatively, but not quantitatively, to resistance. Various incubation conditions were examined. When the pH of the incubation medium increased, the DNR retention increased in sensitive and resistant cells. In contrast, when the cell concentration increased, the DNR retention decreased. Using sensitive and resistant cell lines, a proportion of resistant cells lower than 10% can be detected in a mixture. To analyse cells from solid tumours, the cells were dissociated by repeated fine needle aspirations. Tumours from 22 patients have been processed with this technique; 8 samples were classified as S (sensitive); 2 as R (resistant); and 12 as I (intermediate). Further experiments were run to study and improve the method. Another method of detection of dead cells was tested. The intra-assay variability of the technique was found to be less than 10%. When the study was performed with different fragments of the same tumour, the variation, corresponding to the tumour heterogeneity, rose to 21 to 36%. The inter-assay reproducibility was too bad, so a variant of this technique has been adapted, using verapamil or cyclosporin A, which is able to block DNR efflux; this new method allows tumour cells to be used as their own controls.","['Carpentier, Y', 'Gorisse, M C', 'Desoize, B']","['Carpentier Y', 'Gorisse MC', 'Desoize B']","['Institut Jean Godinot, GIBSA, BP 171, Reims, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Culture Media', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nephelometry and Turbidimetry', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990130611 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1992;13(6):630-7. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990130611.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The synthetic peptide elicited a strong antibody response to the HTLV-I envelope protein gp46; however, these antibodies failed to inhibit HTLV-I-mediated cell fusion. Immunized rabbits were not protected from HTLV-I infection as determined by seroconversion to viral core proteins by immunoblot, HTLV-I p24 antigen detection in lymphocyte cultures and polymerase chain reaction for the HTLV-I provirus in lymphocyte DNA. Env-5 peptide immunization failed to induce T-cell lymphocyte proliferative responses in rabbits, but induced antibody responses in T-cell deficient Balb c nu/nu mice suggesting that the antigenic determinant represented by the Env-5 peptide is primarily a B-cell epitope.

Using the monoclonal antibody C219 and flow cytometric analysis, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was found to be expressed in all peripheral blood (PB) subpopulations (CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19, CD56) except granulocytes. To specifically determine MDR1 gene expression, these PB subpopulations were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and analyzed for MDR1 mRNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All subsets were positive by PCR, but only minimal MDR1 mRNA was detected in monocytes and granulocytes. Significant efflux of Rhodamine-123 (Rh-123), a measure of P-gp function, was detected in CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, CD19+, and CD56+ cells but not in granulocytes. Next, PCR-analysis was performed on FACS-sorted bone marrow (BM) cells to assess MDR1 expression in different maturational stages. Precursors (CD34+), early and late myeloid cells (CD33+/CD34+, CD33+/CD34-) as well as lymphocytes of the B-cell lineage (CD19+/CD10+, CD19+/CD10-) expressed the MDR1 gene. BM monocytic cells (CD33++/CD34-) were negative, and a very weak signal was detected in erythroid cells (glycophorin A+). Significant Rh-123 efflux was found in CD34+, CD10+, CD33+, and CD33++ BM cells, but not in glycophorin A+ cells. We conclude that PB and BM lymphocytes, PB monocytes, BM progenitors, and immature myeloid cells, but not late BM monocytes, erythroid cells, and PB granulocytes, express MDR1 mRNA and a functional P-gp.

Depending on the cell line S9788 was shown to be two to five times more active and five to 15 times more potent than Verapamil (VRP) in increasing ADR accumulation in resistant cells. ADR retention in KB-A1 cells maintained in a concentration of 10 microM S9788 was twice that in VRP-treated cells, and similar to that measured in the untreated sensitive KB-3-1 cells. Although 5 microM S9788 and 50 microM VRP gave the same values of ADR uptake in KB-A1 cells, S9788 was shown to induce a greater ADR retention following cell wash and post-incubation in resistance modifier- and ADR-free medium. Taking into account that S9788 had no effects on ADR accumulation and retention in sensitive KB-3-1 cells, it can be suggested that S9788 inhibits specifically the P-gp dependent ADR efflux, and in a manner less reversible than that observed with VRP. Moreover, [3H]azidopine photolabeling of P-gp, in P388/ADR plasma membranes, was completely inhibited by 100 microM S9788. Although S9788, as VRP, had no effect on the cell cycle of P388 cells, 5 microM S9788 increased 700-fold the efficacy of ADR to block P388/ADR cells in the G2+M phase of the cell cycle. Together, these results show that the sensitization, by S9788, of cell lines resistant to ADR is mainly due to an increase in ADR accumulation and retention, leading to an increase in the number of resistant cells blocked in the G2+M phase.","['Leonce, S', 'Pierre, A', 'Anstett, M', 'Perez, V', 'Genton, A', 'Bizzari, J P', 'Atassi, G']","['Leonce S', 'Pierre A', 'Anstett M', 'Perez V', 'Genton A', 'Bizzari JP', 'Atassi G']","['Division de cancerologie experimentale, Institut de Recherches Servier, Suresnes, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Triazines)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '140945-01-3 (S 9788)', '63XR70204A (azidopine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azides/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Dihydropyridines/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lung', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Triazines/*pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1992/11/03 00:00,1992/11/03 00:01,['1992/11/03 00:00'],"['1992/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(92)90063-O [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(92)90063-o [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1992 Nov 3;44(9):1707-15. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(92)90063-o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Key enzymes in this metabolism are the cytosolic thymidine kinase (TK1), the mitochondrial thymidine kinase (TK2) and the cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). These enzymes are expressed differently in different tissues and cell cycle phases, and they display overlapping substrate specificities. Thymidine is phosphorylated by both thymidine kinases, and deoxycytidine is phosphorylated by both dCK and TK2. The enzymes also phosphorylate nucleoside analogs with very different efficiencies. Here we present specific radiochemical assays for the three kinase activities utilizing analogs as substrates that are by more than 90 percent phosphorylated solely by one of the kinases; i.e. 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) as substrate for TK1, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylthymidine (AraT) for TK2 and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA) for dCK. We determined the fraction of the total deoxycytidine and thymidine phosphorylating activity that was provided by each of the three enzymes in different human cells and tissues, such as resting and proliferating lymphocytes, lymphocytic cells of leukemia patients (chronic lymphocytic, chronic myeloic and hairy cell leukemia), muscle, brain and gastrointestinal tissue. The detailed knowledge of the pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside kinase activities and substrate specificities are of importance for studies on chemotherapeutically active nucleoside analogs, and the assays and data presented here should be valuable tools in that research.","['Arner, E S', 'Spasokoukotskaja, T', 'Eriksson, S']","['Arner ES', 'Spasokoukotskaja T', 'Eriksson S']","['Department of Biochemistry I, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'NS9U4BEG7Y (thymine arabinoside)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Arabinonucleosides/metabolism', 'Cladribine/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphorylation', 'Radioisotope Dilution Technique', 'Reference Values', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thymidine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Thymidine Kinase/*analysis/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zidovudine/metabolism']",1992/10/30 00:00,1992/10/30 00:01,['1992/10/30 00:00'],"['1992/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-291X(92)91114-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(92)91114-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1992 Oct 30;188(2):712-8. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(92)91114-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulation by cytosolic phosphatases.,69-77,"The role of cytosolic and membrane-associated phosphatases in regulating dephosphorylation of the CD3 antigen gamma-chain has been investigated using streptolysin-O-permeabilized T lymphoblasts and Jurkat T leukaemia cells. Permeabilization of T cells caused a rapid extrusion of cytosolic type 2A phosphatases, but a membrane-associated phosphorylase phosphatase activity remained inside the cells. This activity had the properties characteristic of type 2A phosphatases, being resistant to inhibition by type 1 phosphatase inhibitors, though it was inhibited in a time-dependent manner by ATP or by non-hydrolysable ATP analogues, but not by GTP, CTP, ITP or PPi. The membrane-associated type 2A phosphatase in permeabilized cells did not dephosphorylate the CD3 antigen gamma-chain, suggesting that cytosolic phosphatases dephosphorylate the gamma-chain in situ. Cross-linking the CD2 and CD3 antigens with a bivalent monoclonal antibody in the absence of cytosolic phosphatases induced marked phosphorylation of the CD3 gamma-chain, immunoprecipitated using a novel gamma-chain peptide analogue directed antiserum (TG1). Phosphorylation was inhibited by a protein kinase C (PKC) pseudosubstrate inhibitor, indicating that CD2/CD3-induced gamma-chain phosphorylation is a PKC-mediated event. Activation of T cells either with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate or by CD2-CD3 cross-linking caused [32P]Pi incorporation into the same gamma-chain Ser residues. The site-mapping data suggested that PKC in situ may incorporate phosphate at the CD3 gamma-chain Ser-123 and Ser-126 residues, but that phosphate is rapidly lost from Ser-123 by cytosolic phosphatase action. Our findings underline the importance of the dual actions of kinases and phosphatases as potential regulators of T cell antigen-receptor complex function.","['Alexander, D R', 'Brown, M H', 'Tutt, A L', 'Crumpton, M J', 'Shivnan, E']","['Alexander DR', 'Brown MH', 'Tutt AL', 'Crumpton MJ', 'Shivnan E']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics Research, Babraham, Cambridge, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '0 (streptolysin O)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'CD2 Antigens', 'CD3 Complex/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Streptolysins', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology/immunology']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2880069 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1992 Nov 15;288 ( Pt 1):69-77. doi: 10.1042/bj2880069.,,,,PMC1132081,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fluorescent characteristics of fluorescein were conserved in FTI after linkage with the thiol NEP inhibitor. FTI inhibited NEP with an IC50 value of 10 nM and a good selectivity compared to that of aminopeptidase N (greater than 100 microM) and angiotensin converting enzyme (32 microM). The FTI probe was shown to detect membrane-bound NEP using photomicroscopy on cultured cells or flow cytometry techniques. Using NEP-expressing MDCK cells and episcopic fluorescence microscopy, a specific labeling was obtained with 100 nM FTI which was completely displaced by 10 microM HACBOGly, a specific and potent inhibitor of NEP. Therefore, FTI can be considered a suitable tool for following cellular NEP traffic. In flow cytometry, the fluorescent probe FTI, used at concentrations as low as 1 nM with Reh6 cells, could be very useful for detecting NEP/CALLA on lymphoid cells. In addition, the recognition of FTI is independent of tissues and species, a major advantage of inhibitors over monoclonal antibodies.","['Milhiet, P E', 'Dennin, F', 'Giocondi, M C', 'Le Grimellec, C', 'Garbay-Jaureguiberry, C', 'Boucheix, C', 'Roques, B P']","['Milhiet PE', 'Dennin F', 'Giocondi MC', 'Le Grimellec C', 'Garbay-Jaureguiberry C', 'Boucheix C', 'Roques BP']","['Departement de Chimie Organique, U266 INSERM, URA D1500 CNRS, Faculte de Pharmacie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '145724-06-7', ""(N-(fluoresceinyl)-N'-(1-(6-(3-mercapto-2-benzyl-1-oxopropyl)amino)-1-hexyl)thioc"", 'arbamide)', '6F82C6Q54C (Phenylthiourea)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.15.1 (Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Aminopeptidases/analysis', 'Animals', 'CD13 Antigens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dogs', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins', '*Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Neprilysin/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/metabolism', 'Phenylthiourea/analogs & derivatives', 'Photomicrography', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-2697(92)90578-U [pii]', '10.1016/0003-2697(92)90578-u [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1992 Aug 15;205(1):57-64. doi: 10.1016/0003-2697(92)90578-u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These blots, when probed with a cDNA specific for v-H-ras, revealed a 7.0-kilobase (kb) H-ras-related transcript (designated HRRT) in UMR 106-01 cells that was not expressed in other osteoblastic cells. Osteoblast-enriched calvarial cells expressed the typical 1.1-kb H-ras mRNA, which was absent in UMR cells. Additionally, Western blots of lysates of UMR cells documented the presence of three proteins immunologically related to H-rasp21. To determine whether HRRT represented a recombinant retrovirus product, Northern blots were probed with a cDNA specific for the highly conserved gag-pol region of Moloney murine leukemia virus. These blots showed parallel cross-reactivity with an apparently identical transcript of 7.0 kb.

These include studies of the dose level of a particular regimen (e.g., CBV). There is some suggestion in the literature that a dose response effect exists even at high doses. Studies of the relative merits of different drugs such as cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and hydroxyurea that have all been added to the CBV regimen need to be carried out. The contribution of TBI also remains uncertain. However, these studies require prospective, randomized trials that will probably have to be performed on a multi-institutional basis.

Furthermore, following therapy, serological monitoring of these cytokines may be considered a useful tool for controlling therapeutic efficacy and for detection of minimal residual disease. Eighteen HCL patients, treated with 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg daily for 7 days, entered the study all of them showing increased levels of sIL-2R and TNF-alpha prior to therapy. After therapy, serum levels were reassessed and a remarkable decrease was recorded in all cases. In particular, after 1 month by the end of treatment sIL-2R and TNF-alpha decreased from 3,377 +/- 2,303 to 149 +/- 96 pM/ml (p = 0.00003) and from 38 +/- 41 to 18 +/- 18 pg/ml (p = 0.015) respectively. The only 3 patients who did not normalize sIL-2R and TNF-alpha levels showed also an evident persistence of the disease in the marrow. In conclusion, 2-CdA leads to a rapid normalization of the increased levels of sIL-2R and TNF-alpha in the majority of HCL patients.

During early recovery from marrow aplasia, when WBC reached 0.3-1.5 x 10--9/L, peripheral blood stem cells (BSC) were collected by 4-8 leukapheresis consecutively. BSC collected from the 2/3 patients with CP-CML resulted Ph-negative and PCR negative. In 8 out of 26 BP-CML patients, BSC resulted Ph-negative and in two cases PCR negative. Of the nine ALL patients, 6 patients lost the cytogenetic translocations, one patient died during aplasia, two patients did not have cytogenetic modifications and died in few weeks of leukemia and one patient out of six responding patients relapsed before transplant. After complete recovery, 15 patients (BP-CML:8 patients; CP-CML:2 patients; ALL:5 patients) were subsequently given high-dose therapy (VP-16 +/- Cy+TBI in single dose) followed by reinfusion of ""normal"" BSC. Both the patients in CP-CML and 5/5 patients with ALL maintain clinical and cytogenetic remission; all the patients transplanted in BP-CML relapsed 5-18 months post-transplant. It is concluded that intensive conventional chemotherapy employed in CML and ALL can lead to a precocious overshoot of cytogenetically normal BSC.","['Carella, A M', 'Pollicardo, N', 'Raffo, M R', 'Podesta, M', 'Carlier, P', 'Valbonesi, M', 'Lercari, G', 'Vitale, V', 'Gallamini, A']","['Carella AM', 'Pollicardo N', 'Raffo MR', 'Podesta M', 'Carlier P', 'Valbonesi M', 'Lercari G', 'Vitale V', 'Gallamini A']","['ABMT Section, Osp.

This method detects the codon 72 polymorphism of the p53 gene, allowing identification of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the p53 gene. In this study, at least two specimens were obtained from each patient to compare the allele status at different points of clinical course. Of 21 cases examined 7 were heterozygous at this polymorphic site and were evaluable for LOH study. Only one patient of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) lost the heterozygosity in the specimen of her last relapse. Leukemic cells from her repeated relapses including the last one revealed to have the clonally rearranged immunoglobulin H chain gene of the same size, indicating that alteration of the p53 gene in this patient might account for the lethal relapse as a clonal evolution event. Northern-blot analysis of the p53 gene showed that one case of CD7(+) ALL had altered p53 mRNA. Overall, it is demonstrated that alterations of the p53 gene might be involved in the pathogenesis or progression of at least some human leukemias, although the alterations in leukemias seemed to be not as frequent as in solid tumors.","['Miwa, H', 'Kita, K', 'Saya, H', 'Otsuji, A', 'Masuya, M', 'Nishii, K', 'Morita, N', 'Takakura, N', 'Ohishi, K', 'Nasu, K']","['Miwa H', 'Kita K', 'Saya H', 'Otsuji A', 'Masuya M', 'Nishii K', 'Morita N', 'Takakura N', 'Ohishi K', 'Nasu K', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(92)90049-d [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992 Nov;16(11):1105-12. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90049-d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-12 synergizes with lectins and phorbol diesters to induce proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral blood T lymphocytes. In the case of phorbol-diester-induced proliferation, the effect of IL-12 is in part mediated by induced IL-2 production, as suggested by the observation that IL-12 enhances IL-2 production in these cultures and that anti-IL-2 antibodies inhibit proliferation. IL-12 synergizes also with anti-CD3 antibodies and with allogeneic stimulation in MLC in inducing T cell proliferation. IL-12 alone is mitogenic for preactivated T and NK lymphoblasts. This mitogenic effect is observed with similar doses of IL-12 on NK lymphoblasts as well as on CD4+ and CD8+ TCR-alpha beta+ and on TCR-gamma delta+ lymphoblasts. On TCR-alpha beta+ T lymphocytes the effect of IL-12 is always additive to that of IL-2 over a wide dose range. The same effect is observed on highly activated, actively proliferating NK cells. However, on NK and TCR-gamma delta+ lymphoblasts reverting to a resting state after stimulation and on a TCR-gamma delta+ acute leukemia-derived T cell line, IL-12 inhibits significantly the proliferation induced by moderate to high doses (10 to 100 U/ml) of IL-2. This inhibitory effect is, at least in part, indirect, and depends on IL-12-induced production of TNF. Neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies, but not anti-IFN-gamma and anti-transforming growth factor antibodies, restore by more than 70% the inhibition of proliferation induced by IL-12 in these cultures. However, TNF alone cannot mimic the inhibitory effect of IL-12 on the IL-2-induced proliferation of NK and TCR-gamma delta+ lymphoblasts, suggesting the involvement of additional mechanisms. The relevance of these findings for the biology of lymphocyte subsets mediating MHC nonrestricted cytotoxicity is discussed.","['Perussia, B', 'Chan, S H', ""D'Andrea, A"", 'Tsuji, K', 'Santoli, D', 'Pospisil, M', 'Young, D', 'Wolf, S F', 'Trinchieri, G']","['Perussia B', 'Chan SH', ""D'Andrea A"", 'Tsuji K', 'Santoli D', 'Pospisil M', 'Young D', 'Wolf SF', 'Trinchieri G']","['Jefferson Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-12', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Dec 1;149(11):3495-502.,"['CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37155/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Full-length cDNA analysis reveals an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 548 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 61,740. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited 98% identity to the human cellular transglutaminase sequence. The cysteine at position 277 in the active site and the putative Ca(2+)-binding pocket at residues 446-453 of cellular transglutaminase are conserved. Such evidence predicts that the encoded protein product is likely to be a transglutaminase homologue (TGase-H). Immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translation products from a synthetic TGase-H mRNA and from total protein of cultured erythroleukemia HEL cells revealed a protein with a molecular weight of 63,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Northern blot analysis of HEL cells and normal human fibroblast cells WI-38 using a cellular TGase probe detected the 1.9- and 4.0-kb RNA species at a relative abundance of 1:3 and 1:7, respectively. The 3'-end of the human cellular transglutaminase mRNA was also cloned and sequenced to allow comparison to the 3'-end of TGase-H reported here. This new piece gives a full length of 4012 nucleotides (4.0 kb) for human cellular transglutaminase. Comparison of the 5'-end (bases 1-1747) of the 1.9- and 4.0-kb cDNA sequences revealed a very high degree of identity. Beginning with base 1748, the sequences diverge showing no homology.

A familial form of monosomy 7 has been recognized in which two or more siblings develop MPS or AML before age 20. We tested the hypothesis that a recessive cancer susceptibility locus on chromosome 7 was important in the pathogenesis of leukemia in familial monosomy 7 by determining the parental origins of the chromosome 7 retained in the bone marrows of three pairs of affected siblings. We found no overlapping region where all three pairs retained DNA derived from the same paternal or maternal chromosome.

Because IMP DH activity is rate limiting for de novo biosynthesis of GTP, this enzyme was suggested as a sensitive target for chemotherapy. Tiazofurin (2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide) is converted in the cells into the active metabolite, TAD, (thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide) which potently inhibits IMP DH activity. By adding TAD to tissue extracts one can determine the extent of inhibition of IMP DH. We applied the IMP DH assay method to extracts of normal ovaries (N = 11) and epithelial ovarian carcinomas (N = 10). The IMP DH activity (mean +/- SE) in ovarian carcinoma was 21.1 +/- 5.8 which was markedly higher than that observed in normal ovaries (2.9 +/- 0.7 nmol/hr/mg protein) (P < 0.05%). The inhibition by TAD of IMP DH activity in ovarian carcinomas (N = 4) was 81%. The results indicate that IMP DH activity is elevated sevenfold in ovarian carcinomas as compared to normal ovary and can be inhibited by exposure to tiazofurin (TAD). Similar high IMP DH activity and inhibition of the activity by TAD was observed in patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis among whom 70 to 80% remissions were reported. Since there is increased IMP DH activity in human ovarian carcinomas and in OVCAR-5 cells and tiazofurin and TAD inhibit IMP DH activity of these cells and the proliferation of human ovarian carcinoma xenografts in the mouse, tiazofurin may merit serious consideration for a Phase II trial for patients with recurrent/refractory epithelial ovarian carcinoma.","['Look, K Y', 'Sutton, G P', 'Natsumeda, Y', 'Eble, J N', 'Stehman, F B', 'Ehrlich, C E', 'Olah, E', 'Prajda, N', 'Bosze, P', 'Eckhardt, S']","['Look KY', 'Sutton GP', 'Natsumeda Y', 'Eble JN', 'Stehman FB', 'Ehrlich CE', 'Olah E', 'Prajda N', 'Bosze P', 'Eckhardt S', 'et al.']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Gynecol Oncol,Gynecologic oncology,0365304,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tissue Extracts)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Ovary/chemistry/enzymology/metabolism', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tissue Extracts']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0090-8258(92)90078-w [doi]'],ppublish,Gynecol Oncol. 1992 Oct;47(1):66-70. doi: 10.1016/0090-8258(92)90078-w.,['CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if there was additional metabolism of the most active metabolite, methylazoxyprocarbazine, it was incubated in the presence and absence of CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells. Incubations were extracted, and potential metabolites were detected by HPLC with UV detection and by combined HPLC and thermospray mass spectrometric analysis. The major metabolite identified by HPLC with UV detection of the extracts was N-isopropyl-p-formylbenzamide; this was identified by comparison of its retention time with that of a synthesized standard. This identification was further corroborated by HPLC/thermospray mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Analysis of the extracts by LC/MS also showed the presence of a closely eluting peak that had a protonated molecular ion at m/z 207. This new metabolite was identified as N-isopropyl-(benzene-1,4-bis-carboxamide) by 1H NMR and gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry. This metabolite is postulated to arise from breakage of the N-N bond in the hydrazine portion of the molecule. Reconstructed ion (m/z 236) current profiles from the analysis of the cell extracts indicated that there was only a trace amount of methylazoxyprocarbazine left after a 72-hr incubation. Interestingly, a peak with the same molecular weight as the parent compound (methylazoxyprocarbazine) was observed in the cellular incubations and also in extracts of control incubations in which methylazoxyprocarbazine was incubated in medium without cells. This unknown was silylated and identified as a hydroxyazo compound by an ion trap mass spectrometer operated under both single and multiple-stage mass analysis. Formation of this decomposition product appears to involve a novel intramolecular rearrangement of methylazoxyprocarbazine in solution. This pathway may be responsible for the formation of the ultimate cytotoxic species by chemical decomposition of procarbazine.","['Swaffar, D S', 'Harker, W G', 'Pomerantz, S C', 'Lim, H K', 'Yost, G S']","['Swaffar DS', 'Harker WG', 'Pomerantz SC', 'Lim HK', 'Yost GS']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City 84112.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '66944-56-7 (methylazoxyprocarbazine)']",IM,"['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Procarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 1992 Sep-Oct;20(5):632-42.,"['GM29812/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL02119/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA 05860/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The v-erbA protein is a mutated, ligand independent version of the c-erbA/T3R alpha chick receptor for T3, a ligand dependent transcriptional regulator. In reconstituted systems using idealized hormone responsive elements, over-expressed v-erbA acts as a dominant repressor of transcription mediated by liganded c-erbA/T3R alpha. This property seems to account for at least part of the phenotype of AEV transformed erythroid cells and for the transcriptional repression of some erythrocyte specific genes. However, v-erbA is likely to interfere with regulatory circuits other than those directly regulated by T3 receptors.

Transplantation of marrow and PBSC was undertaken following busulphan/cyclophosphamide conditioning 9 months after diagnosis in CR1. Hyperthermic purging did not impair the rate of engraftment and the patient was independent of blood product support by day 21. Studies on this patient's committed normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM) on samples from marrow and peripheral blood following treatment at 42 degrees C for 1 h, showed minimal and acceptable loss of activity comparable with the loss seen in other marrow progenitor activity treated in a similar fashion in our laboratory.

The age of the patients ranged from 7 months to 17 years with a median of 8 years. Ten of the 71 referred children were removed from the collection procedure because of failure to induce clinical remission (nine) or deteriorating chemotherapy-induced liver failure (one). A total of 215 aphereses were performed on a CS 3000 cell separator in 61 patients, including 18 children aged 4 years or less. The methylcellulose progenitor assay was used as an index of stem cell collection. A minimum of greater than or equal to 3 x 10(5) colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM)/kg body weight were collected in 31 of 71 children (44%) with a mean of 3.1 (range, 1-5) aphereses, and greater than or equal to 1 x 10(5) CFU-GM/kg in 46 children (65%). The incidence of serious morbidity was low. When apheresis or chemotherapy was repeated, the progenitor yields decreased rapidly. By multivariate analysis, the age of the patients was the only significant predictor of CFU-GM yield (p = 0.009). In our experience with 12 children with acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, regimens containing high-dose cytarabine (2.0 g/m2 x 10) were effective for mobilization.

Using drug sensitive cell lines (KB-3-1) and MDR mutants (KB-8-5, KB-C1) experimental conditions were established that enabled demonstration of significant differences in Rh123 efflux and accumulation. Subsequently we investigated the applicability of this functional assay for the prediction of MDR in human peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. Using two-colour flow cytometry, the leukaemic blast cells of six patients suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were analysed. In three cases the blast cells showed a rapid and marked Rh123 efflux. In the presence of MDR inhibitors these cells retained Rh123. To determine whether the efflux of Rh123 was associated with P-gp expression, the leukaemic cells were stained with the monoclonal antibody MRK-16. In addition extracted RNA was analysed by polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the expression of mdr 1 mRNA. In all three Rh123+ cases mdr 1 mRNA was detectable whereas only one AML case expressed P-gp. In comparing Rh123 with daunorubicin, which also allows the detection of MDR cells, accumulation studies proved Rh123 to be the more sensitive drug for flow cytometric MDR screening. Additionally, two-colour flow cytometry was much easier to perform with Rh123 than with daunorubicin. Our results indicate that flow cytometric measurement of Rh123 accumulation/efflux proves applicable to detect MDR cells in heterogenous clinical samples.","['Ludescher, C', 'Thaler, J', 'Drach, D', 'Drach, J', 'Spitaler, M', 'Gattringer, C', 'Huber, H', 'Hofmann, J']","['Ludescher C', 'Thaler J', 'Drach D', 'Drach J', 'Spitaler M', 'Gattringer C', 'Huber H', 'Hofmann J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Acute Disease', 'Cell Line', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rhodamine 123', '*Rhodamines', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb04608.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Sep;82(1):161-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb04608.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential role of alcohol as cofactor in HIV infection and in the development and expression of AIDS is suggested but unknown. In order to understand better the contribution of alcohol to immune dysfunction following HIV infection, we assessed the presence of specific markers on thymus and spleen cells in C57B1/6 mice infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus and fed ethanol-containing diets. In the first experiments, mice were fed diets containing 0, 4.5, 5.5, and 6% (v/v) ethanol for 14 weeks. High ethanol exposure (6%) resulted in severe dehydration and death after 7 weeks. Although moderately low intakes of ethanol did not significantly modify percentages of T and B cells, they increased the absolute number of mature T, B, and CD4+ cells and decreased percentages of Thy 1.2+ cells. In the second experiment, mice were infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia retrovirus and fed diets containing 5% ethanol in a regimen of 5 days of ethanol diet and 2 days of diet without alcohol for 12 weeks. Ethanol exposure in the retrovirally infected mice showed a marked decrease in Thy 1.2+ (P < 0.05). Moderate decreases in percentages of CD4+, CD8+, CD5+ cells and an increase in Ia+ cells were also observed in the retrovirus/infected ethanol-treated mice. Moderate ethanol consumption during retroviral infection induced mild/moderate changes on lymphoid cells. Ethanol consumption may accelerate the progression of murine AIDS through such changes in the lymphoid cells of the spleen.","['Watson, R R', 'Odeleye, O E', 'Darban, H R', 'Lopez, M C']","['Watson RR', 'Odeleye OE', 'Darban HR', 'Lopez MC']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Alcohol Alcohol,"Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire)",8310684,['3K9958V90M (Ethanol)'],IM,"['Alcoholism/*immunology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects/immunology', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Ethanol/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects/immunology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Alcohol Alcohol. 1992 Jul;27(4):417-24.,['AA08037/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frozen-section immunoperoxidase immunophenotyping was equivocal in each case. All patients had abdominal pain attributable to superficial gastric ulceration, most often antral, without peripheral lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (JH-R, seven patients) or kappa light-chain gene (JK-R, eight patients), was found in eight GBx from eight (seven stage IAE; one stage IBE) of 12 patients, establishing, in conjunction with the histologic features, a diagnosis of low-grade B-cell lymphoma. This diagnosis had not been tenable on multiple prior GBx, ranging from one to five per patient, over intervals of 1 month to 6.5 years (median 4.5 months). The T-cell receptor beta-chain gene retained germline configuration in all cases. Insufficient DNA for molecular studies was extracted from the GBx of two patients, one with JK-R (JH-G) on subsequent GBx and one without further GBx. One patient had two GBx, each demonstrating a single additional band in HindIII digests hybridized with the JH probe. No rearrangements were detected in either the BamHI or the EcoRI digests. Uninvolved tissue from this patient was not available for the exclusion of restriction fragment length polymorphism. Three GBx (two patients) showed germline JH genes (JH-G). One had a partial gastrectomy (histology: MALT lymphoma) in 1981 followed by GBx in 1983 (histologically benign) and in 1990 (JH-G), and negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in 1991 without biopsy. The other patient (two GBx with JH-G) had multiple subsequent abnormal EGD, but no biopsies since December 18, 1990. Adequate DNA for gene rearrangement studies can be extracted from GBx samples weighing as little as 20 mg. The two samples with insufficient DNA weighed 1 and 16 mg, respectively. Practically speaking, the remainder of a frozen block from a single GBx is adequate, thus allowing the screening of multiple endoscopic GBx by sequential frozen sections to determine which one contains the most extensive lymphocytic infiltrate for molecular study. Consistent results are obtained on samples weighing 40 to 60 mg. This method is a suitable alternative to kappa/lambda frozen-section immunoperoxidase immunostaining, which can be uninterpretable on endoscopic biopsies or small biopsies from other sites.","['Osborne, B M', 'Pugh, W C']","['Osborne BM', 'Pugh WC']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal', 'Female', 'Gastric Mucosa/chemistry/pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/analysis/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemistry/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/analysis/genetics', 'Stomach/*pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/chemistry/genetics/*pathology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-199209000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1992 Sep;16(9):838-44. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199209000-00002.,,,"['JH', 'JK', 'TCR-&bgr;']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is suggested that the presence of the 3.5 kb fragment and the numerous chromosomal breaks associated with this disease may not be direct results of viral integration.","['Macera, M J', 'Szabo, P', 'Verma, R S']","['Macera MJ', 'Szabo P', 'Verma RS']","['Division of Genetics, Long Island College Hospital, Brooklyn, N.Y.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Mol Gen Genet,Molecular & general genetics : MGG,0125036,,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*microbiology', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Virus Integration']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00538707 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Gen Genet. 1992 Sep;234(3):466-74. doi: 10.1007/BF00538707.,['AG00541/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tiazofurin, an inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase, proved to be an effective agent in the treatment of refractory granulocytic leukemia. To examine the cell cycle dependent alterations of GTP synthesis and sensitivities to tiazofurin, we measured IMP DH activities and GTP pools, as well as the effects of tiazofurin on cell cycle phase enriched HL-60 cells. We now show that IMP DH activities and GTP concentrations are increased in S-phase enriched fractions of HL-60 cells. Moreover, the depletion of GTP concentrations by tiazofurin is most effective in S-phase enriched HL-60 cells. These results may be utilized in cancer chemotherapy to combine tiazofurin with biologic response modifiers which recruit quiescent leukemic cells into the cell cycle.","['Szekeres, T', 'Fritzer, M', 'Pillwein, K', 'Felzmann, T', 'Chiba, P']","['Szekeres T', 'Fritzer M', 'Pillwein K', 'Felzmann T', 'Chiba P']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0024-3205(92)90021-G [pii]', '10.1016/0024-3205(92)90021-g [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 1992;51(16):1309-15. doi: 10.1016/0024-3205(92)90021-g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because clodronate inhibits osteoclastic resorption, we did a randomised, controlled trial in 350 patients from 23 hospitals. All patients received standard melphalan-prednisolone, and were randomised to receive clodronate 2.4 g daily or placebo for 24 months. The proportion of patients with progression of osteolytic bone lesions was twice as high in the placebo group (n = 168 at baseline) than in the clodronate group (n = 168 at baseline) in an intention-to-treat analysis (24 vs 12%, p = 0.026). Progression of vertebral fractures was lower in the clodronate group, but the difference was not significant (30 vs 40%). Serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion decreased significantly in both groups, but the changes were greater in the clodronate group. The percentage of patients feeling no pain increased more in the clodronate group (from 24 to 54%, p < 0.001) than in the placebo group (from 29 to 44%, p < 0.01). Side-effects were similar in both groups. We conclude that clodronate is an effective and safe adjunct in the management of multiple myeloma. The drug delays osteolytic bone lesions, reduces the degree of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria, and decreases pain.","['Lahtinen, R', 'Laakso, M', 'Palva, I', 'Virkkunen, P', 'Elomaa, I']","['Lahtinen R', 'Laakso M', 'Palva I', 'Virkkunen P', 'Elomaa I']","['Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (Placebos)', '0813BZ6866 (Clodronic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Diseases/prevention & control', 'Calcium/blood/urine', 'Clodronic Acid/*therapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fractures, Spontaneous/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Pain/prevention & control', 'Placebos']",1992/10/31 00:00,1992/10/31 00:01,['1992/10/31 00:00'],"['1992/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['0140-6736(92)93075-X [pii]', '10.1016/0140-6736(92)93075-x [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1992 Oct 31;340(8827):1049-52. doi: 10.1016/0140-6736(92)93075-x.,,['Lancet. 1993 Jan 16;341(8838):175-6.

Individual HLA-DR generic typing for 30 DR specificities, including subtypes of DR1, DR2, DR13, DR14, and DR52, is done on a single plate. The entire typing assay can be completed in less than 4 hours. The procedure has been validated on more than a thousand haplotypes in prospective DR typing of kidney transplant patients, leukaemic patients, and their potential donors. The simplicity of this assay makes it suitable for routine laboratory use. It can be applied to genetic testing in general, including the testing of patients with multiple mutations.","['Cros, P', 'Allibert, P', 'Mandrand, B', 'Tiercy, J M', 'Mach, B']","['Cros P', 'Allibert P', 'Mandrand B', 'Tiercy JM', 'Mach B']","['Nucleic Acid Probes Laboratory, bioMerieux, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'DNA/genetics', 'Genotype', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oligonucleotide Probes', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tissue Donors']",1992/10/10 00:00,1992/10/10 00:01,['1992/10/10 00:00'],"['1992/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['0140-6736(92)93284-T [pii]', '10.1016/0140-6736(92)93284-t [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1992 Oct 10;340(8824):870-3. doi: 10.1016/0140-6736(92)93284-t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report a phase I and II clinical study that examined the toxicity of the combination of quinine with mitoxantrone and cytarabine (Ara-C). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia were treated with quinine formiate (30 mg/kg/d in continuous intravenous (IV) infusion from day 1 through day 5 or 6) associated with Ara-C (1 g/m2 in 3-hour IV infusion twice a day for 5 days) and five increasing doses of mitoxantrone (from 8 mg/m2/d for 4 days to 12 mg/m2/d for 5 days). RESULTS: The main toxicity was severe myelosuppression: the mean times to leukocyte recovery (> 500/microL), granulocytes recovery (> 500/microL), and platelet count recovery (> 50,000/microL) were 23 days (range, 17 to 29 days), 30.6 days (range, 17 to 48 days), and 35.4 days (range, 14 to 75 days), respectively. The nonhematopoietic toxicity of this regimen was acceptable. Nausea and vomiting were common, but severe mucositis was observed in only two patients. Cardiotoxicity was limited to transient episodes of moderate supraventricular tachycardia and a clinically well-tolerated bradycardia. Tinnitus and vertigo were observed in 10 cases (67%), and mild hearing loss and transient increase of serum bilirubin were observed in six patients (40%). Total quinine serum levels reached a steady-state concentration between 6.4 and 18 mg/L in 24 hours. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in eight of 14 (57%) assessable patients, and partial response (PR) was achieved in two additional patients (14%). P-glycoprotein expression was detected on blast cells from five of 13 studied patients before treatment. A response was observed in all P-glycoprotein-positive cases. CONCLUSION: Quinine can be used safely as a potential reversing agent of MDR for the treatment of clinically resistant acute leukemias.","['Solary, E', 'Caillot, D', 'Chauffert, B', 'Casasnovas, R O', 'Dumas, M', 'Maynadie, M', 'Guy, H']","['Solary E', 'Caillot D', 'Chauffert B', 'Casasnovas RO', 'Dumas M', 'Maynadie M', 'Guy H']","['Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Quinine/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.11.1730 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Nov;10(11):1730-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.11.1730.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, the expression of LFA-1 (CD11a and CD18) was more or less similar among the cell lines with and without HTLV-1. Interestingly, however, 3 out of 4 ATL cell lines (TL-Om1, H582, HUT102) revealed striking depression of LFA-1 expression. Several lines of evidence strongly argued against direct involvement of the viral transactivator p40tax or some autocrine cytokines in the induction of ICAM-1 in HTLV-1-positive T-cell lines. It was also found that ICAM-1 and LFA-1 were involved in syncytium formation induced in the co-culture of HTLV-1-positive and HTLV-1-negative human T-cell lines. Implications of constitutive expression of ICAM-1 for certain clinical manifestations of ATL and of depression of either ICAM-1 or LFA-1 during progression of ATL are discussed.","['Fukudome, K', 'Furuse, M', 'Fukuhara, N', 'Orita, S', 'Imai, T', 'Takagi, S', 'Nagira, M', 'Hinuma, Y', 'Yoshie, O']","['Fukudome K', 'Furuse M', 'Fukuhara N', 'Orita S', 'Imai T', 'Takagi S', 'Nagira M', 'Hinuma Y', 'Yoshie O']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*analysis', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/30 00:00,1992/09/30 00:01,['1992/09/30 00:00'],"['1992/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910520316 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1992 Sep 30;52(3):418-27. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910520316.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the molecular basis of multidrug resistance, several laboratories have isolated cell lines resistant to doxorubicin, actinomycin D, vinca alkaloids and related agents. Many months or years of culture with gradually increasing concentrations of cytotoxic agents are necessary to obtain a resistant cell line. METHODS: We selected a new multidrug resistant cell line (MELC-DRTL) by 24-hour cycles of exposure to relatively high concentrations of daunorubicin from sensitive Friend Leukemia cells. After each cycle, the residual live cells were expanded up to the density of 1 x 10(6) cells/ml. RESULTS: The assay conducted with MoAb C-219 showed a high expression on the membrane surface of P-glycoprotein in the MELC-DRTL line, but the fact that it was impossible to obtain a complete reversal of the resistance, even when using high concentrations of verapamil, suggests the presence of other mechanisms unrelated to the presence of P-glycoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: The kind of cellular resistance induction used in this experiment enabled us to obtain an MDR cell line in three months of culture.","['Abbadessa, V', 'Tolomeo, M', 'Luparello, M', 'Perricone, R', 'Cajozzo, A', 'Dusonchet, L', 'Candiloro, V', 'Crosta, L', 'Rausa, L']","['Abbadessa V', 'Tolomeo M', 'Luparello M', 'Perricone R', 'Cajozzo A', 'Dusonchet L', 'Candiloro V', 'Crosta L', 'Rausa L']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita di Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1992 Mar-Apr;77(2):137-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-glycoprotein expression was measured flow cytometrically by the binding of C219 or MRK16 monoclonal antibody to multidrug-sensitive human K562 erythroleukemia and 8226/S myeloma cells, compared to multidrug-resistant 8226/DOX40 myeloma cells. Cells were treated for up to 2 h with up to 80 units of leukoregulin/ml or one of a variety of unrelated cytokines including interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, gamma-interferon, alpha-interferon, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor AA, platelet-derived growth factor BB, insulin-like growth factor I, insulin-like growth factor II, fibroblast growth factor, or transforming growth factor beta. Leukoregulin caused a concentration-dependent decrease in P-glycoprotein expression; however, P-glycoprotein expression was unaffected by the other cytokines (< 12% decrease in expression). Leukoregulin-induced membrane permeabilization, determined flow cytometrically by intracellular fluorescein efflux, and decreased P-glycoprotein expression occurred simultaneously within 15 min in drug-sensitive and -resistant cells. Enhanced doxorubicin uptake, measured flow cytometrically by doxorubicin influx, was also present within 15 min. Leukoregulin enhancement of doxorubicin uptake and increased membrane permeability varied directly with the decrease in P-glycoprotein expression. Leukoregulin in combination with doxorubicin enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation in 8226/DOX40 multidrug-resistant cells over expressing P-glycoprotein. In contrast, combined treatment of HL-60/MX2 multidrug-resistant human promyelocytic leukemia cells that do not overexpress P-glycoprotein in association with their multidrug resistance resulted in no greater growth inhibition than observed with HL-60/MX2 cells treated with doxorubicin alone.

Eleven female MDS patients heterozygous for at least one of these probes were studied: 3 with refractory anemia (RA), 2 with RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 2 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and 4 with RA with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-t). All exhibited clonal hematopoiesis as determined by Southern analysis of DNA prepared from peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) cells. In three of the six patients heterozygous for the PGK1 gene, purified cell suspensions of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), monocytes, lymphocytes, and/or T cells prepared from PB were tested. In addition, five of these patients were analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based procedure as described recently. This method was slightly adapted to facilitate the analysis of cell lysates of fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) monocytes, T and B lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. The outcome of Southern and PCR analysis was concordant, showing that PMN and monocytes were clonally derived, whereas circulating T and B lymphocytes and NK cells exhibited random X-chromosome inactivation compatible with a polyclonal pattern. To address the question of whether T cells are derived from unaffected progenitor cells or that their origin had antedated the onset of MDS, naive and memory T cells were analyzed separately. Both subsets showed a polyclonal pattern. However, in one patient analysis of constitutive DNA suggested a skewed methylation, and the presence of clonal lymphocytes against a background of polyclonal lymphoid cells cannot be ruled out in this patient. PCR analysis of PB and BM cells showed a nonrandom, unilateral pattern of X-inactivation, compatible with a mixture of clonally (myeloid) and polyclonally (lymphoid) derived cells. In conclusion, in some patients, MDS represents a disorder with clonal hematopoiesis restricted to cells of myeloid origin, whereas a random X-inactivation pattern is found in lymphoid cells.","['van Kamp, H', 'Fibbe, W E', 'Jansen, R P', 'van der Keur, M', 'de Graaff, E', 'Willemze, R', 'Landegent, J E']","['van Kamp H', 'Fibbe WE', 'Jansen RP', 'van der Keur M', 'de Graaff E', 'Willemze R', 'Landegent JE']","['Department of Hematology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.2.3 (Phosphoglycerate Kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Carrier Screening', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/enzymology/*genetics/*immunology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phosphoglycerate Kinase/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', '*X Chromosome']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67543-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Oct 1;80(7):1774-80.,,,"['HPRT', 'PGK<down>1</down>']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among a panel of TOPO II inhibitors which included etoposide (VP-16), DOX, MTT and 4'-[(9-acridinyl)-amino]methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA), the relative resistance compared to parental sensitive P388/S cells was: P388/DOX greater than P388/MTT greater than P388/VCR. All the resistant sublines exhibited minimal cell kill (less than 20%) at vincristine concentrations greater than 100-fold the IC50 for P388/S cells. In a soft-agar colony-forming assay, the modulation of cytotoxicity in P388/MTT cells by the calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperazine following a 3-hr drug treatment demonstrated a marked potentiation in cell kill with MTT, VP-16, DOX and m-AMSA but not VCR. Immunoblotting data revealed that while PGP was not detectable in P388/S cells, the overexpression of PGP was apparent in P388/MTT cells and the relative expression between the resistant sublines was: P388/DOX greater than P388/MTT greater than P388/VCR. Although the amount and DNA cleavage activity of TOPO II in nuclear extracts from P388/VCR cells were comparable to those in P388/S cells, they were markedly lower in both P388/DOX and P388/MTT cells. However, decatenation activity of TOPO II in nuclear extracts was comparable between the sensitive (P388/S) and resistant sublines (P388/MTT, P388/DOX, and P388/VCR). Results from the present study demonstrated that P388 cells selected for resistance to mitoxantrone exhibit changes in TOPO II and overexpression of PGP similar to P388/DOX cells, while vincristine resistant cells only overexpress PGP. Since therapeutic strategies are primarily designed to interfere with PGP-mediated drug efflux, the choice of agents for modulating resistance in tumors which overexpress PGP versus tumors which overexpress PGP with altered TOPO II could be different.","['Kamath, N', 'Grabowski, D', 'Ford, J', 'Kerrigan, D', 'Pommier, Y', 'Ganapathi, R']","['Kamath N', 'Grabowski D', 'Ford J', 'Kerrigan D', 'Pommier Y', 'Ganapathi R']","['Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Cell Death', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(92)90126-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(92)90126-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1992 Sep 1;44(5):937-45. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(92)90126-4.,['R01CA35531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A similar tendency was found between P-170 and GST-pi expression in breast carcinomas. In contrast, hematological malignancies did not show such a coexpression of resistance markers. Furthermore, we found interrelationships between the expression of resistance markers, resistance to doxorubicin or vincristine, and doubling times of kidney carcinoma cell lines.

However, patients in whom the disease has proved refractory to primary treatment have a reduced life expectancy and a dismal outcome. METHODS: We treated four consecutive patients who had unsatisfactory responses to second-line or subsequent treatment with fludarabine with another halogenated nucleoside analogue, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. RESULTS: One patient with progressing lymphocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia despite 10 courses of fludarabine entered a complete remission when treated with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. Two patients who had less-than-partial remissions after six courses of fludarabine had good partial remissions when treated with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. One patient with Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia who had no response to three courses of fludarabine had a partial remission, with resolution of hypogammaglobulinemia, when treated with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of cross-resistance between fludarabine and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine despite their similar structures. 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine may induce a complete remission in chronic lymphocytic leukemia that is highly resistant to chemotherapy, and it deserves wider clinical evaluation in patients with this condition.","['Juliusson, G', 'Elmhorn-Rosenborg, A', 'Liliemark, J']","['Juliusson G', 'Elmhorn-Rosenborg A', 'Liliemark J']","['Department of Medicine, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Haptoglobins)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine', 'Deoxyadenosines/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Haptoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1992/10/08 00:00,1992/10/08 00:01,['1992/10/08 00:00'],"['1992/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199210083271504 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1992 Oct 8;327(15):1056-61. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199210083271504.,,"['N Engl J Med. 1993 Mar 18;328(11):812; author reply 813.

Occasionally, P-glycoprotein gene expression was additionally examined by indirect immunocytofluorescence using the monoclonal antibody C219. No significant difference in mdr1/P-glycoprotein mRNA levels between primary and relapsed state acute lymphocytic leukaemias (ALL) was seen on average. Second or third relapses, however, showed a distinct tendency to an elevated expression of this multidrug transporter gene (up to 10-fold) in part well beyond the value seen in the moderately cross-resistant T-lymphoblastoid CCRF-CEM subline CCRF VCR 100.

If topoisomerase II mRNA was undetectable, expression of topoisomerase I was clearly visible throughout. These observations might be valuable considering the possible treatment with specific topoisomerase I or topoisomerase II inhibitors.

We found a high incidence of mdr1 gene expression in newly diagnosed patients (27% by immunocytochemistry and 43% by slot blot). No difference was observed between newly diagnosed patients and relapsed patients. However, patients with resistant disease showed statistically higher incidence of mdr1 gene expression compared to the untreated and relapsing patients (60% versus 27% by immunocytochemistry, p 0.005; and 73% versus 45% by slot blot, p less than 0.05). The expression of mdr1 gene correlated significantly with clinical drug resistance: 62% of patients positive for mdr1-mRNA and 68% of patients positive for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) eventually developed resistance to chemotherapy, while this was the case for a lower percentage of patients who did not express mdr1 gene (only 23% by slot blot analysis, p = 0.0052, or 24% by immunocytochemistry, p = 0.0009). A combined parameter, mdr1-mRNA/P-gp, had a very high prognostic value in terms of specificity and sensitivity. All nine patients (100%) who were mdr1-mRNA+/P-gp+ progressed to clinical drug resistance afterward, whereas 11 of 13 (85%) patients who were mdr1-mRNA-1 P-gp- entered complete remission and only two patients later developed drug resistance (p = 0.0005).

Peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells were established as an interleukin-2-dependent T-cell line. When the MoL cells were exposed for a few days to conditioned medium from the T-cell line, they extended several dendritic cytoplasmic projections and became intensely positive for HLA-DR antigen, cytoplasmic S-100 beta protein, and CD1 antigen. Functionally, the conditioned medium significantly down-regulated Fc-mediated and Fc-independent phagocytic activities, and the levels of lysosomal enzymes such as lysozyme and nonspecific esterase in the MoL cells. Moreover, the conditioned medium significantly up-regulated the accessory cell function of the MoL cells as measured by the primary allogenic mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). Furthermore, the conditioned medium significantly down-regulated the expression of CD14 antigen. Biochemical analysis indicated that the factor responsible for these changes is a protein which is distinct from known human cytokines and whose molecular weight is approximately 31 kDa.

The recent MRC UKALL X trial was designed to facilitate a non-randomised comparison between BMT and chemotherapy in children deemed to be at high risk of treatment failure. 198 children aged 1-15 had a presenting leucocyte count of more than 100 x 10(9)/l. All received induction and early intensification therapy. Children with an HLA-compatible sibling donor were eligible for BMT in first remission. All other children received cranial irradiation at 24Gy, late intensification, and two years of continuous treatment. 183 children achieved a stable remission of whom 111 were HLA typed; these tended to be older and to have T-cell ALL. A donor was identified in 41 cases, of whom 34 proceeded to BMT at a median time of 17 weeks; there was no difference in distribution of age, sex, or leucocyte count between the groups receiving BMT and chemotherapy. Comparison of the 144 children who were in remission at 17 weeks and received chemotherapy with the 34 proceeding to BMT showed no significant difference in event-free survival at five years (69% for BMT and 52% for chemotherapy). There were significantly more treatment-related deaths in the marrow transplant group (6 vs 4) and more relapses in the chemotherapy group (59 vs 4). There was no significant difference in event-free survival between children who were HLA typed and had a donor and those without a donor, although there were fewer relapses among the former. BMT can be evaluated in the context of a multicentre trial for paediatric ALL but the number of children with donors is too small to make a significant impact on overall survival. However, marrow transplantation was associated with a much lower relapse rate than that with the UK ALL protocol, and with better definition of higher risk patients BMT may be of benefit in some children with high-risk ALL in first remission.","['Chessells, J M', 'Bailey, C', 'Wheeler, K', 'Richards, S M']","['Chessells JM', 'Bailey C', 'Wheeler K', 'Richards SM']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",1992/09/05 00:00,1992/09/05 00:01,['1992/09/05 00:00'],"['1992/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['0140-6736(92)92103-M [pii]', '10.1016/0140-6736(92)92103-m [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1992 Sep 5;340(8819):565-8. doi: 10.1016/0140-6736(92)92103-m.,,['Lancet. 1992 Oct 24;340(8826):1045.

EoL-3 cells expressed large amounts of LFA-1 and small amounts of ICAM-1, and their expression was regulated similarly in EoL-3 cells and U937 cells. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enhanced ICAM-1 expression but not LFA-1 expression, and PMA augmented both LFA-1 and ICAM-1 expression. IFN-gamma and PMA showed an additive effect on ICAM-1 expression. These results collectively suggest that expression of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 is regulated differently and that IFN-gamma and PMA regulate the expression through different mechanisms. PMA but not IFN-gamma induced homotypic adhesion of EoL-3 and U937 cells, suggesting that PMA but not IFN-gamma activated the adhesive function of these cells. Staurosporin, an inhibitor of protein kinases (PKs), partly suppressed IFN-gamma- and PMA-augmented expression of ICAM-1 on EoL-3 and U937 cells, but did not affect PMA-augmented LFA-1 expression, suggesting that staurosporin-sensitive PKs are involved in IFN-gamma- and PMA-augmented ICAM-1 expression but not in PMA-augmented LFA-1 expression. The role of protein kinase C (PK-C) in these mechanisms was not revealed because a PK-C inhibitor, H-7, did not show any definitive effect on IFN-gamma- and PMA-induced expression of LFA-1 and ICAM-1. Moreover, cyclic AMP (cAMP)- and cGMP-dependent pathways were not shown to be involved in the augmentation of the expression of these molecules.","['Nambu, M', 'Mayumi, M', 'Mikawa, H']","['Nambu M', 'Mayumi M', 'Mikawa H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'CD18 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eosinophils/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Eosinophilic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(92)90030-S [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(92)90030-s [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1992 Sep;143(2):335-47. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(92)90030-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five different multidrug-resistant cell lines, characterized by mdr1 amplification, were used in this study: Dox-R-MCF7, a human breast adenocarcinoma; SKVBL1, a human ovarian adenocarcinoma; K562-R, a human erythroleukemia; and two murine lines: P388-Adr-R, a monocytic leukemia of DBA2 mouse, and LR73MDR, a Chinese hamster ovarian cell line. These lines were 38.7, 210, 232, 143 and 20 times more resistant than their corresponding sensitive counterparts, respectively. Using Dox-NS, we obtained complete reversion of drug resistance in vitro, i.e. cell growth inhibition comparable with that obtained with sensitive cells exposed to free Dox. In vivo, we significantly prolonged the survival of DBA2 mice which had previously received P388-Adr-R cells by i.p. injections of Dox-NS, while free Dox injection was ineffective toward this rapidly growing tumor. (Prolongation of survival time: 115% vs 167% after Dox vs Dox-NS treatment, respectively.) Using the MCF7 cell line and its resistant variant, we studied the intracellular concentration and the cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution of Dox by laser microspectrofluorometry (LMSF). In sensitive cells, we observed a similar accumulation and distribution of Dox whatever the form of Dox delivery, i.e. whether free or carried by nanospheres. Analysis by LMSF showed that 99% of intranuclear Dox was bound to DNA after treatment with both forms of Dox. Of Dox, 81 and 83% were found in the intranuclear compartment of sensitive cells incubated with free Dox and Dox-NS, respectively. Resistant cells incubated with Dox-NS accumulated the same amount of Dox as sensitive cells incubated with free Dox or with Dox-NS. Dox, when loaded in nanospheres, bypasses the efflux mechanism responsible for multidrug resistance. LMSF analysis showed that Dox, transported and released by nanospheres, interacts with DNA identically in sensitive and resistant cells.","['Cuvier, C', 'Roblot-Treupel, L', 'Millot, J M', 'Lizard, G', 'Chevillard, S', 'Manfait, M', 'Couvreur, P', 'Poupon, M F']","['Cuvier C', 'Roblot-Treupel L', 'Millot JM', 'Lizard G', 'Chevillard S', 'Manfait M', 'Couvreur P', 'Poupon MF']","['URA 620-CNRS, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Lasers', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/mortality', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Microspheres', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1992/08/04 00:00,1992/08/04 00:01,['1992/08/04 00:00'],"['1992/08/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/04 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(92)90443-M [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(92)90443-m [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1992 Aug 4;44(3):509-17. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(92)90443-m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation of K562 cells with BR resulted in a significant decrease in GMP and GTP levels with a concurrent increase in IMP pools, and with a significant inhibition of IMPDH activity. However, 290-fold higher BR concentration was needed to demonstrate in vitro inhibition of IMPDH activity, suggesting that the agent may require metabolism to exert its action.

V-erbA acts as a constitutive repressor of erythrocyte-specific gene transcription, arresting the expression of at least three different erythroid genes: the erythrocyte anion transporter (band 3), carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) and delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALA-S). To test whether or not the v-erbA induced repression of these genes is causally related to the v-erbA induced leukaemic phenotype, we have reintroduced the genes for band 3 or CAII into transformed erythroblasts via retrovirus vectors. We show here that such erythroblasts, expressing v-erbA, require the same narrow range of medium pH and ion concentration for growth as do transformed erythroblasts lacking v-erbA, i.e. the v-erbA induced tolerance to pH variation was abrogated.

Our experiments show that the two v-erbA-related 'erythroblast transformation parameters' are separable: suppression of band 3 and CAII accounts for one parameter (pH/ion tolerance), while the second parameter (differentiation block) must involve v-erbA regulation of a different set of target genes.","['Fuerstenberg, S', 'Leitner, I', 'Schroeder, C', 'Schwarz, H', 'Vennstrom, B', 'Beug, H']","['Fuerstenberg S', 'Leitner I', 'Schroeder C', 'Schwarz H', 'Vennstrom B', 'Beug H']","['Department of Molecular Biology, CMB, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (Anion Transport Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-erbA)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)']",IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/genetics', 'Alpharetrovirus/genetics', 'Animals', 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/*genetics', 'Anion Transport Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Carbonic Anhydrases/*genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Erythroblasts/metabolism/microbiology', 'Fibroblasts/microbiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins v-erbA', 'Phenotype', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1992 Sep;11(9):3355-65.,,,,PMC556870,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study based on hospital surveillance data. SETTING: Referral cancer center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 795 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who received care at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 1990. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with fludarabine alone or fludarabine and prednisone. MEASUREMENTS: The listeriosis attack rate was analyzed according to the type of treatment received. RESULTS: Seven of 408 patients in the fludarabine group developed listeriosis (1.7%; 95% Cl, 0.2% to 6%) compared with 0 of 387 patients who received conventional chemotherapy alone (0% to 0.9%; P = 0.015). The 7 patients were among 248 patients who were treated with both fludarabine and prednisone; none of 160 patients treated with fludarabine alone developed listeriosis (P = 0.045 by the Fisher exact test). A dramatic reduction in CD4 counts occurred in patients after fludarabine and prednisone treatment and coincided with the development of listeriosis. CONCLUSION: The administration of fludarabine plus prednisone is associated with an increased incidence of listeriosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The depletion of CD4 cells may underlie the pathogenesis.","['Anaissie, E', 'Kontoyiannis, D P', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Elting, L', 'Robertson, L E', 'Keating, M']","['Anaissie E', 'Kontoyiannis DP', 'Kantarjian H', 'Elting L', 'Robertson LE', 'Keating M']","['University of Texas M.

Patch-clamp experiments in 'whole-cell' and in 'cell-attached' configurations showed that cell adhesion to fibronectin promoted plasma membrane hyperpolarization mediated by activation of potassium channels that were indistinguishable from calcium-dependent potassium channels K(Ca) in these cells. K+ current increase began in 5-6 min and was completed about 10 min after the first contact. The timecourse of this process recorded from 'whole-cell' was very similar to that followed in intact cells by observing the increase of single channel currents. The open probability of single channels in the patch increased after contact, revealing that this activation is propagated at distance from the adhesion site. The slow onset of the effect suggests the presence of a complex regulatory pathway between fibronectin-integrin binding and activation of potassium channels. Decreasing cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration to pCa 9 diminished, but did not inhibit, the response. The current induced by fibronectin was not blocked by apamin, alpha-charybdotoxin or glibenclamide, but was abolished by high concentrations of tetraethylammonium (TEA).

We have previously observed that in Adriamycin (ADR) resistant P388 murine leukemia cells, DNA topoisomerase II enzyme content and cleavage and catalytic activities were all reduced and correlated with drug sensitivity. A subsequent study provided evidence for an allelic mutation of the gene for DNA topoisomerase II as a possible molecular mechanism underlying the enzyme alterations. To ascertain how universal were these observations, a study was undertaken of DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) in other cell lines resistant either to ADR or another topo-II-interactive drug, mitoxantrone. In ADR-resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, topo II cleavage and catalytic activities and the gene product were all reduced; however, only cleavage activity correlated with drug sensitivity. No differences were noted between ADR-sensitive and -resistant CHO cells by Northern or Southern blot analysis, raising the possibility that the enzyme in resistant cells may be regulated at a posttranscriptional level. Findings on a gel retardation or immunoblot band depletion assay showed that the enzyme in CHO/ADR-1 cells failed to bind to the DNA-drug-enzyme complex, suggesting a qualitative as well as quantitative enzyme alteration in those cells. Mitoxantrone-resistant HeLa cells (Mito-1) displayed not only a lower level of cleavage activity but also of enzyme content and catalytic activity, relative to the parental drug-sensitive HeLa cells. As with the CHO cells, no differences were noted between mitoxantrone-sensitive and -resistant HeLa cells on Northern and Southern blot analyses, suggesting that enzyme regulation in these resistant cells may also be at a posttranscriptional level. There was no evidence of enzyme binding to DNA-drug-enzyme complex in resistant HeLa/Mito-1 cells, once again suggesting the presence of a qualitative enzyme alteration. The findings in both ADR-resistant CHO cells and mitoxantrone-resistant HeLa cells do not exclude the possibility that subtle changes in the topoisomerase II gene, such as point mutations, may account for these enzyme changes.

A major factor is the behavior of the activity of IMPDH, the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo GTP biosynthesis, and the activity of GPRT, the salvage enzyme of guanylate production. The activities of GMP synthase, GMP kinase and nucleoside-diphosphate kinase are also relevant. In neoplastic transformation, the activities and amounts of all these biosynthetic enzymes are elevated as shown by kinetic assays and by immunotitration for IMPDH. In cancer cells, the up-regulation of guanylate biosynthesis is amplified by the concurrent decrease in activities of the catabolic enzymes, nucleotidase, nucleoside phosphorylase, and the rate-limiting purine catabolic enzyme, xanthine oxidase. The up-regulation of the capacity for GTP biosynthesis is also manifested in the stepped-up capacity of the overall pathways of de novo and salvage guanylate production. The linking with neoplasia is also seen in the elevation of the activities of IMPDH and GMP synthase and de novo and salvage pathways as the proliferative program is expressed as cancer cells enter log phase in tissue culture. The activity of GMP reductase showed no linkage with neoplastic or normal cell proliferation; however, in induced differentiation in HL-60 cells the activity increased concurrently with the decline in the activity of IMPDH. This reciprocal regulation of the two enzymes is observed in differentiation induced by retinoic acid, DMSO or TPA in HL-60 cells. In support of enzyme-pattern-targeted chemotherapy, evidence was provided for synergistic chemotherapy with tiazofurin (inhibitor of IMPDH) and hypoxanthine (competitive inhibitor of GPRT and guanine salvage activity) in patients and in tissue culture cell lines. These investigations should contribute to the clarification of the controlling factors of GMP biosynthesis, the role of the various enzymes, the behavior of GMP reductase in mammalian cells and the application of the approaches of enzyme-pattern-targeted chemotherapy in patients.","['Weber, G', 'Nakamura, H', 'Natsumeda, Y', 'Szekeres, T', 'Nagai, M']","['Weber G', 'Nakamura H', 'Natsumeda Y', 'Szekeres T', 'Nagai M']","['Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5200.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '131-99-7 (Inosine Monophosphate)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '85-32-5 (Guanosine Monophosphate)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.7.1.7 (GMP Reductase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'GMP Reductase', 'Guanosine Monophosphate/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/blood/therapeutic use', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Inosine Monophosphate/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(92)90008-n [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1992;32:57-69. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(92)90008-n.,['CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its role in paediatric tumours, most of which are non-epithelial in origin, has yet to be fully elucidated. A study was undertaken to investigate reactivity of two P-gp monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), JBS-1 and MRK16, recognising cytoplasmic and surface epitopes, respectively, of the P-gp molecule, in a variety of newly diagnosed and relapsed childhood cancers. P-gp was not expressed in any of 36 tumours examined (neuroblastoma 13, nephroblastoma 12, rhabdomyosarcoma 6, lymphoma 3, teratoma 1, Ewings 1), 14 of whom had chemoresistant disease. Reactivity to both MAbs was also investigated in patients with acute leukaemia. Out of 10 diagnostic acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) samples, a positive reaction with JSB-1 was observed in 1 patient who failed to remit on standard induction therapy and in 3 of 6 patients in ALL relapse, only 1 of whom showed low grade positivity with MRK16. Both MAbs reacted positively in 1 patient with acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) at diagnosis who achieved remission with teniposide and cytosine arabinoside, but relapsed 7 months later and was again positive with both Mabs. JSB-1 also showed varying degrees of positivity in 4 out of 4 other patients in ANLL relapse. It would therefore appear that P-gp is unlikely to mediate chemoresistance in most solid tumours of childhood, but may well play a major role in the development of chemoresistance in acute leukaemia.","[""O'Meara, A"", 'Imamura, A', 'Johnson, P', 'Ball, R', 'Rooney, S', 'Kierce, B', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Dervan, P']","[""O'Meara A"", 'Imamura A', 'Johnson P', 'Ball R', 'Rooney S', 'Kierce B', 'Tsuruo T', 'Dervan P']","[""Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, Ireland.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000227039 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncology. 1992;49(3):203-8. doi: 10.1159/000227039.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand possible consequences of the DNA damage induced during such treatment, information is required about the nature of the damage, the level of induction and its persistence, and about the importance of the various lesions for cell-lethality and/or mutation induction. Recently, we developed a sensitive immunochemical method to quantify single-strand breaks (SSB) in the DNA of mammalian cells. In addition, a modification of the so-called alkaline elution technique was introduced which allows quantification of SSB together with base damage (SSB+BD). These methods have now been applied successfully to study the in vivo induction and repair of DNA damage in WBC of leukaemia patients who prior to BMT were treated with cyclophosphamide (CY) and received TBI. SSB and SSB+BD were determined after two treatments with CY (60 mg kg-1) followed by TBI (4.5-8.6Gy). The CY treatments gave rise to rather persistent SSB. In addition to these, radiation-induced SSB and SSB+BD could be detected shortly after TBI. However, 105 min after TBI, these SSB could be observed no longer, as a result of rapid repair.","['van Loon, A A', 'Raadsheer, F C', 'Timmerman, A J', 'Haanen, C', 'Wessels, J', 'van der Schans, G P', 'Lohmans, P H', 'Baan, R A']","['van Loon AA', 'Raadsheer FC', 'Timmerman AJ', 'Haanen C', 'Wessels J', 'van der Schans GP', 'Lohmans PH', 'Baan RA']","['TNO Medical Biological Laboratory, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['2ETP3U2WQNPKTK82 [pii]', '10.1080/09553009214551801 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1992 Jul;62(1):33-43. doi: 10.1080/09553009214551801.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in some cases, these symptoms are persistent, progressive, and not directly correlated with the severity of other neurologic symptoms of the lower spinal cord. These findings prompted us to locate organic lesions in the lower urinary tract and to correlate them with HTLV-1 infection. Among 35 HAM patients with lower urinary symptoms, we found 4 cases with the symptoms persistent and progressive: 3 with contracted bladder and another with persistent prostatitis. Histological or cytological examinations indicated local lymphocytic infiltrations in the lower urinary tract in all cases: 3 by the infiltration in the bladder and the other by a high concentration of lymphocytes in expressed prostatic secretions. Of 3 cases whose urinary samples were available, 2 showed significant increase in the concentration of urinary anti-HTLV-1 antibody of IgA class. The urinary IgA antibody of the third case was not elevated, but the sample had been obtained after resection of the affected bladder. None of the control cases showed significant anti-HTLV-1 IgA antibody in urine except for a case of gross hematuria due to chemotherapy directed against adult T-cell leukemia. We suggest inclusion of these processes into the spectrum of complications for HAM/TSP. The elevated excretion of anti-HTLV-1 of IgA class in urine may be an indicator of these complications.","['Nomata, K', 'Nakamura, T', 'Suzu, H', 'Yushita, Y', 'Kanetake, H', 'Sawada, T', 'Ikeda, S', 'Hino, S', 'Nagataki, S', 'Saito, Y']","['Nomata K', 'Nakamura T', 'Suzu H', 'Yushita Y', 'Kanetake H', 'Sawada T', 'Ikeda S', 'Hino S', 'Nagataki S', 'Saito Y']","['Department of Urology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cystitis/*complications/pathology', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/urine', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/chemistry/immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*complications/immunology', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Muscular Diseases/*complications', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*complications', 'Prostatitis/*complications']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1992.tb00132.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1992 Jun;83(6):601-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1992.tb00132.x.,,,,PMC5918891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-170 expression was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence using the monoclonal antibody MRK16.

The Leukaemia Group of the EORTC and the HOVON.,255-9,"Resistance to chemotherapy in refractory multiple myeloma is frequently associated with expression of multidrug resistance (MDR). In resistant cells, intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and vincristine does not occur because the MDR-1 gene product, a membrane glycoprotein (PgP), is an energy-dependent efflux pump. Cyclosporin is one of several non-cytotoxic drugs that can block the function of PgP. In a prospective study, we assessed the possibility that cyclosporin could be used clinically to modulate MDR. We studied 21 patients with multiple myeloma; disease had progressed during primary chemotherapy in 6 and was resistant to VAD (vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone) in 15. The patients received cyclosporin by continuous infusion during VAD treatment; there were three cyclosporin dosage groups (5, 7.5, 10 mg/kg daily). Serum cyclosporin concentrations adequate for MDR modulation were reached in all patients receiving 7.5 or 10 mg/kg daily. 47% (7) of the VAD-refractory patients and 48% (10) of the whole group responded to VAD. Before treatment, MDR-1 expression was present in 12 patients. After VAD plus cyclosporin, no MDR-1-positive plasma cells were present in 6 of 8 patients tested. The response rate in MDR-1-positive patients was 58% compared with 33% in all our patients. Toxic effects were mild and reversible and did not include nephrotoxic or serious cardiovascular side-effects. 12 months after the start of treatment, survival was 85%, and disease-free survival at a median of 9 months after the response was 65%.

To this end, the ionic strength (NaCl concentration) of the solutions in which cells were suspended during their fixation with 0.5% paraformaldehyde was increased, to up to 1.65 M NaCl, to weaken the intra- and/or intermolecular ionic interactions during the process of crosslinking, and the cells were then immunostained. Fluorescence of cells reacting with Ki-67 antibody was maximally increased after their treatment with 1.15 M NaCl; the average increase was nearly 110% above the level seen with the standard methodology utilizing 0.15 M NaCl. The increase was greater for cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle compared to cells in S or G2. Fluorescence of cells stained with the PCNA antibody was maximally enhanced after cell treatment with 0.65 M NaCl.

However, both enantiomers are equally effective in increasing cellular accumulation of anticancer drugs [Gruber et al., Int J Cancer 41: 224-226, 1988]. In addition to verapamil, there exists a wide variety of stereoisomers with phenylalkylamines and dihydropyridine structures which markedly differ in their potency as calcium antagonists. We have tested these drugs for their ability to increase intracellular accumulation of [3H]vinblastine ([3H]VBL) in a doxorubicin-resistant cell line (F4-6RADR) derived from the Friend mouse leukemia cell line (F4-6P) and in COS-7 monkey kidney cells. Both cell types express substantial amounts of multidrug resistance gene 1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein as revealed by RNA and immuno blot analysis.

Although the stereoisomers of these drugs differ markedly in their potency as calcium channel blockers they were about equally effective in increasing VBL levels in the cells. There was no substantial difference in the potencies of the phenylalkylamine drugs in affecting cellular [3H]VBL transport. Major potency differences, however, were observed in the dihydropyridine drug series with the niguldipine isomers as the most effective drugs. Moreover, the niguldipine enantiomers were equally as effective in reversing VBL resistance in F4-6RADR cells as were the verapamil enantiomers. Since (-)-niguldipine (B859-35) displays a 45-fold lower affinity for calcium channel binding sites than (+)-niguldipine, but is equally potent in inhibiting drug transport by P-glycoprotein and in reversing drug resistance, it may be, in addition to (+)-verapamil, another useful candidate drug for the treatment of multidrug resistance in cancer patients.","['Hollt, V', 'Kouba, M', 'Dietel, M', 'Vogt, G']","['Hollt V', 'Kouba M', 'Dietel M', 'Vogt G']","['Department of Physiology, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Dihydropyridines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'Z81N45O25Z (niguldipine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dihydropyridines/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Haplorhini', 'Immunoblotting', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",1992/06/23 00:00,1992/06/23 00:01,['1992/06/23 00:00'],"['1992/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(92)90149-D [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(92)90149-d [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1992 Jun 23;43(12):2601-8. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(92)90149-d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, HCL cells express relatively low amounts of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1/CD54) and may therefore be an inappropriate target for recognition by T cells or lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. We tested whether these molecules were inducible on HCL cells and if induction would lead to enhanced susceptibility to lysis by LAK cells or cytolytic T cells. CD11a expression was induced by incubation with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) or interleukin-4. CD54 was induced by culturing the cells irrespectively of the addition of cytokines. Expression of CD11a and CD54 did not enhance susceptibility to either autologous or allogeneous LAK cells. However, induction of these adhesion molecules was accompanied by enhanced susceptibility to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones. This lysis could be reversed by the addition of anti-CD11a and anti-CD54 antibodies. Finally, we monitored the expression of CD11a and CD54 on HCL cells from patients during IFN-alpha therapy. In one of four patients monitored, we observed rapid in vivo induction of CD11a and CD54 on the leukemic cells during IFN-alpha therapy. These studies provide a model for studying immunosurveillance in HCL.","['Jansen, J H', 'van der Harst, D', 'Wientjens, G J', 'Kooy-Winkelaar, Y M', 'Brand, A', 'Willemze, R', 'Kluin-Nelemans, H C']","['Jansen JH', 'van der Harst D', 'Wientjens GJ', 'Kooy-Winkelaar YM', 'Brand A', 'Willemze R', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/surgery/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/analysis/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Splenectomy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1992/07/15 00:00,1992/07/15 00:01,['1992/07/15 00:00'],"['1992/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70624-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jul 15;80(2):478-83.,,['Blood. 1993 Jan 1;81(1):267-9.

Ki-67 monoclonal antibody reactive antigen and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were measured by the simultaneous flow cytometric analysis of DNA and nuclear antigens. The percentage of PCNA-positive cells was always higher than that of Ki-67-positive cells in individual patients. The level of PCNA was greatly increased in G1 or early S phase, but was generally stable in S and G2 phases. Accordingly, most of the cells in the proliferative compartments (greater than 2C DNA) showed a high expression of PCNA. In contrast, expression of Ki-67 antigen varied greatly from patient to patient, and differed significantly in different subtypes of the disease. The level of Ki-67 antigen increased with the cell cycle progression, showing maximum expression in late S and G2 phases. However, in most of the patients, a distinct population of Ki-67-negative cells was found not only in G1 phase, but also in the proliferative compartments.

By using oligonucleotide primers flanking an intron of the HOX-11 gene, we have developed a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the expression of HOX-11. We detected HOX-11 expression in multiple cell lineages including normal T cells and two T-cell lines in which the HOX-11 gene appeared to be unaltered in structure.

It has been shown that CD8+ T cells play an important role in the development of disease directed to the minor H antigens, and that initial indications were that highly purified preparations of these cells were capable of mediating GVHD, without apparent 'help' from mature donor-derived CD4+ T cells. To further strengthen this hypothesis, the current study was undertaken with the B10.BR----CBA strain combination in which irradiated recipient mice were additionally treated with an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, as a single or repeated injection, to minimize the presence of either residual host CD4+ cells or recently generated donor-derived CD4+ cells at later stages of disease development. The results indicate that these treatments do not affect the GVHD outcome and that the CD8+ cells are indeed capable of inducing disease independent of CD4+ 'help'. The addition of donor CD4+ T cells in the inoculum, however, does enhance the potential of these CD8+ cells, and is observed with both low and high dosages of CD4+ cells. CD4+ T cells, on their own, have also been observed to cause GVHD directed to minor H antigens in certain strain combinations, and their response has been further characterized in this study. Results indicate that CD4+ cells capable of mediating GVHD in the B10.D2----DBA/2 strain combination can do so over a wide range of recipient irradiation exposures.

High grade NHL, classified according to the updated Kiel classification, revealed significantly larger amounts of c-myc mRNA compared with low grade NHL and lymphadenitis. mRNA levels in non-specific lymphadenitis were lower than in low grade NHL, but the differences were not statistically significant. No correlation between c-myc mRNA levels and the immunologic phenotype was discernible. Growth fractions of the NHL were determined by immunostaining with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. Significant correlations between the percentages of Ki-67-positive cells, as well as the amounts of c-myc mRNA, and classification into high or low grade NHL were found. However, the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells and c-myc mRNA levels in individual cases and in the various histologic entities of NHL did not correlate.

Recently, it was reported that total body irradiation appeared useful in the treatment of Friend leukemia virus infection in mice. In this report, the effect of x-irradiation on the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro in CD4+ cells was examined. MT-4 cells and HIV strain human T cell lymphotropic virus Type IIIB were used to conduct this study. Infected MT-4 cells were irradiated at the time of infection or following infection with x-ray doses of 25-300 cGy. Doses of 50, 150, and 300 cGy enhanced HIV replication by 1.6-, 2-, and 4.8-fold, respectively. Irradiating the cells prior to infection also resulted in similar enhancement of HIV replication. This phenomenon was also observed with wild-type HIV isolates grown in peripheral blood mononuclear and in HIV chronically infected cells. In addition, the enhancement was associated with a radiation-induced increase in intracellular levels of cAMP. The use of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A inhibitor, H-8, inhibited HIV replication by 65%. These data suggest that in vitro exposure to low doses of x-ray enhances HIV replication partially via a cAMP-dependent pathway.","['Nokta, M', 'Belli, J', 'Pollard, R']","['Nokta M', 'Belli J', 'Pollard R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

To understand better the mechanism of formation of the hyperdiploid karyotype, we studied 15 patients using 20 DNA probes that detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms. We first examined disomic chromosomes for loss of heterozygosity. Two patients had widespread loss of heterozygosity on all informative disomic chromosomes, and represent cases of near-haploid leukemia in which the chromosomes doubled. One other patient had loss of heterozygosity limited to chromosome 3; in this patient all of seven other informative disomic chromosomes retained heterozygosity. Loss of heterozygosity was not detected in the remaining 12 patients on a total of 87 informative disomic chromosomes. We then examined tetrasomic chromosomes for parental dosage. Of the 13 patients in whom widespread loss of heterozygosity was not present, 11 patients had tetrasomy 21; 10 of 11 (91%) had an equal dose of maternal and paternal alleles on chromosome 21 and only 1 of 11 (9%) had an unequal dose of parental alleles in a 3:1 ratio. These results suggest that the hyperdiploid karyotype usually arises by simultaneous gain of chromosomes from a diploid karyotype during a single abnormal cell division, and occasionally by doubling of chromosomes from a near-haploid karyotype. The hyperdiploidy in cases without widespread loss of heterozygosity is not caused by stepwise or sequential gains from a diploid karyotype or by losses from a tetraploid karyotype; the former should result in a 3:1 parental dosage for 67% of tetrasomic chromosomes (9% observed) and the latter should result in loss of heterozygosity for 33% of disomic chromosomes (1% observed).

Together with recent studies using established cell lines, this indicates a large representation of HOX genes in the hematopoietic compartment and suggests a participation of this class of nuclear proteins to early steps of hematopoiesis.","['Vieille-Grosjean, I', 'Roullot, V', 'Courtois, G']","['Vieille-Grosjean I', 'Roullot V', 'Courtois G']","[""INSERM U217-Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Departement de Biologie Moleculaire et Structurale, Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires, Grenoble, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1992/06/15 00:00,1992/06/15 00:01,['1992/06/15 00:00'],"['1992/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-291X(92)91694-L [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(92)91694-l [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1992 Jun 15;185(2):785-92. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(92)91694-l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the incidence of leukaemia among 46,988 Swedish patients exposed to iodine-131 (131I) for diagnostic reasons or to treat hyperthyroidism or thyroid cancer. The observed number of leukaemias was compared with that expected based on incidence data from the general population. The mean absorbed dose to the bone marrow was estimated as 14 mGy (range 0.01-2.226). 195 leukaemias occurred more than 2 years after exposure, and the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.94-1.25). Similar, but again not significantly, increased risks were seen for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (SIR = 1.08), a malignant condition not found to be increased after irradiation, and for non-CLL (SIR = 1.09). The risk of leukaemia did not vary by sex, age, time, or radiation dose from 131I. One reason for the absence of a radiation effect, other than chance, includes the possible lowering of risk when exposure is protracted over time as occurs with 131I. Excess leukaemia risks of more than 25% could thus be excluded with high assurance in this population of mainly adults. These results should be reassuring to patients exposed to 131I in medical practice and to most individuals exposed to the fall-out from the Chernobyl accident.","['Hall, P', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Berg, G', 'Bjelkengren, G', 'Ericsson, U B', 'Hallquist, A', 'Lidberg, M', 'Lundell, G', 'Mattsson, A', 'Tennvall, J']","['Hall P', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Berg G', 'Bjelkengren G', 'Ericsson UB', 'Hallquist A', 'Lidberg M', 'Lundell G', 'Mattsson A', 'Tennvall J', 'et al.']","['Department of General Oncology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Hyperthyroidism/diagnosis/radiotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/diagnosis/radiotherapy', 'Time Factors']",1992/07/14 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/07/14 19:15'],"['1992/07/14 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/07/14 19:15 [entrez]']","['0140-6736(92)92421-B [pii]', '10.1016/0140-6736(92)92421-b [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1992 Jul 4;340(8810):1-4. doi: 10.1016/0140-6736(92)92421-b.,['N01-CP-51034/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Lancet. 1992 Aug 15;340(8816):437.

We have established V beta 5+ T cell lines, clones, and hybridomas expressing identical TCR with different CD4/CD8 phenotypes and demonstrated that T cell reactivity to B6-1710 is, although not absolute, dependent on the presence of CD4 molecules. Further analysis of T cell hybridomas with known J beta-chain usage revealed that D beta- and J beta-chain usage do not play crucial roles in T cell reactivity to B6-1710 B cells. However, T cell hybridomas derived from TCR-V beta gene transgenic mice were found to be heterogeneous for their reactivity to B6-1710, suggesting that the V alpha-chains associating with the transgenic V beta-chain determine T cell responsiveness to B6-1710.

Frequency of the polymorphic alleles was studied in 100 samples from healthy controls, 94 samples from patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 25 samples from patients with benign lymphadenopathy, and 38 samples from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. XbaI digestion showed a three-allele polymorphism with two frequent alleles A (8.0 kb) and B (9.2 kb) and a rare allele (5.8 kb). After SacI digestion the probe identified two primary genotypes. Genotype I showed two hybridizable DNA fragments, one each of 6.6 and 3.5 kb. In genotype II the 3.5 kb fragment was absent, instead two smaller fragments, one each of 1.9 kb and 1.6 kb were present.

For this purpose, we tested the HEV-binding ability and the expression of the lymphocyte homing receptor (LHR) for peripheral lymph nodes as well as Pgp-1/CD44, LFA-1 and ICAM-1 adhesion molecules by the highly leukemic cell line NQ22 in comparison with a series of non-leukemic murine T-lymphoma cell lines. Our results indicate that the hematogenous spreading as well as peripheral node invasion of lymphoma-derived leukemic cells may occur independently of LHR expression.

Gold sodium thiomalate inhibits the activity of T cell protein kinase C.,1839-48,"Previous studies have shown that the gold compounds, gold sodium thiomalate (GST) and auranofin (AUR), which are effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inhibit functional activities of a variety of cells, but the biochemical basis of their effect is unknown. In the current studies, human T cell proliferation and interleukin 2 production by Jurkat cells were inhibited by GST or AUR at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Because it has been documented that protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in T cell activation, the capacity of gold compounds to inhibit PKC partially purified from Jurkat cells was assayed in vitro. GST was found to inhibit PKC in a dose-dependent manner, but AUR caused no significant inhibition of PKC at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. The inhibitory effect of GST on PKC was abolished by 2-mercaptoethanol. To investigate the effect of GST on the regulation of PKC in vivo, the levels of PKC activity in Jurkat cells were examined. Cytosolic PKC activity decreased slowly in a concentration- and time-dependent manner as a result of incubation of Jurkat cells with GST. To ascertain whether GST inhibited PKC translocation and down-regulation, PKC activities associated with the membrane and cystosolic fractions were evaluated after phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation of GST incubated Jurkat cells. Translocation of PKC was markedly inhibited by pretreatment of Jurkat cells with GST for 3 d, but the capacity of PMA to down-regulate PKC activity in Jurkat cells was not altered by GST preincubation. The functional impact of GST-mediated downregulation of PKC in Jurkat cells was examined by analyzing PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of CD3. Although GST preincubated Jurkat cells exhibited an increased density of CD3, PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of the gamma chain of CD3 was markedly inhibited. Specificity for the inhibitory effect of GST on PKC was suggested by the finding that GST did not alter the mitogen-induced increases in inositol trisphosphate levels in Jurkat cells. Finally, the mechanism of the GST-induced inhibition of PKC was examined in detail, using purified PKC subspecies from rat brain. GST inhibited type II PKC more effectively than type III PKC, and also inhibited the enzymatic activity of the isolated catalytic fragment of PKC.

We performed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis on 68 peripheral blood samples from 26 patients treated with BU/CY prior to allo-BMT for chronic myelogenous leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. MC was detected in four of 26 patients for an overall incidence of 15.4%. Three of four MC patients are alive with no evidence of disease at 263 to 795 days post-transplantation. A fourth patient is alive at day 501 but developed CNS relapse at day 274. The level of recipient origin cells was less than 10% in all samples and detectable MC was transitory with an RFLP pattern that reverted to full chimerism. These results are comparable to those reported for TBI-containing regimens in patients receiving non-T cell-depleted bone marrow.

Most striking has been the establishment of a close association between certain immunophenotypical subtypes of CLL and infection with HTLV-I and possibly HTLV-II. CLL has consistently been shown to have a strong genetic component and a low incidence among Asians, but a growing body of evidence also links this major leukaemia type with environmental factors including solvents, unidentified farming and other occupational exposures. In contrast, CML is characterized by few genetic associations, relatively homogenous world-wide distribution, greater frequency in Blacks than in Whites, little evidence of viral aetiology, and evidence that exposures to ionizing radiation, benzene and possibly other chemical agents are important aetiological factors. Most studies suggest that acquired rather than genetic factors are of greater importance in the aetiology of CML, but this conclusion is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the relatively small variation in incidence rates internationally. Common to both disorders in most populations are an increasing incidence with age, male predominance, and stability of incidence, survival and mortality over the years, exclusive of improved survival of CML following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['Finch, S C', 'Linet, M S']","['Finch SC', 'Linet MS']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/complications', 'Diseases in Twins/epidemiology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80034-x [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1992 Jan;5(1):27-56. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80034-x.,,,,,,,93,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lethal mast cell disease is characterized by massive infiltration of bone marrow, spleen, and several other visceral organs by connective tissue mast cells, which normally reside in the skin and the peritoneal cavity. As is frequently found in malignant mastocytosis, the v-erbB-induced mast cell disease was accompanied in some primary recipients by an acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) that killed all secondary recipients regardless of whether the AML was already evident in the primary host. The infiltrating mast cells stained strongly positive with berberine sulfate, suggesting that they were terminally differentiated and in vitro they showed only a weak proliferative capacity. The leukemias were clonal but apparently of different origin than the malignant mast cells, implying the transformation of two independent cell populations. Leukemic cells expressed various myeloid-specific markers as well as the B220 antigen, normally associated with the B-cell lineage. However, the Ig heavy chain genes were still in germ line configuration. In culture, these cells proliferated in the absence of exogenous growth factors and had the capacity to differentiate into mature myeloid cells. Preliminary experiments suggest that v-erbB may use parts of a signal transduction pathway normally coupled to the c-kit receptor. The v-erbB-induced malignant mast cell disease should provide a useful animal model for elucidating the cause for malignant mastocytosis in humans and to explore possible therapeutic strategies.","['von Ruden, T', 'Kandels, S', 'Radaszkiewicz, T', 'Ullrich, A', 'Wagner, E F']","['von Ruden T', 'Kandels S', 'Radaszkiewicz T', 'Ullrich A', 'Wagner EF']","['Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-erbB)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/genetics', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', '*Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/pathology', 'Mastocytosis/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Oncogene Proteins v-erbB', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Transfection']",1992/06/15 00:00,1992/06/15 00:01,['1992/06/15 00:00'],"['1992/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71170-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jun 15;79(12):3145-58.,,,['v-erbB'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis showed no clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. The majority of the circulating lymphocytes had a NK cell phenotype and demonstrated both direct NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, the in vitro growth characteristics of these cells did not suggest that they were polyclonal expansions of normal NK cells.

Density gradient centrifugation methods were used to isolate mononuclear cells, and NK cells were positively selected by CD16-immunoconjugated magnetic beads. The DNA of these cells was analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism-methylation strategy and showed a monoclonal pattern of X-chromosome inactivation while a polyclonal pattern was obtained in corresponding skin tissue.

Three factors unrelated to machine performance contributed to the lower overall CE despite a high instantaneous CE: (1) A fall in the patient's mononuclear cell counts during apheresis leading to an overestimation of the cells available for collection, (2) dilution of blood by anti-coagulant, and (3) the operational dead space of the Fenwal CS3000. The overall CE corrected for these 3 factors approximated the instantaneous CE closely.

The flow cytometric analysis showed that the expression of HLA-DR and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was highly increased on HL-60 cells when stimulated with IFN-gamma after treatment with Vit D. The expression of ICAM-1 was also induced with IFN-gamma on untreated cells but in lower amounts. Monoclonal antibodies against ICAM-1 and HLA-DR inhibited the alpha T3-L-induced T-cell proliferation, indicating that these molecules are at least required for contact-mediated AC function. Thus our study revealed that HL-60 cells express cell surface interaction molecules necessary for potentiating the T-cell proliferation through two steps, differentiation with Vit D to mature monocyte-like cells followed by stimulation with IFN-gamma.","['Shinbori, T', 'Yamada, M', 'Kakimoto, K', 'Araki, S', 'Onoue, K']","['Shinbori T', 'Yamada M', 'Kakimoto K', 'Araki S', 'Onoue K']","['Department of Biochemistry, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Calcitriol/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Cell Communication/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1992 Apr;75(4):619-25.,,,,PMC1384840,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both allogeneic pooled peripheral blood mononuclear cells and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines (BCL) could function as accessory cells (AC) for PHA activation of T-cell clones. Although minimal clonal proliferation was seen when the T-cell activation signal was BCL+PHA+IL4, a majority of the clones could undergo IL4-dependent proliferation after previous activation with AC+PHA+IL2. For certain clones, IL4 also showed an additive effect with IL2. Thus, IL4 was a growth factor for a majority of the investigated posttransplant T-cell clones, and in vivo modulation of IL4-dependent T-cell functions may thus become a future therapeutic possibility to enhance graft-versus-leukaemia effects in bone marrow transplant recipients.","['Bruserud, O', 'Hamann, W', 'Patel, S', 'Ehninger, G', 'Pawelec, G']","['Bruserud O', 'Hamann W', 'Patel S', 'Ehninger G', 'Pawelec G']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tubingen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Clone Cells', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/*surgery', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/pharmacology']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb01589.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1992 Apr;48(4):221-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb01589.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nature of the biochemical lesion in these defective lymphocyte populations remains unknown. Flow cytometric analysis of the T cell population in infected animals has demonstrated expansion of both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Despite chronic expansion in vivo, CD4+ T cells by wk 4 postinfection failed to up-regulate cell surface IL-2R expression, produced IL-2, or proliferate in vitro in response to either Con A, Staphylococcal enterotoxin super-antigens, or anti-CD3 stimulation. Exogenous IL-2 did not restore the proliferative response and also failed to up-regulate IL-R expression on CD4+ T cells from infected mice, even though basal IL-2R expression was initially elevated compared to normals. In contrast, CD4+ T cells from infected mice could be induced to proliferate by stimulation with PMA and ionomycin resulting in IL-2R up-regulation, IL-2 production, and proliferation. Moreover, proliferation could also be induced by anti-CD3 plus PMA, although anti-CD3 plus ionomycin was without effect. These studies suggest that chronic expansion of CD4+ T cells in infected mice is probably not maintained by normal TCR signaling, which appears defective in these cells. In addition, the lesion in biochemical signaling appears to result in defective activation of protein kinase C, which can be overcome by direct activation with PMA.","['Fitzpatrick, E A', 'Bryson, J S', 'Rhoads, C', 'Kaplan, A M', 'Cohen, D A']","['Fitzpatrick EA', 'Bryson JS', 'Rhoads C', 'Kaplan AM', 'Cohen DA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Kentucky, Lexington 40536-0084.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'CD3 Complex', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*physiopathology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Jun 1;148(11):3377-84.,"['AA08237/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with energy inhibitors, such as dinitrophenol (DNP) or sodium azide/deoxyglucose, led to a marked decrease in daunorubicin accumulation in parental cells and cytoplasts. Another ionophore, monensin, also caused a significant decrease in daunorubicin accumulation; however, ATPase inhibitors ouabain, vanadate, and N-ethylamaleimide had little or no effect. The lysosomatropic agents chloroquine and methylamine caused a moderate decrease in anthracycline accumulation. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the DNP-sensitive daunorubicin uptake occurred in a nonnuclear subcellular compartment. Studies using increasing daunorubicin concentrations demonstrated fluorescence quenching that occurred in the nonnuclear, DNP-sensitive compartment. The effect of inhibitors on the accumulation of rhodamine 123 and acridine orange strongly implicated lysosomes as the principal compartment of this inhibitable daunorubicin accumulation. Cytoplasts from P-glycoprotein containing multidrug-resistant K562 cells demonstrated a verapamil-reversible, decreased daunorubicin accumulation that was observed in resistant whole cells. Verapamil pretreatment of cytoplasts from resistant cells revealed the subcellular DNP-sensitive uptake present in parental cytoplasts. These studies demonstrate that cytoplasts are an effective means to study drug transport in mammalian cells without nuclear drug binding. Parental K562 cells and cytoplasts exhibit an energy-dependent accumulation of daunorubicin into cytoplasmic organelles that is also present in resistant cells and cytoplasts when P-glycoprotein mediated efflux is inhibited.","['Slapak, C A', 'Lecerf, J M', 'Daniel, J C', 'Levy, S B']","['Slapak CA', 'Lecerf JM', 'Daniel JC', 'Levy SB']","['Department of Medicine, New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Methylamines)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'BSF23SJ79E (methylamine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Methylamines/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Sodium Azide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1992/05/25 00:00,1992/05/25 00:01,['1992/05/25 00:00'],"['1992/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)50065-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 May 25;267(15):10638-44.,"['CA-01613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32-CA08774/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sensitivity of K562/DOX to 10(-6) M mitoxantrone was also slightly enhanced by CyA. The change in CFU-L drug sensitivity in the presence of CyA was then tested in 12 relapsing/resisting patients and in 3 untreated patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). No change in CFU-L sensitivity to DNR was noted, despite the presence of a subset of P-glycoprotein positive (P-gp+) cells in three out of the ten evaluable cases. Among the six evaluable cases tested with mitoxantrone and CyA, an increase of 50% in CFU-L sensitivity to mitoxantrone was noted in one (of three) P-gp+ patient.

However, substantial morbidity and mortality result from the 3- to 6-week period of marrow aplasia until the reinfused marrow recovers adequate hematopoietic function. Hematopoietic growth factors, particularly used after chemotherapy, can increase the number of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) present in systemic circulation. The reinfusion of PBPCs with marrow has recently been reported to reduce the time to recovery of adequate marrow function. This study was designed to determine whether granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-mobilized PBPCs alone (without marrow) would result in rapid and reliable hematopoietic reconstitution. Sixteen patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with four cycles of doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and methotrexate (AFM induction). Patients responding after the first two cycles were administered GM-CSF after the third and fourth cycles to recruit PBPCs for collection by two leukapheresis per cycle. These PBPCs were reinfused as the sole source of hematopoietic support after high doses of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin. No marrow or hematopoietic cytokines were used after progenitor cell reinfusion. Granulocytes greater than or equal to 500/microL was observed on a median of day 14 (range, 8 to 57). Transfusion independence of platelets greater than or equal to 20,000/microL occurred on a median day of 12 (range, 8 to 134). However, three patients required the use of a reserve marrow for slow platelet engraftment. In retrospect, these patients were characterized by poor baseline bone marrow cellularity and poor platelet recovery after AFM induction therapy. When compared with 29 historical control patients who had received the same high-dose intensification chemotherapy using autologous marrow support, time to engraftment, antibiotic days, transfusion requirements, and lengths of hospital stay were all significantly improved for the patients receiving PBPCs. Thus, autologous PBPCs can be efficiently collected during mobilization by chemotherapy and GM-CSF and are an attractive alternative to marrow for hematopoietic support after high-dose therapy. The enhanced speed of recovery may reduce the morbidity, mortality, and cost of high-dose treatment. Furthermore, PBPC support may enhance the effectiveness of high-dose therapy by facilitating multiple courses of therapy.","['Elias, A D', 'Ayash, L', 'Anderson, K C', 'Hunt, M', 'Wheeler, C', 'Schwartz, G', 'Tepler, I', 'Mazanet, R', 'Lynch, C', 'Pap, S']","['Elias AD', 'Ayash L', 'Anderson KC', 'Hunt M', 'Wheeler C', 'Schwartz G', 'Tepler I', 'Mazanet R', 'Lynch C', 'Pap S', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Component Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocytes/pathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Thiotepa/administration & dosage']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71238-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jun 1;79(11):3036-44.,['P01CA-38493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To develop assays that would be predictive of how a particular patient's disease would evolve, we studied the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by Western blotting in 40 patients with CLL. The concentration of PCNA, a cofactor for delta DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, is indicative of the proliferative state of the cell. Significantly lower PCNA levels were observed in earlier stage CLL when compared with more advanced disease. The leukemic cell proliferative rate, assessed by lymphocyte doubling time and flow cytometry, also correlated significantly with the level of PCNA expression. These results suggest that a high level of PCNA in the cells of CLL patients at presentation identifies a subgroup of patients whose CLL cells have a higher proliferative activity and who may, therefore, have a potentially shorter survival.","['del Giglio, A', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Ford, R', 'Saya, H', 'Manning, J', 'Keating, M', 'Johnston, D', 'Khetan, R', 'el-Naggar, A', 'Deisseroth, A']","['del Giglio A', ""O'Brien S"", 'Ford R', 'Saya H', 'Manning J', 'Keating M', 'Johnston D', 'Khetan R', 'el-Naggar A', 'Deisseroth A']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/blood', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/15 00:00,1992/05/15 00:01,['1992/05/15 00:00'],"['1992/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)72945-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 May 15;79(10):2717-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During myeloid differentiation, the increase in CD18 cell surface expression is paralleled by increased CD18 messenger RNA levels. Nuclear run-on studies show that CD18 expression is transcriptionally regulated during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced HL-60 monocytic differentiation. The CD18 transcriptional start site was defined by primer extension and RNAse protection. The gene encoding CD18 was cloned and a fragment that overlaps the transcriptional start site was isolated. DNA sequence analysis of this promoter fragment identified potential AP-1 elements that may mediate the TPA transcriptional response. The CD18 promoter also contains a putative binding site for PU.1, a leukocyte-specific transcription factor. DNA elements resembling those found in other myeloid and integrin promoters were identified. The CD18 promoter fragment was linked to the luciferase reporter gene, electroporated into the U937 monocytic cell line, and its expression increased after exposure to TPA. Thus, CD18 may serve as a model for identifying the cis elements and trans-acting factors that regulate gene expression during myeloid differentiation.","['Rosmarin, A G', 'Levy, R', 'Tenen, D G']","['Rosmarin AG', 'Levy R', 'Tenen DG']","['Department of Medicine, Miriam Hospital, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'CD18 Antigens', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/physiology', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'DNA Probes', 'Genomic Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection']",1992/05/15 00:00,1992/05/15 00:01,['1992/05/15 00:00'],"['1992/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)72930-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 May 15;79(10):2598-604.,"['5P-30CA13943-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 01283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different aspects of drug resistance were studied in 17 children with relapsed ALL. The in vitro sensitivity profile was determined using the MTT assay. Cells from relapsed children were significantly more resistant to 6-thioguanine, prednisolone, cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin (DNR), mustine-HCl and mafosfamide but not to L-asparaginase and vincristine (VCR) than cells from 41 children with ALL at initial diagnosis. Some relapsed patients showed a general drug resistance while others were resistant to only 1-3 drugs. The relevance of the multidrug resistance (MDR) model was analysed: In all DNR- and VCR resistant cases a co-resistance to drugs not involved in the MDR model was found. P-glycoprotein was not detected in any of 28 untreated and 14 relapsed samples tested. VCR- and DNR accumulation in the most resistant cells were not lower than in sensitive cells. Resistance modifiers did not potentiate the cytotoxicity of VCR and DNR. We conclude that resistance to anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids in childhood relapsed ALL is not due to P-glycoprotein mediated MDR. Different types of drug resistance varying from a resistance to only one drug to a general chemoresistance, can be detected in children with relapsed ALL. VCR and L-asparaginase seemed to be only infrequently involved in drug resistance. Knowledge of drug resistance might lead to more effective and less toxic therapies for children with relapsed ALL.","['Pieters, R', 'Hongo, T', 'Loonen, A H', 'Huismans, D R', 'Broxterman, H J', 'Hahlen, K', 'Veerman, A J']","['Pieters R', 'Hongo T', 'Loonen AH', 'Huismans DR', 'Broxterman HJ', 'Hahlen K', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Child', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1992.146 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1992 May;65(5):691-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1992.146.,,,,PMC1977370,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One week after the initiation of conventional chemotherapy for ALL, the leukemic blasts had disappeared. Alternatively, monocytoid cells appeared along with the recovery from nadir status. They showed several features of monocytes; they were weakly dot-positive for nonspecific esterase, reactive with CD14 and CD13 and Fc gamma-receptor-positive. Furthermore, they migrated into a fungally infected joint space. Features incompatible with normal monocytes were the absence of peroxidase reactivity, the expression of B-cell-associated antigens, CD19 and CD10 and E-rosette receptor, CD2. Southern blot hybridization analysis revealed an unexpected result that HindIII digested DNA from both leukemic blasts and monocytoid cells had the same rearranged band of IgH.

Adoptive transfer of syngeneic total T cells from immunized mice protected newborn mice, at least partially, from ts1-induced disease syndrome. In infected mice who received total immune T cells, virus replication was reduced and the mice survived longer. When only separated immune CD8+ T cells were transferred to infected mice, similar protection, albeit to a lesser extent, was observed. Transfer of separated immune CD4+ T cells alone gave no protection. However, when recombined CD4+ and CD8+ cells were transferred together, an immune response similar to that when total T cells were transferred was observed. Cytotoxic assays from ts1-immunized mice revealed the presence of virus-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes that could lyse virus-expressing cells at a high effector/target ratio.

Interestingly, the frequency of virus-specific precursor cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) observed in moderately-aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice was not substantially decreased from that found in their young responder counterparts. To further investigate the mechanism(s) responsible for the inability of moderately-aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice to mount AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL responses, adoptive transfer experiments were performed in the present study. Transferring splenocytes from moderately-aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b donors into young AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b recipients resulted in inhibition of AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL responsiveness. Anti-Thy-1.1 plus complement depletion of T cells from the donor cell population before adoptive transfer resulted in a near complete restoration of AKR/Gross MuLV responsiveness of young recipient AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice suggesting that the inhibition observed in moderately aged mice was mediated by T lymphocytes. Additional experiments using depletion of T subsets before cell transfer demonstrated that inhibition of AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL responsiveness was mediated by a CD4-CD8+ T lymphocyte.","['Rich, R F', 'Fujii, T', 'Green, W R']","['Rich RF', 'Fujii T', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03756.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (anti-Thy antibody)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['*AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Aging/immunology', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Isoantibodies/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transfection']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 May 1;148(9):2961-7.,"['CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K04 CA-01112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amplification of the VNTR loci in DNA from BMMC using the polymerase chain reaction revealed the persistence of host cells in two of four patients studied. One of the patients, whose cultured lymphocytes inhibited in vitro growth of donor-derived hemopoietic progenitor cells, responded to immunosuppressive therapy and donor-derived hemopoiesis was restored. In the other patient, host-derived polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) appeared together with donor-derived PMN from the early post-transplant period, and he proceeded to relapse with myelodysplastic syndrome. In the other two patients in whom host cells were not detectable, the marrow hypoplasia was associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The hypoplasia improved significantly as the chronic GVHD improved in response to immunosuppressive therapy. We conclude that detecting minimal residual host cells by means of amplification of VNTR loci is valuable for understanding the etiology of late graft failure in marrow transplant recipients, and could prove helpful for choosing appropriate therapy for this syndrome.","['Nakao, S', 'Nakatsumi, T', 'Chuhjo, T', 'Ohtaguro, M', 'Tsuchiya, H', 'Niki, T', 'Shiobara, S', 'Mori, T', 'Matsuda, T']","['Nakao S', 'Nakatsumi T', 'Chuhjo T', 'Ohtaguro M', 'Tsuchiya H', 'Niki T', 'Shiobara S', 'Mori T', 'Matsuda T']","['Third Department of Medicine, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/pathology/surgery', 'Anemia, Refractory/pathology/surgery', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA/*analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/pathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Pancytopenia/etiology/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992 Feb;9(2):107-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the ultrastructural techniques are cumbersome, immunologic assays for expression of several platelet-specific antigens, such as CD41a (platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa), have become the primary method used to detect megakaryoblastic differentiation. In our flow cytometric analysis of the immunophenotypes of over 1,000 cases of AML from patients registered to Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) Treatment Protocols, we found that 38% of cases demonstrated CD41a reactivity. Because this frequency of CD41a expression by flow cytometry greatly exceeded the number of morphologically defined cases of AML-M7, we postulated that the reaction may be caused by platelets adherent to leukemic blasts. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a side-by-side comparison of flow cytometric and cytospin immunofluorescence studies on 37 cases of adult de novo AML that demonstrated a wide range of CD41a expression by flow cytometric analyses. We found that the expression of CD41a detected by flow cytometric techniques was secondary to adherent platelets or platelet fragments in 85% of cases. Many of these cases also expressed the lineage-specific carbohydrate, LNF III (CD15), which may mediate platelet adhesion to mature monocytes and neutrophils. Only 15% of the CD41a flow cytometrically positive cases demonstrated true diffuse membrane and cytoplasmic positivity on cytospin slides indicative of megakaryoblastic differentiation. Cytospin immunofluorescence for CD41a should be performed on all cases of suspected AML-M7. If only flow cytometric techniques are used, adherent platelets may result in the erroneous diagnosis of this AML subtype.","['Betz, S A', 'Foucar, K', 'Head, D R', 'Chen, I M', 'Willman, C L']","['Betz SA', 'Foucar K', 'Head DR', 'Chen IM', 'Willman CL']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Lewis X Antigen', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Adhesiveness', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)72994-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 May 1;79(9):2399-403.,"['CA12213/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though CD11a/18 and CD54 are important in leukocyte and endothelial cell interaction, the literature suggested that these adhesion proteins are not involved in adhesion of hematopoietic stem cells to MSC. We therefore utilized a unique ICAM-1- murine MSC line (MLT) to evaluate the mechanisms of adherence of LL cells (L5178Y and L1210) to MLT. Adherence of LL cells to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins was also examined. L1210 cells attached to collagen types III and IV, laminin, and fibronectin, but not to collagen type I. L5178Y cells did not attach to any of the ECM proteins tested. The adherence of both L1210 and L5178Y to MSC was unaffected by rat monoclonal antibodies to murine CD11a, CD11b, and CD18.

The expression of the eleven HOX 1 genes is lineage-restricted and these genes are predominantly detected within cells of myelomonocytic origin. This is in strong contrast with the erythro-megakaryocytic specific expression of HOX 2 genes. Furthermore, we have observed that the expression of three HOX 1 genes within B lymphoid lineages is stage-related and that the expression of several of them is switched off during TPA-induced differentiation of Kg1 and U937.

Molecular biological analysis has had a greater impact on the investigation of HIV and AIDS than on that of any other disease. Unfortunately, the vast amount of material published on this subject has still not resulted in a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS. Undoubtedly, part of the reason for the complexity of this disease stems from the ability of HIV to infect a large number of different cell types. To comprehend the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AIDS, it is of great importance to understand the factors that control the cell tropism of the virus. In this review, we describe the known factors involved in the determination of the cell tropism of retroviruses and the ways by which molecular biological analysis of HIV has revealed the nature of the processes involved in control of the tropism of the virus for various cell types.","['Johnson, M A', 'Cann, A J']","['Johnson MA', 'Cann AJ']","['Microbiology Department, University of Leicester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/physiology', 'CD4 Antigens/physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, nef', 'Genes, tat', 'Genetic Variation', 'HIV/genetics/*physiology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/clinids/14.3.747 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 1992 Mar;14(3):747-55. doi: 10.1093/clinids/14.3.747.,,,"['env', 'gag', 'nef', 'pol', 'rev', 'tat', 'vif', 'vpr', 'vpu']",,,,114,,,,,,,,,,,,

T lymphocytes have been shown to be primarily responsible for this ts1-induced syndrome. Here we compare the role played by each subset of T lymphocytes, i.e., CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in disease development. Mice were depleted of a specific subset for the first 10 days of their lives by using either anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies in vivo. Disease development in these mice was then monitored. Depletion of CD4+ T cells significantly attenuated the ts1-induced syndrome: virus replication was decreased, disease latency was extended, and death was prevented in 60% of the mice. Similar treatment with anti-CD8 antibody had almost no effect on disease progression. However, when depletion was begun 2 weeks after neonatal ts1 inoculation, CD4+ T cell depletion did not affect disease development. ts1 infected CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes equally well in vivo, as shown by flow cytometric analysis, but virus replication was restricted primarily to the CD4+ subset of T cells, as found by in vitro assay. Hence, CD4+ T lymphocytes play an important role in the development of ts1-induced paralysis and immunodeficiency. The mechanism of this CD4+ T-cell-mediated disease production by ts1 is not clear; however, increased replication of ts1 in the CD4+ T cells, especially in the early stages of the disease, seems to play a crucial role.","['Saha, K', 'Wong, P K']","['Saha K', 'Wong PK']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville 78957.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/microbiology', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'Hindlimb/pathology', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/etiology', 'Immunocompetence', 'Leukemia, Experimental/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Mutation', 'Paralysis/etiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*microbiology', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology', 'Virus Replication']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.5.2639-2646.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 May;66(5):2639-46. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.5.2639-2646.1992.,"['AI 28283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC241017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) overexpression on TPT cytotoxicity was examined in CHRC5 (colchicine-resistant) and AuxB1 (parental) Chinese hamster ovary cells. Examination of the IC50 values observed in colony-forming assays revealed that the CHRC5 cells were 15-fold (SD, +/- 3; n = 3) resistant to TPT after a 1-h exposure and 3.2-fold (SD, +/- 1.4; n = 4) resistant in continuous exposure experiments. Band depletion immunoblotting revealed that 4-fold higher concentrations of extracellular TPT were required to induce the formation of topo I-DNA complexes in CHRC5 cells as compared to AuxB1 cells. To assess the role of Pgp in this resistance, drug accumulation and cytotoxicity assays were repeated in the absence and presence of quinidine. Addition of quinidine enhanced TPT accumulation (measured by high-performance liquid chromatography) and diminished the IC50 for TPT to a greater extent in CHRC5 cells than in AuxB1 cells. To examine whether similar effects could be detected in Pgp-expressing human cells, MCF-7/Adriar breast cancer cells and KG1a human acute myelogenous leukemia cells were examined. Quinidine or verapamil enhanced TPT accumulation in both of these cell lines but had no effect in parental MCF-7 cells or a variety of human leukemia cell lines that do not overexpress Pgp. Cytotoxicity measurements performed by counting the number of surviving cells (MCF-7/Adriar) or employing a modified, highly stable tetrazolium dye reduction assay (leukemia cell lines) revealed that quinidine diminished the IC50 for TPT in the Pgp-overexpressing cell lines but not in the control lines. These results suggest that Pgp overexpression diminishes TPT accumulation and TPT cytotoxicity in hamster and human cells. It should be stressed, however, that these effects were substantially smaller than the effects of Pgp overexpression on the accumulation and cytotoxicity of the anthracycline daunorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide in the same cell lines.","['Hendricks, C B', 'Rowinsky, E K', 'Grochow, L B', 'Donehower, R C', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Hendricks CB', 'Rowinsky EK', 'Grochow LB', 'Donehower RC', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Quinidine/pharmacology', 'Topotecan', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/15 00:00,1992/04/15 00:01,['1992/04/15 00:00'],"['1992/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Apr 15;52(8):2268-78.,"['CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor cell engraftment was documented in the peripheral blood and bone marrow by cytogenetic analysis, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as early as day 21. Furthermore, the donor origin of each lymphohematopoietic lineage (ie, CD5+ T cells, CD19/20+ B cells, CFU-GM, and burst-forming unit-erythrocyte [BFU-E]) was confirmed.

Recurrent disease was confirmed histologically on day 225.

It is not known whether this molecular alteration is a uniform consequence of the t(1;19) or is restricted to translocation events within specific immunologic subtypes of the disease. Therefore, we studied leukemic cells from 25 cases of B-cell precursor ALL, with or without evidence of cytoplasmic Ig mu heavy chains (cIg); 17 cases had the t(1;19) by cytogenetic analysis. Leukemic cell DNA samples were analyzed by Southern blotting to detect alterations within the E2A genomic locus; a polymerase chain reaction assay was used to identify expression of chimeric E2A-pbx1 transcripts in leukemic cell RNA; and immunoblotting with anti-Pbx1 antibodies was used to detect hybrid E2A-Pbx1 proteins. Of 11 cases of cIg+ ALL with the t(1;19), 10 had E2A-pbx1 chimeric transcripts with identical junctions and a characteristic set of E2A-Pbx1 hybrid proteins. Each of these cases had E2A gene rearrangements, including the one in which fusion transcripts were not detected. By contrast, none of the six cases of t(1;19)-positive, cIg- ALL had evidence of rearranged E2A genomic restriction fragments, detectable E2A-pbx1 chimeric transcripts, or hybrid E2A-Pbx1 proteins. Typical chimeric E2A-pbx1 transcripts and proteins were detected in one of eight cIg+ leukemias in which the t(1;19) was not identified by cytogenetic analysis, emphasizing the increased sensitivity of molecular analysis for detection of this abnormality. We conclude that the molecular breakpoints in cases of cIg- B-cell precursor ALL with the t(1;19) differ from those in cIg+ cases with this translocation. Leukemias that express hybrid oncoproteins such as E2A-Pbx1 or Bcr-Abl have had a poor prognosis in most studies. Thus, molecular techniques to detect fusion genes and their aberrant products should allow more timely and appropriate treatment of these aggressive subtypes of the disease.","['Privitera, E', 'Kamps, M P', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Inaba, T', 'Shapiro, L H', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Behm, F', 'Hendershot, L', 'Carroll, A J', 'Baltimore, D']","['Privitera E', 'Kamps MP', 'Hayashi Y', 'Inaba T', 'Shapiro LH', 'Raimondi SC', 'Behm F', 'Hendershot L', 'Carroll AJ', 'Baltimore D', 'et al.']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Multimerization/genetics', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73673-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Apr 1;79(7):1781-8.,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,"['E2A', 'E2A-pbx1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we detected spliced messages for the HTLV-I pX regulatory genes in primary uncultured cells from ATL patients and healthy asymptomatic carriers. In addition to the expected doubly spliced pX message, three alternatively spliced mRNAs were demonstrated (pX delta 17, pX-p21rex, and pX-orfII mRNAs, where orf = open reading frame). The same splice sites were shown in the messages from uncultured ATL cells and from the HTLV-I-producing C10/MJ cell line. Alternatively spliced pX mRNAs have the potential to code for known and putative pX gene products. Among the transcripts is a monocistronic mRNA likely to code for p21rex (pX-p21rex mRNA). Since alternative splicing of HTLV-I pX mRNA can be found in primary uncultured cells, it is likely to have a functional significance in vivo. This suggests possible roles for HTLV-I gene expression in the progression to and maintenance of ATL, as well as in the phase preceding it.","['Berneman, Z N', 'Gartenhaus, R B', 'Reitz, M S Jr', 'Blattner, W A', 'Manns, A', 'Hanchard, B', 'Ikehara, O', 'Gallo, R C', 'Klotman, M E']","['Berneman ZN', 'Gartenhaus RB', 'Reitz MS Jr', 'Blattner WA', 'Manns A', 'Hanchard B', 'Ikehara O', 'Gallo RC', 'Klotman ME']","['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1992/04/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/04/11 19:15'],"['1992/04/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/04/11 19:15 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.7.3005 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Apr 1;89(7):3005-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.7.3005.,,,,PMC48792,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In part, this spectrum of activity may be attributable to the selective toxicity of CdA to nondividing lymphocytes and monocytes. However, CdA is unstable at acidic pH and is degraded by bacterial nucleoside phosphorylases. The present experiments demonstrate that the 2'-arabino-fluoro derivative of CdA, designated CAFdA, is also directly toxic to quiescent lymphocytes and macrophages. Unlike CdA, CAFdA was stable at pH 2 and resisted degradation by Escherichia coli nucleoside phosphorylase. Cell killing was preceded by the formation of DNA strand breaks and could be prevented by supplementation of the medium with deoxycytidine. The initial DNA damage initiated the pattern of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis. Mutant lymphoblasts, deficient in deoxycytidine kinase, with elevated cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase, or with expanded deoxynucleotide pools secondary to increased ribonucleotide reductase activity, were cross-resistant to both CAFdA and CdA toxicity. One-week oral treatment with CAFdA (1 mg/ml in drinking water) achieved an average plasma concentration of 0.56 microM and eliminated 90% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells transplanted into severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mice. Under the same conditions, CdA was much less active. Collectively, these results suggest that CAFdA could be effective as an oral agent in indolent lymphoproliferative diseases and in autoimmune diseases where lymphocyte and monocyte depletion is desirable.","['Carson, D A', 'Wasson, D B', 'Esparza, L M', 'Carrera, C J', 'Kipps, T J', 'Cottam, H B']","['Carson DA', 'Wasson DB', 'Esparza LM', 'Carrera CJ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Cottam HB']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0663.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Adenine Nucleotides', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Arabinonucleosides/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cladribine', 'Clofarabine', 'DNA/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Deoxyadenosines/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Monocytes/*drug effects']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.7.2970 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Apr 1;89(7):2970-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.7.2970.,"['CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC48785,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the CD11b subunit is restricted to cells of the myelomonocytic lineage and depends upon the stage of differentiation with the most mature myeloid cells expressing the highest levels of CD11b. To study the regulation of CD11b expression, a genomic clone corresponding to the 5' region of the CD11b gene was isolated from a human chromosome 16 library. Primer extension and RNase protection assays identified two major transcriptional start sites, located 90 base pairs and 54 base pairs upstream from the initiation methionine. DNA sequence analysis of 1.7 kilobases of the 5' flanking sequence of the CD11b gene indicated the absence of a ""CAAT"" or ""TATA"" box; however, potential binding sites for the transcription activators Sp1, PU.1, ets, and AP-2 are present, as well as retinoic acid response elements. The 1.7-kilobase CD11b promoter sequence displayed functional activity in transient transfection assays in the monocytic cell line THP-1 and the myeloid cell line HL-60. In contrast, this 1.7-kilobase promoter sequence did not display functional activity in the Jurkat T-lymphoid cell line. Detailed characterization of the CD11b promoter sequence should provide insight into the molecular events regulating the tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific expression of the CD11b molecule in myelomonocytic cells.","['Hickstein, D D', 'Baker, D M', 'Gollahon, K A', 'Back, A L']","['Hickstein DD', 'Baker DM', 'Gollahon KA', 'Back AL']","['Medical Research Service, Seattle Veterans Affairs Medical Center, WA 98108.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'CD11 Antigens', 'Cell Line', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Sorting Signals/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.6.2105 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Mar 15;89(6):2105-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.6.2105.,"['DK43530/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL02637/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC48605,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, in the case of avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV), v-erbA enhances the effect of the tyrosine kinase-encoding v-erbB oncogene by blocking the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells. In the case of E26 virus a fusion of the product from v-ets to that of the nuclear oncogene v-myb is a prerequisite for leukemogenicity. Here we show that an artificial virus carrying both v-erbA and v-ets induces a rapid, acute erythroleukemia phenotypically similar to that induced by AEV. In contrast, virus constructs containing either v-erbA or v-ets alone are non-leukemogenic, although they are capable of transforming erythroid cells in vitro. Analysis of in vitro-transformed cells showed that v-erbA induces a block of differentiation without abrogating dependence on anemic serum, while v-ets predominantly causes anemic serum independence. As expected, cells transformed by both oncogenes exhibit an increased proliferative potential, are blocked in differentiation and are anemic serum independent. These data demonstrate that two separately expressed nuclear oncoproteins can complement each other in vitro and in vivo.

By means of a p170-directed monoclonal antibody (MRK-16) and immunocytochemistry (alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique), we investigated the expression of p170 in marrow blast cells of 59 cases (38 at diagnosis and 21 in relapse) of acute-non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). The proportion of strongly MDR-positive cells was higher in relapse that at diagnosis (median 15.5% vs 1.5%). Out of 31 patients who were evaluable for the results of first remission induction, failure of first-line treatment (including Daunorubicin, standard-dose and high-dose Arabinosyl Cytosine, and sometimes also Mitoxantrone) occurred in 8/22 MDR-positive cases and in 1/9 MDR-negative ones (p = 0.21). Failure of first-line treatment was always associated with a progressive increase of p170 expression. Total failures (no remission plus early relapse) were more frequent (p = 0.001) among MDR-positive cases (16/22) than among the others (2/9). These data show that MDR is very frequent in ANLL also at diagnosis and suggest that MDR can contribute to early failure of standard treatment.","['Michieli, M', 'Damiani, D', 'Geromin, A', 'Michelutti, A', 'Fanin, R', 'Raspadori, D', 'Russo, D', 'Visani, G', 'Dinota, A', 'Pileri, S']","['Michieli M', 'Damiani D', 'Geromin A', 'Michelutti A', 'Fanin R', 'Raspadori D', 'Russo D', 'Visani G', 'Dinota A', 'Pileri S', 'et al.']","['Chair of Hematology, University of Udine School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics', 'Remission Induction']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb00571.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1992 Feb;48(2):87-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb00571.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rationale for this study was the observation that the majority of patients with therapy-related leukemia (t-AML or t-MDS), resulting from cytotoxic treatment for prior malignancies, have loss of chromosome 5 and/or 7 or deletions involving the long arms of one or both of these chromosomes. This cytogenetic finding suggested that tumor-suppressor genes, important in the development of AML, may be located in these chromosomal regions. We analyzed a total of 60 patients, 43 with primary MDS/AML de novo and 17 with t-MDS/t-AML. Leukemia cells were evaluated for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Leukemia cell genotypes were compared with lymphoblastoid cell genotypes from the same patients. Two cases of loss of heterozygosity were identified from chromosomes lacking visible deletions: one involving chromosome 5 in a patient with AML de novo who had a visible deletion of 5q at a later stage of the disease, and one involving chromosome 7 in a patient with t-AML. We conclude that allele loss from loci on chromosomes 5 and 7 in MDS/AML, when it occurs, usually results from major deletion or simple chromosome loss, rather than from mitotic recombination or chromosome loss with duplication of the remaining homologue.","['Neuman, W L', 'Rubin, C M', 'Rios, R B', 'Larson, R A', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Rowley, J D', 'Vardiman, J W', 'Schwartz, J L', 'Farber, R A']","['Neuman WL', 'Rubin CM', 'Rios RB', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM', 'Rowley JD', 'Vardiman JW', 'Schwartz JL', 'Farber RA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73709-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Mar 15;79(6):1501-10.,"['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCNA immunostaining revealed the pattern of proliferation within individual haemopoietic lineages in normal marrow. Two unexpected observations were made: of erythroid cells, only pro-erythroblasts and occasional early normoblasts reacted, and positivity of megakaryocytes was unrelated to nuclear lobulation or CD61 expression. The pathological cases represented conditions in which haemopoiesis is increased (reactive hyperplasia, chronic granulocytic leukaemia, myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes, megaloblastic anaemia). Increases in the number, and disturbances of the spatial organization, of PCNA-expressing cells were present to a variable extent in all cases. Sheets of PCNA-positive megaloblastoid erythrocytes were frequently found in myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative tissue, associated with marked disturbances in the spatial organization of all haemopoietic lineages. Cases of megaloblastic anaemia due to vitamin B12/folate deficiency also demonstrated greatly increased erythroid PCNA expression, with positivity in some giant metamyelocytes. In addition to reflecting increased proliferation, elevated PCNA expression in some bone marrow pathologies may be due to altered kinetics of the protein induced by disturbances in growth factor production.","['Wilkins, B S', 'Harris, S', 'Waseem, N H', 'Lane, D P', 'Jones, D B']","['Wilkins BS', 'Harris S', 'Waseem NH', 'Lane DP', 'Jones DB']","['University Department of Pathology, Southampton General Hospital, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)']",IM,"['Autoantigens/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Hematologic Diseases/immunology/*pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/path.1711660108 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 1992 Jan;166(1):45-52. doi: 10.1002/path.1711660108.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PSC-833, a new cyclosporine, exerts a similar resistance-modifying activity but lacks toxicity or immunosuppressive activity. We have tested its potency in vitro and in vivo on the L1210 leukemia cell line transfected with a full-length cDNA copy of the human mdr I gene, which showed a stable 30-fold resistance towards adriamycin as compared to the parental cell line. In vitro growth of the transfected cell was unchanged. In vivo growth was less aggressive; the survival time of inoculated mice was prolonged. In vitro, PSC-833 was at least as potent as CsA or verapamil in reversing multidrug resistance. In vivo, the drug-resistant L1210 leukemia was completely unresponsive to i.v. monotherapy with adriamycin at its maximum tolerated dose (MTD). PSC-833 enhanced the activity and toxicity of adriamycin. The MTD of adriamycin was about 3 times lower than when given alone. On this basis, the MTD of i.v. adriamycin in combination with oral PSC-833 successfully overcame refractoriness to treatment.

The t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation results in the formation of a BCR-ABL fusion gene that encodes a 210-kDa chimeric protein with abnormal tyrosine kinase activity. The ABL and BCR genes are expressed by normal cells and thus the encoded proteins are presumably nonimmunogenic. However, the joining-region segment of the p210BCR-ABL chimeric protein is composed of unique sequences of ABL amino acids joined to BCR amino acids that are expressed only by malignant cells. The current study demonstrates that the joining region of BCR-ABL protein is immunogenic to murine T cells. Immunization of mice with synthetic peptides corresponding to the joining region elicited peptide-specific, CD4+, class II major histocompatibility complex-restricted T cells. The BCR-ABL peptide-specific T cells recognized only the combined sequence of BCR-ABL amino acids and not BCR or ABL amino acid sequences alone. Importantly, the BCR-ABL peptide-specific T cells could recognize and proliferate in response to p210BCR-ABL protein. The response of peptide-specific T cells to protein demonstrated that p210BCR-ABL can be processed by antigen-presenting cells so that the joining segment is bound to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules in a configuration similar to that of the immunizing peptide and in a concentration high enough to stimulate the antigen-specific T-cell receptor. Thus, BCR-ABL protein represents a potential tumor-specific antigen related to the transforming event and shared by many individuals with chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Chen, W', 'Peace, D J', 'Rovira, D K', 'You, S G', 'Cheever, M A']","['Chen W', 'Peace DJ', 'Rovira DK', 'You SG', 'Cheever MA']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Peptides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*immunology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1992/02/15 00:00,1992/02/15 00:01,['1992/02/15 00:00'],"['1992/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.4.1468 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Feb 15;89(4):1468-72. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.4.1468.,"['K08 CA01299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA54561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC48472,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with low-grade lymphocytic lymphomas including diffuse small lymphocytic, follicular small-cleaved, and follicular mixed histologies were enrolled onto the study. Conventional therapies had failed in all patients, and six patients had lymph node biopsies showing evidence of histologic evolution to a higher-grade lymphoma. A total of 107 courses of 2-CdA were administered. There were 27 males and 13 females. The median age was 59 years (range, 37 to 80 years). Patients had received a median of three prior therapies (range, one to six therapies). RESULTS: An overall response rate of 43% was achieved, with eight patients experiencing complete responses (CRs) and nine patients experiencing partial responses (PRs). The duration of responses ranged from 1 to greater than 33 months without maintenance therapy (median duration of response, 5 months). Histology and prior therapy history did not seem to correlate with responses. Significant toxicity was limited to bone marrow suppression; 18% of patients developed neutropenia, and 30% developed thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: This phase II trial demonstrates that 2-CdA is an effective antilymphocyte, antineoplastic agent with significant activity as a single agent in patients with recurrent or refractory low-grade lymphocytic lymphoma. Responses were achieved with an acceptable toxicity profile. Further trials of this agent in previously untreated patients and in combination regimens are indicated and will be developed.","['Kay, A C', 'Saven, A', 'Carrera, C J', 'Carson, D A', 'Thurston, D', 'Beutler, E', 'Piro, L D']","['Kay AC', 'Saven A', 'Carrera CJ', 'Carson DA', 'Thurston D', 'Beutler E', 'Piro LD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Cladribine', 'Deoxyadenosines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.3.371 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Mar;10(3):371-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.3.371.,"['FDR-0028003/FD/FDA HHS/United States', 'GM23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['J Clin Oncol. 1992 Mar;10(3):352-5.

To substantiate and extend this result, we performed a phase II trial in a representative group of children and young adults with relapsed acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients (median age, 11 years) with acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia in first or later relapse (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 17; acute lymphoid leukemia [ALL], seven) were given continuous infusion 2-CDA for 5 days at 8.9 mg/m2/d. Patients with residual blast cells 10 days after treatment received a second course of 2-CDA that was identical to the first. Detailed pharmacokinetic studies were performed on plasma collected from five patients. RESULTS: Eight (47%) of the 17 patients with AML had complete hematologic remissions (four after the initial course of 2-CDA), and two (12%) had partial remissions, for a total response rate of 59%. Only one child with ALL achieved remission. Seven of the responding patients underwent allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation, with six remaining free of leukemia for a median of 7 months (range, 1 to 11 months). The major form of drug-induced toxicity was hematologic, with severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (National Cancer Institute [NCI] grade 3 or 4) developing in 34 of the 36 courses of 2-CDA. In responding patients, the median times to recovery of neutrophil counts greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet counts greater than 50 x 10(9)/L were 18 and 21 days, respectively.

In both cases, the transformed cells remain dependent on chicken myelomonocytic growth factor (cMGF). This factor dependence can be relieved by expression of kinase-type oncogenes such as v-mil or v-erbB, leading to expression of cMGF and autocrine growth stimulation. In erythroid cells the same kinase-type oncogenes cause transformation but do not induce cMGF expression. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms of the observed lineage specific oncogene collaboration. We found that kinase-type oncogenes and TPA activate the cMGF promoter via AP-1 like transcription factors. The activation of the cMGF promoter is, however, strictly dependent on the binding of nuclear proteins to both halves of an inverted repeat adjacent to the AP-1 binding site. These proteins are related to C/EBP. They are expressed exclusively in myeloid cells and were therefore termed NF-M. Our results indicate that the lineage specific cooperation of kinase type oncogenes with v-myb or v-myc in leukemia formation is based on the concerted action of AP-1 and NF-M on the cMGF promoter.","['Sterneck, E', 'Muller, C', 'Katz, S', 'Leutz, A']","['Sterneck E', 'Muller C', 'Katz S', 'Leutz A']","['Zentrum fur Molekulare Biologie Heidelberg, University of Heidelberg, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MGF protein, chicken)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-erbB)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Proteins v-raf)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Avian Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Cytokines', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Substances/*genetics', '*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Oligonucleotides/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-erbB', 'Oncogene Proteins v-raf', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/pharmacology', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1992 Jan;11(1):115-26.,,,,PMC556432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine possible relationships between methylation patterns within the M-bcr and the stage of hematopoietic cell development, the M-bcr methylation status of 39 patients with leukemia and lymphoma and two patients with myelodysplastic syndrome with non-rearranged M-bcrs was examined by BgIII-HpaII digestion. In the myeloid malignancies, the presence of a hypermethylated 4.8 kb BgIII-BgIII M-bcr allele was directly proportional to the combined myeloblast and promyelocyte percentage of the specimen, whereas the presence of a 2.5 kb BgIII-HpaII allele was directly proportional to the combined percentage of monocytic cells and neutrophils. All five acute monoblastic leukemias showed a methylation pattern that closely resembled neutrophils. All of thirteen surface immunoglobulin positive B-cell malignancies showed a distinct methylation pattern consisting of three or more BgIII-HpaII restriction fragments of 2.5 kb or less in length. The B-cell precursor leukemias showed heterogeneous M-bcr methylation patterns, with four of seven showing a B-cell pattern and three showing a hypermethylated pattern with 4.8, 3.1/3.0 and/or 2.5 kb BgIII-HpaII M-bcr alleles. It is concluded that the M-bcr methylation status is related to the maturation of the neutrophil series; the surface immunoglobulin positive B-cell malignancies are characterized by a distinct, extreme hypomethylation pattern of the M-bcr; and the B-cell precursor malignancies appear to have a heterogeneous M-bcr methylation pattern.","['Litz, C E', 'McClure, J S', 'Coad, J E', 'Goldfarb, A N', 'Brunning, R D']","['Litz CE', 'McClure JS', 'Coad JE', 'Goldfarb AN', 'Brunning RD']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Alleles', 'Anemia, Refractory/*genetics/pathology', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Jan;6(1):35-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used one class of drug, the phenothiazines, to study the structural features required for optimum interference with the function of P-gp. The structure-activity relationships revealed three important components including the hydrophobicity of the tricyclic ring, the length of the alkyl bridge and the charge on the terminal amino group. Trans-flupenthixol is a lead compound that conforms to these structural requirements and demonstrates significant activity as a sensitizer of MDR cell lines to drugs affected by the MDR phenotype. Based on these data, we have proposed a model for the binding of modulators to P-gp and have speculated on the structure of the drug-binding domain. We have developed pre-clinical models of MDR that may help predict clinical activity of chemo-modulators. L1210/VMDRC.06 is a murine lymphocytic leukemia line transformed by a retroviral expression vector containing a full-length cDNA for the human mdr1 gene. K562/VBL1-3 are clones of human myeloid blast cells that were transformed with the same vector. Resistance in these lines is not complicated by changes in the cellular content of glutathione or alterations in topoisomerase II. The transformed L1210 line grows in mice as a slowly proliferating non-metastatic peritoneal implant. Both MDR lines are restored to sensitivity by cyclosporin A or trans-flupenthixol, and the K562 clones are induced to differentiate by hemin. These lines should provide simple, sensitive screens for new drugs for use against cancers expressing P-gp. We have proposed a model to explain how the pumping activity of P-gp is activated in response to toxic drugs. In this schema, basal activity of P-gp is modulated through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium sensitive phosphatases. In response to the activation of phospholipase C by toxic drugs and the local production of 1,2-diacylglycerol, PKC is translocated to the cell membrane where it phosphorylates P-gp. Following the extrusion of drug from the cell membrane, phospholipase C activity returns to baseline, diacylglycerol is metabolized, PKC returns to the cytosol and serine/threonine phosphatases dephosphorylate P-gp returning it to the basal state.","['Hait, W N', 'Aftab, D T']","['Hait WN', 'Aftab DT']","['Yale University School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Internal Medicine, New Haven, CT.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phenothiazines)', '0 (Thioxanthenes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenothiazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thioxanthenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/01/09 00:00,1992/01/09 00:01,['1992/01/09 00:00'],"['1992/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(92)90667-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(92)90667-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1992 Jan 9;43(1):103-7. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(92)90667-8.,"['CA 08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of A23187 to the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 in the presence of fetal calf serum led to rapid increases in mRNA concentration of up to 40-fold for HMG-CoA synthase and 15-fold for HMG-CoA reductase with little or no change in FPP synthetase mRNA levels. Treatment of HepG2 cells with A23187 resulted in approximately 2-4-fold increases in the mRNA levels for these three enzymes. The increases in HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase mRNAs were maximal after treatment of THP-1 cells with 10 micrograms/ml A23187 for 3 h. The stimulation was blocked by actinomycin D but not by cycloheximide treatment. Ionophore treatment had no effect on the half-lives of the mRNAs for HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase. Surprisingly, the addition of A23187 to THP-1 cells incubated in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonic acid also led to significant increases in the mRNA levels for HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase. Finally, the stimulation of these mRNA levels by A23187 was reduced in cells in which protein kinase C had been inactivated by preincubation of the cells with a phorbol ester. Taken together, these data suggest that A23187 treatment results in increased transcription of HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, and, in some cell types, FPP synthetase by a mechanism that does not involve de novo protein synthesis. We speculate that A23187 treatment results in the modification of a trans-acting factor(s) which is common for the transcription of all these genes.","['Wilkin, D J', 'Edwards, P A']","['Wilkin DJ', 'Edwards PA']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles 90024-1679.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sterols)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)', 'EC 2.3.3.10 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.10 (Geranyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['*Alkyl and Aryl Transferases', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Drug Antagonism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Geranyltranstransferase', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sterols/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",1992/02/05 00:00,1992/02/05 00:01,['1992/02/05 00:00'],"['1992/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)45954-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Feb 5;267(4):2831-6.,"['HL-30568/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'IT 32 HL-07412/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 865/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its ability to sensitise in vitro tumour cells whose resistance is due to P-glycoprotein-mediated anticancer-drug efflux was shown using four different pairs of parental drug-sensitive (Par-) and multidrug-resistant (MDR-) cell lines, from three different species (mouse, human, Chinese hamster) representing four different cell lineages (monocytic leukaemia, nasopharyngeal epithelial carcinoma, colon epithelial carcinoma, ovary fibroblastoid carcinoma), and using four different drug classes (colchicine, vincristine, daunomycin/doxorubicin and etoposide). By measuring its capacity to restore normal drug sensitivity of MDR-cells in culture in vitro, it appeared that SDZ 280-446 belongs to the same class of very potent chemosensitisers as the cyclosporin derivative SDZ PSC 833: both are about one order of magnitude more active than cyclosporin A (CsA), which is itself about one order of magnitude more active than other known chemosensitisers (including verapamil, quinidine and amiodarone which have already entered clinical trials in MDR reversal). Low concentrations of SDZ 280-446 could also restore cellular daunomycin retention in MDR-P388 cells to the levels found in the Par-P388 cells. SDZ 280-446 was also effective as a chemosensitiser when given orally in vivo. In a syngeneic mouse model, combined therapy with vinca alkaloids given i.p. and SDZ 280-446 given per os for 5 consecutive days significantly prolonged the survival of MDR-P388 tumour-bearing mice, when compared with mice receiving vinca alkaloids alone. Another protocol, using three cycles of i.p. doxorubicin at 4 day intervals, could also not increase MDR-P388 tumour-bearing mouse survival unless the mice received SDZ 280-446 orally 4 h before each doxorubicin injection. Though only very few combined therapy treatment protocols have been tested so far, clear increases in survival time of MDR-tumour-bearing mice were regularly obtained, leaving hope for major improvement of the therapy using other dosing schedules.","['Loor, F', 'Boesch, D', 'Gaveriaux, C', 'Jachez, B', 'Pourtier-Manzanedo, A', 'Emmer, G']","['Loor F', 'Boesch D', 'Gaveriaux C', 'Jachez B', 'Pourtier-Manzanedo A', 'Emmer G']","['Biotechnology Department, Sandoz Pharma Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1992.3 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1992 Jan;65(1):11-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1992.3.,,,,PMC1977342,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these hematologic malignancies, nine were classified as malignant histiocytosis or acute monoblastic leukemia, and all occurred in males. We now report on a patient who was phenotypically female, with 46XY gonadal dysgenesis, and who developed a true histiocytic malignancy that presented as a large hepatic tumor and also involved the spleen, right kidney, and lymph nodes. Twenty-six months before the development of the histiocytic malignancy, an ovarian malignant teratoma with yolk sac elements was removed; the patient subsequently received chemotherapy. The neoplasm was composed of large pleomorphic cells and the histiocytic nature was established by cytologic, cytochemical, immunologic, and ultrastructural studies. In the course of her illness, the patient developed classic acute monoblastic leukemia 8 months after the diagnosis of histiocytic malignancy. Karyotypic analysis of the hepatic tumor, bone marrow, and blood showed 46XY gonadal dysgenesis. We believe that this is the first reported case of a phenotypically female patient who developed these two rare malignancies. It suggests that the association between germ cell tumors and histiocytic malignancy in genotypically male individuals may not be coincidental or secondary to therapy, but may be a phenomenon related to dysgenetic gonads in the presence of a Y chromosome.","['Koo, C H', 'Reifel, J', 'Kogut, N', 'Cove, J K', 'Rappaport, H']","['Koo CH', 'Reifel J', 'Kogut N', 'Cove JK', 'Rappaport H']","['Department of Pathology, Kaiser Foundation Hospital, Los Angeles, CA 90027.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'CD11 Antigens', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics', 'Gonadal Dysgenesis, 46,XY/*complications/pathology', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/*complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Karyotyping', 'Liver/chemistry/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Muramidase/analysis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'S100 Proteins/analysis', 'Teratoma/*complications/genetics/pathology']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-199202000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1992 Feb;16(2):175-83. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199202000-00011.,['CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All B-cell precursor clones require recombinant interleukin-7 (rIL-7) and FLS4.1 stromal cells for continuous growth in culture, but pro-B lymphocyte clones can also proliferate in rIL-3. None proliferate in rIL-1, rIL-2, rIL-4, rIL-5, rIL-6, or leukemia inhibitory factor. FLS4.1 stromal cells synthesize mRNA for Steel factor but not for IL-1 to IL-7; all pro-B and pre-B clones express c-Kit, the receptor for Steel factor, and a c-Kit-specific antibody inhibits the enhanced proliferative response of fetal liver B-220+ B-cell precursors supported by FLS4.1 stromal cells and exogenous rIL-7 but does not affect that promoted by rIL-7 alone. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of the expression of the MB-1, lambda 5, Vpre-B, c mu, RAG-1, and RAG-2 genes in pro-B and pre-B clones show that transcription of the MB-1 gene precedes IgH gene rearrangement and RNA synthesis from c mu, RAG-1, RAG-2, lambda 5, and Vpre-B genes. All clones at the pre-B-cell stage synthesize mRNA for c mu, RAG-1, and RAG-2 genes; transcription of the lambda 5 and Vpre-B genes seems to start after D-to-JH rearrangement in B-cell precursors, indicating that the proteins encoded by either gene are not required for B-cell progenitors to undergo D-to-JH gene rearrangement. These findings mark transcription of the MB-1 gene as one of the earliest molecular events in commitment to develop along the B-lymphocyte pathway. Indeed, both pro-B and pre-B clones can generate in vitro and in vivo B lymphocytes but not T lymphocytes; moreover, these clones do not express the CD3-gamma T-cell-specific gene, nor do they have rearranged gamma, delta, or beta T-cell antigen receptor genes.","['Palacios, R', 'Samaridis, J']","['Palacios R', 'Samaridis J']","['Basel Institute for Immunology, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Genes, MHC Class I/genetics', 'Genes, MHC Class II/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, SCID', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.12.2.518-530.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Feb;12(2):518-30. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.2.518-530.1992.,,,,PMC364211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Green, W.A. Jefferies, M. Puklavec, and A.F. Williams. 1987. J. Exp. Med. 165:1). When we isolated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on the basis of their ability to activate the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway in RNK-16 cells (a rat leukemia line with natural killer activity), three of the resulting mAbs recognized the OX-44 molecule. Addition of these mAbs to RNK-16 elicits protein tyrosine phosphorylation, generates inositol phosphates, and increases the concentration of cytoplasmic free calcium. These responses require the addition of intact mAb and are not observed with F(ab')2 fragments. One of these mAbs (7D2) is mitogenic for freshly isolated rat splenic T cells and synergizes with a mAb to the T cell antigen receptor in this activation. A 50-60-kD glycoprotein coprecipitates with the OX-44 molecule from RNK-16 cells and rat splenic T cells. Peptide mapping and reprecipitation studies indicate that the coprecipitating molecule is CD2. Thus, the OX-44 molecule can couple to multiple signaling pathways and associates with CD2 on both RNK-16 and rat T cells.","['Bell, G M', 'Seaman, W E', 'Niemi, E C', 'Imboden, J B']","['Bell GM', 'Seaman WE', 'Niemi EC', 'Imboden JB']","['Arthritis/Immunology Section, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Cd53 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cd53 protein, rat)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Tetraspanin 25)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'CD2 Antigens', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tetraspanin 25']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.175.2.527 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1992 Feb 1;175(2):527-36. doi: 10.1084/jem.175.2.527.,"['AI-00999/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46812/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-52669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2119111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Vth MRC myelomatosis trial, the survival of 314 patients randomised to receive ABCM (adriamycin, BCNU, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan) as first-line treatment was significantly longer than that of 316 patients given intermittent melphalan (M7) (p = 0.0003).

Stable disease with few symptoms (plateau) was achieved by 61% of patients given ABCM and 49% of those given M7 (p = 0.004). Myelotoxicity was comparable between regimens. Cross-trial analysis suggests that M7 is comparable to melphalan and prednisone or melphalan, prednisone, and vincristine; that the efficacy of ABCM in the Vth trial and VIth MRC trials is comparable; and that ABCM gave better survival than intermittent melphalan regimens in the prognostic groups analysed.

We have studied a consecutive series of patients to see whether protective isolation is of benefit as prophylaxis against infectious complications of BMT. 50 consecutive patients who had malignant disease and received their first BMT from siblings or unrelated donors were nursed in standard single rooms with visitors instructed to wash their hands. A subset of 20 patients living locally spent a median of 25 days in hospital after BMT; they also spent some time at home on a median of 8 days before engraftment and 3 patients went home on more than 90% of their hospital days. 16 patients (32%) had positive bacterial cultures and/or focal infection. Gram-positive bacteraemia was found in 12 subjects (24%) but there were no gram-negative or deep fungal infections. Grade II or III acute GvHD developed in 17 patients (34%). There were no deaths from infection or acute GvHD. Transplant-related mortality was 6% in the first 100 days and 18% overall with a median follow-up of 22 months.

No increase in cell survival was observed in the LY-S cell line until the dose-rate was reduced to 2 cGy/min, whereas in the LY-A4 cell line 20 cGy/min was low enough to detect changes in survival. The extent of this change, as assessed by dose reduction factors at 2 logs of cell kill, was greater in the LY-A4 cell line. Fitting these data with the incomplete repair model of Thames led to anomalous values for the half-time of repair. In split-dose experiments the maximum observed recovery ratio increased as a function of dose in a manner that is consistent with the linear-quadratic equation.

Seven groups of 4 to 5 rabbits each were inoculated with lethally-irradiated HTLV-I-infected cell lines derived from patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma or from patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy. Four separate control groups of 2 rabbits each were inoculated with similarly prepared HTLV-I-negative cells derived from rabbits or humans. Anti-viral antibody responses were assessed by immunoblot assay and hematologic parameters were measured using automated cell counters and cytologic staining. The virologic status of challenged rabbits was determined by co-culture and HTLV-I antigen capture assay, as well as by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of HTLV-I DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or tissues. The HTLV-I inocula could be separated into groups based upon their infectivity to rabbits: highly infectious strains elicited intense serologic responses and were detected frequently in tissues by antigen and PCR assays, while other strains were moderately to poorly infectious, induced weak antibody responses and were infrequently detected by antigen and PCR assays. Overall, PBMC appeared to have the greatest quantity of HTLV-I containing cells, while bone marrow was a poor source of virus. No clinical or hematologic abnormalities were evident during the 24-week course of infection. Taken together, our results suggest there is heterogeneity in the biological response to HTLV-I infection which is, in part, dependent on the infecting strain of virus.","['Lairmore, M D', 'Roberts, B', 'Frank, D', 'Rovnak, J', 'Weiser, M G', 'Cockerell, G L']","['Lairmore MD', 'Roberts B', 'Frank D', 'Rovnak J', 'Weiser MG', 'Cockerell GL']","['Centers For Disease Control, Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, Atlanta, GA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*physiopathology', 'Genes, gag', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/biosynthesis', 'HTLV-I Antigens/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*microbiology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*microbiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rabbits']",1992/01/02 00:00,1992/01/02 00:01,['1992/01/02 00:00'],"['1992/01/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/02 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910500125 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1992 Jan 2;50(1):124-30. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910500125.,['R01CA40714-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preferential activation of Th2 cells during progression of retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency in mice.,182-8,"Progressive lymphoproliferation and increasingly severe immunodeficiency are prominent features of a syndrome, designated mouse AIDS, which develops in susceptible strains of mice infected with the mixture of murine leukemia viruses, termed LP-BM5. Development of splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, caused primarily by increases in B cell immunoblasts, requires the presence of CD4+ T cells and is assumed to be mediated by lymphokines produced by these cells inasmuch as progression of disease is markedly inhibited by treatment of infected mice with cyclosporin A. Studies of spleen cells from infected mice revealed spontaneous production of cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) characteristic of Th0 (or a mixture of Th1 and Th2) T helper cells at 1 wk after infection. At later times, IFN-gamma and IL-2, characteristic products of Th1 helper clones, were expressed poorly, either spontaneously or after stimulation of cells with Con A. In contrast, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10, cytokines typically synthesized by Th2 cells, were produced in response to Con A or spontaneously through 18 wk post-infection. Increased serum IgE levels and enhanced IL-10 mRNA expression were consistent with expression of Th2 cytokines at biologically significant levels in vivo. Selective depletion of T cell subsets before stimulation with Con A showed that CD4+ T cells were the primary source of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and, to a lesser extent, IFN-gamma in spleens and lymph nodes of normal or infected mice. These results suggest that persistent activation of CD4+ T cells with the lymphokine profile of Th2 helper clones is responsible for chronic B cell stimulation, down-regulation of Th1 cytokines, and impaired CD8+ T cell function in mouse AIDS. This provides the first demonstration that, like many parasitic infections, viruses encoding potent antigenic stimuli can markedly affect the balance of Th subset expression.","['Gazzinelli, R T', 'Makino, M', 'Chattopadhyay, S K', 'Snapper, C M', 'Sher, A', 'Hugin, A W', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Gazzinelli RT', 'Makino M', 'Chattopadhyay SK', 'Snapper CM', 'Sher A', 'Hugin AW', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-5/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Jan 1;148(1):182-8.,['N0-AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A similar clinical pattern was found in Japan and was named Human myelopathy (HAM). The virus was isolated from mononuclear cells either of the peripheral blood, and of the CSF. Molecular studies have shown that the ""neurotropic"" HTLV-I is similar to that associated to T cell leukemia. In vitro studies have shown that tumoral and fetal astroglial cells are susceptible to HTLV-I entry. Actually after 7 days, cells exposed to HTLV-I showed the virus core protein p19 together with an high expression of class II antigens and a disorganization of the GFAP.

These genes, termed viral oncogenes (v-onc), have subsequently been shown to be derived from highly conserved, normal cellular genes commonly referred to as proto-oncogenes (c-onc). Proto-oncogenes are thought to be intimately involved in the processes of cell proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, any c-onc amplification, mutation, structural alteration, or change in transcriptional regulation might lead to, or be associated with, induction of a malignant phenotype. Targeted disruption of these genes may therefore be of therapeutic value.

However, a major concern has been that infusion of occult tumor cells with the autologous marrow will contribute to relapse. Accordingly, multiple techniques for treating autologous marrow grafts in vitro, to remove or ""purge"" occult tumor, have been developed. Despite controversy regarding the necessity and efficacy of purging, most autologous transplants for acute leukemia and many for lymphoma are currently purged. Most studies have used immunologic or cytotoxic agents for purging. The most widely used cytotoxic purging agents have been the cyclophosphamide congeners, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) and mafosfamide. Since the first 4-HC-purged autologous marrow transplant was performed in 1980, over 700 patients have received 4-HC-purged autologous bone marrow transplants at Johns Hopkins alone.

BFM Study Group.,S50-4,"Twenty-five years ago over 90% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) died of this disease. Dramatic improvement has been achieved since then by employing risk-adapted, aggressive polychemotherapy protocols. More than 90% of children with ALL treated according to, for example BFM-protocols, have nowadays cure rates in the range of 70%-80%. However, 10% of patients do not initially respond adequately to standard induction chemotherapy. They are characterized by distinct chromosomal abnormalities such as translocation (9; 22) or combinations of early treatment failure and other risk factors as cytogenetic abnormalities, lineage-specific surface markers or tumour load at diagnosis. In this group of patients in first complete remission and certainly in the vast majority of relapsed patients, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has evolved as an alternative approach allowing further intensification of myeloablation and the introduction of an additional antileukaemic alloreactivity. Nevertheless, the decision for a marrow transplant in children has to be made very carefully because of a significant increase in treatment related mortality and BMT-specific risks like acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease with a critical iatrogenic chronic morbidity. This is even more evident, if mismatched or unrelated transplants are being considered. The indications for one or the other treatment modality according to the current BFM strategy are discussed.","['Ebell, W', 'Reiter, A', 'Riehm, H']","['Ebell W', 'Reiter A', 'Riehm H']","[""Department of Paediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02125803 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1992;151 Suppl 1:S50-4. doi: 10.1007/BF02125803.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cultivation was carried out at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2. Proliferation assay was conducted with a RPMI 1640 medium (control) and a serine-deprived medium for 3 days. The deprivation of serine reduced the proliferation of both cells, and the necessity of serine for the cell proliferation was thus recognized. The effects of the substance on the level and pattern of intracellular amino acids were observed. P388 cells exposed to serine-deprived medium for 3 h were then transferred to the control medium. The cellular amino acid levels were determined at the time of medium change and 1, 2, 3 h thereafter. Serine-deprivation improved intracellular amino acids in comparison with those from control, and the medium change to control reduced their levels. Therefore, extracellular serine appeared to regulate the efflux of amino acids from cells.

Removal from plasma of the lipid label was higher in the leukemic group compared to healthy subjects in terms of fractional clearance rate (0.185 +/- 0.205 and 0.080 +/- 0.030 h-1, respectively, P < 0.03). When the emulsion was again injected into 10 of the AML patients after complete hematological remission, the fractional clearance rate of cholesteryl ester was reduced to one third of the value observed prior to treatment (0.061 +/- 0.038 h-1) and was not different from that obtained for the healthy subjects. Also, in untreated AML patients, serum LDL-cholesterol levels inversely correlated with the values of fractional clearance rate of the microemulsion. This correlation was no longer observed after treatment. These data suggest that the LDL-like microemulsion was selectively taken up by the neoplastic cells presumably by interaction with LDL receptors. Therefore, microemulsions may function as potential carriers for anticancer drugs that are targeted to tumor cells for patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Unlike native LDL, microemulsions are suitable for utilization in routine clinical practice.","['Maranhao, R C', 'Garicochea, B', 'Silva, E L', 'Llacer, P D', 'Pileggi, F J', 'Chamone, D A']","['Maranhao RC', 'Garicochea B', 'Silva EL', 'Llacer PD', 'Pileggi FJ', 'Chamone DA']","['Instituto do Coracao, Hospital das Clinicas, Sao Paulo, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Fat Emulsions, Intravenous)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Triglycerides)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cholesterol Esters', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Fat Emulsions, Intravenous/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy', 'Lipids/*blood', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*blood/drug effects', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Triglycerides/blood']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 1992;25(10):1003-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endogenous gamma-interferon is a 166-amino-acid protein encoded by a single gene on chromosome 12. Recombinant human interferon gamma is purified from Escherichia coli as a monomer containing 139 amino acids. Gamma-interferon has antiviral, immunomodulatory, and antiproliferative activity. Serum concentrations of recombinant interferon gamma increase in proportion to the dose. Clearance after i.m. or s.c. administration fits a two-compartment model. The half-life is 3.5-7.5 hours, and bioavailability is 89%. Evidence that recombinant interferon gamma can enhance phagocytic oxidative metabolism led to its evaluation for use in the treatment of CGD. Clinical studies showed that the agent decreases the frequency of serious infections in patients with CGD. Recombinant interferon gamma has shown only limited success in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), both as a single agent and in combination with recombinant interferon alfa. Similarly, although interferons appear to be able to change cytogenetic abnormalities in some patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, therapy with recombinant interferon gamma has led to minimal success. However, the agent has produced some encouraging results in atopic dermatitis. The adverse effects of recombinant interferon gamma in patients with CGD usually consist only of fever, chills, headache, and erythema. The recommended dosage in CGD-afflicted children whose body surface area is greater than 0.5 sq m is 50 micrograms/sq m given by s.c. injection three times a week for life. Recombinant interferon gamma has given new hope to patients with CGD.

A marked heterogeneity with respect to sensitivity was observed for a panel of cytotoxic drugs tested in 76 samples from 60 patients with treated or untreated AML. Primary resistance to vincristine (Vcr) and prednisolone in untreated AML was observed as well as 'acquired' resistance to several other antileukemic drugs. Cross resistance patterns for AML active drugs revealed significant positive relationships between anthracyclines, VP16 and amsacrine (Amsa), whereas mitoxantrone (Mitox) was more weakly correlated. Sensitivity to cytosine arabinoside was unrelated to the anthracyclines, VP16, Amsa and Mitox but showed a significant relationship to 6-thioguanine. Several resistance modifying agents, including the novel non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin A analogue PSC 833, were able to potentiate the effects of doxorubicin and Vcr at concentrations achievable in the clinic. However, the pattern of activity was heterogenous and the frequency of responsive samples was higher in relapse compared to de novo cases. Individual in vitro/in vivo correlations based on quartile distributions of all accumulated drug sensitivity data from AML patients indicated a high specificity with respect to the identification of drug resistance. The results suggest that the FMCA may provide clinically valuable information on chemotherapeutic drug resistance in AML.","['Kristensen, J', 'Jonsson, B', 'Sundstrom, C', 'Nygren, P', 'Larsson, R']","['Kristensen J', 'Jonsson B', 'Sundstrom C', 'Nygren P', 'Larsson R']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, Uppsala, University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Fluorometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02989656 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1992;9(2):65-74. doi: 10.1007/BF02989656.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother 1992;9(3):157'],,,,,

In a previous study, we confirmed the profound neutrophil chemotactic deficiency induced by Interleukin-2 therapy. Peripheral blood cells exposed to Interleukin-2 in vitro secrete secondary cytokines. The release of tumor necrosis factor into the circulation after Interleukin-2 injection has been proposed as an important mechanism underlying cell function alterations. We tested chemotaxis of neutrophils from normal subjects after incubation with the serum from treated patients. Serums induced a defective chemotaxis of normal neutrophils similar to the one observed with neutrophils from Interleukin-2 treated patients. We have previously demonstrated a dose-dependent reversion of neutrophil chemotaxis after incubation with anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha antibody. Pentoxifylline is known for counteracting the inflammatory action of tumor necrosis factor.

In many cases, these factors display a much broader spectrum of activities, especially when their effect is tested on various cell or tissue types. Consequently, names of certain factors are quite deceptive. A textbook example is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF was initially described based on its ability to induce differentiation in the murine myeloid leukemia cell line M1. Later, LIF turned out to be a synonym for at least nine different factors defined on the basis of their effects on a variety of cell types including lymphomas, liver cells, embryonic stem cells and carcinoma cells, neurons, melanomas and osteoclasts. Apart from its differential effect on unrelated cell types and tissues. LIF induces biphasic effects on cells of the same ""lineage"" as well. Needless to say, LIF activity in these circumstances largely depends on the developmental stage of the target cells. An example is LIF activity on bone cells. Osteoclast as well as osteoblast activity is stimulated or suppressed by LIF depending on the developmental stage of the respective cells. This concept is of utmost importance in the evaluation of the seemingly opposing or contradictory effects of LIF in vitro as well as in vivo.","['Van Vlasselaer, P']",['Van Vlasselaer P'],"['Vlaamse Instelling voor Technologisch Onderzoek V.I.T.O.

Isoproterenol and platelet activating factor can induce kinase translocation.,6886-92,"Receptor phosphorylation is a key step in the process of desensitization of the beta-adrenergic and other related receptors. A selective kinase (called beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, beta ARK) has been identified which phosphorylates the agonist-occupied form of the receptor. Recently the bovine beta ARK cDNA has been cloned and the highest levels of specific mRNA were found in highly innervated tissues. It was proposed that beta ARK may be primarily active on synaptic receptors. In the present study, the cDNA of human beta ARK was cloned and sequenced. The sequence was very similar to that of the bovine beta ARK (the overall amino acid homology was 98%). Very high levels of beta ARK mRNA and kinase activity were found in peripheral blood leukocytes and in several myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cell lines. Since agonist-induced beta ARK translocation is considered the first step involved in beta ARK-mediated homologous desensitization, we screened a number of G-protein-coupled receptor agonists for their ability to induce beta ARK translocation. In human mononuclear leukocytes, beta-AR agonist isoproterenol and platelet-activating factor were able to induce translocation of beta ARK from cytosol to membrane. After 20 min of exposure to isoproterenol (10 microM), the cytosolic beta ARK activity decreased to 61% of control, while membrane-associated beta ARK activity increased to 170%. 20-min exposure to platelet-activating factor (1 microM) reduced the cytosolic beta ARK activity to 42% of control with concomitant increase in membrane beta ARK activity to 214% of control. The high levels of beta ARK expression in human peripheral blood leukocytes together with the ability of isoproterenol and platelet-activating factor to induce beta ARK translocation, suggest a role for beta ARK in modulating some receptor-mediated immune functions.","['Chuang, T T', 'Sallese, M', 'Ambrosini, G', 'Parruti, G', 'De Blasi, A']","['Chuang TT', 'Sallese M', 'Ambrosini G', 'Parruti G', 'De Blasi A']","['Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Santa Maria Imbaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (GRK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (beta-Adrenergic Receptor Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', '*Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'DNA/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2', 'Humans', 'Isoproterenol/*pharmacology', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rod Cell Outer Segment/enzymology', 'beta-Adrenergic Receptor Kinases']",1992/04/05 00:00,1992/04/05 00:01,['1992/04/05 00:00'],"['1992/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)50511-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Apr 5;267(10):6886-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/L01675', 'GENBANK/L01676', 'GENBANK/L01677', 'GENBANK/M80776', 'GENBANK/M81836', 'GENBANK/M83679', 'GENBANK/M83680', 'GENBANK/M83681', 'GENBANK/M83724', 'GENBANK/M96793']",,,,,,

This factor contributes to inducible transcription of the c-jun gene in human myeloid leukemia cells. NF-jun was, however, undetectable in nuclear proteins from human monocytes, granulocytes, resting T lymphocytes and lung fibroblasts. NF-jun shares several features with the well characterized NF-kappa B in that binding activity can be generated in cytosolic extracts by treatment with dissociating agents. In addition, binding of NF-jun to its recognition site is enhanced by treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, tumor necrosis factor alpha or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). However, as revealed by competition assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, purified NF-kappa B fails to bind to the c-jun fragment which contains the NF-jun site, and this fragment fails to compete with NF-kappa B for binding. UV crosslinking showed that NF-jun contains a 55 and a 125 kDa protein species. These findings demonstrate that the c-jun gene can be regulated by a transcription factor distinct from AP-1. Our findings also indicate that while NF-jun has several features in common with the NF-kappa B binding protein including its subcellular localization and its ability to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, this factor recognizes a unique DNA sequence. Moreover, the activity of this protein is differentially regulated in various cell types. NF-jun might function as a signal transducing molecule in order to mediate rapid induction of the early response gene c-jun in a cell type- and stimulus-specific manner.","['Brach, M A', 'Herrmann, F', 'Yamada, H', 'Bauerle, P A', 'Kufe, D W']","['Brach MA', 'Herrmann F', 'Yamada H', 'Bauerle PA', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (nuclear factor-jun)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', '*Genes, jun', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'NF-kappa B/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1992 Apr;11(4):1479-86.,"['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['c-jun'],PMC556596,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S38423', 'GENBANK/X63633', 'GENBANK/X63634', 'GENBANK/X63635', 'GENBANK/X63636', 'GENBANK/X63637', 'GENBANK/X63638', 'GENBANK/X63639', 'GENBANK/X63640', 'GENBANK/X63729']",,,,,,

As deduced from their cDNA sequences, defensins are initially synthesized as 94 amino acid (aa) precursors that must undergo extensive processing. We performed metabolic labeling studies of defensin synthesis in the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 and in chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and showed that preprodefensins are processed to mature 29 to 30 aa defensins over 4 to 24 hours via two major intermediates: a 75 aa prodefensin generated by the cleavage of the signal sequence, and a 56 aa prodefensin that results from a subsequent preaspartate proteolytic cleavage. Almost all of the 75 aa form was found in the cytoplasmic/microsomal fraction, whereas the 56 aa prodefensin and mature defensins predominated in the granule-enriched fraction. The 75 aa prodefensin was also selectively released into the culture supernatant. Treatment of HL-60 cells with monensin, chloroquine, or ammonium chloride, substances that neutralize acidic subcellular compartments, partially blocked conversion of the 75 aa prodefensin into 56 aa prodefensin, but did not increase the extracellular release of the 75 aa form. Further studies will be required to determine the role of this processing pathway in subcellular targeting to azurophil granules and avoidance of autocytotoxicity.","['Valore, E V', 'Ganz, T']","['Valore EV', 'Ganz T']","['Will Rogers Institute Pulmonary Research Laboratory, University of California, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Defensins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Defensins', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/analysis', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73714-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Mar 15;79(6):1538-44.,"['1S10RR05554/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-22839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-35640/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/L12690', 'GENBANK/L12691', 'GENBANK/M80678', 'GENBANK/M80679', 'GENBANK/M91429', 'GENBANK/M91430', 'GENBANK/M93301', 'GENBANK/X64637', 'GENBANK/X64638', 'GENBANK/X64639']",,,,,,

They have since been recognized to occur in other myeloid malignancies such as therapy-related leukaemia and de novo AML as well. The variability of the deletions, and the heterogeneity of the clinical syndromes, have made it difficult to describe a single clinical-molecular entity such as we see with chromosomal translocations described elsewhere in this volume. Translocations in leukaemogenesis often have a dominant effect leading to activation of oncogenes or the production of a modified protein. Consistently occurring chromosomal deletions in human tumours, however, have been regarded as evidence that the affected regions contain tumour suppressor genes. Loss of function of these tumour suppressor genes or 'recessive oncogenes' leads to cancer. Deletions in the long arm of chromosome 5 in myeloid malignancies are thought to signal the existence of a recessive oncogene on 5q, which is homozygously inactivated in these malignancies. Here we describe the clinical and molecular features of the diseases associated with deletions of chromosome 5 in an attempt to propose a unified approach to identifying the genes on 5q which are involved in leukaemogenesis. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity of these disorders will not be understood until the relevant genes are cloned and their role in the initiation or progression of leukaemia is known.","['Westbrook, C A', 'Keinanen, M J']","['Westbrook CA', 'Keinanen MJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Growth Substances/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80052-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1992 Oct;5(4):931-42. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80052-1.,,,"['ALG', 'APC', 'CD14', 'CSF1R', 'CSF2', 'DCC', 'EGR1', 'FMS', 'MCC', 'RB1', 'VMA', 'v-fms']",,,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,

An early and accurate diagnosis is necessary to initiate therapy and treat the life-threatening coagulopathy caused by release of procoagulants from the abundant promyelocytic granules. Cytogenetically the disease is characterized by a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17)(q21;q22), which is seen in almost every patient with APL but in no other form of malignancy. The presence of this translocation, often as the only karyotypic change, suggests that potentially leukaemogenic sequences are located at the breakpoints and are activated by rearrangement. The recent cloning of the breakpoints by three groups has demonstrated that the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene (RARA) on chromosome 17 is fused to a previously undescribed transcription factor gene, PML, on chromosome 15. The DNA-binding motifs of both the RARA and PML proteins, together with the ligand-binding domain of RARA, are combined in a single fusion protein which may dysregulate either retinoic acid or PML-sensitive pathways. Identification of these dysregulated target genes has become the next molecular goal for research on APL. Intriguingly, some APLs not only express the PML-RARA fusion protein but also the reciprocal RARA-PML fusion protein, although the contribution of this product is unclear. The PML-RARA chimaeric protein is presumably the target during the striking differentiation therapy achieved with all-trans retinoic acid. This therapy induces the malignant promyelocytes to mature and die, rather than continue proliferating. Moreover, it represents the first direct connection between a genetic defect and clinical treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Borrow, J', 'Solomon, E']","['Borrow J', 'Solomon E']","['Somatic Cell Genetics Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*ultrastructure', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80048-x [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1992 Oct;5(4):833-56. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80048-x.,,,"['ABL', 'BCR', 'BMI1', 'CRABP', 'ERBA1', 'ERBB2', 'G-CSF', 'GAL4', 'MEL18', 'MPO', 'MYL', 'MZF1', 'PML', 'RAG1', 'RARA', 'RET', 'RFP', 'RPT1', 'XNF7', 'myc', 'v-ERBA']",,,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 4 months of LP-BM5 MuLV infection, there was a significant decrease in the absolute numbers of Thy1+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in PP with a concomitant decrease in the percentage and in the absolute numbers of surface IgA+--(sIgA+) and surface IgM+--bearing (sIgM+) cells. Infection also produced an enlarged MLN with a six-fold increase in cell numbers and a decrease in the relative percentage of sIgA+, cytoplasmic IgA+, and cytoplasmic IgM+ cells. However, murine retrovirus infection caused no significant changes in the percentages of Thyl+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD5+ cells in the MLN. After 4 months of murine retrovirus infection cIgA+ cells from MLN were not able to populate the intestinal lamina propria as the number of IgA plasma cells was significantly decreased. Moreover, there was a concomitant decrease in the number of CD4+ cells per field in the ILP. These results suggest that murine retrovirus infection favors the expansion of IgA B cell precursors at the level of MLN, while simultaneously interfering with the terminal differentiation step and thus preventing IgA plasma cell precursors from seeding the ILP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lopez, M C', 'Colombo, L L', 'Huang, D S', 'Watson, R R']","['Lopez MC', 'Colombo LL', 'Huang DS', 'Watson RR']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, Arizona Health Sciences Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Reg Immunol,Regional immunology,9001013,['0 (Immunoglobulin A)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunoglobulin A/metabolism', 'Intestine, Small/immunology/pathology', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/pathology', ""Peyer's Patches/immunology/pathology"", 'Plasma Cells/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/pathology']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Reg Immunol. 1992 May-Jun;4(3):162-7.,"['AA08037/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA04827/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were obtained that were 1,000-fold resistant to CPT, compared to wild-type P388 cells. Neither topoisomerase I mRNA nor 100 kDa topoisomerase I enzyme was detectable in these cells, and topoisomerase I activity extracted from nuclei was less than 4% of that extracted from nuclei of wild-type cells. An immunoreactive 130 kDa protein that could be an altered, inactive form of topoisomerase I was evident in the hyper-resistant cells. In addition, the cells deficient in topoisomerase I contained enhanced topoisomerase II activity. Maintenance of the hyper-resistant phenotype required continued exposure to CPT; growth in its absence led to loss of hyper-resistance, increased topoisomerase I content and activity, and decreased topoisomerase II activity. The sensitivity of the cells to killing by a number of inhibitors of topoisomerases I and II was consistent with these observations. Thus, P388 cells have the potential to become highly resistant to CPT by severely curtailing topoisomerase I expression; in these circumstances, topoisomerase I and II activities are regulated coordinately.","['Woessner, R D', 'Eng, W K', 'Hofmann, G A', 'Rieman, D J', 'McCabe, F L', 'Hertzberg, R P', 'Mattern, M R', 'Tan, K B', 'Johnson, R K']","['Woessner RD', 'Eng WK', 'Hofmann GA', 'Rieman DJ', 'McCabe FL', 'Hertzberg RP', 'Mattern MR', 'Tan KB', 'Johnson RK']","['Research & Development, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA 19406.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macrophages/*enzymology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1992;4(11-12):481-8.,['CA-40884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P388 showed a low total number of high affinity 125I-pindolol binding sites (340 +/- 33/cell, Kd 108 pM) when compared with normal splenocytes (1221 +/- 67 sites/cell, Kd 97 pM). The number of beta-adrenergic receptors was even lower in P388/DXR cells (230 +/- 41 sites/cell, Kd 101 pM). In addition, these receptors were subnormally expressed on the cell surface: only 26% and 52% of the total receptors were surface receptors in P388 and P388/DXR, respectively, whereas it was 87% in normal splenocytes. Isoproterenol slightly (less than 1-fold) stimulated cAMP accumulation in P388 and P388/DXR; the stimulation observed in splenocytes was 2.5-fold. In addition, the basal levels of cAMP appeared to be low (0.48 +/- 0.05 pmoles/10(6) cells in P388 and 0.71 +/- 0.08 pmoles/10(6) cells in P388/DXR; 3.47 +/- 0.28 pmoles/10(6) cells in splenocytes) in the two leukemias and they were only slightly (less than 2-fold) increased by forskolin, which otherwise stimulated about 15-fold cAMP accumulation in splenocytes; thus, P388 and P388/DXR were probably also defective in their adenylate cyclase activity. It can be concluded that, owing to multifactorial mechanisms, the lymphocytic leukemia P388, also as an MDR variant, is minimally sensitive to the direct influences of the beta-adrenergic system, probably including any effect of this system on drug-sensitivity.","[""D'Amico, C"", 'Crescimanno, M', 'Armata, M G', 'Leonardi, V', 'Palazzoadriano, M', ""D'Alessandro, N""]","[""D'Amico C"", 'Crescimanno M', 'Armata MG', 'Leonardi V', 'Palazzoadriano M', ""D'Alessandro N""]","['Instituto di Farmacologia, Policlinico P.

Many studies have shown that the megakaryocytic leukemic events may occur at a pluripotent stem cell level and clinical observations reveal that the megakaryocytic leukemias are diverse entities. The immunophenotyping using monoclonal antibodies against platelet specific surface antigens and the ultrastructural detection of platelet peroxidase reaction do not provide sufficiently useful information to determine whether a megakaryocytic leukemia is chronic, acute, therapy-responsive or therapy-unresponsive. More sophisticated techniques are required to further characterize megakaryocytic leukemic cells. In this review, we emphasize that megakaryocytic leukemic cells can be categorized into two groups; one with the PF4 mRNA, and the other without it, and that the expression of PF4 mRNA in the blasts could be a useful marker for the identification of mature megakaryoblasts. It seems that the patients with blasts expressing PF4 mRNA will have a longer survival and a better response to chemotherapy than those without PF4. We further discuss the fact that the detection of mRNAs of the IL-6 receptor, PDGF A- and B-chains, and TGF beta 1 in megakaryocytic leukemic cells will be useful to clarify the mechanisms involved in the proliferation of megakaryocytic leukemic cells and fibroblasts in the bone marrow. Furthermore, we reviewed data showing that megakaryocytic erythroid, and mast cell lineages share the nuclear transcription factor known as GF-1 (NF-E1 or Erf-1). We suggest that characterization of megakaryocytic leukemia should be performed using monoclonal antibodies against erythroid, megakaryocytic and mast cell lineages.","['Ryo, R', 'Yasunaga, M', 'Saigo, K', 'Yamaguchi, N']","['Ryo R', 'Yasunaga M', 'Saigo K', 'Yamaguchi N']","['Blood Transfusion Service, Kobe University Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Growth Substances/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/epidemiology/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Platelet Factor 4/*biosynthesis', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Prevalence', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199209051011 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Nov;8(4-5):327-36. doi: 10.3109/10428199209051011.,,,,,,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, using molecular biology techniques, a number of laboratories have demonstrated that the gene coding for the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA), normally located on chromosome 17, is disrupted by the t(15;17) and fused with the PML gene on chromosome 15. The chromosome 17 breaks were mapped consistently within the second intron of the RARA gene while the chromosome 15 breaks were clustered in two limited regions within the PML gene. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the PML gene demonstrated a complex splicing pattern and this gene may encode a transcription factor. Different isoforms of the PML-RARA fusion transcripts were discovered which are produced as a result of distinct PML gene rearrangements. Sequence analysis of the reciprocal products of the translocation t(15;17) in some APL cases suggested the implication of topoisomerase II in mediating the DNA recombination. The RT/PCR procedure has been established to characterize the expression patterns of the PML-RARA fusion gene and to detect minimal residual disease (MRD).

METHODS: 98 patients undergoing allogeneic BMT for hematologic malignancies (n = 91) or aplastic anemia (n = 7) were monitored weekly for the expression of the lower matrix protein pp65 of cytomegalovirus (CMV) on peripheral blood cells (PB) and urine sediments (U) as detected by C10 and C11 monoclonal antibodies (Clonab, Biotest) and immunoperoxidase. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytospin preparations were also studied in patients with clinically documented interstitial pneumonia. Patients were considered to be infected with CMV if pp65 was detected in PB (n = 15) or BAL cells (n = 6), or in the presence of serum CMV-IgM with (n = 7) or without (n = 3) pp65-positive cells in urine sediments. RESULTS: The overall actuarial risk at 300 days of developing a CMV infection was 35%. CMV serum/status (IgG) pre-BMT of donor and/or recipient predicted the occurrence of CMV infections post-BMT: in neg/neg donor/recipient pairs (n = 17) the actuarial risk at 300 days was 0%, compared to 41% in pairs in which donor and/or recipient were CMV seropositive (n = 81) (p = 0.001). 24/31 patients were treated with ganciclovir (DHPG), and 17 survive. Mortality of patients treated early with DHPG on the basis of CMV antigenemia was 18% compared to 42% for untreated patients (p = 0.9). Pretransplant donor/recipient seropositivity accurately predicted transplant related mortality (TBM): 6% in neg/neg pairs vs 41% in all other combinations (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of developing CMV infections post-BMT can be predicted by pre-transplant serostatus, diagnosed by monitoring the expression of pp65-protein and correlates with transplant related mortality. The latter appears to be reduced by early treatment with DHPG.","['Bacigalupo, A', 'Tedone, E', 'Sanna, M A', 'Moro, F', 'Van Lint, M T', 'Grazi, G', 'Balestreri, M', 'Frassoni, F', 'Occhini, D', 'Gualandi, F']","['Bacigalupo A', 'Tedone E', 'Sanna MA', 'Moro F', 'Van Lint MT', 'Grazi G', 'Balestreri M', 'Frassoni F', 'Occhini D', 'Gualandi F', 'et al.']","['II Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/surgery', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/drug therapy/mortality/*transmission', 'Female', 'Ganciclovir/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/blood/immunology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1992 Nov-Dec;77(6):507-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These responses were roughly inversely correlated to the growth of BLV in the peripheral blood leukocytes.

Using this model we investigated the action mechanisms of IL-1 and IL-6. IL-6, but not IL-1, stimulated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. The differentiative effect of IL-6 however, was not suppressed by indomethacin, although PGE2 induction by IL-6 was completely inhibited. Exogenously added PGE2 neither augmented the differentiative effect of IL-6 nor induced differentiation in combination with IL-1. Therefore, stimulation of PGE2 production did not appear to be essential for differentiative effects of these cytokines. Dibutyryl cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP and two adenylate cyclase-activating reagents, cholera toxin (CT) and forskolin (FK), all exhibited the similar augmenting effects as IL-1. These reagents augmented M1 cell differentiation by IL-6, and they did not induce differentiation in combination with IL-1. cAMP derivatives, CT, FK, IL-1 and IL-6 all inhibited the proliferation of M1 cells. CT and FK increased the intracellular cAMP levels. However, neither IL-1 nor IL-6 increased the cAMP levels. In contrast to the cAMP derivatives and reagents that activate adenylate cyclase activity, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and calcium ionophore neither induced nor augmented the differentiation in combination with either IL-1 or IL-6. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was not altered by IL-1 or IL-6 suggesting that Ca2+/Calmodulin kinase and protein kinase C activation are not involved in this signal transduction pathway. Therefore, the present study suggests that IL-1 exhibits an effect similar to that of cAMP without affecting intracellular cAMP level.","['Onozaki, K', 'Kato, K', 'Inui, S', 'Takuwa, Y', 'Akiyama, Y']","['Onozaki K', 'Kato K', 'Inui S', 'Takuwa Y', 'Akiyama Y']","['From the Department of Hygienic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Pharmacobiodyn,Journal of pharmacobio-dynamics,7901854,"['0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/*pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/biosynthesis', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb1978.15.491 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharmacobiodyn. 1992 Sep;15(9):491-500. doi: 10.1248/bpb1978.15.491.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the fact that TNF alpha was neutralized quantitatively by antibodies to human TNF alpha in feline monocyte supernatants and in feline sera, it was concluded that feline TNF alpha immunologically cross-reacts with human TNF alpha and that the human TNF alpha ELISA can be used to quantitate feline TNF alpha. During the first 6 months after experimental feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection no differences in serum TNF alpha values were observed between infected and non-infected cats. TNF alpha levels increased significantly after primary vaccination with a feline leukemia virus (FeLV) vaccine in FIV infected cats over those in the non-infected controls. During secondary immune response TNF alpha levels rose transiently for a period of a few days in both the FIV positive and the FIV negative cats. After FeLV challenge, TNF alpha levels increased in all animals challenged with virulent FeLV for a period of 3 weeks. This period corresponded to the time necessary to develop persistent FeLV viremia in the control cats. It was concluded from these experiments that in the asymptomatic phase of FIV infection no increased levels of TNF alpha are present, similar to the situation in asymptomatic HIV infected humans.

One long term FIV infected cat with lymphosarcoma was also positive for FIV RNA in bone marrow cells. The other four long term FIV infected cats were relatively healthy, with normal bone marrow morphology, and were negative for FIV infected cells. Bone marrow from three non-infected and two cats infected with FeLV alone were also negative for FIV RNA by in situ hybridization. We concluded that megakaryocytes and mononuclear cells were targets of the viral infection and that the presence of FIV RNA in cells of the bone marrow correlated with marrow hypercellularity and immaturity, and severity of illness.","['Beebe, A M', 'Gluckstern, T G', 'George, J', 'Pedersen, N C', 'Dandekar, S']","['Beebe AM', 'Gluckstern TG', 'George J', 'Pedersen NC', 'Dandekar S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*microbiology', 'Cats', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Feline/microbiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/microbiology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*microbiology', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(92)90119-B [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(92)90119-b [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1992 Dec;35(1-2):37-49. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(92)90119-b.,['AI30377/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The serum tested negative for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) p27 antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) but was strongly positive for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies by ELISA and Western blot. When her only offspring and mate were tested for FIV, high antibody titers to FIV were also found in their serum. Lymphocytes were prepared from these two lions on different occasions and co-cultivated with specific pathogen free (SPF) cat lymphocytes in the presence of concanavalin A and recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 6 weeks. The cell culture supernatants tested negative for Mg(2+)-dependent reverse transcriptase and FIV p24 by a double antibody sandwich ELISA throughout the culture period. Whole blood and buffy coat cells collected from these two lions were transmitted by intraperitoneal injection into two SPF cats. The two cats did not seroconvert for a period of 11 months nor could reverse transcriptase activity and FIV p24 antigen be demonstrated in the supernatant of several lymphocyte cultures. To determine the importance of lentivirus infections in zoo-kept wild felids, 124 serum samples were obtained from African lions, Indian and Siberian tigers, snow leopards, panthers, cheetahs and other wild cats from nine European zoos. In addition, serum samples collected from 12 Asiatic lions originating from Gir forest in the Indian State of Gujarat were included in this study. The sera were tested for antibodies to FIV, FeLV and feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV) by ELISA and Western blot using the respective viruses after gradient purification. In addition, some of the sera were also tested for antibodies to equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and Visna-Maedi virus (VMV). Antibodies to FIV were found in 30/53 (57%) of African lions, one of 18 tigers and one of four panthers. All other sera including those collected from the 12 Asiatic lions were negative for FIV antibodies. Some of the FIV positive lion sera had high antibody titers producing strong bands on Western blot strips even in dilutions of >> 1:1000. The Western blot pattern of the lion sera differed from that of domestic cats in that primarily p24 and to a lesser degree p17 was recognized. Antibodies to FeSFV were found in 14 animals (seven with strong, seven with intermediate, reaction). No correlation was found between FIV and FeSFV infection. Antibodies to FeLV were found in two cheetahs which later turned out to have been vaccinated with Leukocell, a FeLV vaccine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Lutz, H', 'Isenbugel, E', 'Lehmann, R', 'Sabapara, R H', 'Wolfensberger, C']","['Lutz H', 'Isenbugel E', 'Lehmann R', 'Sabapara RH', 'Wolfensberger C']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Zoo/*microbiology', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carnivora/*microbiology', 'Cats', 'Cross Reactions', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/growth & development/immunology', 'Lentivirus/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Lentivirus Infections/epidemiology/immunology/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Lions/*microbiology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2427(92)90133-B [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(92)90133-b [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1992 Dec;35(1-2):215-24. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(92)90133-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of the cytotoxic activity of MC540 is not yet fully understood, and the subcellular targets of MC540-mediated photodynamic damage remain to be identified. The human neutrophil provides an attractive model with which to study the effects of photoactivated MC540 on several well-defined cellular functions. As we report in this paper, simultaneous exposure of neutrophils to MC540 and light inhibited phagocytosis, random migration, chemotaxis, hydrogen peroxide production, and oxygen consumption. By contrast, the ability of neutrophils to kill engulfed bacteria and to produce superoxide radical was not compromised. Intracellular ATP levels and the activities of the cytosolic enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and myeloperoxidase were only slightly reduced. Even in HL-60 leukemia cells, which bind more dye and are more readily killed by MC540-mediated photodynamic therapy than neutrophils, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and myeloperoxidase activities remained at normal or near-normal levels. These results are compatible with the view that plasma membrane components are primary targets of MC540-mediated photodynamic damage.","['Smith, O M', 'Traul, D L', 'Sieber, F']","['Smith OM', 'Traul DL', 'Sieber F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', '*Light', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/physiology', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Dec;20(11):1278-84.,"['CA 42734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Productively infected fibroblast cell lines, fresh acute virus-infected spleen cells, and virus-infected CFU-E were sensitive, whereas uninfected CFU-E were resistant to TNF cytotoxicity in vitro. When FVA-infected erythroblasts were depleted from the spleen cell population in vitro with antivirus antibodies, TNF suppression of the remaining (uninfected) cells was abrogated. In contrast, both normal and virus-infected macrophage progenitor cells and immature erythroid progenitor cells were equally sensitive to TNF cytotoxicity in vitro. Normal erythroblasts had significantly fewer TNF receptors than FVA-infected erythroblasts, which also were morphologically less mature.

These structure-activity relationships indicate that both the C-25-OH and C-1 alpha-OH groups in the 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 molecule are essential for expressing thromboxane synthesis in HL-60 cells. Also, the rank order for stimulating thromboxane synthesis correlated well with the binding affinity of these dialkyl analogues for the 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 receptor of HL-60 cells, suggesting a 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 receptor-mediated induction mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Honda, A', 'Mori, Y', 'Ikekawa, N', 'Raz, A']","['Honda A', 'Mori Y', 'Ikekawa N', 'Raz A']","['Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo College of Pharmacy, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '54397-85-2 (Thromboxane B2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 5.3.99.5 (Thromboxane-A Synthase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Calcitriol', 'Receptors, Steroid/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thromboxane B2/*biosynthesis', 'Thromboxane-A Synthase/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/15 00:00,1992/12/15 00:01,['1992/12/15 00:00'],"['1992/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-2999(92)90558-L [pii]', '10.1016/0014-2999(92)90558-l [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1992 Dec 15;229(2-3):217-22. doi: 10.1016/0014-2999(92)90558-l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A flow cytometer and the calcium-sensitive dye indo-1 were used to make multiparameter measurements on the HL60 cells. Chol-OdC15 (5-10 microM) triggered a rapid increase (within 1 min) in [Ca2+]i, with a subsequent slow decline to baseline over 15 min in the continuous presence of agonist. The effect was preserved after unloading the intracellular Ca2+ stores with caffeine and ryanodine. The effect was not sensitive to membrane depolarization by KCl (60 mM) or nimodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist. An increase in [Ca2+]i was absent in a Ca(2+)-free solution and was inhibited by the inorganic Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+. The results suggest that Ca2+ influx activated by the chol-oligomer is probably mediated by receptor-operated Ca2+ channels.

The overall proportion of FIV seropositive feline samples was 5% during the 22 month study period. The number of tests performed increased slowly while the positive test results decreased with time (7% in 1990 and 4% in 1991). The decrease in prevalence was assumed to reflect a change in the sample population rather than an actual change in the general cat population. There were more symptomatic and domestic cats tested in 1990 than 1991. The lower-risk groups in the second year of the study may simply be an indication that the cat owners became more aware of FIV and the motivation to send samples switched from the veterinarian's interest to diagnose the disease in a symptomatic cat to the owner's interest to survey their cats for possible FIV infection. In a multivariable analysis, breed, symptoms, age and sex were associated with the risk of FIV seropositivity. The risk increased faster with age in males than in females (i.e., the age effect was not constant between sexes). The cats with symptoms had a higher risk than those without symptoms and non-purebred cats were at a higher risk than purebred cats.

This consensus is not merely predictable from the doublet frequencies and codon usage, but could correspond to an intermediary stage in a so-called periodic-to-chaotic transition. (3) Probable stepwise local duplications could be accounted for by slippagelike mechanisms. Comparison with the human spumaretrovirus (HSRV) shows similar segments in the overrepresented oligomers of the two sequences.

We describe a comprehensive assessment of pre- and postexposure AZT therapy in the feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-cat model for AIDS which included in vitro testing, an in vivo dose-response titration, a postexposure treatment study, plasma drug concentration determinations, and evaluation of the immune response to FeLV. In in vitro studies, AZT prevented FeLV infection of a feline T-lymphoid cell line, giving 50 and 90% inhibition concentrations of 4.6 and 11.1 mM, respectively. In all of the in vivo efficacy studies, AZT was administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion for 28 days. AZT toxicity was excessive at a dosage of 120 mg/kg of body weight per day, causing acute anemia, but AZT was tolerable at 60 mg/kg/day. In preexposure studies, AZT was efficacious in preventing chronic antigenemia at a dosage of > or = 15 mg/kg/day, at which plasma AZT concentrations averaged between 0.51 and 0.81 micrograms/ml (2.13 and 3.03 microM). As a postexposure treatment, at 60 mg/kg/day, AZT prevented chronic FeLV antigenemia when treatment was started up to 96 h post-virus inoculation (p.i.), but not when treatment was started at 192 h p.i. The 4-day period between 96 and 192 h p.i. appears to be critical for establishing chronic viremia. It is presumed that the increase in virus load between 4 and 8 days p.i. was able to overwhelm the immunologic functions responsible for containment of FeLV infection, even though AZT therapy effectively controlled viremia during the treatment period. The antibody response to FeLV varied depending on the time of AZT treatment initiation relative to virus challenge. When AZT treatment was started 48 h before or 8 h after FeLV challenge, antibodies to FeLV were not detected until after AZT treatment was discontinued at 28 days p.i. Following AZT treatment, however, antibody titers rapidly increased at a rate suggestive of a secondary immune response. When AZT treatment was initiate at later time points relative to virus challenge (24, 48, and 96 h p.i.), antibodies to FeLV became detectable during the treatment period. These results indicate that AZT treatment does not completely prevent FeLV infection, even when treatment begins before virus challenge, and that immune sensitization to FeLV proceeds during the prophylactic drug treatment period.","['Mathes, L E', 'Polas, P J', 'Hayes, K A', 'Swenson, C L', 'Johnson, S', 'Kociba, G J']","['Mathes LE', 'Polas PJ', 'Hayes KA', 'Swenson CL', 'Johnson S', 'Kociba GJ']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Columbus, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Cats', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology', 'Zidovudine/*therapeutic use']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.36.12.2715 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1992 Dec;36(12):2715-21. doi: 10.1128/AAC.36.12.2715.,"['5 P30 CA 16058-17/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 AI 62525/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 56295-1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC245534,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We obtained good resolution in specific signals against background (GAPDH signal/control plasmid signal ratio +/- SE 3.5 +/- 0.9). The technique was optimized taking into account several hybridization variables, like fixation, hybridization time, effect of blocking agents, and stringency wash variations. This method also allowed us to quantitate the GAPDH RNA copy number/cell using a fluorescence standard; we obtained a figure of about 1200 copies/cell, which is in good agreement with the dot blot hybridization assay result. Flow cytometric analysis of in situ hybridization represents an original method to study gene expression. This technique has the potential to develop into a multiparametric tool for cell biology studies, examining specific mRNA production together with DNA content or membrane molecules expression, and offering the possibility to purify by sorting a cell population expressing a specific mRNA.","['Lalli, E', 'Gibellini, D', 'Santi, S', 'Facchini, A']","['Lalli E', 'Gibellini D', 'Santi S', 'Facchini A']","['Laboratorio di Immunologia e Genetica, Istituti Ortopedici Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Antisense', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-2697(92)90015-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0003-2697(92)90015-y [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1992 Dec;207(2):298-303. doi: 10.1016/0003-2697(92)90015-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is antigenically and genetically distinct from HIV; an antigenic relatedness with equine infectious anaemia virus has been demonstrated. FIV has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Diagnostic tests are commercially available and attempts at preparing inactivated, subunit and molecularly engineered vaccines are being made in different laboratories. During FIV infection a transient primary illness can be recognized, with fever, neutropenia and lymphadenopathy. After a long period of clinical normalcy a secondary stage is distinguished with signs of an immunodeficiency-like syndrome. The incubation period for this stage can be as long as 5 years, during which gradual impairment of immune function develops. Many FIV-infected cats are presented for the first time showing vague signs of illness: recurrent fevers, emaciation, lack of appetite, lymphadenopathy, anaemia, leucopenia and behavioural changes. Later, the predominant clinical signs observed are chronic stomatitis/gingivitis, enteritis, upper respiratory tract infections, and infections of the skin. Neoplasias, neurological, immunological and haematological disorder are seen in a smaller proportion. The immunodeficiency-like syndrome is progressive over a period of months to years. Concomitant infection with feline leukaemia virus has been shown to accelerate the progression of disease. In vitro, phenotypic mixing between FIV and an endogenous feline oncovirus (RD114) has been demonstrated which leads to a broadening of the cell spectrum of the lentivirus. Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) has been isolated only once, and all attempts to obtain additional isolates have failed; it has been recovered from the leucocytes of cattle with persistent lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, lesions in the central nervous system, progressive weakness and emaciation. As with the feline representative, BIV also was found to possess a lentivirus morphology and to encode a reverse transcriptase with Mg++ preference; it replicates and induces syncytia in a variety of embryonic bovine tissues in vitro. Antigenic analyses have demonstrated a conservation of epitopes between the major core protein of BIV and HIV. The original isolate has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. Besides the three large open reading frames (ORFs) comprising the gag, pol, and env genes common to all replication-competent retroviruses, five additional small ORFs were found. Numerous point mutations and deletions were found, mostly in the env-encoding ORF. These data suggest that, within a single virus isolate, BIV displays extensive genomic variation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Egberink, H', 'Horzinek, M C']","['Egberink H', 'Horzinek MC']","['Institute of Virology, School of Veterinary Medicine, State University of Utrecht, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/epidemiology/immunology/microbiology', 'Cats', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/epidemiology/immunology/microbiology', 'HIV Infections/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Bovine/chemistry/classification/physiology', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/chemistry/classification/physiology', 'Lentivirus/chemistry/classification/*physiology', 'Lentivirus Infections/epidemiology/immunology/microbiology/*veterinary']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0378-1135(92)90059-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1135(92)90059-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 1992 Nov;33(1-4):311-31. doi: 10.1016/0378-1135(92)90059-3.,,,,PMC7117276,,,106,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies were used to monitor changes in lymphocyte subpopulations in the first few weeks after inoculation. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected BLV DNA in PBL of infected sheep 11-15 days after inoculation, that is, before antibodies to viral structural proteins were detected at 15-39 days post-inoculation. A rise in the number of both B and T lymphocytes coincided with detection of infection by PCR. At this time, an increase in the number of circulation CD8+ lymphocytes resulted in a low CD4: CD8 ratio. It appears that in BLV infection there is a host specific cell-mediated immune response to infected lymphocytes rather than a general immune response to foreign antigens. This response, which is characterized by an increase in the number of circulating CD8+ lymphocytes, precedes seroconversion. There is considerable variation between animals in this cytotoxic T lymphocyte response.","['Ward, W H', 'Dimmock, C K', 'Eaves, F W']","['Ward WH', 'Dimmock CK', 'Eaves FW']","['Animal Research Institute, Queensland Department of Primary Industries, Moorooka, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/microbiology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sheep/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/microbiology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/icb.1992.42 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1992 Oct;70 ( Pt 5):329-36. doi: 10.1038/icb.1992.42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bovine sera with anti-BIV activity, obtained from cows in two dairy herds, had antibodies directed against a variety of BIV-specific antigens indicating chronic infections. These sera were also tested for serological reactivity against bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and bovine syncytial virus (BSV). Cows most commonly had anti-BSV antibodies (12 of 39). Evidence for infection with BSV and BIV or BSV and BLV occurred with almost equal frequency (5 of 39 and 4 of 39, respectively) while only one instance of BIV and BLV coseropositivity was detected. The high prevalence of BSV seropositivity is consistent with a relatively infectious virus, which, as is known, may be transferred congenitally. Similar rates of coseropositivity of BIV or BLV with BSV in this population suggest that BIV is no more infectious than BLV and probably requires prolonged close contact for transmission. Seven of nine cows with anti-BIV antibodies detected primarily human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p51 and p63 antigens by WBA using an alkaline phosphatase detection system, suggesting that HIV-1 proteins have potential usefulness in screening cattle for BIV seropositivity. Six human sera that showed strong reactivity against multiple HIV-1 proteins and the serum from one of three patients considered to be an ""indeterminate"" HIV-1 reactor, cross-reacted primarily with BIV p26.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern hybridization were used to detect BLV provirus in the tumor DNA of the 27 cattle with lymphoma. The PCR was used to detect BLV provirus in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA of the 46 normal known-exposed cattle. Two presumed false negative AGID test results compared to ELISA were found. Of ten cattle three years of age or less with ""sporadic"" forms of lymphoma, four had BLV provirus in tumor DNA, detectable by PCR. In two of these four, BLV provirus was clonally integrated based on digestion of tumor DNA with restriction enzymes followed by Southern hybridization. The BLV provirus was not detected by PCR in 5 of 17 cattle with ""enzootic"" lymphoma and two of these five were seronegative. Among normal BLV-exposed cows, 6.5% (3 of 46) were serologically positive and PCR negative; serologically negative and PCR positive cows occurred with the same frequency. Serological and PCR test results, when considered in all cattle (n = 73), had a concordance rate of 83.6%. Discordant test results occurred with approximately equal frequency between serologically positive and PCR negative (7 of 73, 9.6%) and serologically negative and PCR positive (5 of 73, 6.8%) groups. These data suggest that the role of BLV in some ""sporadic"" bovine lymphomas, previously unassociated with BLV, should be reexamined. The BLV provirus was not demonstrable in the tumor DNA from five adult cattle with lymphoma, suggesting that BLV may not be the etiological agent in all adult bovine lymphomas. The findings of persistently seronegative PCR positive and seropositive PCR negative cattle indicate that further work is needed to more fully understand the host-virus interaction. Present serological screening methods may not have sufficient sensitivity for determining BLV status in some circumstances.","['Jacobs, R M', 'Song, Z', 'Poon, H', 'Heeney, J L', 'Taylor, J A', 'Jefferson, B', 'Vernau, W', 'Valli, V E']","['Jacobs RM', 'Song Z', 'Poon H', 'Heeney JL', 'Taylor JA', 'Jefferson B', 'Vernau W', 'Valli VE']","['Department of Pathology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Can J Vet Res,Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,8607793,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/chemistry', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*microbiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Immunodiffusion', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Lymphoma/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Can J Vet Res. 1992 Oct;56(4):339-48.,,,,PMC1263566,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular weight of all the ECF was about 30,000 to 45,000. None of the ECF except ECF-PI5 was suppressed when they were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF together, suggesting that ECF activity of ECF-PI5 is mainly comprised of IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF. ECF-PI5, PI6, and PI7 also exhibited enhancing activity on ex vivo eosinophil survival whereas ECF-PI8 and PI9 failed. Expression of Fc epsilon receptor II on eosinophils was potentiated by ECF-PI6 and ECF-PI7. In contrast, expression of Fc gamma receptor III was potentiated by ECF-PI7, ECF-PI8, and ECF-PI9. ECF-PI6 could also change an eosinophilic cell line, EOL-1, to eosinophilic granule-positive cells, whereas the rest of ECF failed.

A binding assay with [125I]iodocyanopindolol as the ligand revealed that cell lines of myelomonocytic or histiocytic derivation (HL-60, ML-2, RC-2A, U-937) expressed high numbers of beta-adrenoceptors. An intermediate density of receptors was found in a non-T, non-B cell leukemia line (Nall-1), whereas T-cell (JM, CCRF-CEM), B-cell (Raji) or erythroleukemic cell lines (K-562, HEL) displayed minimal or undetectable binding of the radioligand. Isoprenaline-stimulated cAMP production by the cells correlated to their extent of beta-adrenoceptor expression. Southern blot hybridization analysis of genomic DNA from the cell lines with a 32P-labelled beta 2-adrenoceptor cDNA probe revealed no evidence for major rearrangement or amplification of the receptor gene. Incubation with isoprenaline in vitro suppressed the proliferation of the receptor-rich RC-2A cells but did not affect the growth rate of the receptor-deficient K-562 cells. Treatment with propranolol slightly enhanced the proliferation of the RC-2A cells but did not markedly alter the growth rate of two other cell lines, regardless of their beta-adrenoceptor status. These findings indicate a regulatory influence by the sympathoadrenergic system on selected cells of the myelomonocytic lineage.","['Maki, T', 'Andersson, L C', 'Kontula, K K']","['Maki T', 'Andersson LC', 'Kontula KK']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta)', '83498-72-0 (Iodocyanopindolol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9Y8NXQ24VQ (Propranolol)', 'BJ4HF6IU1D (Pindolol)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Blood Cells', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Iodocyanopindolol', 'Isoproterenol/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Pindolol/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Propranolol/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb00059.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1992 Nov;49(5):263-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1992.tb00059.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have therefore examined the effect of the phorbol ester PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) which stimulates PKC and a combination of the adenosine receptor agonist NECA (5'-(N-ethyl)-carboxamido adenosine) and forskolin to raise cAMP, on the levels of c-Fos and Jun and on the binding and transcriptional activity of the transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1). PMA treatment caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in both c-Fos and Jun immunoreactivity in contrast to cAMP elevation that had only a slight effect. Both PMA and the combination of NECA and forskolin acted together either to increase (c-Fos) or decrease (Jun) protein levels as well as increasing AP-1 binding, as judged by gel-shift assay, and AP-1 transcriptional activity. Furthermore there was a clear-cut synergy between the PKC stimulator and the cAMP elevating agents. The results demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of PKC and elevation of cAMP leads to an enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity in a T-leukemia cell line, suggesting that the previously observed interaction between the parallel signal transduction pathways may have functional consequences at the level of gene transcription.","['Kontny, E', 'Kvanta, A', 'Fredholm, B B']","['Kontny E', 'Kvanta A', 'Fredholm BB']","['Department of Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/02 00:00,1992/11/02 00:01,['1992/11/02 00:00'],"['1992/11/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/02 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0922-4106(92)90012-k [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1992 Nov 2;227(3):333-8. doi: 10.1016/0922-4106(92)90012-k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard chromatographic techniques, coupled with the use of inhibitors and activators that are selective for various phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozymes, were used to establish the PDE isozyme profile in supernatant fractions of U937 cells. When PDE activity was assessed using 1 microM [3H]cAMP as a substrate, 70 to 90% of the total U937 cell supernatant activity in the major peak eluting from anion-exchange columns was inhibited by 30 microM rolipram, a selective inhibitor of PDE IV. The remaining activity was nearly abolished by 10 microM siguazodan or 10 microM cyclic GMP (cGMP,) selective inhibitors of the cGMP-inhibited PDE. Kinetic analyses of the enzyme activity contained within this major peak of PDE activity revealed a cAMP Km = 3 microM and a rolipram Ki = 0.5 microM, values characteristic of PDE IV. Additional studies revealed the presence of a small amount of Ca++/calmodulin-stimulated PDE, but no cGMP-stimulated PDE or cGMP-specific PDE activity. In an effort to induce PDE activity in intact U937 cells by producing a sustained increase in cAMP content, cells were treated for 4 hr with salbutamol (1 microM), rolipram (30 microM) or a combination of both agents. The combination of salbutamol and rolipram produced a 2- to 3-fold increase in PDE activity in U937 cells; when used alone, rolipram was without effect whereas salbutamol induced an increase that was approximately one-half of that observed with the combination. Isozyme isolation and characterization revealed that the overall elevation of cellular PDE activity could be accounted for by a 2- to 3-fold increase in the Vmax of PDE IV with no change in its Km. The induction of PDE IV by salbutamol was: 1) concentration- and time-dependent; 2) detectable only after prolonged (2-4 hr) agonist exposure; 3) preceded by an increase in cAMP content and an activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase; 4) mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP and prostaglandin E2; 5) reversible within 3 hr of salbutamol removal; and 6) abolished by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Collectively, these results indicate that the major PDE isozyme in the soluble fraction of U937 cells is PDE IV and that the activity of this enzyme is increased markedly in cells after prolonged exposure to agents that increase cAMP content.","['Torphy, T J', 'Zhou, H L', 'Cieslinski, L B']","['Torphy TJ', 'Zhou HL', 'Cieslinski LB']","['Department of Inflammation & Respiratory Pharmacology, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'K676NL63N7 (Rolipram)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'QF8SVZ843E (Albuterol)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism"", 'Albuterol/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinases/analysis', 'Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/*physiology', 'Rolipram', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1992 Dec;263(3):1195-205.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Fc epsilon RII expression leads to the IgE-dependent production of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. Expression by monocytes of Fc epsilon RII is regulated by several cytokines including interleukin-4, gamma- and alpha-interferons, and granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colony stimulating factors. An anti-inflammatory effect of nedocromil on monocytes has been proposed as a possible mechanism for its anti-asthma activity. We therefore investigated the capacity of nedocromil to modulate mononuclear phagocyte Fc epsilon RII expression and cytokine production. We used an anti-Fc epsilon RII antibody and flow cytometric analysis to assess the capacity of nedocromil to modulate cytokine-induced Fc epsilon RII expression in normals and asthmatics. Monocytes, THP-1 monocyte leukaemia cells, and alveolar macrophages were exposed to varying concentrations of these cytokines for 48 hr at 37 degrees C with or without the additional presence of nedocromil (1-10 microM) and the per cent of monocytes expressing Fc epsilon RII was determined. No changes in Fc epsilon RII expression were observed. Subsequently, we investigated the capacity of nedocromil to affect the capacity of IgE plus anti-IgE complexes, allergen, and LPS (16 hr/37 degrees C) to stimulate IL-1 beta and IL-6 production.

Retinoids have recently become of interest to research in areas as diverse as dermatology, embryonal development and cancer research. Retinol is the major retinoid transported in the blood and tissues by its specific carrier retinol binding protein (RBP). The normal level of retinol in plasma is regulated very precisely by retinol homeostasis. RBP-retinol circulation supplies target cells, which then activate retinol into retinoic acid (RA) if they possess the NAD-dependent enzymatic oxidation system. RA, which is one of the most active metabolites of retinol, is also present in low concentration in the blood and the RA rate formation varies from tissues depending on specific need of the cell. The cellular transport and biological activity of retinoids may be mediated by their specific cytoplasmic binding proteins cellular retinol binding protein (CRBP) and the cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) which may function as shuttles targetting RA to nucleosol fraction and/or as regulator of cellular concentration of RA. The nuclear proteins RARs (retinoic acid receptors), which are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily are likely to be the final transducers of the RA signal at the gene expression. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is able to specifically differentiate the malignant cells from leukemic patients with APL in short-term culture. For this reason, APL patients were successfully treated with ATRA (Chinese and French results). Acute promyelocytic leukemia M3 (French-American-British FAB classification) is a rare disease (10% of AML), characterized by a reciprocal chromosome 15-17 translocation. It has been shown that the chromosome 17 breakpoint of the translocation is localized within the RAR alpha gene. Due to the t(15;17) RAR alpha gene translocated to a gene PML on chromosome 15 resulting in synthesis of PML/RAR alpha fusion messenger RNA. Detection of PML/RAR alpha transcript is now a molecular marker of the disease. The abnormal PML/RAR alpha protein exhibits altered transcription activation properties when compared with RAR alpha. Clinical trials have demonstrated that ATRA is extremely efficient in inducing complete remission in APL patients. The morphologic finding of maturing elements in the bone marrow and peripheral blood during retinoic acid treatment indicates that the remission is obtained without hypoplasia and suggests that a differentiating mechanism is involved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Cornic, M', 'Guidez, F', 'Delva, L', 'Agadir, A', 'Degos, L', 'Chomienne, C']","['Cornic M', 'Guidez F', 'Delva L', 'Agadir A', 'Degos L', 'Chomienne C']","['Laboratoire de biologie cellulaire hematopoietique, hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Retinoids/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1992;79(7):697-704.,,,,,,Mode d'action des retinoides dans une nouvelle approche therapeutique des leucemies aigues promyelocytaires.,39,,,,,,,,,,,,

By combining SAC, or the phorbol ester TPA, with IL-2 and the conditioned medium of a T-cell hybridoma (BSF-MP6), we could strongly enhance the Trx expression. After [35S]methionine labeling of stimulated B-CLL cells in vitro, Trx was immunoprecipitated both from cell extracts and from the medium with antibodies against human placenta Trx. Secretion of newly synthesized Trx was also confirmed by a quantitative radioimmunoassay for human Trx.

We analyzed the expression pattern of the SR alpha promoter in human and mouse embryonal carcinoma lines and transgenic mouse tissues. Efficient and stable expression was detected in all cell lines tested, and tissues from all mice of four independent transgenic lines carrying the SR alpha-CAT vector showed a detectable level of CAT expression. These data suggest that the SR alpha promoter is useful for studies of both human embryonal carcinoma and transgenic mouse tissue.

The results of antitumor test in mice bearing L 1210 on podophyllotoxin derivatives suggest the following: 1) the strong cytotoxic effect itself is not a good indication of antitumor activity in vivo as long as it is associated with inhibition of tubulin polymerization.

Immunotherapy with IVIG in diseases of autoimmune character such as acute and chronic demyelinating neuropathy has recently shown promising results and encouraging reports have been published in the treatment of severe, steroid-dependent asthma, juvenile chronic arthritis and systemic vasculitis and dermatomyositis where IVIG possibly has a favourable immunomodulating effect on the patient's immune response.

Therefore, we developed a murine model to study the effect of daily cocaine administration, protein malnutrition, and retrovirus infection causing murine AIDS on the lymphoid cell populations of the thymus. C57BL/6 female mice fed a diet containing 4% protein were studied following chronic cocaine administration and LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) infection. Cocaine administration reduced body and thymus weight. Cocaine partially prevented thymus enlargement due to lymphoid cell proliferation induced by murine retrovirus infection. Cocaine treatment affected dramatically the thymus of protein-malnourished mice where the absolute number of Thy 1.2+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells represented only 10% of the control values. Daily saline injection also induced a significant decrease in the number of Thy 1.2+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells per thymus. These results suggest that the thymus glands of mice fed a low protein diet were susceptible to stress. Retrovirus infection provoked a decrease in the percentage and absolute number of Thy 1.2+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the thymus. This effect was potentiated by cocaine treatment. Therefore, cocaine was able to potentiate the impairment of the immune system caused by MuLV infection. We consider that cocaine could alter the immune system by altering the expression of T cell differentiation markers after direct interaction with thymocytes or through the neuroendocrine-thymus axis. Moreover, this effect was more dramatic and severe during protein malnutrition.","['Lopez, M C', 'Colombo, L L', 'Huang, D S', 'Watson, R R']","['Lopez MC', 'Colombo LL', 'Huang DS', 'Watson RR']","['Department of Family and Community Medicine, Arizona Health Sciences Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Thymus,Thymus,8009032,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'I5Y540LHVR (Cocaine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cocaine/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/chemically induced/*etiology/microbiology/pathology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/*immunology/pathology', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Protein Deficiency/complications/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects', 'Thymus Gland/drug effects/microbiology/*pathology']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Thymus. 1992 Nov;20(3):171-81.,"['AA08037/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA04827/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increase in cytotoxicity was accompanied by an increase in the formation of drug-stabilized protein-DNA covalent complexes. We now report that novobiocin increased the amount of VP-16-induced covalent complexes between the 170 kDa form of topoisomerase II and DNA in WEHI-3B D+ cells, as measured by the band-depletion immunoblotting assay, while it did not affect the extractable topoisomerase II activity, measured by the unknotting of P4 phage DNA and by a DNA cleavage assay. Novobiocin progressively increased the steady-state concentration of intracellular VP-16. Removal of novobiocin resulted in a rapid return of VP-16 to levels comparable to those seen with VP-16 alone. The increased accumulation of VP-16 was accounted for by an increase in the exchangeable fraction only. The novobiocin-mediated increase in the steady-state concentration of VP-16 occurred whether novobiocin was added simultaneously with VP-16 or was added after a steady-state level of VP-16 had been achieved. Novobiocin did not affect the initial rate of uptake of VP-16; however, it inhibited the efflux of the epipodophyllotoxin. In fact, when cells were loaded with the same level of VP-16 in the presence or absence of novobiocin, the efflux curves in the presence or absence of novobiocin were significantly different. We conclude that the inhibition of VP-16 efflux by novobiocin is responsible for the increase in VP-16 accumulation, leading to increased formation of VP-16-stabilized topoisomerase-II-DNA covalent complexes and increased cytotoxicity.","['Lorico, A', 'Rappa, G', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Lorico A', 'Rappa G', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/physiology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Etoposide/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Novobiocin/*pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/02 00:00,1992/12/02 00:01,['1992/12/02 00:00'],"['1992/12/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/02 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910520613 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1992 Dec 2;52(6):903-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910520613.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of these methods were applied to studies of apoptosis triggered in the human leukemic HL-60 cell line by DNA topoisomerase I or II inhibitors, and in rat thymocytes by either topoisomerase inhibitors or prednisolone. In most cases, apoptosis was selective to cells in a particular phase of the cell cycle: only S-phase HL-60 cells and G0 thymocytes were mainly affected. Necrosis was induced by excessively high concentrations of these drugs. The following cell features were found useful to characterize the mode of cell death: a) Activation of an endonuclease in apoptocic cells resulted in extraction of the low molecular weight DNA following cell permeabilization, which, in turn, led to their decreased stainability with DNA-specific fluorochromes. Measurements of DNA content made it possible to identify apoptotic cells and to recognize the cell cycle phase specificity of the apoptotic process. b) Plasma membrane integrity, which is lost in necrotic but not apoptotic cells, was probed by the exclusion of propidium iodide (PI). The combination of PI followed by Hoechst 33342 proved to be an excellent probe to distinguish live, necrotic, early- and late-apoptotic cells. c) Mitochondrial transmembrane potential, assayed by retention of rhodamine 123 was preserved in apoptotic but not necrotic cells. d) The ATP-dependent lysosomal proton pump, tested by the supravital uptake of acridine orange (AO) was also preserved in apoptotic but not necrotic cells. e) Bivariate analysis of cells stained for DNA and protein revealed markedly diminished protein content in apoptotic cells, most likely due to activation of endogenous proteases. Necrotic cells, having leaky membranes, had minimal protein content. f) Staining of RNA allowed for the discrimination of G0 from G1 cells and thus made it possible to reveal that apoptosis was selective to G0 thymocytes. g) The decrease in forward light scatter, paralleled either by no change (HL-60 cells) or an increase (thymocytes) of right angle scatter, were early changes during apoptosis. h) The sensitivity of DNA in situ to denaturation, was increased in apoptotic and necrotic cells. This feature, probed by staining with AO at low pH, provided a sensitive and early assay to discriminate between live, apoptotic and necrotic cells, and to evaluate the cell cycle phase specificity of these processes. i) The in situ nick translation assay employing labeled triphosphonucleotides can be used to reveal DNA strand breaks, to detect the very early stages of apoptosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Bruno, S', 'Del Bino, G', 'Gorczyca, W', 'Hotz, M A', 'Lassota, P', 'Traganos, F']","['Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Bruno S', 'Del Bino G', 'Gorczyca W', 'Hotz MA', 'Lassota P', 'Traganos F']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'DNA/*analysis', 'DNA Damage', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Organelles/ultrastructure', 'Proteins/analysis', 'Rats', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/drug effects', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990130802 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1992;13(8):795-808. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990130802.,"['R01 CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-1 is the prototype of the proinflammatory molecule while TGF-beta is essentially anti-inflammatory. IL-1 is part of the cascade of cytokines that are produced during microbial invasion or bodily injury and enhance a variety of host responses, particularly in the immunological and haemopoietic systems, while TGF-beta acts as an inhibitor of these responses. At several levels, IL-1 and TGF-beta act in opposition to one another. IL-1 stimulates the expression of many genes in lymphoid and marrow stromal cells that stimulate haemopoietic cell growth and differentiation, while TGF-beta inhibits these IL-1 mediated effects. Also, TGF-beta stimulates secretion of the IL-1Ra. In addition, IL-1 induces the cell surface expression of cytokine receptors on lymphoid and haemopoietic cells, while TGF-beta dramatically inhibits the cell surface expression of these receptors, including the IL-1 receptor. Finally, IL-1 augments lymphoid and haemopoietic cell growth and TGF-beta potently inhibits this proliferation. The interactions of these cytokines serve to illustrate that the net balance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals determines the fate of a given cell which may be responsible for regulating homeostatic cell growth (Figure 1).

Here we have summarized the current insights in the growth properties of acute leukaemia progenitor cells, derived from the application of fully defined in vitro assays. We have discussed the proliferation and maturation abilities in relation to cytogenetic abnormalities, status of growth factor receptors and the property of autocrine growth stimulation and evaluated the significance of these findings for the understanding of the pathogenesis of acute myeloblastic leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Lowenberg, B', 'Touw, I P']","['Lowenberg B', 'Touw IP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80009-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1992 Jul;5(3):599-618. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80009-0.,,,"['bcl-2', 'c-fms', 'c-kit', 'myl', 'pml', 'rARA', 'v-abl']",,,,109,,,,,,,,,,,,

Baboons and other Old World non-human primates harbor a related virus termed simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-I), which may also be associated with neoplastic disease. To explore the utility of the baboon as a model for HTLV-I infection and disease, 329 baboons from a colony of 3200 at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (SFBR) were analyzed for the presence of antibodies against STLV-I. An overall seroprevalence rate of > 40% was found, with higher rates in females versus males. Furthermore, seroprevalence rates increased dramatically with age, reaching greater than 80% in animals over the age of 16. Molecular and antigenic analysis of proviral DNA isolated from both tumor tissue and a cell line isolated from a baboon with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) indicates that STLV-I in this colony is closely related to HTLV-I. Furthermore, monoclonally integrated provirus isolated from lymphoma tissue was detected, strongly implicating STLV-I in the etiology of this malignancy. DNA primer pairs homologous to HTLV-I sequences amplified both HTLV-I and STLV-I, but not HTLV-II, providing further evidence for a close genetic relationship between baboon-derived STLV-I and HTLV-I. The detailed study of a large population of naturally infected baboons may therefore shed some light into the complex processes required for the induction of disease associated with HTLV-I infection in humans.","['Mone, J', 'Whitehead, E', 'Leland, M', 'Hubbard, G', 'Allan, J S']","['Mone J', 'Whitehead E', 'Leland M', 'Hubbard G', 'Allan JS']","['Department of Virology, Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, San Antonio, TX 78228.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern/veterinary', 'Blotting, Western/veterinary', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Single-Stranded', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Papio/*microbiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Prevalence', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1992.8.1653 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1992 Sep;8(9):1653-61. doi: 10.1089/aid.1992.8.1653.,"['5PO1 HL28972/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-28273/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HV53030/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FIV was isolated from PBMC of all infected cats, but not from the uninfected cats. FIV was also isolated consistently from 100 microliters plasma from most of the experimentally infected cats, but not from the 2 naturally infected cats. The virus titer in PBMCs in both experimentally and naturally infected cats was comparatively high, ranging from 10 TCID/10(6) PBMC to 14,286 TCID/10(6) PBMC. The titers in PBMC of individual cats remained unchanged or varied only slightly over the 20 week period. In contrast, the titers varied substantially between cats, with significantly higher titers in the youngest litter (4 cats) than in the oldest litter (3 cats). This suggests that there is an age-related factor influencing the level of PBMC virus titers in experimental infection with FIV. A similar age-related susceptibility has been shown with feline leukemia virus. More importantly, the sustained titers in the experimentally infected cats bear close resemblance to infection of children with human immunodeficiency virus. These data reinforce suggestions that age and immune maturity have a fundamental influence on PBMC and plasma titers in lentivirus infections.","['Meers, J', 'Robinson, W F', 'del Fierro, G M', 'Scoones, M A', 'Lawson, M A']","['Meers J', 'Robinson WF', 'del Fierro GM', 'Scoones MA', 'Lawson MA']","['School of Veterinary Studies, Murdoch University, Western Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cats/*microbiology', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Lentivirus Infections/blood/*microbiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/microbiology', 'Time Factors']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01309587 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 1992;127(1-4):233-43. doi: 10.1007/BF01309587.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to the decline in circulating CD4+ cells, infected cats are unable to mount primary antibody responses to T-dependent antigens. We investigated whether the altered ability of helper T cells to produce cytokines necessary for B cell growth and differentiation might be a primary event in the pathogenesis of FeLV-FAIDS infection. We found that as early as 9 weeks after infection, lymphocytes from cats with normal CD4+ cell numbers produced significantly lower levels of B-cell stimulatory factors. This deficit became progressively more severe with time. By contrast, resting B cells isolated from infected cats did not differ from controls in the ability to undergo activation and differentiation to antibody-secreting cells. The results suggest that a progressive defect in Th function occurs prior to CD4+ T-cell depletion early in the course of FeLV-FAIDS induced immunodeficiency.","['Diehl, L J', 'Hoover, E A']","['Diehl LJ', 'Hoover EA']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988),Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,8812597,"['0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cats', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/etiology/*immunology/physiopathology', 'HIV Antibodies/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988). 1992 Dec;5(12):1188-94.,"['AI-25273/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells were incubated with three chelators known to bind copper. One chelator, tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), reduced cellular copper levels and the activities of two copper-requiring enzymes, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and cytochrome c oxidase. The specificity of the chelator was assessed by incubating cells with both copper and TEPA and, in other experiments, with zinc and TEPA. Copper levels, Cu/Zn-SOD activity and cytochrome c oxidase activity were restored to control values when copper and TEPA were added to cultures simultaneously, indicating the TEPA was responsible for reducing these aspects of copper metabolism. Incubating with both zinc and TEPA reduced copper levels relative to the control, but did not reduce Cu/Zn-SOD activity to the same extent as TEPA alone. The chelation of copper was a time-dependent process that was stable for at least 4 d. Cell growth and viability were not affected by TEPA. Respiratory burst activity, an indicator of differentiation, was not affected by TEPA, demonstrating that the reduction of Cu/Zn-SOD activity was due to copper chelation and not due to changes in Cu/Zn-SOD protein levels that occur during differentiation. Loss of copper, as well as a reduction of the activity of two copper-requiring enzymes, provides evidence that TEPA is a useful compound for creating a functional copper deficiency in cell culture.","['Percival, S S', 'Layden-Patrice, M']","['Percival SS', 'Layden-Patrice M']","['Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (Ethylenediamines)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'YZD1C9KQ28 (tetraethylenepentamine)']",IM,"['Copper/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/metabolism', 'Ethylenediamines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jn/122.12.2424 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr. 1992 Dec;122(12):2424-9. doi: 10.1093/jn/122.12.2424.,['DK43518/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic advantage may be obtained regardless of whether drugs are synergistic in the pharmacologic sense in the treatment of a tumor.

Specimens from the third biopsy exhibited histologic features that were consistent with malignant lymphoma of the diffuse, mixed B-cell type. Chemotherapy with the regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone was adopted but was interrupted after a short time because of bone marrow suppression. Subsequently, large numbers of enlarged abnormal lymphocytes with a few vacuoles in the cytoplasm appeared in the circulating blood, indicating leukemic transformation of the midline lymphoma.

However, enzymes capable of oxidizing it in non-hepatic tissue have yet to be identified. A potential candidate, that may be relevant to the metabolism of amsacrine in blood and its action in myeloid leukaemias and myelosuppression, is the haem enzyme myeloperoxidase. We have found that the purified human enzyme oxidizes amsacrine to its quinone diimine, either directly or through the production of hypochlorous acid. In comparison, the 4-methyl-5-methylcarboxamide derivative of amsacrine, CI-921 9-[[2-methoxy-4[(methylsulphonyl)-amino]phenyl]amino)-N, 5-dimethyl-4-acridine carboxamide, reacted poorly with myeloperoxidase, although it was oxidized by hypochlorous acid. Detailed studies of the mechanism by which myeloperoxidase oxidizes amsacrine revealed that the semiquinone imine free radical is a likely intermediate in this reaction. Oxidation of amsacrine analogues indicated that factors other than their reduction potential determine how readily they are metabolized by myeloperoxidase. Both amsacrine and CI-921 inhibited production of hypochlorous acid by myeloperoxidase. CI-921 acted by trapping the enzyme as the inactive redox intermediate compound II. Amsacrine inhibited by a different mechanism that may involve conversion of myeloperoxidase to compound III, which is also unable to oxidize Cl-. The susceptibility of amsacrine to oxidation by myeloperoxidase indicates that this reaction may contribute to the cytotoxicity of amsacrine toward neutrophils, monocytes and their precursors.","['Kettle, A J', 'Robertson, I G', 'Palmer, B D', 'Anderson, R F', 'Patel, K B', 'Winterbourn, C C']","['Kettle AJ', 'Robertson IG', 'Palmer BD', 'Anderson RF', 'Patel KB', 'Winterbourn CC']","['Free Radical Research Unit, Christchurch School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '712K4CDC10 (Hypochlorous Acid)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'S8P50T62B6 (asulacrine)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/analogs & derivatives/*blood/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypochlorous Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxidase/*blood/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/03 00:00,1992/11/03 00:01,['1992/11/03 00:00'],"['1992/11/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/03 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(92)90066-R [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(92)90066-r [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1992 Nov 3;44(9):1731-8. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(92)90066-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SH2 domains were shown to be responsible for mediating association between signalling proteins and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including growth factor receptors. Nck is an ubiquitously expressed protein consisting exclusively of one SH2 and three SH3 domains. Here we show that epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor stimulation of intact human or murine cells leads to phosphorylation of Nck protein on tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues. Similar stimulation of Nck phosphorylation was detected upon activation of rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells by cross-linking of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptors (Fc epsilon RI). Ligand-activated, tyrosine-autophosphorylated platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor receptors were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Nck antibodies, and the association with either receptor molecule was mediated by the SH2 domain of Nck. Addition of phorbol ester was also able to stimulate Nck phosphorylation on serine residues. However, growth factor-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of Nck was not mediated by protein kinase C. Interestingly, approximately fivefold overexpression of Nck in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in formation of oncogenic foci. These results show that Nck is an oncogenic protein and a common target for the action of different surface receptors. Nck probably functions as an adaptor protein which links surface receptors with tyrosine kinase activity to downstream signalling pathways involved in the control of cell proliferation.","['Li, W', 'Hu, P', 'Skolnik, E Y', 'Ullrich, A', 'Schlessinger, J']","['Li W', 'Hu P', 'Skolnik EY', 'Ullrich A', 'Schlessinger J']","['Department of Pharmacology, New York University Medical Center, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Nck protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/physiology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.12.12.5824-5833.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Dec;12(12):5824-33. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.12.5824-5833.1992.,,,,PMC360522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that polyphosphoinositides may play critical roles in the activation process of mu-calpain. Experiments with purified enzyme, substrate (fodrin), and phospholipids show that only polyphosphoinositides but not other lipids significantly promote calpain action in the physiological intracellular calcium range of 10(-7) to 10(-6) M. The effect of polyphosphoinositide is exerted through both a reduction in the calcium concentration required for calpain autolysis and an increase in the Vmax of the proteolytic reaction. Neomycin, a polyphosphoinositide-binding antibiotic, inhibits both polyphosphoinositide-assisted proteolysis in test tubes and calcium-induced calpain activation coupled with substrate proteolysis in intact cells. This implies that the presence of polyphosphoinositides may actually be a prerequisite for calpain activation inside cells.","['Saido, T C', 'Shibata, M', 'Takenawa, T', 'Murofushi, H', 'Suzuki, K']","['Saido TC', 'Shibata M', 'Takenawa T', 'Murofushi H', 'Suzuki K']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (fodrin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calpain/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Microfilament Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipids/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/05 00:00,1992/12/05 00:01,['1992/12/05 00:00'],"['1992/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)35804-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Dec 5;267(34):24585-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ET-1 induced an elevation of the intracellular levels of Ca2+([Ca2+]i) as measured with the fluorescent indicator indo-1, which consists of an initial transient increase and an ensuing sustained plateau. The plateau phase was abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+. In addition, ET-1 induced a rapid (within 5 s) increase in the accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and more delayed increases in Ins(1,3,4)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, but did not modify cAMP levels. ET-1 homologues (ET-2, ET-3, sarafotoxin 6b and vasointestinal constrictor) also induced biphasic effects on [Ca2+]i. The Ca2+ elevation was concentration dependent, the order of potency being sarafotoxin 6b > ET-1 > ET-2 = vasointestinal constrictor > ET-3. The actions of ET analogs in raising [Ca2+]i were mutually exclusive, suggesting that they act through the same mechanism.

Once 8-oxodGTP is formed in the cellular nucleotide pool, this mutagenic nucleotide is incorporated into DNA and would cause transversion mutations. The MutT protein of Escherichia coli possesses enzyme activity to hydrolyze 8-oxodGTP to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate and thus may be responsible for preventing the occurrence of such mutations. Here we show that the human cell has an enzyme specifically hydrolyzing 8-oxodGTP in a fashion similar to that seen with MutT protein. The human 8-oxodGTPase has been found in cell-free extracts from Jurkat cells and purified > 400-fold. Analyses by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis revealed that the molecular mass of the native form of human 8-oxodGTPase is 18 kDa. Mg2+ ion is required for the enzyme action and the optimum pH for the reaction is pH 8.0. The enzyme hydrolyzes 8-oxodGTP to 8-oxodGMP with a Km value of 12.5 microM. dGTP and dATP are also degraded to dGMP and dAMP, respectively, with Km values 70 times greater than that for 8-oxodGTP. dTTP and dCTP are not hydrolyzed. These properties of the human 8-oxodGTPase are similar to those observed with the E. coli MutT protein, suggesting that the function of protecting the genetic information from the threat of endogenous oxygen radicals is widely distributed in organisms.","['Mo, J Y', 'Maki, H', 'Sekiguchi, M']","['Mo JY', 'Maki H', 'Sekiguchi M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Deoxyguanine Nucleotides)', '139307-94-1 (8-oxodeoxyguanosine triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.55 (8-oxodGTPase)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', '*DNA Repair Enzymes', 'Deoxyguanine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Molecular Weight', '*Mutagenesis', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.22.11021 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Nov 15;89(22):11021-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.22.11021.,,,,PMC50475,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of human HL-525 cells to x-rays was associated with increases in EGR1 mRNA levels. Nuclear run-on assays showed that this effect is related at least in part to activation of EGR1 gene transcription. Sequences responsive to ionizing radiation-induced signals were determined by deletion analysis of the EGR1 promoter. The results demonstrate that x-ray inducibility of the EGR1 gene is conferred by a region containing six serum response or CC(A+T-rich)6GG (CArG) motifs. Further analysis confirmed that the region encompassing the three distal or upstream CArG elements is functional in the x-ray response. Moreover, this region conferred x-ray inducibility to a minimal thymidine kinase gene promoter. Taken together, these results indicate that ionizing radiation induces EGR1 transcription through CArG elements.","['Datta, R', 'Rubin, E', 'Sukhatme, V', 'Qureshi, S', 'Hallahan, D', 'Weichselbaum, R R', 'Kufe, D W']","['Datta R', 'Rubin E', 'Sukhatme V', 'Qureshi S', 'Hallahan D', 'Weichselbaum RR', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/*physiology', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Gene Conversion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*radiation effects', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Rays', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.21.10149 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Nov 1;89(21):10149-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.21.10149.,"['CA41068/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['EGR1', 'Krox-24', 'NFGI-A', 'TIS-8', 'zif/268']",PMC50295,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyse further the contribution of the individual domains involved in the transformation of various hematopoietic lineages, we have constructed several mutant viruses expressing a fusion protein with deletions in either v-myb or v-ets.

The DNA-binding domain of v-ets is necessary to transform myelomonocytic cells. Furthermore, we show that E26 onco-protein also transforms granulocytic cells. The v-ets DNA-binding domain is not necessary to transform them, whereas deleting the v-myb DNA-binding domain strongly reduces transformation of these cells.

In order to study whether GTP gamma S formed locally from adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (ATP gamma S) and GDP by nucleoside diphosphokinase has any advantage over exogenously added GTP gamma S in binding to and activating G proteins, regulation of complement component 5a (C5a) binding to its receptors, as well as formation of GTP gamma S, was studied in membranes of HL-60 cells. GTP gamma S added to HL-60 membranes potently inhibited binding of 125I-C5a (IC50 about 3 nM), an effect not influenced by addition of either GDP or ATP gamma S. When HL-60 membranes were incubated with the combination of ATP gamma S and GDP, a marked potentiation (up to 300-fold) of the inhibition caused by either GDP or ATP gamma S alone was observed. By measuring nucleoside diphosphokinase-catalyzed formation of GTP gamma S and inhibition of 125I-C5a binding in the presence of GDP and ATP gamma S under identical assay conditions, it was found that formed GTP gamma S inhibited binding of 125I-C5a with an IC50 value of about 0.3 nM, thus being about 10-fold more potent than exogenously added GTP gamma S.

Since seroepidemiologic studies have demonstrated higher HHV-6 antibody titers in young children than in adults, this serologic study suggests that the previous association reported for HHV-6 and ALL was a result of the age of the population rather than a relationship between the virus and the disease.","['Levine, P H', 'Ablashi, D V', 'Saxinger, W C', 'Connelly, R R']","['Levine PH', 'Ablashi DV', 'Saxinger WC', 'Connelly RR']","['Environmental Epidemiology Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*complications', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Nov;6(11):1229-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its oncogenicity has been studied in three meat-type and five Leghorn strains of chickens. In the meat-type strains, the virus, following embryonal inoculation, induced an overall incidence of 27% myelocytic myeloid leukosis (myelocytomatosis) and 12% renal adenomas, with long median latent periods. Amongst the Leghorn lines, these tumors occurred with similar incidence in line 0, but with lower or zero incidences in the other lines. A variety of other tumours occurred with low incidence. Embryonal infection resulted in a permanently tolerant viraemic state with shedding of ALV group specific (gs)-antigen to egg albumen; contact infection resulted mainly in the development of non-shedder birds with serum virus-neutralising antibodies. Contact infection in a meat-type line was associated with the development of transient or permanent viraemia in some birds, and a low tumour incidence. A viraemic phase was not detected following contact infection in a Leghorn line and no tumours developed. The long latent period between embryo infection and tumour mortality, apparently differing from the consequences of infection with acutely transforming ALVs, and the inability of HPRS-103 ALV to transform cultured bone marrow cells, suggests that this virus may lack a viral oncogene and exert its oncogenic properties by some other mechanism such as promoter insertion activation of a cellular oncogene.","['Payne, L N', 'Gillespie, A M', 'Howes, K']","['Payne LN', 'Gillespie AM', 'Howes K']","['AFRC Institute for Animal Health, Houghton Laboratory, Cambridgeshire, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Avian Leukosis/microbiology/pathology/*transmission', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*pathogenicity', 'Bone Neoplasms/microbiology/veterinary', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens/*microbiology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/microbiology/veterinary', 'Liver Neoplasms/microbiology/veterinary', 'Poultry Diseases/*microbiology', 'Species Specificity']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Nov;6(11):1167-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is recognized by c-Rel/HIVEN86A in DNA affinity precipitation (DNAP) assays and by the Rel-related p50 and p65 subunits of the nuclear factor NF-kappa B in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). We have analyzed activities that bind the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and simian virus 40 kappa B motifs in two human leukemia cell lines, Jurkat and H9. In both DNAP and EMSA analyses of Jurkat cell extracts, we detected multiple kappa B motif-binding activities in addition to c-Rel/HIVEN86A and p50-p65 NF-kappa B. In Jurkat cell nuclear extracts, EMSA analysis revealed at least six specific DNA-protein complexes, of which one comigrated with the p50-p65 NF-kappa B complex. Formation of all six complexes was enhanced by stimulation of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin but was differentially affected by the salt concentration in the binding reaction and by the conditions of Jurkat cell growth. Nuclear extracts from both unstimulated and stimulated H9 cells revealed similar levels of five kappa B motif-specific complexes, all of which displayed mobilities distinct from those of the Jurkat cell complexes. Indeed, a complex corresponding to p50-p65 NF-kappa B was not detectable in nuclear extracts from unstimulated H9 cells although such a complex was apparent in nuclear extracts from stimulated H9 cells. In contrast to the inducibility of a p50-p65 NF-kappa B-like complex, transcriptional enhancers composed of multimerized kappa B motifs displayed similar high levels of activity in both the unstimulated and stimulated H9 cells. Thus, the activity of the kappa B motif in H9 cells corresponded to the abundance of the H9 cell-specific kappa B motif complexes and not to the levels of p50-p65 NF-kappa B complex. These results suggest that the broad activity of the kappa B enhancer element is not only due to the broadly distributed NF-kappa B activator but also to cell type-specific kappa B motif-binding activities.","['Phares, W', 'Franza, B R Jr', 'Herr, W']","['Phares W', 'Franza BR Jr', 'Herr W']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York 11724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'HIV-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Simian virus 40/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1992/12/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/12/11 19:15'],"['1992/12/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/12/11 19:15 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.12.7490-7498.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Dec;66(12):7490-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.12.7490-7498.1992.,"['AI27270/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI31825/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC240457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the HCMV enhancer acts as a powerful stimulator of transcription in most cell types examined, human T cells do not support strong activity. The present study demonstrates that the tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type I trans activates the major enhancer of HCMV more than 60-fold in the T-cell line Jurkat. When a series of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression plasmids containing synthetic oligonucleotides with the 17-, 18-, 19-, or 21-bp motif upstream of a minimal immediate-early 1 and 2 gene promoter was tested, two of the four repeat motifs could be identified as Tax-responsive elements.

The dimer linkage structure, while maintaining the dimer state of the retroviral genome, might also be involved in packaging and reverse transcription, as well as recombination during proviral DNA synthesis. To study the dimer structure of the retroviral genome and the mechanism of dimerization, we analyzed features of the dimeric genome of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) type A and identified elements required for its dimerization. Here we report that the REV dimeric genome extracted from virions and infected cells, as well as that synthesized in vitro, is more resistant to heat denaturation than avian sarcoma and leukemia virus, murine leukemia virus, or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 dimeric RNA. The minimal domain required to form a stable REV RNA dimer in vitro was found to map between positions 268 and 452 (KpnI and SalI sites), thus corresponding to the E encapsidation sequence (J. E. Embretson and H. M. Temin, J. Virol. 61:2675-2683, 1987).

Besides the enhancer element, we have observed that the region between the enhancer and promoter (DEN) has a profound effect on transcription in different cell types. This effect, however, was dependent on the copy number of enhancer repeats and was detectable in the presence of a single repeat. When two enhancer repeats were present, the effect of DEN on transcription was abrogated except in T cells. DEN also makes a significant contribution to the leukemogenic property of the MCF13 retrovirus. Its deletion from the MCF13 virus dramatically reduced the incidence of thymic lymphoma and increased the latency of disease in comparison with the wild-type virus. This effect was most marked when one rather than two enhancer repeats was present in the mutant viruses. We also observed that the removal of one repeat alone remarkably reduced leukemogenicity by the MCF13 virus. A newly identified protein-binding site (MLPal) located within DEN affects transcription only in T cells, and its deletion attenuates the ability of an MCF13 virus with a single enhancer repeat to induce thymic lymphoma. This observation suggests that the MLPal protein-binding site contributes to the effect of the DEN region on T-cell-specific transcription and viral leukemogenicity. This study identifies the importance of nonenhancer sequences in the long terminal repeat for the oncogenesis of the MCF13 retrovirus.","['Tupper, J C', 'Chen, H', 'Hays, E F', 'Bristol, G C', 'Yoshimura, F K']","['Tupper JC', 'Chen H', 'Hays EF', 'Bristol GC', 'Yoshimura FK']","['Department of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Lymphoma/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muridae', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*microbiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.12.7080-7088.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Dec;66(12):7080-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.12.7080-7088.1992.,"['CA44166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CT2T32CA09537/CT/CIT NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC240380,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were interested in examining the role of thrombin in the regulation of adenylyl cyclase in this cell line. As opposed to its predominantly inhibitory effects on cyclic AMP production in platelets or in membranes from HEL cells, our initial experiments in intact HEL cells revealed that thrombin markedly potentiated the cyclic AMP response to prostaglandin E1 (2.9 +/- 0.2-fold), prostacyclin (1.9 +/- 0.2-fold) and carbacyclin (2.5 +/- 0.5-fold), measured either by radioimmunoassay or by the [3H]adenine preloading procedure. Thrombin, although ineffective alone, also potentiated cyclic AMP production stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (1.6 +/- 0.2-fold), cholera toxin (3.0 +/- 0.6-fold) and AIF4- (2.3 +/- 0.6-fold), but not by forskolin (0.9 +/- 0.1-fold). The thrombin effect 1) produced an increase in the efficacy of the prostaglandins with no change in potency; 2) was long-lived; 3) required the proteolytic activity of thrombin; 4) was insensitive to pertussis toxin; and 5) was at least partially mimicked by trypsin, extracellular ATP and UTP, platelet activating factor and activators of protein kinase C. Down-regulation of protein kinase C or pre-exposure to the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine blocked the potentiating effect. Together, these results suggest that in HEL cells, the mechanism of thrombin potentiation of cyclic AMP production may involve alterations in the interaction between stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding protein and the catalytic subunit of adenylyl cyclase, possibly involving protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation.","['Turner, J T', 'Camden, J M', 'Kansra, S', 'Shelton-James, D', 'Wu, H', 'Halenda, S P']","['Turner JT', 'Camden JM', 'Kansra S', 'Shelton-James D', 'Wu H', 'Halenda SP']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of Missouri-Columbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['69552-46-1 (carboprostacyclin)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Alprostadil/pharmacology', 'Calcium/analysis', 'Cyclic AMP/*biosynthesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epoprostenol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1992 Nov;263(2):708-16.,"['DE07389/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL38406/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanisms of photosensitization of human leukemic cells by diaminoanthraquinones: singlet oxygen and radical reactions.,317-35,"The synthesis of several aminoanthraquinone derivatives (AAQs), designed to suppress the dark toxicity and to promote more efficient cancer cell photosensitization for potential use in photodynamic therapy (PDT), is described. The following AAQs were synthesized: 1-NH2-4,5-(MeO)2-AQ (1), 1,5-(NH2)2-4,8-(MeO)2-AQ (2), 1,8-(NH2)2-4,5-(MeO)2-AQ (3), and 1,5-(NHPhMe)2-4,8-(MeO)2-AQ (8). The agents exhibit strong absorption in the region 480-620 nm. Possible mechanisms of photosensitization were studied by measuring 1O2 phosphorescence at 1270 nm, detecting superoxide radicals employing an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-spin trapping technique, and measuring oxygen consumption during the photo-oxidation of a representative biological electron donor, NADH. Strong phosphorescence from 1O2 was observed upon illumination of 2 and 3 in C6H6 (quantum yield of 0.25 and 0.5 respectively), and in EtOH (quantum yield of 0.23 and 0.34). The 1-amino-AQ (1) was the weakest 1O2 sensitizer, with quantum yield of 0.13 in benzene. No phosphorescence was observed in EtOH. A superoxide radical was detected as a spin adduct of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) in irradiated benzene solutions of 1, 2 or 3 and DMPO. AAQs 2 and 3 sensitized photo-oxidation of NADH in H2O/EtOH mixture with the intermediacy of singlet oxygen as judged by the effect of sodium azide on the photostimulated oxygen consumption. Evolution of O2 upon addition of catalase to the illuminated solution confirmed the ultimate formation of hydrogen peroxide. These findings suggested that the (di)amino-dimethoxyanthraquinones might exert photosensitization via both Type I and Type II mechanisms. The AAQs were tested for their ability to photosensitize K562 human chronic myeloid leukemic cells in culture. Viability was measured using the 3,4,5-diethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium blue assay, and DNA and possible membrane damage were assessed. The results from illuminating cells with light > 475 nm show that for the 1,5-compounds, the presence of methoxy substituents at 4,8 positions reduces the dark toxicity from ID50 of 23 to 250 microM and for the 1,8-compounds correspondingly from ID50 of 53 to > 300 microM. In the 1,5-series this decrease of the dark toxicity is accompanied by an increase in light-induced dose modification from 8.85 to 14.4. Differences exist in the mechanisms of cytotoxicity between the prototype phenolic AAQs and their methoxy counterparts. It appears that the cytotoxic action of the latter causes cell damage by the formation of a high proportion of alkali labile sites in addition to frank strand breaks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Reszka, K J', 'Bilski, P', 'Chignell, C F', 'Hartley, J A', 'Khan, N', 'Souhami, R L', 'Mendonca, A J', 'Lown, J W']","['Reszka KJ', 'Bilski P', 'Chignell CF', 'Hartley JA', 'Khan N', 'Souhami RL', 'Mendonca AJ', 'Lown JW']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

FeLV-A is the ubiquitous, highly infectious form of FeLV, and FeLV-C isolates are rare variants which are invariably isolated along with FeLV-A. The FeLV-C isolates share the capacity to induce acute non-regenerative anaemia and the prototype, FeLV-C/Sarma, has strongly age-restricted infectivity for cats. The FeLV-C/Sarma env sequence is closely related to that of common, weakly pathogenic FeLV-A isolates. We now show by construction of chimeric viruses that the receptor specificity of FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 virus can be converted to that of FeLV-C by exchange of a single env variable domain, Vr1, which differs by a three codon deletion and nine adjacent substitutions. Attempts to dissect this region further by directed mutagenesis resulted in disabled proviruses. Sequence analysis of independent natural FeLV-C isolates showed that they have unique Vr1 sequences which are distinct from the conserved FeLV-A pattern. The chimeric viruses which acquired the host range and subgroup properties of FeLV-C retained certain FeLV-A-like properties in that they were non-cytopathogenic in 3201B feline T cells and readily induced viraemia in weanling animals. They also induced a profound anaemia in neonates which had a more prolonged course than that induced by FeLV-C/Sarma and which was macrocytic rather than non-regenerative in nature. Although receptor specificity and a major determinant of pathogenicity segregate with Vr1, it appears that sequences elsewhere in the genome influence infectivity and pathogenicity independently of the subgroup phenotype.","['Rigby, M A', 'Rojko, J L', 'Stewart, M A', 'Kociba, G J', 'Cheney, C M', 'Rezanka, L J', 'Mathes, L E', 'Hartke, J R', 'Jarrett, O', 'Neil, J C']","['Rigby MA', 'Rojko JL', 'Stewart MA', 'Kociba GJ', 'Cheney CM', 'Rezanka LJ', 'Mathes LE', 'Hartke JR', 'Jarrett O', 'Neil JC']","['Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, CRC Beatson Laboratories, Glasgow, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, Feline leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anemia/pathology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cat Diseases', 'Cats', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genes, Viral/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Virulence']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-73-11-2839 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1992 Nov;73 ( Pt 11):2839-47. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-73-11-2839.,"['AI 25722/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40034/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 41939/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Samples (n = 525) from patients with haemophilia A, leukaemia, and chronic liver disease and at increased risk of hepatitis C virus infection were tested by EIA-1 (Ortho Diagnostics), an assay which uses recombinant HCV fusion proteins as antigens, and by EIA-2 (United Biomedical), an assay based on synthetic HCV oligopeptide antigens. RESULTS: Samples (n = 193) were repeatedly reactive in both EIAs. Of these, 190 (98%) yielded reactivities in both of two supplemental assays used, one an immunoblot assay (RIBA) using recombinant HCV polypeptides similar to EIA-1 antigens, and the other a neutralisation EIA (EIA-2N) based on antigenic competition with HCV peptides similar to EIA-2 antigens. The three samples not reactive in supplemental tests exhibited low EIA optical density (OD) values (signal/cutoff ratios of less than 3). Hence, all specimens reactive and yielding high OD values in both EIAs were also reactive in supplemental assays. Twenty four samples were reactive in EIA-1 only and nine (38%) of these were reactive in RIBA. Fourteen of the 15 (93%) specimens reactive in EIA-1 but not RIBA were derived from patients with chronic liver dysfunction. Two samples were reactive in EIA-2 only, of which one was reactive in EIA-2N and none in RIBA. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with EIA-2, EIA-1 yielded more validated reactive samples and resulted in more non-validated reactivities. It is therefore suggested that for clinical diagnosis: (i) EIA-1 be used for anti-HCV testing and EIA-2 for validation of EIA-1 reactivities; (ii) samples concordantly reactive in EIA-1 and EIA-2 and displaying high OD readings be considered HCV antibody positive without supplemental testing; (iii) supplemental testing by RIBA be limited to samples reactive in EIA-1 but equivocal or unreactive in EIA-2 and those concordantly reactive but exhibiting low absorbance readings.","['Teo, C G', 'Gabriel, F G', 'Mortimer, P P']","['Teo CG', 'Gabriel FG', 'Mortimer PP']","['PHLS Virus Reference Laboratory, Central Public Health Laboratory, London.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,['0 (Hepatitis Antibodies)'],IM,"['Hemophilia A/immunology', 'Hepacivirus/*immunology', 'Hepatitis Antibodies/*analysis', 'Humans', '*Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Liver Diseases/immunology', 'Reproducibility of Results']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.45.10.917 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1992 Oct;45(10):917-20. doi: 10.1136/jcp.45.10.917.,,,,PMC495067,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect is selective since ACV at the same concentration had no effect on the src and Ha-ras transformation of NIH 3T3 cells or on the proliferation of hemopoietic cells transformed by those oncogenes. The inhibitory effect on proliferation of abl-transformed cells correlated with the extent of ACV triphosphate formation and incorporation into cellular DNA that was greater than that in normal or other oncogene-transformed cells.

None of the chloroacetic acids induced DNA SB in the livers of rats at 4 hr following a single administration of 1-10 mmole/kg. TCA (10 mmole/kg) and DCA (5 and 10 mmole/kg) did produce a small amount of strand breakage in mice (7% at 4 hr) but not at 1 hr. N-nitrosodiethylamine (DENA), an established alkylating agent and a rodent hepatocarcinogen, produced DNA SB in the livers of both species. TCA, DCA, and MCA also failed to induce DNA strand breaks in splenocytes and epithelial cells derived from the stomach and duodenum of mice treated in vivo. None of the three chloroacetaldehydes induced DNA SB in either mouse or rat liver. The continuous exposure of mice to 5 g/L DCA in the drinking water for 7 and 14 days did not induce appreciable hepatic DNA SB (< 10% at 14 days), although peroxisome proliferation, as evidenced by an increased cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl CoA oxidase (PCO) activity, was stimulated to 490% (7 days) and 652% (14 days) of control. Under this protocol, DENA (0.1 g/L) produced DNA damage after both 7 days (73% of control) and 14 days (57% of control). Similarly, long-term exposure of rats (30 weeks) to 2 g/L DCA in the drinking water, a level that increased PCO activity to 364% of the control value, exhibited no DNA damage. Both the chloroacetic acids and the chloroacetaldehydes were ineffective in inducing DNA SB in cultured rat and mouse hepatocytes at concentrations below those that yielded cytotoxicity. The chloroacetic acids were also ineffective in the CCRF-CEM cells.

Virus induced B cell growth transformation in vitro is associated with the expression of a limited set of viral genes encoding six nuclear antigens (EBNA 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C and LP) and two latent membrane proteins (LMP 1, 2). Healthy virus carriers possess strong EBV specific CTL memory that can be reactivated in vitro. Here, we summarize experiments in which the antigenic specificities of these HLA class I restricted memory CTL responses have been mapped in a range of individuals with different HLA backgrounds. Of the known EBV latent proteins, EBNA 3A, 3B and 3C are frequently the dominant targets for such responses, but examples of responses directed against epitopes of EBNA 2, EBNA-LP or the LMP have been identified; by contrast, CTL responses against epitopes of EBNA 1 have not been observed. Epstein-Barr virus is associated with at least three malignancies of lymphoid origin--immunoblastic lymphomas of the immunosuppressed, endemic Burkitt's lymphoma and a subset of Hodgkin's disease. The immunoblastic lymphomas express the complete spectrum of EBV coded latent proteins and a cellular phenotype similar to that of in vitro transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines; accordingly, they remain sensitive to EBV specific CTL recognition. Endemic BL cells are not recognized by such CTL, and at least three consistent features of this tumour could contribute to immune escape: (a) allele specific downregulation of HLA class I antigen expression, (b) absence/low expression of cellular adhesion molecules and (c) restriction of EBV latent protein expression to EBNA 1 only. The relative importance of these three features of the BL cell phenotype with regard to sensitivity to CTL recognition is re-interpreted in the light of recent results. Finally, the pattern of virus latent protein expression in EBV positive Hodgkin's disease is described, and the possibility of EBV specific CTL control against this tumour is discussed.","['Rickinson, A B', 'Murray, R J', 'Brooks, J', 'Griffin, H', 'Moss, D J', 'Masucci, M G']","['Rickinson AB', 'Murray RJ', 'Brooks J', 'Griffin H', 'Moss DJ', 'Masucci MG']","['Department of Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*immunology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1992;13:53-80.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,79,,,,,,,,,,,,

The correlation between methylation status and rearrangement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain gene in leukemia cells obtained from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was examined. All of the AML patients with a TCR-beta rearrangement had hypomethylated CCGG sequences within the J beta 1 region on the rearranged allele, while the germline allele had completely methylated CCmeGG sequence in this region, indicating a strong association between hypomethylation status and rearrangement of the TCR beta chain gene. In the DNA from AML patients with or without a TCR-beta rearrangement, the C beta 2 region contained completely methylated CCmeGG sequences, even though they express T-cell-associated antigens, including CD7; this pattern is quite different from that observed in T-cell neoplasias.

The effects of GEN on cell proliferation and cell cycle kinetics of human myelogenous leukemia HL-60 and lymphocytic leukemia MOLT-4 cell cultures were studied, and the data were compared to results obtained with normal human lymphocytes stimulated to proliferate with phytohemagglutinin. GEN concentrations greater than 50 micrograms/ml (185 microM) were cytotoxic to HL-60 and MOLT-4 cells following exposure for 24 h; in HL-60 cell cultures, a population of cells with decreased DNA content and nuclear fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis was observed within 8 h. The 50% inhibition concentration after 24 h of exposure for HL-60 and MOLT-4 cells was 8.5 and 13.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Normal proliferating lymphocytes survived a 24-h exposure of up to 200 micrograms/ml GEN. Short-term (4-8 h) exposures of MOLT-4 or HL-60 cells to 5-20 micrograms/ml GEN resulted in a suppression of cell progression through S or through both S and G2 phases, respectively, while equivalent treatment had no effect on proliferating lymphocytes. A stathmokinetic experiment using MOLT-4 cells revealed that as little as 5 micrograms/ml GEN suppressed cell exit from S to G2 phase by 40%, with a terminal point of action at or near the S-G2 border. Cell progression through the very early portion of G1 phase (G1A, characterized by postmitotic chromatin decondensation) was also suppressed by approximately 40%, whereas cell advancement through the remainder of the G1 phase was not markedly affected. Longer (24 h) exposure of proliferating lymphocytes to 20 micrograms/ml GEN led to an S-phase arrest, while similar treatment of leukemic cells caused cell arrest in G2 phase and an increase in the number of cells entering the cycle at higher DNA ploidy. The mitogen-induced transition of lymphocytes from G0 to G1 phase was extremely sensitive to inhibition by GEN; the 50% inhibition concentration was 1.6 micrograms/ml. The chemotherapeutic value of GEN may be due to the fact that, in terms of cytotoxicity, this agent is more active against proliferating leukemic cells than against normal proliferating lymphocytes. The sensitivity of the G0 to G1 transition in normal lymphocyte cultures and the suppressive effect of GEN on the G1A exit in MOLT-4 cells both suggest that protein kinases involved in chromatin decondensation may be a target of this drug. In light of the observation that lymphocyte stimulation is sensitive to the presence of GEN, the drug is expected to be a strong immunosuppressant.","['Traganos, F', 'Ardelt, B', 'Halko, N', 'Bruno, S', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Traganos F', 'Ardelt B', 'Halko N', 'Bruno S', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Genistein', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1992/11/15 00:00,1992/11/15 00:01,['1992/11/15 00:00'],"['1992/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Nov 15;52(22):6200-8.,"['CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show considerable quantitative differences in the biological activity between TNF alpha and TNF beta depending on the type of target cell which has been used. TNF beta was 3 fold more cytotoxic than TNF alpha against murine L929 fibroblasts and 3-5 times more active concerning the induction of hemorrhagic tumor necrosis, complete tumor regression and more toxic in tumor-bearing mice. In contrast to this, TNF beta was markedly less cytotoxic against human capillary endothelial cells and the human mammary carcinoma cell line MCF7 and much less cytostatic against the human myeloid leukemia cell lines HL60 and U937. The lesser antiproliferative effect of TNF beta correlated with a lower ability for induction of differentiation in these cell lines. Competitive radioligand binding assays showed that TNF beta was about 4 fold more effective than TNF alpha in competing with 125I-labeled TNF alpha for the binding to murine L929 fibroblasts.

That work was done in HeLa cell lines that had stably integrated the regulated DT-A gene in a plasmid context. To increase the efficiency with which the HIV-regulated DT-A gene could be introduced into cells, we studied a recombinant, amphotropic murine leukemia virus containing the HIV-regulated DT-A transcription unit. Here we demonstrate that such recombinant retroviruses can be packaged, for both wild-type DT-A and an attenuated version, tox 176. In transient transfection assays, the proviral constructs exhibited similar basal and trans-activated levels of DT-A expression to the parental plasmids. Transduced H9 cells expressed the integrated DT-A gene upon transfection with plasmids encoding Tat and Rev, as assayed by decreased expression of a cotransfected luciferase reporter gene. Furthermore, the transduced H9 cells were substantially impaired in their ability to produce HIV, as demonstrated by p24 assays of culture supernatants following either transfection with an HIV proviral clone or infection with HIV-IIIB. These data demonstrate that basal expression of the regulated DT-A gene has been reduced to a tolerable level, both in packaging cells and transduced H9 cells. The use of HIV-regulated retroviruses encoding the highly lethal DT-A product may eventually be applicable as a gene therapy approach for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).","['Harrison, G S', 'Long, C J', 'Curiel, T J', 'Maxwell, F', 'Maxwell, I H']","['Harrison GS', 'Long CJ', 'Curiel TJ', 'Maxwell F', 'Maxwell IH']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Diphtheria Toxin/administration & dosage/genetics/*pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rev/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tat/metabolism', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV Core Protein p24/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1992.3.5-461 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1992 Oct;3(5):461-9. doi: 10.1089/hum.1992.3.5-461.,"['AI27096/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42354/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['DT-A'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The representativity of cell lines derived from the B cell differentiation lineage, however, is the most impressive. Human B-lymphoid cell lines are extensively used world wide as models in studies of various aspects of B cell biology and as tools in research on the etiology, pathogenesis and the biology of leukemia and lymphoma. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) carrying the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) are of particular importance. These lines can be established spontaneously from blood and lymphoid tissue from any EBV positive individual by special techniques, and from all individuals by EBV infection of peripheral blood B cells by EBV infection in vitro. At spontaneous establishment B cells, latently infected by EBV in vivo, will release EBV which subsequently infects normal EBV-negative B cells and immortalizes them into LCL cells, but direct outgrowth of the latently infected B cells as LCLs has also been documented. The target B cells for the EBV infection in vitro are not fully defined-most are mature B cells but also pro-B and pre-B and some B-blasts can be infected. Apart from their capacity for infinite growth, LCL cells have non-malignant properties, e. g. they are diploid, do not grow in agarose and do not form tumors upon inoculation subcutaneously in nude mice. LCLs have a phenotype corresponding to activated B cells (B-blasts) and have been used as ""the E. Coli"" of eukaryotic cells for about two decades. LCLs are derived at a high frequency also from tumor biopsies of EBV positive patients with leukemia and lymphoma. However, tumor cell lines are available from most of the B cell lineage-derived leukemias, B-lymphomas and myeloma. The frequency of successful establishment has been particularly high from EBV positive Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). From EBV genome negative BL and other B-lymphoma and B-leukemia biopsies the frequency of successful, spontaneous establishment is low (5-10%), and such lines have, with rare exceptions, been derived from pleural effusions and ascitis of patients with advanced, chemotherapy resistant, disease. Many of the cell lines therefore do not represent the clinically most common types of leukemia and lymphoma. No authentic malignant cell lines have been established from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) and Waldenstrom's disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Nilsson, K']",['Nilsson K'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Uppsala.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hum Cell. 1992 Mar;5(1):25-41.,,,,,,,122,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number as well as the shape of dendritic MHC class II+ cells from ear skin of C57BL/6 mice were similar in normal and infected animals. In mixed epidermal cell (EC) lymphocyte cultures, EC from infected mice and from normal mice stimulated allogeneic T cell proliferation to the same extent. In contrast to T cells from normal mice, however, T cells from infected mice did not respond to allogeneic spleen cells, confirming the presence of a T-cell defect in MAIDS. Subcutaneous injection of syngeneic mice with trinitrophenyl-modified MAIDS EC resulted in delayed ear swelling responses after challenge that were equivalent to those induced by hapten-modified EC from normal mice, suggesting that the contact sensitivity inducing potential of MAIDS LC was preserved. To investigate antigen presenting and processing function, EC and spleen cells were tested with the ovalbumin-specific IAb-restricted T cell hybridoma BO.17.10 and either ovalbumin 323-339 peptide or intact ovalbumin protein. MAIDS spleen cells had a reduced antigen presenting capacity compared with normal spleen cells, whereas EC from these mice showed the same processing and presenting capacity as normal controls. In summary, our results demonstrate that the frequency, morphology, level of MHC class II antigen expression and ability to process and present antigen is normal for LC from mice with MAIDS whereas the function of splenic T cells and APC from infected mice is significantly impaired.","['Cerny, A', 'Izui, S', 'Saurat, J H', 'Waldvogel, F A', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Hauser, C']","['Cerny A', 'Izui S', 'Saurat JH', 'Waldvogel FA', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Hauser C']","['Department of Medicine, Hopital Cantonal Universitaire, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Arch Dermatol Res,Archives of dermatological research,8000462,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*physiology', 'Dermatitis, Contact/etiology', 'Epidermis/*immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Spleen/*immunology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00375791 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dermatol Res. 1992;284(4):189-92. doi: 10.1007/BF00375791.,['N01-AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli UB5201 (pACYC184), and the gene encoding one beta-lactamase was transposed onto plasmid pACYC184 by exploiting a gene dosage effect. The transposable gene was found to encode a TEM-12 enzyme as determined by nucleotide sequencing. This gene was subsequently transposed onto plasmid pUB307. The transposable element encoding the TEM-12 enzyme has been designated Tn841. Both plasmids pACYC184::Tn841 and pUB307::Tn841 were shown to encode a beta-lactamase with the same isoelectric point and substrate profile as the TEM-12 beta-lactamase. Transposon Tn841, at approximately 7 kb, is larger than TnA (4.8 kb) and transposes at a lower frequency. Although it produced a resolvase which can complement the resolvase of Tn3, its transposase function was not able to complement the transposition of a TnA element which lacked transposase. The occurrence of a gene encoding an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase on a transposable element in a clinically significant bacterium is potentially a cause for concern for the spread of resistance to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins.","['Heritage, J', 'Hawkey, P M', 'Todd, N', 'Lewis, I J']","['Heritage J', 'Hawkey PM', 'Todd N', 'Lewis IJ']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Leeds, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Transposable Elements/physiology', 'DNA, Bacterial/biosynthesis', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Klebsiella/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plasmids', 'beta-Lactamases/biosynthesis/*genetics']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.36.9.1981 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1992 Sep;36(9):1981-6. doi: 10.1128/AAC.36.9.1981.,,,['tn841'],PMC192219,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M83279', 'GENBANK/M83280', 'GENBANK/M83281', 'GENBANK/M83282', 'GENBANK/M83283', 'GENBANK/M83284', 'GENBANK/M83285', 'GENBANK/M88143', 'GENBANK/X65253', 'GENBANK/X65254']",,,,,,

ADF is constitutively produced by human lymphoid cell lines transformed by human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). ADF augments the proliferation of HTLV-I and EBV transformed cells as an autocrine growth factor. These data are indicative of the possible involvement of ADF in virus-related transformation of cells and their autocrine growth. On the other hand, thioredoxin contains a redox active disulfide and has a reducing activity in the presence of thioredoxin reductase and NADPH. To clarify the role of ADF/thioredoxin system in the viral transformation, we tested the effect of 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA), which is a competitive inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase, on the growth of ADF high producing cells. The expression of IL-2R/alpha on HTLV-I (+) cells was suppressed by RA. RA dose-dependently reduced the cell number and viability of ADF high producing lymphoid cells. Moreover, it had a suppressive effect on the proliferation of ADF high producing cells. It is suggested that RA has an inhibitory effect on the activation and the growth of cells producing ADF and that inhibition of the ADF/thioredoxin system may be a new therapeutic approach for retrovirus-related disorders.","['Masutani, H', 'Nakamura, H', 'Ueda, Y', 'Kitaoka, Y', 'Kawabe, T', 'Iwata, S', 'Mitsui, A', 'Yodoi, J']","['Masutani H', 'Nakamura H', 'Ueda Y', 'Kitaoka Y', 'Kawabe T', 'Iwata S', 'Mitsui A', 'Yodoi J']","['Department of Biological Responses, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cytokines', 'HTLV-I Infections/therapy', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Retroviridae Infections/*therapy', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thioredoxins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4615-3434-1_27 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1992;319:265-74. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-3434-1_27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The level of integration but not the distribution of integration sites is sensitive to the stage in the SV40 life cycle at which MLV infection is performed. Using a temperature-sensitive tumor (T) antigen mutant SV40 strain, we observed that active replication of the target DNA is not required for efficient integration in vivo. The distribution of integration sites in vivo is closely approximately by in vitro reactions with isolated SV40 minichromosomes as integration targets.

In this study we evaluated the effects of the site-selective cAMP analog 8-chloroadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Cl-cAMP) on clonogenic growth of blast progenitors from 15 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia and 3 patients affected by advanced myelodysplastic syndrome. Leukemic blast progenitors undergo terminal divisions, giving rise to colonies in methylcellulose. The self-renewal capacity of blast progenitors is conversely reflected in a secondary methylcellulose assay after exponential growth of clonogenic cells in suspension cultures. In all the samples tested, 8-Cl-cAMP, at micromolar concentrations (0.1-50 microM), suppressed in a dose-dependent manner both primary colony formation in methylcellulose and the recovery of clonogenic cells from suspension culture. Strikingly, in the samples from the entire group of patients, 8-Cl-cAMP was more effective in inhibiting the self-renewing clonogenic cells than the terminally dividing blast cells (P = 0.005). In addition, in four out of six cases studied, 8-Cl-cAMP was able to induce a morphologic and/or immunophenotypic maturation of leukemic blasts. An evident reduction of RI levels in fresh leukemic cells after exposure to 8-Cl-cAMP was also detected. Our results showing that 8-Cl-cAMP is a powerful inhibitor of clonogenic growth of leukemic blast progenitors by primarily suppressing their self-renewal capacity indicate that this site-selective cAMP analog represents a promising biological agent for acute myeloblastic leukemia therapy in humans.","['Pinto, A', 'Aldinucci, D', 'Gattei, V', 'Zagonel, V', 'Tortora, G', 'Budillon, A', 'Cho-Chung, Y S']","['Pinto A', 'Aldinucci D', 'Gattei V', 'Zagonel V', 'Tortora G', 'Budillon A', 'Cho-Chung YS']","['Leukemia Unit, Istituti Nazionali di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Receptors, Cyclic AMP)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', ""31966-52-6 (8-azidoadenosine-3',5'-monophosphate)"", 'BQ94Z7E5OR (8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Affinity Labels/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azides/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.19.8884 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Oct 1;89(19):8884-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.19.8884.,,,,PMC50028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the documented involvement of second messengers produced by the PI pathway in RBL cell exocytosis, recent evidence has suggested that additional signalling events are also necessary. We have, therefore, examined PLA2 activation and AA metabolite production by these cells in response to Ag stimulation, and evaluated the potential role of these in activating degranulation. The time course and antigen dose dependence for release of AA and its metabolites were comparable to those for degranulation and production of inositol phosphates (InsPs) when examined in parallel. Stimulated fatty acid release was highly selective for AA (compared with oleic or linoleic acids) and appeared to result predominantly from PLA2 activation. AA released upon antigen stimulation is rapidly metabolized to produce prostaglandin and leukotrienes. These are not required for activating degranulation, since BW755c completely inhibited AA metabolite production without affecting AA release, degranulation or InsP production. In contrast, the PLA2 inhibitors quinacrine and quercetin inhibited both AA release and degranulation in parallel, without significantly affecting levels of InsP production, and this inhibition could be partially reversed by exogenous addition of AA and lysophospholipid. These results demonstrate that activation of IgE-receptor mediated exocytosis of RBL cells does not require AA metabolites, and strongly suggest that PLA2 activation and release of AA and lysophospholipid may be involved in triggering this response.","[""O'Rourke, A M"", 'Mescher, M F', 'Apgar, J R']","[""O'Rourke AM"", 'Mescher MF', 'Apgar JR']","['Division of Membrane Biology, Medical Biology Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '66000-40-6 (4,5-Dihydro-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-amine)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)']",IM,"['4,5-Dihydro-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-amine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antigens/*pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Degranulation/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Fatty Acids/biosynthesis', 'Inositol Phosphates/biosynthesis', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/biosynthesis', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Quercetin/pharmacology', 'Quinacrine/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Time Factors']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(92)90166-u [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1992 Nov;29(11):1299-308. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(92)90166-u.,"['R01 AI26950/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM42388/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore determined the relationship between the nuclear factors that bind to the TCR delta and Moloney murine leukemia virus core motifs. On the basis of electrophoretic mobility shift binding and competition studies, biochemical analysis of affinity-labeled DNA-binding proteins, and the binding of a purified core binding factor, the proteins that bound to the TCR delta core site were indistinguishable from those that bound to the murine leukemia virus core site.

In these studies, we have examined the effect of CD28 signal transduction on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) promoter activity. Stimulation of CD28 in the presence of TCR-like signals increases the activity of the GM-CSF, IL-3, and IFN-gamma promoters by three- to sixfold. As previously demonstrated for the IL-2 promoter, the IL-3 and GM-CSF promoters contain distinct elements of similar sequence which specifically bind a CD28-induced nuclear complex. Mutation of the CD28 response elements in the IL-3 and GM-CSF promoters abrogates the CD28-induced activity without affecting phorbol ester- and calcium ionophore-induced activity. UV cross-linking indicates that the CD28-induced nuclear complex contains polypeptides of approximately 35, 36, and 44 kDa. These studies indicate that the TCR and CD28-regulated signal transduction pathways coordinately regulate the transcription of several lymphokines and that the influence of CD28 signals on transcription is mediated by a common complex.","['Fraser, J D', 'Weiss, A']","['Fraser JD', 'Weiss A']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD28 Antigens', 'DNA', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphokines/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.12.10.4357-4363.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Oct;12(10):4357-63. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.10.4357-4363.1992.,['GM-44493-01A2/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC360359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This antigen, termed MKW, was also detected on the surface of the monocytic cell line U937, but not on the K562, ML1, or HL-60 cell lines. On normal hematopoietic cells, the antigen is expressed on the surface of monocytic and myelocytic cells and on a subpopulation of B-cells. During normal hematopoiesis, the surface expression of MKW is greatest and occurs very early on monocytic cells. Alternatively, in myeloid cells, surface expression occurs later and cell maturation is correlated with increased surface expression. When U937 cells are induced to differentiate, surface expression is transiently up-regulated. Surface expression of MKW, however, does not appear to be an activation antigen since activation of purified T- or B-cells failed to increase MKW on the cell surface. Leukemic blasts from 22 of 80 children (27%) with acute myeloblastic leukemia and from 29 of 225 children (13%) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia expressed MKW on the cell surface. Although surface expression of MKW was absent on T-cell lines, peripheral T-cells, and most B-cells, the antigen was identified in the cytoplasm of some B-cells, T-cells, and cell lines. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that MKW is a 52-kDa protein whether expressed on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm, and it appears to be nonglycosylated. Furthermore, studies with phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C suggested that MKW is not attached to a glycolipid anchor. The biochemical characterization of MKW and its pattern of expression are distinct from any of the previously identified CD groups or published antigens. Since this unique antigen has prognostic significance in leukemia and appears to be associated with cell differentiation, its exact role in hematopoiesis should be investigated.","['Koehler, M', 'Fitzgerald, T J', 'Goorha, R M', 'Kitchingman, G', 'Downing, J', 'Mirro, J Jr']","['Koehler M', 'Fitzgerald TJ', 'Goorha RM', 'Kitchingman G', 'Downing J', 'Mirro J Jr']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (MKW antigen)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/chemistry/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",1992/10/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/10/11 19:15'],"['1992/10/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/10/11 19:15 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Oct;6(10):985-92.,"['CA 01429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results presented demonstrate that TCR delta rearrangements in LP-ALL are incomplete, immature, and involve V delta 2 to D delta 3 or D delta 2 to D delta 3 joints. These rearrangements are found in most cases of ALL. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that these leukemias originate in multipotent lymphoid precursor cells. The remarkable diversity of the rearrangements detected by polymerase chain reaction, cloning and sequencing demonstrates the clonal specificity and potential for detection of leukemic residual disease. However, in some cases the number of nucleotide differences may not be sufficient for the discrimination of leukemic and non-leukemic cells carrying V delta 2-(D)-D delta 3 rearrangements. A novel inversional rearrangement was demonstrated in one leukemia.

Large quantities of hyaluronate and of sulfated GAGs accumulated in the extracellular matrix of infected spleens, as shown by histoimmunoassay and alcian blue staining, respectively. The splenic GAGs were either labeled with 35S-sulfate injected in vivo or unlabeled. The spleens were fractionated to separate hematopoietic cells from the stromal component containing extracellular matrix material and fibroblasts, and the GAGs were extracted from each fraction. Specific degradative treatments and electrophoresis indicated that sulfated GAGs were mostly chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate. Three hours after in vivo injection of 35S-sulfate, the amount of 35S-GAGs was increased approximately fivefold per mg stromal proteins. The bulk of these 35S-GAGs (70%) was recovered in the stromal fraction. The higher amount of sulfated GAGs in leukemic spleen was due both to the presence of more producer cells (infected fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells) and to a stimulation of GAG synthesis per cell, as evidenced 35S-labeling in in vitro experiments. Chondroitin sulfate was the main sulfated GAG present in the culture medium of both hematopoietic and fibroblastic cells and in the pericellular material released by trypsin from fibroblastic cells. High amounts of chondroitin sulfate, which has a possible role in the detachment of hematopoietic cells from the stromal cells, may favour the release of hematopoietic cells from the spleen into the peripheral blood. Heparan sulfate was produced by fibroblastic cells and it was principally present in their pericellular material. Considering the capacity of heparan sulfate to retain cytokines, as demonstrated by others in vitro, large amounts of heparan sulfate may result in the retention of large amounts of the cytokines, which production is enhanced in the infected spleen. This phenomenon may contribute to promote the hematopoietic stem cell proliferation characteristic of the MPSV-induced myeloproliferative disease.","['Smadja-Joffe, F', 'Moczar, M', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles, C', 'Delpech, B', 'Leibovitch, M P', 'Dufour, F', 'Jasmin, C']","['Smadja-Joffe F', 'Moczar M', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles C', 'Delpech B', 'Leibovitch MP', 'Dufour F', 'Jasmin C']","[""Unite d'Oncogenese Appliquee, INSERM U268, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Sulfates)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Glycosaminoglycans/*biosynthesis', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hyaluronic Acid/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proviruses/chemistry', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Sulfates/metabolism']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Oct;6(10):1011-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the pairwise integration reaction catalyzed by purified avian retrovirus integrase by measuring the response to solution parameters and how the sequences of the viral termini, which comprise the avian imperfect inverted repeat, affect the reaction. When we optimized the reaction, an efficiency was achieved which approached that measured in systems using cytoplasmic extracts from virus-infected cells. The response of purified avian integrase to solution parameters was similar to that of the integration activity derived from cellular extracts. For strand transfer, the U3 viral terminal sequences were preferred to those of the U5 termini, a result we previously showed for the trimming reaction. That the sequence preference was the same for trimming and strand transfer may be further evidence that only one catalytic site is used for both reactions. A significant number of integration sites were sequenced. Interesting trends were found for the fidelity of the host duplications to the avian 6-bp duplication size, the clustering of the integration sites in the nonessential region of the lambda host DNA, and the sequence characteristics of the duplication sites.","['Fitzgerald, M L', 'Vora, A C', 'Zeh, W G', 'Grandgenett, D P']","['Fitzgerald ML', 'Vora AC', 'Zeh WG', 'Grandgenett DP']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, St. Louis University Medical Center, Missouri 63110.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA Transposable Elements/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'Integrases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Nucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Substrate Specificity', '*Virus Integration']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.11.6257-6263.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Nov;66(11):6257-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.11.6257-6263.1992.,['CA16312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC240116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virus-infected mice were examined for the ability to resist acute infection and to control chronic infection with the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, a major opportunistic pathogen of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Mice infected with the retroviruses for 2 or 4 weeks responded normally to challenge with the parasite, but mice inoculated with the protozoan 8 or 12 weeks after viral infection died with acute disease due to T. gondii. Increased sensitivity to acute infection was associated with a reduced ability to produce gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and with established changes in CD4+ T-cell function. Mice latently infected with T. gondii and then inoculated with the retrovirus mixture were found to reactivate the parasite infection, with 30 to 40% of dually infected animals dying between 5 and 16 weeks after viral infection. Reactivation was associated with reduced proliferation and impaired production of IFN-gamma in response to stimulation with soluble T. gondii antigens or to concanavalin A. Continuing resistance to lethal reactivation in the remaining mice was shown to require CD8+ T cells and expression of IFN-gamma. In addition, it was found that chronic infection with T. gondii altered the course of MAIDS by inhibiting the progression of splenomegaly and immunodeficiency and reducing the expression of both the helper and etiologic defective viruses. These results support previous studies which indicate that infection with T. gondii is controlled by synergistic interactions between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the functions of which are progressively impaired during the course of MAIDS.","['Gazzinelli, R T', 'Hartley, J W', 'Fredrickson, T N', 'Chattopadhyay, S K', 'Sher, A', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Gazzinelli RT', 'Hartley JW', 'Fredrickson TN', 'Chattopadhyay SK', 'Sher A', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Immunology and Cell Biology Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'CD8 Antigens/physiology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Immunity', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/*immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Toxoplasmosis, Animal/complications/*immunology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/iai.60.10.4394-4401.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Infect Immun. 1992 Oct;60(10):4394-401. doi: 10.1128/iai.60.10.4394-4401.1992.,,,,PMC257477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both O2- and H2O2 exhibited two different modes of cytotoxic actions depending on their exposure rates: At a high exposure rate (4.3 nmol of O2-/mL/min), M10 was more sensitive to O2- than L5178Y normal type cell, in agreement with the case of X-rays; while at a low exposure rate (five times less than the high exposure rate), M10 became more resistant than L5178Y. Similar results were obtained with H2O2. Reactive species responsible for these two different cytotoxic actions were examined with special reference to the metal-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction, by using a metal chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline, and an .OH scavenger, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Significant protection by 1,10-phenanthroline was observed, which indicates the presence of a metal-dependent process in both cytotoxic actions. DMSO showed a marked protective effect, except for the case of M10 exposed at the low exposure rate, in which DMSO showed no protection. The resistance of M10 to O2- and H2O2 observed at the low exposure rate suggests the possibility that reactive species other than .OH are involved in the cytotoxicity.","['Ito, A', 'Shinohara, K']","['Ito A', 'Shinohara K']","['Department of Radiation Research, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'W4X6ZO7939 (1,10-phenanthroline)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*pharmacology', 'Superoxides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Rays']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0891-5849(92)90177-I [pii]', '10.1016/0891-5849(92)90177-i [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1992 Oct;13(4):299-304. doi: 10.1016/0891-5849(92)90177-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, a Wilms' tumor cell line, a retinoblastoma cell line, and a nondifferentiated teratocarcinoma cell line expressed FLT4, whereas differentiated teratocarcinoma cells were negative. Most fetal tissues also expressed the FLT4 mRNA, with spleen, brain intermediate zone, and lung showing the highest levels.

In the present work, we have applied this type of methylation analysis to primary leukemia myeloid cell samples. We found that expression of MPO messenger RNA (mRNA) is grossly limited to leukemias of late myeloblastic and promyelocytic stages; expression is thus associated with progressive demethylation in the 5' region of the MPO gene. This modification was not global. Low-level induction of MPO mRNA expression in very immature leukemic cells using phorbol ester was not accompanied by progressive demethylation.

In the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line, this RA-induced granulocytic differentiation appears to be directly mediated through the RA receptor (RAR-alpha). We have previously identified a mutant subclone of HL-60 (designated HL-60R) that exhibits relative resistance to RA and that harbors RA receptors with markedly reduced affinity for RA. In the present study, we have now identified the genetic basis for this aberrant RA receptor activity. DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA products corresponding to the RAR-alpha ligand-binding domain shows a point mutation in RAR-alpha codon 411 in this mutant HL-60R subclone. This specific C-->T mutation generates a termination codon resulting in the truncation of 52 amino acids at the COOH terminal end of RAR-alpha. In cotransfection studies, expression vectors harboring this mutated RAR-alpha exhibit dominant negative activity with respect to the trans-activating function of the normal RAR-alpha.

However, the dysregulation of additional genes appears to be required for transition to the acute leukemic phase, as inferred by the appearance of recurrent secondary cytogenetic abnormalities in the majority of patients. To determine whether the expression of p210bcr/abl alone is responsible for this genetic instability, we introduced and expressed the bcr/abl gene from a retroviral vector in a clone of the interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependent myeloblastic 32D C13(G) cell line. Clonal and polyclonal cells transformed to IL-3 independent growth were observed for a period extending up to 6 months for changes in the expression of p210bcr/abl, cell proliferation, inhibition by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), forskolin, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analogues, regulation of the cell cycle, and karyotype. Whereas the properties of control vector infected 32D C13(G)' cells remained stable over time, cells expressing p210bcr/abl were phenotypically unstable. In cells expressing p210bcr/abl, we observed selective modulation of p210bcr/abl mRNA and protein expression, evolution from partial to full abrogation of IL-3 dependence, reduced serum requirements, increased cell proliferation, decreased inhibition by PGE1 and cAMP analogues, and the appearance of new structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities with successive cell passages. These results indicate that expression of p210bcr/abl can directly predispose 32D C13(G)' cells to genetic instability, promotes the emergence of clones with an increased proliferative advantage, and may represent an in vitro model suitable for the study of mechanisms underlying progression to the acute leukemic phase in CML.","['Laneuville, P', 'Sun, G', 'Timm, M', 'Vekemans, M']","['Laneuville P', 'Sun G', 'Timm M', 'Vekemans M']","['Department of Medicine, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Phosphotransferases/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Simplexvirus/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Transfection']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67545-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Oct 1;80(7):1788-97.,,,"['bcr', 'c-abl', 'neo', 'ts']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of tissues from other inbred strains of mice as well as the wild mouse, Mus musculus musculus, showed a similar pattern of tissue expression. EPI-EPS expression was also highly androgen regulated in both the reproductive and nonreproductive tissues of the C57BL/6 strain. However, a differential response to testosterone replacement was observed between tissues. Expression of EPI-EPS mRNA in the epididymis and vas deferens exhibited only a partial recovery to precastration levels after testosterone replacement; in the kidney and submandibular gland there was a complete recovery of EPI-EPS expression. Finally, EPI-EPS expression was also highly restricted in the female tissues, with expression limited to the oviduct and uterus. EPI-EPS, however, was not estrogen regulated in the female. These results suggest that a proviral sequence, EPI-EPS, is expressed in M. m. musculus and several inbred strains of mice due to its integration near a highly tissue-specific and androgen-regulated genetic locus.","['Cornwall, G A', 'Orgebin-Crist, M C', 'Hann, S R']","['Cornwall GA', 'Orgebin-Crist MC', 'Hann SR']","['Center for Reproductive Biology Research, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Androgens/physiology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Epididymis/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genitalia/*microbiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Ovarian Follicle/microbiology', 'Proviruses/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Uterus/microbiology', 'Vas Deferens/microbiology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1095/biolreprod47.4.665 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Reprod. 1992 Oct;47(4):665-75. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod47.4.665.,"['HD03820/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD07376/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukocyte counts, cortisol, and ACTH were determined at 30-min intervals between 4 p.m. and midnight. Profiles were determined the day before and on day 1 of TNF therapy. Leukocyte numbers decreased 30 min after start of TNF administration and increased 30-60 min later with a rebound until the next TNF application. The increase of leukocyte counts was due mostly to neutrophil granulocytes. ACTH levels increased 30 min, cortisol 60 min, and leukocyte counts 90 min after start of TNF infusion. Metopirone, an inhibitor of cortisol synthesis given to one patient, suppressed the TNF-induced stimulation of cortisol secretion and subsequent increase of leukocyte counts, while ACTH blood levels were enhanced.

A similar application of prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients undergoing therapy for small cell anaplastic carcinoma of the lung has been noted to decrease CNS relapse from approximately 25% to approximately 5%. However, CNS toxicity has been noted to occur with CNS prophylaxis. We can reduce the incidence of CNS toxicity by using modern treatment schedules and avoiding the use of doxorubicin with irradiation. Prophylactic cranial irradiation delivered to those patients who obtain a complete remission in response to induction chemotherapy can reduce the incidence of CNS relapse and can usually be delivered with minimal CNS toxicity. Unfortunately, long-term disease control with systemic agents is poor.

Chimeric viruses were constructed by replacement of fragments of FeLV-C envelope genes into the FeLV-A prototype virus 61E. Using a modified vesicular stomatitis virus-FeLV pseudotype assay, we demonstrated that the subgroup C receptor specificity for each virus was determined by changes within the N-terminal 87-92 amino acids of SU, in which most changes occurred within the 15- to 20-amino-acid first variable region (V1).

Despite the consistent localization of biological determinants, the only consistent features that distinguished the deduced FeLV-A and FeLV-C proteins was one lysine-to-arginine change and a structural prediction of an alpha-helix in FeLV-A proteins versus random coil in FeLV-C proteins within V1. However, arginine in equilibrium with lysine substitutions were not sufficient to convert the subgroup A virus to the subgroup C phenotype or vice versa. Thus, certain distinct structural changes within the N-terminal region of FeLV SU can result in convergent viral phenotypes.","['Brojatsch, J', 'Kristal, B S', 'Viglianti, G A', 'Khiroya, R', 'Hoover, E A', 'Mullins, J I']","['Brojatsch J', 'Kristal BS', 'Viglianti GA', 'Khiroya R', 'Hoover EA', 'Mullins JI']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305-5402.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Anemia/*microbiology/veterinary', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', '*Genes, env', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.18.8457 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Sep 15;89(18):8457-61. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.18.8457.,['CA48594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC49939,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M89998', 'GENBANK/M89999']",,,,,,

Basal DNA synthesis of the early differentiated T-cell lines HSB2 and HUT78, as well as the B-cell line REH, could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both monoclonal antibodies against IGF-I (ASC41) and antibodies against the IGF-I receptor (alpha-IR3), suggesting that IGF-I acts as an auto- or paracrine growth factor for these cells via the IGF-I receptor. From these cells HUT78 and REH secreted IGF-I into cell culture medium. DNA synthesis of the further differentiated T-cell lines CEM and MOLT3 was inhibited by alpha-IR3 and antibodies directed against the insulin receptor (RPN.538) and against insulin (RPN.1661). These results suggest that insulin via the IGF-I receptor or insulin receptor can function as an autocrine or paracrine growth factor in these T-ALLs. Proliferation of the most differentiated T-ALL Jurkat and JMP was inhibited only by alpha-IR3 and 2C2, an antibody directed against the IGF-II receptor, suggesting that IGF-I or IGF-II acting via the IGF-I receptor or IGF-II receptor may be involved in proliferation of these cell lines.

The mechanism by which these viruses transform lymphocytes is not clear. Previous studies have implicated either integrational activation of proto-oncogenes, chronic autocrine immune stimulation, and/or autocrine stimulation of growth factor receptors (e.g., interleukin 2 receptors) via binding of the viral env glycoprotein (gp70) to these receptors. Any one of these events could also involve activation of second messenger signaling pathways in the cell. We examined whether infection with oncogenic AKR-247 MCF MuLV induced transmembrane signaling cascades in thymocytes of AKR mice. Cyclic AMP levels were not changed, but there was enhanced turnover of phosphatidylinositol phosphates, with concomitant increases in diacyglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate. Thus, phospholipase C activity was increased. Protein kinase C activity was also elevated in comparison to that in uninfected thymocytes. The above events occurred in parallel with MCF expression in the thymus and were chronically maintained thereafter. No changes in phospholipid turnover occurred in an organ which did not replicate the MCF virus (spleen) or in thymocytes of AKR mice infected with a thymotropic, nononcogenic MCF virus (AKV-1-C36). Therefore, only the oncogenic MCF virus induced phosphatidylinositol signal transduction. Flow cytometric comparison of cell surface gp70 revealed that AKR-247 MCF virus-infected thymocytes expressed more MCF virus gp70 than did thymocytes from AKV-1-C36 MCF virus-infected mice, suggesting that certain threshold quantities of MCF virus env glycoproteins may be involved in this signaling. This type of signal transduction is not induced by stimulation of the interleukin 2 receptor but is involved in certain oncogene systems (e.g., ras and fms). Its chronic induction by oncogenic MCF MuLV may thus initiate thymocyte transformation.","['al-Salameh, A M', 'Cloyd, M W']","['al-Salameh AM', 'Cloyd MW']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Viral', 'Inositol Phosphates/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Second Messenger Systems', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*microbiology']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.10.6125-6132.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Oct;66(10):6125-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.10.6125-6132.1992.,,,,PMC241490,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis to determine the hematopoietic phenotypes of tumor cells induced by a number of MuLVs. Tumor cells induced by ecotropic Moloney, amphotropic 4070A, and 10A1 MuLVs and by two chimeric MuLVs, Mo(4070A) and Mo(10A1), were examined with antibodies to 13 lineage-specific cell surface markers found on myeloid cell, T-cell, and B-cell lineages. The chimeric Mo(4070A) and Mo(10A1) MuLVs, consisting of Moloney MuLV with the carboxy half of the Pol region and nearly all of the Env region of 4070A and 10A1, respectively, were constructed to examine the possible influence of these sequences on Moloney MuLV-induced tumor cell phenotypes. In some instances, these phenotypic analyses were supplemented by Southern blot analysis for lymphoid cell-specific genomic DNA rearrangements at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain, the T-cell receptor gamma, and the T-cell receptor beta loci. The results of our analysis showed that Moloney MuLV, 4070A, Mo(4070A), and Mo(10A1) induced mostly T-cell tumors. Moloney MuLV and Mo(4070A) induced a wide variety of T-cell phenotypes, ranging from immature to mature phenotypes, while 4070A induced mostly prothymocyte and double-negative (CD4- CD8-) T-cell tumors. The tumor phenotypes obtained with 10A1 and Mo(10A1) were each less variable than those obtained with the other MuLVs tested. 10A1 uniformly induced a tumor consisting of lineage marker-negative cells that lack lymphoid cell-specific DNA rearrangements and histologically appear to be early undifferentiated erythroid cell-like precursors. The Mo(10A1) chimera consistently induced an intermediate T-cell tumor. The chimeric constructions demonstrated that while 4070A 3' pol and env sequences apparently did not influence the observed tumor cell phenotypes, the 10A1 half of pol and env had a strong effect on the phenotypes induced by Mo(10A1) that resulted in a phenotypic consistency not seen with other viruses.

Inhibition of productive infection is closely paralleled by reduced accumulation of integrated proviral DNA as well as by reduced levels of linear viral DNA in a cytoplasmic fraction. Nevertheless, viral DNA is present at nearly normal levels in a nuclear fraction, and total amounts of viral DNA are only mildly affected in restrictive infections, suggesting a block in integration to account for reduced levels of proviral DNA. However, integrase (IN)-dependent trimming of 3' ends of viral DNA occurs normally in vivo during restrictive infections, demonstrating that not all IN-mediated events are prevented in vivo. Furthermore, viral integration complexes present in nuclear extracts of infected restrictive cells are fully competent to integrate their DNA into a heterologous target in vitro.

Human ABM cells carry out purging of leukemia without loss of progenitor cell activity in vitro. The purging ability of ABM can be augmented by interleukin-1, interferon, and tumor necrosis factor. IL-2 therapy stimulates the veto suppressor cell activity of T cell-depleted BM, and has reduced GVHD and permitted engraftment of mismatched allogeneic BM in murine models.

One patient (1%) with evaluable disease showed improvement. There was only one partial response in the PS 2 patients. Performance status was a predictive factor for response or improvement (p = 0.0368). A high incidence (74%) of severe or life-threatening hematologic toxicity and fatal sepsis in four patients was a reflection of the intensity of the chemotherapeutic regime. The median survival from study entry was 7.4 months. Thirty-seven percent of the patients survived beyond 1 year; the median survival for the PS 0-1 patients was 11.7 months for the PS 2 patients, 4.1 months. Median time to treatment failure was 3.9 months, but treatment had not failed in 9% of the patients after 1 year, all of whom were PS 0-1 at time of study entry. Although the response rate with this dose-intensive chemotherapy regimen was disappointing, the median survival of PS 0-1 patients was equivalent to that of Stage III NSCLC patients in prior CALGB studies. In patients with NSCLC who are treated with chemotherapy, PS may be as important a prognostic factor as stage, when median survival is used as an endpoint.","['Lyss, A P', 'Perry, M C', 'Goutsou, M', 'Propert, K', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Mason-Coughlin, K', 'Green, M R']","['Lyss AP', 'Perry MC', 'Goutsou M', 'Propert K', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Mason-Coughlin K', 'Green MR']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Lebanon, New Hampshire.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000421-199210000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1992 Oct;15(5):399-404. doi: 10.1097/00000421-199210000-00003.,"['CA-11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that gene expression of the alpha 3 isoform of Na+,K(+)-ATPase, which encodes an ouabain-inhibitable Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity, significantly declines during the first 24 hours of granulocytic differentiation by DMSO of HL60 cells. The more common alpha 1 isoform decreases, but more gradually over 72 hours of DMSO induction. Loss of alpha 3 and alpha 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) are due to changes in mRNA decay; their transcription is not altered. alpha 3 mRNA half-life is 3 hours in HL60 cells; upon induction by 16 hours of DMSO, it decreases to approximately 2 hours. alpha 1 transcripts are less sensitive to DMSO induction, with their half-life being 3.5 hours in HL60 cells; upon induction, their half-life decreases to 3 hours. Experiments measuring protein stability confirm that alpha 3 protein is more labile than alpha 1. In uninduced HL60 cells, alpha 3 membrane protein comprises 30% of the total alpha isoforms, and is less stable than alpha 1, with a protein half-life of only 9 hours. Upon DMSO induction, steady-state alpha 3 protein decreases markedly within 10 hours, whereas alpha 1 protein remains stable. These results show that posttranscriptional changes during induction play a major role in the differential regulation of alpha 1 and alpha 3 isoforms of Na+,K(+)-ATPase; regulation of the latter may be important for early granulocytic differentiation, or for one of the differentiated functions of mature granulocytes.","['Chambers, S K', 'Gilmore-Hebert, M', 'Kacinski, B M', 'Benz, E J Jr']","['Chambers SK', 'Gilmore-Hebert M', 'Kacinski BM', 'Benz EJ Jr']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Stability', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/standards', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology']",1992/09/25 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/09/25 19:15'],"['1992/09/25 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/09/25 19:15 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67582-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 15;80(6):1559-64.,"['5-K12-HD 00849/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '5-P30-CA16359-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoid tumors induced by one recombinant, M-MuLV(myc), containing the v-myc oncogene from the avian MC29 retrovirus consistently reestablished in the thymus and spleen of recipient mice. Since tumors in the recipient thymus and spleen could have arisen by infection of host cells, or could reflect an expansion of a minor subpopulation from the donor tumor, we verified the donor and clonal origin of these tumors by Southern blot analysis using a virus-specific probe. As few as 500 of these tumor cells could migrate to the thymus via the blood and flourish in that microenvironment. In contrast, the majority of tumors induced by wild type M-MuLV or two other M-MuLV recombinants not containing v-myc sequences, inefficiently reestablished in the thymus of recipient mice following i.v. inoculation, although splenic tumors developed. These tumors could, however, multiply within the recipient thymus when inoculated intrathymically. Thus, the inability of tumors induced by wild type M-MuLV or M-MuLV recombinants lacking v-myc to reestablish in the thymus following i.v. inoculation appears to reflect inefficient 'thymic homing' rather than the ability to grow in the thymic microenvironment. Collectively, our data suggest that the thymic homing ability of M-MuLV(myc)-induced tumor cells is related to the presence of v-myc sequences or to the cell type transformed by M-MuLV(myc). Thus, we suggest that these cells may provide a useful model for studying how blood-borne metastatic cells, and possibly normal lymphocytes, enter the thymus by way of the microvasculature.","['Spencer, R H', 'Brightman, B K', 'Trepp, D J', 'Fan, H', 'Chandy, K G']","['Spencer RH', 'Brightman BK', 'Trepp DJ', 'Fan H', 'Chandy KG']","['Department of Microbiology, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Thymus,Thymus,8009032,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', '*Genes, myc', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Mice', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*etiology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Thymus. 1992 Aug;20(1):47-61.,['AI 24783/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,['v-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the TcR delta gene is useful in evaluating clonality for the most immature T-cell neoplasms, not showing rearrangement of the other TcR genes.

The treatment of the nuclear extract containing PEBP2 with phosphatase generated PEBP3, which is a subcomponent of PEBP2 and retained the same DNA-binding specificity as PEBP2. The altered mobility of hematopoietic cell-derived or T lymphocyte-derived PEBP2 was found to be due to the alteration of the mobility of PEBP3.

To further define the receptors' roles, we studied how monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against each receptor affected TNF-induced cellular responses. HTR-9, an MoAb against the type B (low affinity, 55 Kd) receptor, reproduced all of these effects in a dose-dependent manner. UTR-1, an MoAb against the type A (high affinity, 75 Kd) receptor, had no effect in saturating doses, but supersaturating doses enhanced DNA fragmentation threefold. TNF and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) synergistically induced morphologic differentiation and monocytic antigen expression, while the antitype B receptor MoAb was synergistic for morphologic response, but not antigen expression. Our results indicate that (1) the type B receptor mediates some responses to TNF in HL-60 and U937 cells, (2) the type A receptor does not stimulate these responses, (3) the TNF molecule is not necessary for some of these actions, and (4) TNF-induced morphologic changes and surface antigen expression in HL-60 cells may be regulated by separate postreceptor pathways.","['Greenblatt, M S', 'Elias, L']","['Greenblatt MS', 'Elias L']","['University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque 87131-5636.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67631-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 1;80(5):1339-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This molecule is a heterodimer comprising an antigen-inducible component, the Tac chain (P55). Activation of T lymphocytes also generates a soluble form of this P55 called S-IL-2R. S-IL-2R is elevated in many T-cell-related pathologies (leukemia, autoimmunity, etc.). In graft recipients, rejection is a result of T-cell activation by graft antigens and therefore might induce a release of S-IL-2R in the circulation; this parameter is now said to be a good indicator of rejection. We have performed a study in renal graft recipients in order to assess the usefulness of circulating S-IL-2R particularly to discriminate the origin of renal failure in cases of rejection or of cyclosporin-A (CsA)-induced nephrotoxicity. We demonstrated that there are no differences between isolated values in the clinical groups at the time of diagnosis. Variations in S-IL-2R are increased compared to steady-state periods during rejection and cytomegalovirus infections, although not in CsA toxicity episodes. However, at the individual level there are too many false-positive and false-negative results, making this parameter no more meaningful than serum creatinine levels alone or even in association (as tested in logistic discriminant analysis). In addition, it seems that the variations in S-IL-2R are partly related to renal function itself, as suggested by the correlation between S-IL-2R levels and serum creatinine levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Trochu, J N', 'Denis, M', 'Auget, J L', 'Giral, M', 'Jacques, Y', 'Soulillou, J P', 'Le Mauff, B']","['Trochu JN', 'Denis M', 'Auget JL', 'Giral M', 'Jacques Y', 'Soulillou JP', 'Le Mauff B']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM U211, Unite de Recherche sur les Effecteurs Lymphocytaires T), Plateau Technique, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Transpl Int,Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,8908516,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cyclosporine/adverse effects', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology/immunology', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects', 'Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Solubility', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00336599 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Int. 1992 Jul;5(3):145-50. doi: 10.1007/BF00336599.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To isolate the protein kinase which stimulates this phosphorylation, we have used heparin-Sepharose chromatography followed by affinity chromatography over glutathione-Sepharose beads bound with a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and amino acids 5-89 of c-Jun (GST-c-Jun). Using this procedure we purify a 67-kDa protein which is capable of phosphorylating GST-c-Jun as well as the complete c-Jun protein. By making mutations in serines 63 and 73 and then creating a fusion protein with GST (GST-c-Jun mut), we demonstrate that this protein kinase specifically phosphorylates these sites in the c-Jun amino terminus. Treatment of purified c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase (cJAT-PK) with phosphatase 2A inhibits its ability to phosphorylate GST-c-Jun. This inactivated enzyme can be reactivated by phosphorylation with protein kinase C (PKC), although PKC is not capable of phosphorylating the GST-c-Jun substrate. Because v-Jun cannot be phosphorylated in vivo, we compared the ability of cJAT-PK to bind to GST-v-Jun or GST-c-Jun mut. The cJAT-PK bound 50-fold better to GST-c-Jun mut than GST-v-Jun suggesting that the delta domain which is missing in v-Jun plays a role in binding the cJAT-PK. These results suggest that there is a protein kinase cascade mediated by protein phosphatases and PKC which regulates c-Jun phosphorylation.","['Adler, V', 'Polotskaya, A', 'Wagner, F', 'Kraft, A S']","['Adler V', 'Polotskaya A', 'Wagner F', 'Kraft AS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Threonine']",1992/08/25 00:00,1992/08/25 00:01,['1992/08/25 00:00'],"['1992/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)41884-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Aug 25;267(24):17001-5.,['R0-1 CA-42533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for in vitro regulation by basic fibroblast growth factor.,16975-9,"To study thrombin's receptor-mediated effects on vascular cells, we cloned and characterized a cDNA encoding a rat smooth muscle cell thrombin receptor. A rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cell cDNA library was screened with a 500-base pair (bp) sequence from the human thrombin receptor, obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of cDNA synthesized from human erythropoietic leukemia (HEL) cell mRNA with PCR primers based on the published human thrombin receptor sequence. Clone pRTHR17 contains a 3418-bp insert that includes 50 bp of the 5'-untranslated region and the entire coding and 3'-untranslated regions of the RASM cell thrombin receptor. The sequence of pRTHR17 is 85% similar, at the nucleotide level, and 78% similar, at the deduced amino acid level, to the human thrombin receptor. Although the putative thrombin cleavage and binding sites are present, there are significant differences between the rat and human receptors in their amino-terminal sequences. Detectable signals (consisting of a single band of 3.45 kb) are present by Northern analysis of mRNA from RASM cells, and rat lung, kidney, and testes, but not in aorta or other tissues probed. The results of Southern analysis of rat genomic DNA are consistent with the existence of a single copy of the gene encoding this receptor. The steady state thrombin receptor mRNA level is low in cultured growth-arrested RASM cells and not detectable in rat aorta. To determine whether regulation of the RASM cell thrombin receptor occurs under growth-stimulating conditions, growth-arrested RASM cells were treated with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, recently proposed to be a major mitogen controlling vascular smooth muscle cell growth following injury (Lindner, V., and Reidy, M. A. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 3739-3743)). There was a significant increase in thrombin receptor mRNA following the addition of bFGF. These data demonstrate that: 1) mRNA for a thrombin receptor similar to that reported from human megakaryocyte and hamster fibroblast cell lines is present in proliferating primary culture rat smooth muscle cells, 2) the most significant sequence differences are present in the amino-terminal tail of the thrombin receptor, and 3) the mRNA level for this receptor is regulated under growth-stimulating conditions in vitro.","['Zhong, C', 'Hayzer, D J', 'Corson, M A', 'Runge, M S']","['Zhong C', 'Hayzer DJ', 'Corson MA', 'Runge MS']","['Cardiology Division, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombin)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*physiology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombin', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Thrombin/metabolism']",1992/08/25 00:00,1992/08/25 00:01,['1992/08/25 00:00'],"['1992/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)41880-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Aug 25;267(24):16975-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M81642', 'GENBANK/M84424', 'GENBANK/M93284', 'GENBANK/M93285', 'GENBANK/M93701', 'GENBANK/M93702', 'GENBANK/M93703', 'GENBANK/M93704', 'GENBANK/M93705', 'GENBANK/M94144']",,,,,,

The specific receptor for OM has been demonstrated (by chemical cross-linking) to be a 150-kDa protein in a number of cell lines. The IL-6 signal transducer, gp130, is also an affinity converter for the LIF receptor. It does not bind to either IL-6 or LIF, but associates with the alpha subunits of the receptors and transduces the signals. We examined the possible involvement of gp130 in OM binding and signaling. We demonstrate that: (a) anti-gp130 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) block the inhibitory effect of OM on A375 cell growth, (b) the binding and cross-linking of 125I-OM to H2981 cells are completely abolished by anti-gp130 mAbs, (c) the cross-linked OM-receptor complex is immunoprecipitated by anti-gp130 mAbs, and (d) COS-7 cells transfected with the full-length cDNA encoding gp130 exhibit increased OM binding and cross-linking, which are also blocked by anti-gp130 mAbs. Therefore, we conclude that the 150-kDa OM binding protein previously characterized in a variety of cell lines is gp130.

The present work was carried out to examine further the effect of bufalin on the growth and characteristics of human leukemia-derived cell lines U937, ML1, and HL60. At concentrations of 5-10 nM, bufalin decreased the growth of ML1 cells preferentially at the G2 phase and U937 cells at the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Bufalin, under these conditions, induced the differentiation of U937, ML1, and HL60 cells to monocyte/macrophage-like cells by measuring the expression of various differentiation markers, as assessed by morphology and histochemistry, and ability to phagocytose latex particles, to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium, and to develop Fc receptors. U937 and ML1 cells started to differentiate at 4 and 6 h, respectively, after treatment with 10 nM bufalin and showed maximum differentiation 72 h later. At present, a mechanism for the bufalin-mediated induction of the differentiation of these human leukemia cells remains to be determined. The combination of bufalin with all-trans retinoic acid, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin ethylidene-beta-D-glucoside (VP16), or human gamma-interferon synergistically induced the differentiation of HL60 and U937 cells. A similar effect on ML1 cells was observed with the combination of bufalin with VP16 or human rTNF-alpha. These results suggest that bufalin in combination with VP16, all-trans retinoic acid, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, rTNF-alpha, or gamma-interferon may be very useful in the differentiation of human leukemia.","['Zhang, L', 'Nakaya, K', 'Yoshida, T', 'Kuroiwa, Y']","['Zhang L', 'Nakaya K', 'Yoshida T', 'Kuroiwa Y']","['Department of Biochemical Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Vitamins)', '143-62-4 (Digitoxigenin)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'T9PSN4R8IR (cinobufagin)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Bufanolides/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/administration & dosage', 'Digitoxigenin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Ouabain/administration & dosage', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology', 'Vitamins/administration & dosage']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Sep 1;52(17):4634-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cancer Res 1993 Feb 15;53(4):934'],,,,,

Since then, HTLV-2, HIV-1 and HIV-2 have been identified. All four viruses are transmitted with varying efficiency sexually, vertically from mother to infant, and through blood by transfusion or contamination. HTLV-1 is endemic in populations in south-west Japan, Taiwan, sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, southern USA, central and south America, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and western Asia. There is now epidemic spread amongst IVDUs in north and south America and southern Europe. HTLV-1 is the aetiological agent of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). Other associations which may be causative are with polymyositis, infective dermatitis, gastrointestinal malignant lymphoma and chronic lymphatic leukaemia. ATL appears to be due to malignant transformation of HTLV-1 infected cells, and TSP/HAM to chronic activation of these cells. The epidemiology of HTLV-2 is being separated only recently from HTLV-1 through the application of PCR. It has a low level of endemicity in populations of central Africa, and central and south America. It is being spread epidemically amongst IVDUs in north America and southern Europe. Its association with any pathology in man remains uncertain. HIV-1 is epidemic and spreading rapidly throughout the world. In areas where homosexual contact was the predominant mode of transmission, heterosexual spread is becoming increasingly important. The areas where heterosexual contact is the predominant mode of transmission include the worst affected populations in the world, for example sub-Saharan Africa and some of the Caribbean. There have been recent and explosive increases of HIV-1 seroprevalence in IVDUs and female prostitutes in Asia, especially Thailand and India. Of the diverse pathology following infection, only the haematological consequences are reviewed in detail: these include anaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, disorders of coagulation and lymphomas. HIV-2, compared to HIV-1, is less infectious and causes less immunosuppression with more slowly progressive disease. It is prevalent in west Africa, but is spreading, albeit slowly, far beyond.","['Weber, T', 'Hunsmann, G', 'Stevens, W', 'Fleming, A F']","['Weber T', 'Hunsmann G', 'Stevens W', 'Fleming AF']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology/transmission', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology/transmission', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-2', 'HTLV-I Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology/transmission', 'HTLV-II Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology/transmission', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Retroviridae/classification/genetics/ultrastructure', '*Retroviridae Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology/microbiology/transmission', 'Serologic Tests']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80021-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1992 Apr;5(2):273-314. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(11)80021-1.,,,,,,,245,,,,,,,,,,,,

This suggests that myelomonocytic antigen-positive peroxidase-negative acute leukemia is a distinct type of leukemia and may require more aggressive therapy to improve survival.","['Okawa, H', 'Nagasawa, M', 'Morio, T', 'Takase, K', 'Tanaka, K', 'Yata, J', 'Dan, K', 'Nomura, T', 'Sakamaki, H', 'Onozawa, Y']","['Okawa H', 'Nagasawa M', 'Morio T', 'Takase K', 'Tanaka K', 'Yata J', 'Dan K', 'Nomura T', 'Sakamaki H', 'Onozawa Y', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/analysis', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology/immunology', 'Periodic Acid-Schiff Reaction', 'Peroxidase/*analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/drug therapy/enzymology/immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1992 Apr;55(2):165-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sites of action and mechanisms of cell toxicity of these agents are as yet unknown. To better understand the mode of action of this class of anticancer agents, we examined the ability of 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetylglycero-3-phosphocholine with the S or R configuration at C2 ((R)-PAF and (S)-PAF) and 1-O-hexadecyl-2-methoxyglycero-3-phosphocholine with the S or R configuration at C2 ((R)-ET-16-OCH3-GPC and (S)-ET-16-OCH3-GPC) to induce rabbit platelet aggregation and to inhibit [3H]thymidine uptake into WEHI-3B cells, HL-60 cells, and normal blood lymphocytes. The four chiral ether-linked lipids caused aggregation of rabbit platelets with the following order of potency: (R)-PAF greater than (S)-PAF greater than (R)-ET-16-OCH3-GPC greater than (S)-ET-16-OCH3-GPC; the EC50 values were 1 pM, 50 nM, 1 microM, and 50 microM, respectively. The cytotoxic effects of these ether lipids in leukemic cells was in reverse order to that observed for aggregation of platelets. The order of potency for inhibition of [3H]thymidine uptake by WEHI-3B and HL-60 cells was (R)-ET-16-OCH3-GPC = (S)-ET-16-OCH3-GPC greater than (S)-PAF greater than (R)-PAF; the EC50 values were 2, 2, 15, and greater than 40 microM, respectively. PAF antagonists (WEB 2086, CV 3988, triazolam, and SRI 63,441) blocked the action of the four ether lipids on platelets, while SRI 63,441 blocked the antineoplastic activity of the ether lipids on WEHI-3B and HL-60 cells. None of the four lipids was able to kill normal lymphocytes significantly. Scatchard analysis of PAF receptor binding revealed that HL-60 and WEHI-3B cells, which are sensitive to the cytotoxic action of ether-linked lipids, do not possess PAF receptors, whereas both normal lymphocytes and platelets do possess a PAF receptor. The present data indicate that the cytotoxic action of antineoplastic ether-linked lipids does not involve the PAF receptor. The protective role of SRI 63,441 in blocking the proaggregatory activity of the ether lipids in rabbit platelets involves PAF receptor, but cytotoxic activity against WEHI-3B and HL-60 cells does not result from its ability to act as a PAF antagonist.","['Salari, H', 'Dryden, P', 'Howard, S', 'Bittman, R']","['Salari H', 'Dryden P', 'Howard S', 'Bittman R']","['Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', '60M22SGW66 (Glycerylphosphorylcholine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Glycerylphosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Platelet Aggregation/*drug effects', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1139/o92-019 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1992 Feb;70(2):129-35. doi: 10.1139/o92-019.,['HL 16660/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The RA receptor family consists of multiple structurally distinct RA receptors, which diverge primarily at the NH2-terminal domain. The evolutionary conservation of this divergent region in individual RA receptors among different species together with their tissue-specific patterns of expression suggest that the biological function and activity of the individual RA receptors may be confined to specific tissues. To test this hypothesis in hematopoietic cells, we used retrovirus-mediated gene transduction to introduce the RA receptors RAR-alpha, RAR-beta, and RAR-gamma as well as RXR-alpha into a mutant subclone of the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line (designated HL-60R) that is relatively resistant to RA-induced granulocytic differentiation. We found that each of these structurally distinct RA receptors could restore sensitivity of the HL-60R cells to RA. A critical threshold number of transduced receptors per cell appears to be necessary to restore this functional activity. Thus, the capability to mediate granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells is shared among distinctly different RA receptors.","['Robertson, K A', 'Emami, B', 'Mueller, L', 'Collins, S J']","['Robertson KA', 'Emami B', 'Mueller L', 'Collins SJ']","['Molecular Medicine Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*physiology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.12.9.3743-3749.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Sep;12(9):3743-9. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.9.3743-3749.1992.,['CA55397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC360235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An analysis of precursor CTL frequencies in the AKR.H-2b and C57BL/6 mouse strains.,1593-8,"C57BL/6 mice, after immunization and secondary in vitro restimulation with AKR/Gross murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-induced tumors, generate AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL. After similar immunization protocols, AKR-H-2b mice fail to generate CTL specific for AKR/Gross MuLV. The basis for nonresponsiveness in AKR.H-2b mice is unknown, however, unlike C57BL/6 mice, AKR.H-2b mice carry endogenous proviruses and express N-ecotropic viral Ag. Thus, clonal deletion of pCTL populations due to the expression of AKR/Gross MuLV-like Ag is a likely mechanism for the nonresponsiveness. To determine if nonresponsiveness is due to clonal deletion, limiting dilution cultures were performed to assess the presence of pCTL specific for AKR/Gross MuLV. Our study demonstrates that the frequencies of pCTL specific for AKR/Gross MuLV are similar in both the responder C57BL/6 and nonresponder AKR.H-2b strains. The observation that normal levels of AKR/Gross MuLV-specific pCTL exist in AKR.H-2b mice, suggests that clonal deletion of pCTL is not responsible for the inability of AKR.H-2b mice to generate anti-AKR/Gross virus-specific CTL.","['Wegmann, K W', 'Rich, R F', 'Green, W R']","['Wegmann KW', 'Rich RF', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'H-2 Antigens/*analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Immunization', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*physiology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Sep 1;149(5):1593-8.,"['CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K04 CA-01112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection of these cells by feline leukemia virus (FeLV) might not only contribute to the pathogenesis of FeLV-induced hematologic diseases, but could provide a reservoir for virus in the infected cat. To determine the frequency of FeLV infection among marrow FB precursor cells (fibroblast colony-forming units, CFU-F) of cats viremic with FeLV-C/Sarma and FeLV-A/61E, marrow FBs and FB cell clones were isolated and assayed for expression of FeLV gag protein. From 30% to 86% and 64% to 88% of marrow FB precursors were infected with FeLV-C/Sarma and FeLV-A/61E, respectively. CFU-F from a cat viremic with FeLV-A/61E were not affected by exposure to antibody against FeLV envelope glycoprotein gp70 and heterologous complement, whereas similarly treated hematopoietic progenitors (erythroid colony-forming units, CFU-E; erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-E; and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-GM) and culture-propagated, FeLV-infected marrow FBs were effectively lysed, suggesting that infected CFU-F within the marrow microenvironment do not express a significant amount of gp70 on their cell membranes. Thus, marrow FB precursor cells appear to be a major target for FeLV in vivo.

Our inability to identify environmental causes could mean either that the environment does not substantially affect cancer incidence in young children, or that we are simply not looking in the right places. Most attention has naturally been focused on the known and suspected environmental carcinogens and mutagens. Based on the data summarised in this paper, one possibility is that the most important mutagen is endogenous: 5-methyl-cytosine. If so, factors increasing cancer risk could be those which increase the rate of spontaneous deamination, or impair the efficiency of the excision repair enzymes, or regulate the processes of CpG methylation and demethylation. These factors could still be classed as mutagens in their own right, since they would lead to an increase in uncorrected point mutations, but they would be distinctive in a number of ways. Firstly, since the role of methylation in bacteria is very different from that in eukaryotic cells the Ames mutagenicity assay could not be relied upon to detect methylation-mediated mutagens.

The balanced chromosomal translocation t(15;17)(q22;q12-21) of this malignancy is now known to involve the nuclear retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha) on the long arm of chromosome 17 and a novel gene on the long arm of chromosome 15, designated PML (previously called myl). A unique fusion mRNA, PML/RAR-alpha, is produced. Paradoxically, this rearrangement of RAR-alpha results in clinical sensitivity to retinoic acid. Despite its efficacy, retinoic acid therapy has side effect, including a syndrome of hyperleukocytosis and respiratory distress in some patients. Remissions induced and maintained by continuous all-trans-retinoic treatment are not durable in most of these patients. Retinoic acid therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia represents a unique example where a molecular defect may be involved both in the pathogenesis and treatment of a malignancy.","['Frankel, S R', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Dmitrovsky, E']","['Frankel SR', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Dmitrovsky E']","['State U of New York, Roswell Park Cancer Center, Buffalo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1992/08/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/08/11 19:15'],"['1992/08/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/08/11 19:15 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 1992 Aug;6(8):74-78, 83; discussion 84, 87-8.",,,,,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though several radiation-sensitive yeast mutants have been identified, little is known about the genes that control these responses in mammalian cells. Recent studies from our laboratory have demonstrated a close correlation between expression of wild-type p53 genes in human hematopoietic cells and their ability to arrest in G1 phase after certain types of DNA damage. In the present study, this correlation was first generalized to nonhematopoietic mammalian cells as well. A cause and effect relationship between expression of wild-type p53 and the G1 arrest that occurs after gamma irradiation was then established by demonstrating (i) acquisition of the G1 arrest after gamma irradiation following transfection of wild-type p53 genes into cells lacking endogenous p53 genes and (ii) loss of the G1 arrest after irradiation following transfection of mutant p53 genes into cells with wild-type endogenous p53 genes. A defined role for p53 (the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers) in a physiologic pathway has, to our knowledge, not been reported previously. Furthermore, these experiments illustrate one way in which a mutant p53 gene product can function in a ""dominant negative"" manner. Participation of p53 in this pathway suggests a mechanism for the contribution of abnormalities in p53 to tumorigenesis and genetic instability and provides a useful model for studies of the molecular mechanisms of p53 involvement in controlling the cell cycle.","['Kuerbitz, S J', 'Plunkett, B S', 'Walsh, W V', 'Kastan, M B']","['Kuerbitz SJ', 'Plunkett BS', 'Walsh WV', 'Kastan MB']","['Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Cell Cycle/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colonic Neoplasms', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication/*radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Skin', 'Transfection']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.16.7491 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Aug 15;89(16):7491-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.16.7491.,"['CA 06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 05777/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD27799/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,['p53'],PMC49736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which c-myb is regulated during hematopoietic cell differentiation. Previous studies pertaining to the regulation of c-myb have been carried out with the avian and murine forms of the gene; the current studies were designed to determine the mechanisms of regulation of the human form of c-myb. Transcriptional analysis by nuclear run-on assays revealed that an attenuation of transcription was the means of primary regulation during retinoic acid- and vitamin D3-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, while other mechanisms in addition to attenuation were active during dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)- and phorbol ester-induced differentiation. Densitometric analysis of the changes in c-myb transcription caused by phorbol ester suggested that the c-myb promoter may be down-regulated during phorbol ester-induced differentiation of HL-60. Additional studies exhibited post-transcriptional regulation by phorbol ester. DMSO was also shown to regulate c-myb at the post-transcriptional level. Interestingly, the post-transcriptional regulation of c-myb by DMSO required continuous transcription. This requirement was shared for c-myc but not ornithine decarboxylase expression. The transcriptional dependency of c-myb post-transcriptional regulation did not equate to translational dependency, thus a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism may control c-myb gene expression. The multiple levels of regulation of c-myb suggest the importance of proper control for hematopoietic cell differentiation.","['Boise, L H', 'Gorse, K M', 'Westin, E H']","['Boise LH', 'Gorse KM', 'Westin EH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1992 Sep;7(9):1817-25.,['ES 07087/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,['c-myb'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using PBMCs from a newly infected sheep, we asked whether viral transcription proceeded differently during the initial months of infection, when the prevalence of BLV-infected cells and the host's immunological response change markedly. Shortly after being injected with BLV, the animal displayed a characteristic, transient increase in PBMCs that transcribed BLV when cultured. Even when transcriptionally competent PBMCs were most prevalent (1.2%), only rare cells in the circulation (1 in 50,000) contained enough BLV transcripts to be identified readily by in situ hybridization. However, at one point several weeks later, some PBMCs appeared to contain small amounts of BLV RNA as soon as they had been purified from blood. Throughout this period, BLV-transcribing PBMCs greatly outnumbered virus-producing cells, which were counted using a new infectious centers assay. Its viscous medium reduced cell to cell contact among PBMCs, enabling increased detection of BLV-producing cells at a time when virus-specific killer cells might be active. Early infection was polyclonal, and most infected PBMCs transcribed BLV upon being cultured. By 2 months after infection, provirus-containing cells were as abundant as they had been earlier, but few cells transcribed BLV. These results suggest that BLV-infected cells are more easily stimulated to transcribe the provirus and produce infectious virus during the early months of a new infection.","['Radke, K', 'Sigala, T J', 'Grossman, D']","['Radke K', 'Sigala TJ', 'Grossman D']","['Department of Avian Sciences, University of California, Davis 95616-8532.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Microb Pathog,Microbial pathogenesis,8606191,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Giant Cells/microbiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*growth & development/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*microbiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*microbiology', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Sheep', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication/physiology']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0882-4010(92)90095-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0882-4010(92)90095-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Microb Pathog. 1992 May;12(5):319-31. doi: 10.1016/0882-4010(92)90095-6.,['CA-46374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subgroup A FeLVs, although closely related genetically to FeLVs of subgroup C, do not induce PRCA. The determinants for PRCA induction by a molecularly cloned prototype subgroup C virus (FeLV-Sarma-C [FSC]) have been localized to the N-terminal 241 amino acids of the surface glycoprotein (SU) gp70. To investigate whether the anemogenic activity of FSC reflects a unique capacity to infect erythroid progenitor cells, we used correlative immunogold, immunofluorescence, and cytological staining to study prospectively the hemopoietic cell populations infected by either FSC or FeLV-FAIDS-61E-A (F6A), a prototype of subgroup A virus. The results demonstrated that although only FSC-infected animals developed erythrocyte aplasia, the env SU and the major core protein (p27) were expressed in a surprisingly large fraction of the lymphoid, erythroid, and myeloid lineage marrow cells in both FSC- and F6A-infected cats. Between days 8 and 17 postinoculation, gp70 and p27 were detected in 43 to 73% of erythroid, 25 to 75% of lymphoid, and 35 to 50% of myeloid lineage cells, regardless of whether the cats were infected with FSC or F6A. Thus, anemogenic subgroup C and nonanemogenic subgroup A FeLVs have similar hemopoietic cell tropism and infection kinetics, despite their divergent effects on erythroid progenitor cell function. Acute anemia induction by subgroup C FeLV, therefore, does not reflect a unique tropism for marrow erythroid cells but rather indicates a unique cytopathic effect of the SU on erythroid progenitor cells.","['Dean, G A', 'Groshek, P M', 'Mullins, J I', 'Hoover, E A']","['Dean GA', 'Groshek PM', 'Mullins JI', 'Hoover EA']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/microbiology/pathology', 'Cats', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*microbiology', 'Gene Products, gag/biosynthesis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/classification/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Feline/microbiology', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*microbiology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.9.5561-5568.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Sep;66(9):5561-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.9.5561-5568.1992.,['CA48594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC289115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adult female C57BL/10 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with LP-BM5 MuLV. When the virus-inoculated female mice developed splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, they were mated with normal C57BL/10 male mice. Of 56 offspring born to MAIDS mothers, 14 appeared to develop MAIDS, as assessed by the occurrence of splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy as well as the mitogen response of spleen cells. The occurrence of MAIDS in offspring was found to be accompanied by the maternal transmission and expansion of a defective virus genome from which almost the entire pol and env regions are deleted. On the other hand, the ecotropic helper virus genome was detected in all offspring regardless of the occurrence of MAIDS. To examine the mode of maternal transmission of LP-BM5 MuLV, foster-nursing experiments were conducted. The ecotropic helper viruses were found in all normal offspring nursed by a MAIDS mother, and some of them developed MAIDS. In contrast, none of offspring born to a MAIDS mother that were nursed by an uninfected foster mother either carried the LP-BM5 MuLV or developed MAIDS. Finally, both the defective and the ecotropic helper viruses were detected in LP-BM5 MuLV-infected mother's milk. These results indicated that maternal transmission of LP-BM5 MuLV occurs with a high frequency and is mediated by mother's milk.","['Okada, Y', 'Suzuki, K', 'Komuro, K', 'Mizuochi, T']","['Okada Y', 'Suzuki K', 'Komuro K', 'Mizuochi T']","['Department of Blood Products, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Defective Viruses/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Genes, env/genetics', 'Genes, pol/genetics', 'Genome, Viral', 'Helper Viruses/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Milk/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*transmission', 'Pregnancy', 'Virulence']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.9.5177-5182.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Sep;66(9):5177-82. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.9.5177-5182.1992.,,,,PMC289069,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific binding of HrHF was maximal in MOLT-4 cells harvested during exponential growth with the cells in the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle. Specific binding decreased progressively to the plateau phase of growth with the cells in the resting phase of the cell cycle. Scatchard analysis of the competitive binding data for HrHF demonstrated that this decrease in binding was associated with a reduction in receptor number, from 42,140 per cell to 10,306 per cell. Receptor binding affinity increased only minimally over this period, from 7.1 x 10(7) L/mol to 14.9 x 10(7) L/mol. These results indicate that growth- and cell cycle-induced changes in H-ferritin receptor expression are primarily associated with changes in receptor number rather than receptor binding affinity. The present study demonstrates that the expression of this receptor is associated with the proliferative status of the cell and suggests that the H-ferritin receptor may mediate the putative regulatory role of H-ferritin.","['Moss, D', 'Powell, L W', 'Arosio, P', 'Halliday, J W']","['Moss D', 'Powell LW', 'Arosio P', 'Halliday JW']","['Liver Unit, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Bancroft Centre, Herston, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,"['0 (Iron-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (ferritin receptor)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Replication', 'Ferritins/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Iron-Binding Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Time Factors']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0022-2143(92)90131-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1992 Aug;120(2):239-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proximity of these two genes resulted in several effects. Using a newly developed RNase protection assay for measuring transcription from a single endogenous provirus, we found that Mtv-8 transcription could be detected after juxtaposition of the kappa-enhancers to the normally silent provirus. Reciprocally, using the polymerase chain reaction we observed that the frequency of V kappa 9M rearrangement was 5- to 10-fold higher in spleens from Mtv-8-positive mice (BALB/c, C58.C, A/J, and B6) compared to spleens from mice that lacked the Mtv-8 provirus (C58, C.C58, NZB, and PERA/Ei). Molecular cloning and sequencing of the V kappa 9M gene from C.C58 mice (containing the kappa-locus from C58 mice on a BALB/c background) indicated that at least some Mtv-8-negative strains have a functional V kappa 9M gene. Together these data suggest that Mtv-8 or a closely linked gene enhances V kappa 9M rearrangement. Since Mtv-8 also reportedly produces a superantigen, it appears that Mtv-8 may influence both the T cell and B cell repertoires.","['Yang, J N', 'Dudley, J']","['Yang JN', 'Dudley J']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas, Austin 78712.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Aug 15;149(4):1242-51.,['CA34780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Mtv-8'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuous exposure of HL-60 cells to GM-CSF induced the cell differentiation that was evaluated by the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reducing activity. GM-CSF also exhibited a proliferative effect on HL-60 cells. GM-CSF at 1 nmol/L, an optimal concentration for cell growth and cell differentiation, induced significant changes in the intracellular inositoltriphosphate (IP3). Diacylglycerol generation was also stimulated by GM-CSF treatment. GM-CSF increased the membrane PK-C activity by 10-fold of the control, whereas no measurable change in cyclic nucleotides was observed. These data indicated that phosphoinositol turnover and the activation of PK-C were included in the GM-CSF signal transducing pathway in HL-60 cell.

Under these conditions, intracellular Ca2+ concentrations did not correlate with the observed DNA digestion. In contrast, intracellular acidification correlated well with DNA digestion. These data indicate that increased intracellular Ca2+ is not the primary signal for endonuclease activation in all forms of apoptosis, but that intracellular acidification may be involved.

These compounds provide a convenient means for the single-step purification of the folate transporters from L1210 cells. Parental L1210 murine leukemia cells, which contain only the microM transporter (the reduced folate/MTX transport protein) were treated with the N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester of biotin-SS-MTX, and a detergent extract of the plasma membranes was exposed to streptavidin-agarose beads to adsorb the labeled protein. Dithiothreitol cleavage of the disulfide linkage released the transporter, which migrated as a well-defined component (43 kDa) on SDS-PAGE gels; no other proteins were present. An L1210 subline (JF), obtained by adapting cells to grow on nanomolar concentrations of folate, contains both the microM transporter and the nM transporter (high-affinity folate binding protein). When these cells were treated with the N-hydroxysulfosuccimide ester of biotin-SS-folate and processed as described above, analysis on SDS-PAGE gels revealed the presence of two proteins, the microM transporter (43 kDa) and the nM transporter (39 kDa). Both transporters were characterized with respect to amino acid content; blocked N-termini precluded Edman sequencing. Treatment of the nM transporter with peptide:N-glycosidase F produced a smaller component (32 kDa); the microM transporter, conversely, was unchanged by this procedure. When the microM transporter in parental L1210 cells was labeled with fluorescein-MTX and then treated with phosphoinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), no change in fluorescence was detected. Alternatively, when the nM transporter in the JF subline was labeled with fluorescein-folate and then treated with PI-PLC, complete loss of fluorescence was observed. These results indicate that the L1210 microM transporter is a non-glycosylated, integral membrane protein, while its nM counterpart is heavily glycosylated and anchored exofacially to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol component.","['Fan, J', 'Vitols, K S', 'Huennekens, F M']","['Fan J', 'Vitols KS', 'Huennekens FM']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (biotin-SS-folate)', '0 (biotin-SS-methotrexate)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity/methods', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(92)90005-k [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1992;32:3-15. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(92)90005-k.,['CA 39836/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This line exhibits a 95-fold increased Vmax for [3H]-MTX influx as compared to parental cells. The values for [3H]-MTX influx Km, efflux t1/2 and structural specificity for other (anti)folate compounds were unchanged. The amount of carrier protein, estimated by NHS-[3H]-MTX affinity labeling, was approximately 30-fold higher in CEM-7A cells than in parental cells. Influx of [3H]-MTX in CEM-7A cells was found to be down-regulated 6-7-fold after preincubation of cells with adenosine, 5-formyl-THF or 5-methyl-THF, but could be prevented exclusively by inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase. The underlying mechanism(s) of these effects have not as yet been elucidated. A radioiodinated photoaffinity analog of MTX was used to prove the molecular events in carrier-mediated MTX uptake in parental CCRF-CEM cells, CEM-7A cells, and a line exhibiting a MTX-transport defect (CEM-MTX). Specific labeling of an 80-85 kDa membrane protein was observed in parental cells, but not in CEM/MTX cells. Uptake of photoprobe and levels of the 80-85 kDa membrane protein were significantly increased in CEM-7A cells. Due to extensive glycosylation the MW of the carrier protein in human cells seems to be substantially higher than that of its counterpart in murine L1210 leukemia cells (46-48 kDa). Pulse-labeling experiments at 37 degrees C demonstrated that in CEM-7A cells photoprobe uptake proceeds via a specific pathway. The 80-85 kDa membrane protein is involved in the initial binding and translocation of photoprobe, after which a 38 kDa cytosolic protein is responsible for further intracellular distribution. At this time, the combination of photoaffinity labeling techniques and the availability of variant cell lines overexpressing the reduced folate/MTX carrier protein has provided new insights into the MTX transport process in human leukemia cell lines. In the near future this approach should also allow a further elucidation of the regulatory aspects of carrier function.","['Freisheim, J H', 'Ratnam, M', 'McAlinden, T P', 'Prasad, K M', 'Williams, F E', 'Westerhof, G R', 'Schornagel, J H', 'Jansen, G']","['Freisheim JH', 'Ratnam M', 'McAlinden TP', 'Prasad KM', 'Williams FE', 'Westerhof GR', 'Schornagel JH', 'Jansen G']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Ohio, Toledo 43699-0008.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(92)90006-l [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1992;32:17-31. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(92)90006-l.,['CA41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have suggested that the flanking cellular sequences are also important for Fv-4 env gene expression. To establish how the truncated retrovirus was generated and the nature of the cellular sequences involved, the Fv-4 susceptible (Fv-4s) allele DNA was cloned, and its restriction map and nucleotide sequence were compared with those of the Fv-4r allele. A likely mechanism for generation of the truncated endogenous MuLV is suggested by the results; integration of a prototype MuLV provirus at a site within the Fv-4s allele about 6 to 8 kb downstream of a non-retroviral promoter region, followed by deletion of the 5' half of the provirus, with an accompanying loss of only 7 or 10 bp of cellular flanking sequences.

The present studies were designed to address questions about carmethizole's activity against established disease, its activity on different treatment schedules, and the extent of its cross-resistance with established drugs. Human MX-1 mammary carcinoma, human NCI-H82 small-cell lung carcinoma, and human LOX amelanotic melanoma xenografts in athymic mice were used to determine the drug's activity against established disease; the NCI-H82 lung-tumor xenograft in athymic mice was used to explore its schedule dependence; and a series of drug-resistant murine leukemias provided an in vivo cross-resistance profile. When injected i.p., carmethizole exhibited antitumor activity against advanced-stage s.c. MX-1 mammary, s.c. NCI-H82 lung, and i.p. LOX melanoma xenografts and was as effective against established disease (MX-1 and LOX) as it was against early-stage disease (no data are available for early-stage NCI-H82). The therapeutic effect of carmethizole was not route-dependent, as was evidenced by the similar delays observed in tumor growth following i.p. and i.v. administration. The use of a split-dose schedule on a single day instead of one bolus injection yielded an increase in the total dose delivered, resulting in an increased delay in tumor growth. Murine leukemias resistant to vincristine (VCR), amsacrine (AMSA), or methotrexate (MTX) were not cross-resistant to carmethizole. However, murine leukemias resistant to doxorubicin (ADR), melphalan (L-PAM), cisplatin (DDPt), 1-beta-D-ara-binofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were cross-resistant to carmethizole, suggesting that patients who have previously been treated with any of these agents might be less likely to respond to carmethizole than those who have had no opportunity to develop resistance to any of these compounds. We anticipate that the information derived from these studies may be useful in the design of clinical trials of carmethizole and may stimulate additional basic research on the mechanism of action of this new agent.","['Waud, W R', 'Plowman, J', 'Harrison, S D Jr', 'Dykes, D J', 'Anderson, W K', 'Griswold, D P Jr']","['Waud WR', 'Plowman J', 'Harrison SD Jr', 'Dykes DJ', 'Anderson WK', 'Griswold DP Jr']","['Chemotherapy and Toxicology Research, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL 35255-5305.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '117120-88-4 (carmethizole)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1992/01/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/01/11 19:15'],"['1992/01/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/01/11 19:15 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686292 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1992;30(4):261-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00686292.,['N01-CM-07315/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe here a new element of the anoxic response, the induction by anoxia of a sequestered endonuclease activity. Such activity is elevated approximately 3-fold within anoxic fibroblasts and during Hirt DNA isolation is able to digest chromatin to produce a nucleosomal ladder. However, DNA is not measurably affected within intact cells, and cells retain complete viability as the endonuclease is induced. The anoxia-inducible endonuclease acts without specificity for DNA sequence. Trace leakage of this endonuclease into the nucleus has obvious potential to underlie the known propensity of anoxic cells to undergo amplification and may be associated with the break-related genomic instability of cancer cells.","['Stoler, D L', 'Anderson, G R', 'Russo, C A', 'Spina, A M', 'Beerman, T A']","['Stoler DL', 'Anderson GR', 'Russo CA', 'Spina AM', 'Beerman TA']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Hypoxia/*genetics/physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/chemistry/drug effects', 'Endonucleases/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Induction/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/enzymology/genetics', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Rats', 'Teniposide/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Aug 15;52(16):4372-8.,['CA48828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Association of the B blood group, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in chickens, with avian leukosis virus (ALV) infection shown by shedding of group-specific (gs) antigen was studied in an Australorp line selected for short oviposition interval to improve egg production. Three haplotypes (B8a, B9a and B21) were segregating in this line at frequencies of 66.7, 15.6 and 17.8%, respectively, averaged over three generations. 2. The relative risk (odds ratio) of a hen becoming a gs-antigen shedder was calculated for progenies of the dams shedding gs-antigen and those of non-shedding dams separately and pooled over three generations. In the progenies of shedding dams, the relative risk was not significantly different from 1.0 for the three haplotypes. In contrast, in the progenies of non-shedding dams, the relative risk was 0.67, 0.48 and 2.53 for B8a, B9a and B21, respectively, with the last two ratios being significantly different from 1.0. 3. The average effect of haplotype substitution on probability of shedding was estimated from a linear logistic model. The estimates (relative to zero for B8a) for B9a and B21, respectively, were -0.26 and 0.03 among the progenies of shedding dams, and -0.16 and 0.87 among the progenies of non-shedding dams. The last estimate only was highly significant. 4. These results suggest that the three haplotypes were similar in susceptibility to congenital infection through hatching eggs, but differed in susceptibility to post-hatching infection from other infected birds.","['Yoo, B H', 'Sheldon, B L']","['Yoo BH', 'Sheldon BL']","['CSIRO Division of Animal Production, Blacktown, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br Poult Sci,British poultry science,15740290R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/immunology', 'Breeding', 'Chi-Square Distribution', '*Chickens', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Oviposition/genetics']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00071669208417500 [doi]'],ppublish,Br Poult Sci. 1992 Jul;33(3):613-20. doi: 10.1080/00071669208417500.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells from all cases, including three with negative cytochemical features, were labelled by at least one of the anti-myeloid McAb CD13, anti-myeloperoxidase (anti-Mpo), and/or CD14. The most sensitive marker was CD13, since it was positive in 90% of cases. In two out of three AML cases defined as M0-AML, CD13 was expressed in the cytoplasm but not on the membrane; in these three cases peroxidase (Mpo) was not detected by conventional cytochemistry, but could be demonstrated in all of them using the McAb anti-Mpo. The simultaneous expression of CD14 and CD68 McAb was often confined to the M4 and M5 FAB AML subtypes (92% cases) as compared to the others: M1, M2, M3 (18% cases). Lymphoid antigens were rarely positive (TdT+: 13%, CD7+: 15%, CD19+: 5%) and none of the AML cases were CD3+ or CD10+. By contrast, CD4 was expressed in blasts from 44% of cases and this was not restricted to AML with a monocytic component (M4, M5) but also found in other subtypes. There were no significant differences in the clinical or prognostic features according to the positivity or negativity with TdT and CD4. By contrast, expression of CD7 was associated with refractoriness to the treatment or short complete remission duration, although the number of patients is too small to draw firm conclusions.

We studied the effects of DDTC on the regulation of hematopoietic cytokine production in human myeloid cells. The results demonstrated that DDTC decreases proliferation of human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells in a concentration-dependent manner. DDTC treatment also increased interleukin-alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression in these cells. Similar findings were obtained in normal human peripheral blood monocytes. Peak induction of these cytokines occurred 6-12 hr after exposure to DDTC; levels returned to those in control cells by 24-48 hr in HL-60 cells. This effect was specific for IL-1 and TNF in that there was no detectable increase in IL-3, macrophage colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor RNA expression. Transcriptional run-on analysis demonstrated that exposure to DDTC increased the rate of TNF gene transcription in HL-60 cells.

Nevertheless, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can infect non-dividing macrophages. This ability to grow in non-dividing cells is not specific to macrophages because, as we show here, CD4+ HeLa cells arrested at stage G2 of the cell cycle can be infected by HIV-1. Proliferation is necessary for these same cells to be infected by a murine retrovirus, MuLV. HIV-1 integrates into the arrested cell DNA and produces viral RNA and protein in a pattern similar to that in normal cells. In addition, our data suggest that the ability to infect non-dividing cells is due to one of the HIV-1 core virion proteins.

We have used our polyclonal antisera that recognize both the M(r) 170,000 and 180,000 forms of topoisomerase II to examine the nuclear distribution of topoisomerase II in cytospin preparations of drug-sensitive (CEM) and VM-26-resistant (CEM/VM-1 and CEM/VM-1-5) human leukemic lymphoblasts. We have also examined the nuclear distribution of topoisomerase II in monolayer cultures of a human rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30) cell line. In the absence of drug, we observed a focal ""patchy"" staining of nuclear topoisomerase II in all cell lines, that was especially notable in the lymphoblastic cells. Treatment of CEM and Rh30 cells with VM-26 under conditions that increase the number of covalent topoisomerase II-DNA complexes increased both the intensity and the homogeneity of nuclear topoisomerase II staining in a subpopulation of cells; focal staining was less evident after treatment with drug. These responses were roughly proportional to the concentration of VM-26 used and required only brief (approximately 25-min) incubation with drug. We also found that treatment of CEM cells with 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide similarly increased the intensity and homogeneity of nuclear topoisomerase II immunostaining. In contrast, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-o-anisidide and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, agents that do not inhibit topoisomerase II, did not produce this effect. Finally, the VM-26-mediated alteration in topoisomerase II staining intensity and distribution was attenuated in proportion to the degree of VM-26 resistance in the CEM/VM-1 and CEM/VM-1-5 sublines. These results appear to be related to the ability of the drug to stabilize DNA-topoisomerase covalent (""cleavable"") complexes in intact cells. Our findings indicate that anti-topoisomerase II drugs, such as VM-26, have profound effects on the ability to detect topoisomerase II in the nucleus and provide a novel way of examining drug-stabilized DNA topoisomerase II complexes in intact single tumor cells.","['Wolverton, J S', 'Danks, M K', 'Granzen, B', 'Beck, W T']","['Wolverton JS', 'Danks MK', 'Granzen B', 'Beck WT']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*enzymology', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Aug 1;52(15):4248-53.,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adherent, stromal layer of these cultures is composed of fibroblastoid cells (50% to 80%), macrophages (10% to 30%), fat cells (10% to 20%), and large, polygonal cells that express muscle actin (1% to 2%). When fresh, enriched marrow mononuclear cells (MMNC) were added to 3-week-old irradiated stromal cultures, nonadherent erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) could be detected for up to 5 and 12 weeks, respectively. LTMC stromal layers established from marrow cells from cats viremic with either a nonpathogenic strain of FeLV (FeLV-A/61E) or the anemogenic strain FeLV-C/Sarma were morphologically equivalent to uninfected LTMC stromal layers, although more than 80% of the stromal cells expressed FeLV gag protein. When FeLV-infected stromal cultures were recharged with uninfected MMNC, altered patterns of hematopoiesis were observed, compared with recharged, uninfected stromal cultures. In cultures with infected stroma, fewer nonadherent cells (NAC), nonadherent BFU-E, and nonadherent CFU-GM were detected during the first 4 to 5 weeks after recharge. In contrast, greater numbers of NAC and nonadherent CFU-GM were found from weeks 5 to 12 after recharge. When FeLV-infected stromal cultures were recharged with MMNC from a cat heterozygous for the X-chromosome-linked enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), the percentage of nonadherent CFU-GM expressing the domestic type G-6-PD isoenzyme remained stable over time (mean % domestic [%d], 53% +/- 3%), and was equivalent to that of nonadherent CFU-GM maintained in uninfected cultures (mean %d, 56% +/- 3%), indicating that clonal drift or clonal selection was not responsible for the enhanced maintenance of CFU-GM. Furthermore, as only 10% to 20% of recharged hematopoietic cells became infected with FeLV in vitro, it is unlikely that the altered pattern was due to progenitor infection. We hypothesize that the increase in NAC and nonadherent CFU-GM in FeLV-infected cultures resulted from enhanced growth factor production by stromal cells. The two-step LTMC system may facilitate the characterization of stromal-derived factors that affect progenitor cell engraftment and proliferation.","['Linenberger, M L', 'Abkowitz, J L']","['Linenberger ML', 'Abkowitz JL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology/physiopathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/analysis', 'Cats', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/analysis', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/pathology/*physiology', 'Laminin/analysis', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Reference Values', 'Time Factors', 'von Willebrand Factor/analysis']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)70571-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Aug 1;80(3):651-62.,"['DK41934/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL02396/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL31823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of derivatized hydrolysates by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with selected-ion monitoring showed that 3-[(1,3-dihydro-2,4-dioxopyrimidin-5-yl)-methyl]-L-tyrosine (Thy-Tyr cross-link) was formed. The presence of this DNA-protein cross-link in control cells was also observed at a level of approximately 7 molecules per 10(6) DNA nucleotides. Exposure of cells to ionizing radiation at doses between 8.7 and 82 Gy (J.kg-1) increased the amount of the Thy-Tyr cross-link linearly up to approximately fourfold over the background level. At doses higher than 82 Gy, the yield approached a plateau. Treatment of cells with H2O2 (0.5 to 10 mM) also increased the amount of the Thy-Tyr cross-link in a concentration-dependent manner. Addition of dimethyl sulfoxide and o-phenanthroline in the culture medium afforded partial inhibition of cross-link formation. Addition of catalase inhibitor KCN prior to H2O2 treatment increased the yield of cross-linking over the level observed with H2O2 treatment alone. Pretreatment of cells with ascorbic acid for 24 h without H2O2 caused formation of the Thy-Tyr cross-link.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Previously untreated patients with NSCLC underwent bronchoscopy, chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT), bone scan, and surgical staging of the mediastinum. Neoadjuvant treatment consisted of concurrent chemotherapy and RT. Patients then underwent surgical resection, which was followed in turn by additional chemotherapy and RT. Chemotherapy included cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 29, vinblastine 3 mg/m2 on days 1 and 3 and 29 and 31, and fluorouracil (5-FU) 30 mg/kg/d by infusion on days 1 to 3 and 29 to 31 (FVP). RT began on day 1 and included 3,000 cGy in 15 fractions. Surgery took place on day 55, and one more cycle of chemotherapy and an additional 3,000 cGy of RT began on day 85. RESULTS: Forty-one eligible patients (median follow-up, 53 months) were studied. N2 disease was present in 80%, whereas 20% had T3N0 or T3N1 lesions. Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and RT included no complete responses (CR), 21 (51%) partial responses (PR) or regressions, 19 (46%) stable disease (SD), and one (2%) progressive disease (PD). Thirty-one patients underwent surgery, and 25 were resected. In four of the 25 resection specimens, no viable tumor was present, whereas in three of the six unresectable patients, extensive biopsy results demonstrated only necrotic tumor. The maximum response achieved using all protocol treatment was 27 (66%) CRs, seven (17%) PRs or regression, six (15%) SDs, and one (2%) PD. Toxicity was substantial and primarily hematologic. There were six (15%) treatment-related deaths, which included three perioperative deaths and three chemotherapy-related toxicity deaths. The Kaplan-Meier curve indicated a 1-year survival of 58% and a median survival of 15.5 months. Nine patients (22%) remain disease-free. CONCLUSIONS: There was a reasonably high rate of PR associated with concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and RT, and a high percentage of patients who ultimately were rendered completely disease-free. However, treatment-related morbidity and mortality was common. Median survival seemed to be only modestly improved beyond that achieved with less intensive means of treatment. However, a group has emerged of patients who enjoy prolonged disease-free survival and possible cure.","['Strauss, G M', 'Herndon, J E', 'Sherman, D D', 'Mathisen, D J', 'Carey, R W', 'Choi, N C', 'Rege, V B', 'Modeas, C', 'Green, M R']","['Strauss GM', 'Herndon JE', 'Sherman DD', 'Mathisen DJ', 'Carey RW', 'Choi NC', 'Rege VB', 'Modeas C', 'Green MR']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'FVP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/pathology/radiotherapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology/radiotherapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.8.1237 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Aug;10(8):1237-44. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.8.1237.,"['CA12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A combined modality pilot study was performed to test the feasibility of adding warfarin to aggressive chemoradiotherapy for LD SCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin 45 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on day 1, cyclophosphamide 800 mg/m2 IV on day 1, and etoposide (ACE) 80 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 was given every 21 days for the first three courses. The fourth and fifth courses substituted cisplatin 33 mg/m2 IV on days 1 to 3 for the doxorubicin, with concurrent chest irradiation to a total of 4,000 cGy given in 20 fractions during a 4-week period followed by a boost of 1,000 cGy in five fractions during a 1-week period. Prophylactic cranial irradiation, 3,000 cGy was given concurrently in 10 fractions during a 2-week period. Courses 6 to 8 again used ACE chemotherapy, but courses 4 to 8 were given on a 28-day schedule with dose adjustment for hematologic or renal toxicity. Warfarin was given throughout the treatment period titrated to achieve a prothrombin time (PT) of 1.5 to 2 times the control. Patients with histologically proven limited-stage SCLC, good performance status, and normal renal, hematologic, and hepatic functions were eligible. RESULTS: Sixty-one of 66 patients entered onto the study were eligible and assessable. Fifty-four (89%) (95%) confidence interval [CI], 78% to 95%) experienced an objective response, 35 (57%) achieved a complete response (CR) (95% CI, 44% to 70%), and 17 (28%) achieved a partial response (95% CI, 16% to 39%). Median durations were CR, 26.3 months; failure-free survival, 11.8 months; and survival, 18 months. Forty-one percent of the patients were alive at 2 years, 33% were alive at 3 years, and 25% were alive at 4 or more years. Median follow-up for survivors is 5 years (range, 3.5 to 5.9 years). Severe or life-threatening myelosuppression occurred in 90%, infection occurred in 34%, fever without documented infection occurred in 26%, and pulmonary toxicity occurred in 6%. Another 6% of patients experienced severe or life-threatening hemorrhages. There were four treatment-related fatalities. The pulmonary toxicities have been associated with the resumption of ACE chemotherapy after chest irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: These highly encouraging response and survival results compare favorably with any prior CALGB group study. Although they are somewhat more toxic, they are comparable to the best published results. A randomized study that examines the role of warfarin is underway.","['Aisner, J', 'Goutsou, M', 'Maurer, L H', 'Cooper, R', 'Chahinian, P', 'Carey, R', 'Skarin, A', 'Slawson, R', 'Perry, M C', 'Green, M R']","['Aisner J', 'Goutsou M', 'Maurer LH', 'Cooper R', 'Chahinian P', 'Carey R', 'Skarin A', 'Slawson R', 'Perry MC', 'Green MR']","['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['5Q7ZVV76EI (Warfarin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Warfarin/*therapeutic use']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.8.1230 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Aug;10(8):1230-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.8.1230.,"['CA-04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['J Clin Oncol. 1993 Feb;11(2):383.

X-ray diffraction studies performed on envelope glycoproteins of influenza virus indicate that the NH2-terminal part of the external glycoprotein lies very close to the fusion peptide. The same overall structure seems to exist in human immunodeficiency virus as suggested by site-directed mutagenesis followed by syncytia induction assays. Our theoretical studies indicate that a segment expanding between residues 19 and 27 of gp51 probably adopts an amphipathic beta-strand structure. We hypothesize that the amphipathic 19-27 structure of gp51 plays an important role in the process of membrane fusion by interacting with the fusion peptide or with another region of gp30. Mutational analysis disrupting the amphipathy of the 19-27 region strongly altered the fusogenic capacity of the gp51-gp30 complex.","['Voneche, V', 'Callebaut, I', 'Kettmann, R', 'Brasseur, R', 'Burny, A', 'Portetelle, D']","['Voneche V', 'Callebaut I', 'Kettmann R', 'Brasseur R', 'Burny A', 'Portetelle D']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Fusion', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Fragments/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*physiology', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",1992/07/25 00:00,1992/07/25 00:01,['1992/07/25 00:00'],"['1992/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42164-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Jul 25;267(21):15193-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Comparison of key explanatory and outcome variables in five 2-year cohorts, from 1980 through 1981 to 1988 through 1989, using a large database of detailed clinical information. PATIENTS: Recipients (7788) of bone marrow transplants for acute lymphoblastic, acute myelogenous, or chronic myelogenous leukemia reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Milwaukee, Wis, by 185 transplant teams worldwide. RESULTS: Linear increases occurred during the periods 1980 through 1981 to 1988 through 1989 as follows with 95% confidence intervals: (1) transplants for chronic myelogenous leukemia from 14% +/- 2% to 35% +/- 2%; (2) transplants from unrelated donors from 1% +/- 1% to 7% +/- 1%; (3) preparative regimens without radiation from 3% +/- 1% to 30% +/- 2%; and (4) use of methotrexate plus cyclosporine to prevent graft-vs-host disease from 2% +/- 1% to 55% +/- 2%. Among recipients of human lymphocyte antigen-identical sibling bone marrow, the 2-year probability of treatment-related mortality decreased by 6% to 22%. The probability of relapse decreased from 46% +/- 6% to 38% +/- 6% in intermediate leukemia but did not change appreciably in early or advanced leukemia. Probabilities of leukemia-free survival improved from 51% +/- 4% to 57% +/- 3% in early leukemia, from 28% +/- 4% to 36% +/- 5% in intermediate leukemia, and from 12% +/- 4% to 18% +/- 5% in advanced leukemia. A separate analysis of a homogenous population of patients indicated that improvements in outcome in the 1980s were due to improvements in transplant practice rather than improved patient selection. CONCLUSIONS: Modest increases in leukemia-free survival rates occurred after human lymphocyte antigen-identical sibling bone marrow transplants in the 1980s. Improvements were due primarily to reductions in treatment-related mortality with little or no change in relapse risk. More effective antileukemia strategies and continued reductions in treatment-related toxic effects are needed.","['Bortin, M M', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Gale, R P', 'Barrett, A J', 'Champlin, R E', 'Dicke, K A', 'Gluckman, E', 'Kolb, H J', 'Marmont, A M', 'Mrsic, M']","['Bortin MM', 'Horowitz MM', 'Gale RP', 'Barrett AJ', 'Champlin RE', 'Dicke KA', 'Gluckman E', 'Kolb HJ', 'Marmont AM', 'Mrsic M', 'et al.']","['International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality/*trends', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/mortality/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'Tissue Donors/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Homologous/trends', 'Treatment Outcome']",1992/08/05 00:00,1992/08/05 00:01,['1992/08/05 00:00'],"['1992/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,JAMA. 1992 Aug 5;268(5):607-12.,['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The blockage is not overcome by deleting a large portion of the enhancer region (in U3) in recombinant retroviruses (M-MuLVneo delta Enh). This confirms the presence of negative elements outside the viral 82-bp repeats. However, a few sites in the genomes of EC cells permit M-MuLVneo delta Enh proviral expression. One such site, identified in PCC4, PCC3, and LT, was studied. The complete analysis of the mechanism of activation by Northern (RNA) blotting, cloning, and sequencing of partial cDNA copies of the viral transcript and of the site of integration establishes that viral transcripts are initiated from an upstream host-cell promoter and are spliced from a host donor to a cryptic viral acceptor at position 542 in the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) genome. In consequence, the mature transcripts are host cell-virus fusion transcripts from which M-MuLV sequences, including the cis-active negative elements of the 5' long terminal repeat-containing region, are absent. The provirus integrates apparently randomly into any of the three most proximal introns of the transcriptional unit. The host cell promoter contains a TATA box and 14 potential SpI binding sites included in a 1.0-kb GC-rich island. These elements promote gene expression of recombinant vectors in EC and differentiated cells. The mechanism described points to a mechanism by which retroviruses can be transcribed from upstream nonviral elements and can acquire host genes by 5' annexation of exons.","['Bonnerot, C', 'Legouy, E', 'Choulika, A', 'Nicolas, J F']","['Bonnerot C', 'Legouy E', 'Choulika A', 'Nicolas JF']","['Unite de Biologie moleculaire du Developpement, Institut Pasteur, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/growth & development', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/*genetics/growth & development', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Teratoma', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', '*Virus Activation', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.8.4982-4991.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Aug;66(8):4982-91. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.8.4982-4991.1992.,,,,PMC241349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interference assays have shown that MuLVs can be divided into four groups, each using a distinct receptor: ecotropic, polytropic, amphotropic, and 10A1. In this study, we have attempted to map the determinants within viral Env proteins by constructing chimeric env genes. Chimeras were made in all six pairwise combinations between Moloney MCF (a polytropic MuLV), amphotropic MuLV, and 10A1, using a conserved EcoRI site in the middle of the Env coding region. The receptor specificity of each chimera was determined by using an interference assay. We found that amphotropic receptor specificity of each chimera was determined by using an interference assay. We found that amphotropic receptor specificity seems to map to the N-terminal portion of surface glycoprotein gp70SU. The difference between amphotropic and 10A1 receptor specificity can be attributed to one or more of only six amino acid differences in this region. Nearly all other cases showed evidence of interaction between Env domains in the generation of receptor specificity. Thus, a chimera composed exclusively of MCF and amphotropic sequences was found to exhibit 10A1 receptor specificity. None of the chimeras were able to infect cells by using the MCF receptor; however, two chimeras containing the C-terminal portion of MCF gp70SU could bind to this receptor, while they were able to infect cells via the amphotropic receptor. This result raises the possibility that receptor binding maps to the C-terminal portion of MCF gp70SU but requires MCF N-terminal sequences for a functional interaction with the MCF receptor.","['Ott, D', 'Rein, A']","['Ott D', 'Rein A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Carcinogenesis, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702-1201.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Chimera', 'Cricetinae', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.8.4632-4638.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Aug;66(8):4632-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.8.4632-4638.1992.,['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC241286,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M33469', 'GENBANK/M33470', 'GENBANK/M55596', 'GENBANK/M55597']",,,,,,

Ultrastructural examination revealed that peroxidase reactivity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was relatively unchanged for 8 h and decreased between 12 and 24 h; however, ER lacked DAB-reactive peroxidase at 48-72 h. Peroxidase reactivity in the ER reappeared within 4 h after removal of SA. Seventy-two hours after exposure to SA the number of condensed cytoplasmic granules stained with DAB was significantly decreased, and many of the granules had a ""target"" appearance with a central DAB-reactive dense core. Staining of mitochondria was observed with overnight exposure to DAB and persisted in HL-60 cells treated 72 h with SA. Mitochondrial and nuclear morphology appeared unaltered. Immunostaining of MPO in thin sections of paraformaldehyde/glutaraldehyde-fixed unosmicated HL-60 cells, embedded in Lowicryl K4M, was accomplished with sequential exposure to an affinity-purified monospecific rabbit antibody to HL-60-MPO and protein A conjugated to 5- or 10-nm colloidal gold. Compared to untreated control HL-60 cells, cells exposed to SA for 48 h exhibited comparable to increased immunoreactive MPO in the ER, despite the absence of heme-dependent peroxidase reactivity. The data indicate that SA inhibits formation of enzymatically active MPO and that in the presence of SA, the ER contains a form(s) of MPO that lacks enzymatic reactivity.","['Castaneda, V L', 'Parmley, R T', 'Pinnix, I B', 'Raju, S G', 'Guzman, G S', 'Kinkade, J M Jr']","['Castaneda VL', 'Parmley RT', 'Pinnix IB', 'Raju SG', 'Guzman GS', 'Kinkade JM Jr']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio 78284-7810.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Heptanoates)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Heme/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Heptanoates/*pharmacology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/ultrastructure']",1992/08/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/08/11 19:15'],"['1992/08/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/08/11 19:15 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Aug;20(7):916-24.,['CA 22294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF-alpha caused a dose-dependent suppression of feline erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), whereas granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) were minimally affected. TNF-alpha concentrations as low as 200 pg/ml significantly inhibited growth of erythroid progenitors. Addition of polyclonal rabbit anti-TNF-alpha antibodies completely neutralized the suppressive effect of TNF-alpha on erythroid progenitors. At higher concentrations of TNF-alpha (800 pg/ml), 35% of CFU-E and 21% of BFU-E still survived, indicating that some erythroid progenitors are not sensitive to a single exposure of TNF-alpha in vitro. These results suggest that TNF-alpha may play a role in regulating hematopoiesis in cats and may be involved in the pathogenesis of erythroid aplasia in cats infected with feline leukemia virus.","['Khan, K N', 'Kociba, G J', 'Wellman, M L', 'Reiter, J A']","['Khan KN', 'Kociba GJ', 'Wellman ML', 'Reiter JA']","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cats', 'Erythrocytes, Abnormal/drug effects', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia, Feline/blood', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/*pharmacology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Aug;20(7):900-3.,['DK 41939/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of the compounds inhibited the growth of HL-60 effectively. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing activities of cells treated with the concentrations of these compounds for 50% inhibition of growth were compared. TI-66 (2,4-dibenzyl-6-fluoro-7,7,8,8-tetramethyl-cis-2,4-diazabicyclo-[4.2.0] octane-3,5-dione) was the most effective inducer of NBT-reducing activity and morphological differentiation of HL-60 cells into cells of the myelomonocytic lineage. TI-66 was also effective for induction of differentiation of another human myelogenous leukemia cell line, ML-1 cells, but not for differentiation of human erythroid leukemia K562 or HEL cells, or monocytic U937 cells. The effect of TI-66 in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells was additive or more than additive in combination with retinoic acid or vitamin D3. Adenine or hypoxanthine alone induced NBT-reducing activity of the cells, and at suboptimal concentrations these compounds enhanced the effect of TI-66, but the enhanced NBT-reducing activities did not exceed the maximal activity induced by TI-66 alone. Simultaneous treatment of HL-60 cells with hypoxanthine reduced the growth inhibition by TI-66 alone. TI-66 was about 150 times more potent on a molar basis than adenine in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells. These results suggest that nucleobase analogs such as TI-66 should be useful for differentiation therapy of some types of myelogenous leukemia.","['Makishima, M', 'Honma, Y', 'Hozumi, M', 'Sampi, K', 'Hattori, M', 'Ishikawa, I', 'Ogura, H', 'Motoyoshi, K']","['Makishima M', 'Honma Y', 'Hozumi M', 'Sampi K', 'Hattori M', 'Ishikawa I', 'Ogura H', 'Motoyoshi K']","['Saitama Cancer Center, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Uracil/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Aug;20(7):879-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We attempted to identify unusual tumor pairs that might provide a clue to shared genetic etiologies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records and tumor registry correspondence of 1,743 patients (0 to 18 years at diagnosis) were reviewed. For those said to have a second malignancy, biopsy and autopsy records and slides were reviewed to confirm initial and secondary diagnoses. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-eight patients had follow-up of at least 10 years and 157 of at least 20 years. Second malignancies were identified in 14 patients. The estimated cumulative incidence of a second cancer was approximately 1% within 10 years. At 20 years after diagnosis, the actuarial estimate was 3%. Although most second cancers were likely treatment related, several tumor pairs could not clearly be explained on that basis, including thyroid carcinoma followed by an ovarian sarcoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated with renal leiomyosarcoma. Based on one case in this series and a review of the literature, associations between Wilms' tumor, abdominal radiation, and adenocarcinoma of the colon and hepatocellular carcinoma are suggested. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that continued surveillance of very-long-term survivors of childhood cancer, which is usually accomplished by internists, family practitioners, and adult oncologists, may be one approach to defining the life-time incidence of second malignancies. In addition, although the yield is likely to be small, descriptions of unexpected tumor pairs may target families for studies of pleiotropic genetic abnormalities.","['Blatt, J', 'Olshan, A', 'Gula, M J', 'Dickman, P S', 'Zaranek, B']","['Blatt J', 'Olshan A', 'Gula MJ', 'Dickman PS', 'Zaranek B']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology', 'Pennsylvania/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Wilms Tumor/pathology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(92)90680-A [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(92)90680-a [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1992 Jul;93(1):57-60. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(92)90680-a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no significant correlation between data ranked from least to greatest amount of anti-viral antibody. Five cattle had persistent lymphocytosis (PL); all five were BLV-seropositive and two were BIV-positive. The mean anti-BLV titer was significantly greater in PL cattle, as compared at non-PL cattle, whereas there was no significant difference between the mean anti-BIV titer in PL cattle, as compared with non-PL cattle. These results provide additional information on the seroprevalence of naturally occurring BIV infection, and indicate that BIV can exist independent of other common infectious agents, such as BLV. Further, the results suggest that infection with BIV is not associated with an increased rate of infection with other infectious agents such as BLV.","['Cockerell, G L', 'Jensen, W A', 'Rovnak, J', 'Ennis, W H', 'Gonda, M A']","['Cockerell GL', 'Jensen WA', 'Rovnak J', 'Ennis WH', 'Gonda MA']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*epidemiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Lentivirus Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Prevalence']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0378-1135(92)90069-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1135(92)90069-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 1992 Jun 1;31(2-3):109-16. doi: 10.1016/0378-1135(92)90069-6.,"['CA43728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed the effect of different types of fatty acids, bound to serum proteins in physiological conditions, on the lipid composition and growth of human neoplastic B and T-cell lines and compared their effect on normal lymphocyte proliferation. Fatty acids with 0 to 2 unsaturations (stearic, oleic, and linoleic), at concentrations up to 50 or 100 microM did not significantly affect the proliferation of leukemic cells. However, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and mainly docosahexaenoic (22:6, n-3), were cytotoxic at concentrations greater than or equal to 20 microM after 48-72 h in culture. Simultaneous supplementation with vitamin E restored normal cell growth. The amount of end-products of lipid peroxidation in cells correlated with the observed toxicity but the amount of superoxides did not. Fatty acid supplementations increased cell triacylglycerol content but did not affect the degree of unsaturation of phospholipids, cholesterol/phospholipids molar ratio, or membrane fluidity. Glutathione-S-transferase activity was low in Raji and CEM cells, moderate in lymphocytes and high in Ramos cells and did not increase with supplementations. The proliferation of normal lymphocytes, which produced lower amounts of end-products of lipid perodixation, was not inhibited, but in some cases stimulated, by PUFA (with the exception of 30 microM 22:6). The extension of these results to situations in vivo could lead to use of PUFA for delaying leukemia progression or in adjuvant chemotherapy.","['Anel, A', 'Naval, J', 'Desportes, P', 'Gonzalez, B', 'Uriel, J', 'Pineiro, A']","['Anel A', 'Naval J', 'Desportes P', 'Gonzalez B', 'Uriel J', 'Pineiro A']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*toxicity', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*physiopathology', 'Lipid Peroxides/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Lipids/physiology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/pharmacology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Jul;6(7):680-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best immune responses occur in healthy children. Leukemic children have a 50% incidence of mild-to-moderate adverse effects but have a high degree of protection once immune reactions to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) have developed. Adult vaccinees have a lower degree of protection (70%) than children. Vaccinees who develop breakthrough varicella usually have a modified infection. Another significant advantage of vaccination is that in leukemic children it leads to a lower incidence of zoster than after natural chickenpox. It is possible to differentiate between vaccine-type and wild-type VZV using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and restriction endonuclease digestion. A new assay for antibodies to VZV measured by latex agglutination reveals that 8-10 years after vaccination antibodies are detectable in greater than 90% of leukemic children who have not had breakthrough varicella.,"['Gershon, A A', 'LaRussa, P', 'Hardy, I', 'Steinberg, S', 'Silverstein, S']","['Gershon AA', 'LaRussa P', 'Hardy I', 'Steinberg S', 'Silverstein S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Chickenpox/*prevention & control', 'Chickenpox Vaccine', 'Child', 'Herpes Zoster/prevention & control', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/immunology', 'United States', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/adverse effects/immunology', '*Viral Vaccines/adverse effects/immunology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/infdis/166.supplement_1.s63 [doi]'],ppublish,J Infect Dis. 1992 Aug;166 Suppl 1:S63-8. doi: 10.1093/infdis/166.supplement_1.s63.,,,,,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting chimeric gene encodes for a putative PML-RAR alpha fusion protein. PML is a putative transcriptional factor and RAR alpha is one of the nuclear retinoic acid receptors through which retinoic acid regulates gene expression. In this study, we investigated the retinoid binding and biochemical properties of the PML-RAR alpha protein by size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography and immunoblot analysis and compared them with those of normal RAR alpha. The introduction of the expression vector PSG5/PML-RAR alpha into COS-1 cells led to high levels of expression of the PML-RAR alpha fusion protein. This protein was primarily localized in the nucleus and bound retinoids with the same affinity and specificity as the wild type RAR alpha receptor. The PML-RAR alpha fusion protein, but not the RAR alpha, was found in high molecular weight complexes with either itself or other nuclear factors. In the acute promyelocytic leukemia-derived cell line NB4, which contains the t(15;17) chromosomal marker, the PML-RAR alpha product was also found as a high molecular complex. The interaction of the PML-RAR alpha with itself or with other nuclear proteins may be important in understanding the role of the PML-RAR alpha fusion protein in promyelocytic leukemogenesis.","['Nervi, C', 'Poindexter, E C', 'Grignani, F', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Lo Coco, F', 'Avvisati, G', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Jetten, A M']","['Nervi C', 'Poindexter EC', 'Grignani F', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Lo Coco F', 'Avvisati G', 'Pelicci PG', 'Jetten AM']","['Cell Biology Section, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Jul 1;52(13):3687-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of 49 patients.,451-8,"BACKGROUND: Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) has two peaks in distribution of incidence (in adults and children 1 to 2 years of age) and is frequently seen in children with Down syndrome. The current study was undertaken to disclose whether there were any differences between these groups. METHODS: Electron microscopic and ultrastructural cytochemical features of 49 children and adults with a AMKL or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in megakaryoblastic crisis were compared. RESULTS: Blast cells from children with AMKL, including those with and without Down syndrome, had immature features lacking typical alpha granules and a demarcation membrane system (DMS). However, blast cells from patients with AMKL with Down syndrome had more theta, electron-lucent, and basophil-like granules, suggesting that the blast cells had more potential to differentiate into other cell lines than megakaryocytes. The AMKL blast cells of adult patients showed a higher percentage of platelet peroxidase (PPO) positivity than other subgroups, and they occasionally contained typical alpha granules and DMS. This indicated that the blast cells of adults with AMKL were more mature than those of children and CML in megakaryoblastic crisis. CONCLUSIONS: By electron microscopic analysis, leukemic megakaryoblasts differed between children with AMKL with and without Down syndrome, adults with AMKL, and patients with CML in megakaryoblastic crisis.","['Eguchi, M', 'Ozawa, T', 'Sakakibara, H', 'Sugita, K', 'Iwama, Y', 'Furukawa, T']","['Eguchi M', 'Ozawa T', 'Sakakibara H', 'Sugita K', 'Iwama Y', 'Furukawa T']","['Second Department of Pediatrics, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/enzymology/pathology', 'Blood Platelets/enzymology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/ultrastructure', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intracellular Membranes/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Peroxidases/metabolism']",1992/07/15 00:00,1992/07/15 00:01,['1992/07/15 00:00'],"['1992/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19920715)70:2<451::aid-cncr2820700213>3.0.co;2-v [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Jul 15;70(2):451-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19920715)70:2<451::aid-cncr2820700213>3.0.co;2-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INTERVENTIONS: Animals infected experimentally were injected with three different isolates of the virus, administered either intracerebrally or intravenously, and sacrificed at 7 days, 1 and 6 months (intracerebral injection), and 2, 6 and 12 months (intravenous injection) post-inoculation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: General features of encephalopathy were found to be identical, regardless of the method of inoculation or the viral strain used. Moderate gliosis and glial nodules, sometimes associated with perivascular infiltrates and white matter pallor, were observed at 1 month (intracerebral injection) and 2 months (intravenous injection), and remained unchanged until 12 months post-inoculation. The fact that these initial stages are identical for intravenously and intracerebrally inoculated cats suggests that the virus enters the brain very quickly in intravenously infected animals. Encephalopathy in cats naturally infected with FIV only consisted of gliosis, glial nodules, white matter pallor, meningeal perivascular calcification and meningitis. These lesions were more frequent and more severe in the group coinfected with feline leukaemia virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus. Although multinucleated cells were rare, the strong similarities between HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus encephalopathies at comparable stages support the view that FIV infection may represent an interesting model for a physiopathological approach of HIV infection of the central nervous system.","['Hurtrel, M', 'Ganiere, J P', 'Guelfi, J F', 'Chakrabarti, L', 'Maire, M A', 'Gray, F', 'Montagnier, L', 'Hurtrel, B']","['Hurtrel M', 'Ganiere JP', 'Guelfi JF', 'Chakrabarti L', 'Maire MA', 'Gray F', 'Montagnier L', 'Hurtrel B']","['Unit of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Ecole Nationale Veterinaire de Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Encephalitis/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Female', '*Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Lentivirus Infections/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Male']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002030-199204000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS. 1992 Apr;6(4):399-406. doi: 10.1097/00002030-199204000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were cultured in fetal bovine serum free RPMI-1640 containing the test-reagents for 48 hours. PAI-2 and u-PA antigens were measured by ELISA kits. PMA, an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), markedly increased both PAI-2 and u-PA production in each cell line. On the other hand, cAMP increased PAI-2 production in PL-21 cells, but decreased u-PA synthesis in RC-K8 cells. Similar to cAMP, Dex also increased PAI-2 production but decreased u-PA production in RC-K8 cells. Moreover, PMA and cAMP synergistically increased the PAI-2 production. This was verified by Western blot, using a monoclonal antibody against the PAI-2. These two cell lines are, therefore, useful for clarifying the role of A kinase and C kinase on PAI-2 and u-PA synthesis in human hemopoietic cells.","['Niiya, K', 'Sakuragawa, N']","['Niiya K', 'Sakuragawa N']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Rinsho,Nihon rinsho.

The sensitivity of human lymphocytic leukemic MOLT-4 and promyelocytic HL-60 leukemic cells to a wide range of FST concentrations was studied by analyzing the cell cycle-specific effects and changes in nuclear chromatin induced by this inhibitor. The latter was evaluated by assaying the sensitivity of DNA in situ to acid-induced denaturation cytofluorimetrically, with the use of the metachromatic fluorochrome acridine orange (AO), which differentially stains double-stranded and denatured DNA. The cytostatic effects were observed soon after addition of FST (at concentrations of 1-30 microM for MOLT-4 cultures and 1-5 microM for HL-60 cultures) as a perturbation of cell progression through S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Cell progression through the cycle was halted at greater than 30 microM FST in MOLT-4 cultures and at greater than 5 microM in HL-60 cultures; the effect was instantaneous and affected all phases of the cycle, so that no changes in the cell cycle distribution were apparent with increasing length of exposure to the drug. Instead, at these high FST concentrations, immediate cytotoxic effects became evident, manifesting either as cell apoptosis or necrosis. Apoptosis was observed only in the case of HL-60 cells, at FST concentrations of 5-100 microM, and was characterized by markedly increased sensitivity of DNA to denaturation combined with a decrease in overall DNA stainability, either with the DNA-specific dye DAPI or with AO, indicative of the activation of endogenous nucleases. Necrotic cell death was observed at FST concentrations of 1 mM and at greater than 30 microM for HL-60 and MOLT-4 cells, respectively: in both cases the overall DNA stainability, with either DAPI or AO, was unchanged compared to the control, but their DNA was very sensitive to denaturation. Interestingly, DNA in G2 and late S phase MOLT-4 cells, which were undergoing necrotic death, was much more sensitive to denaturation than was DNA in G1 cells of this lineage. The data indicate that chromatin changes induced by DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors in cells that undergo apoptotic or necrotic death can be conveniently monitored by the assay of DNA in situ sensitivity to denaturation.","['Hotz, M A', 'Traganos, F', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Hotz MA', 'Traganos F', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'F30N4O6XVV (Acridine Orange)', 'ZO1648L551 (fostriecin)']",IM,"['Acridine Orange', 'Alkenes/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/drug effects', 'Chromatin/*chemistry', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Polyenes', 'Pyrones', 'S Phase/drug effects', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(92)90362-C [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(92)90362-c [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1992 Jul;201(1):184-91. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(92)90362-c.,"['CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA 23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In C57L/J mice, infection resulted in a rapid increase in plasma IgM and IgG2a, and the elevation of IgG2a persisted undiminished for 21 weeks. Levels of IgG2b also became slightly elevated, but those of IgG1 and IgG3 were not significantly affected. Plasma of 6 to 7-month-old C57BL/6 mice contained already high levels of IgM (30-40 mg/ml), which persisted undiminished in uninfected mice but decreased progressively in infected mice to 10% of the original concentration during 25 weeks of observation. In C57BL/6 mice, plasma IgG1 and IgG2b as well as IgG2a became similarly elevated after infection but also only transiently. Their levels began to decrease progressively about 10 weeks after infection and fell to far below the maximum concentration observed. The drastic loss of plasma IgM and IgGs observed in C57BL/6 mice during the later stages of MAIDS MuLV infection did not seem to be a consequence of the polyclonal activation of B cells per se but seemed to reflect additional immunological abnormalities arising in infected C57BL/6 but not C57L/J mice. In both mouse strains these changes in plasma Ig levels correlated with the formation of Ig-containing immune complexes that bound to high-affinity, protein-binding ELISA plates in the absence of antigen coating, which may represent unusual forms of self-antigen-antibody complexes.","['Even, C', 'Hu, B', 'Erickson, L', 'Plagemann, P G']","['Even C', 'Hu B', 'Erickson L', 'Plagemann PG']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/*blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Disease Susceptibility/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunoglobulins/*analysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology/pathogenicity', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/immunology/microbiology', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*immunology/microbiology', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Species Specificity']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/vim.1992.5.39 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 1992 Spring;5(1):39-50. doi: 10.1089/vim.1992.5.39.,"['AI 15267/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 27320/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors have produced a line of chickens transgenic for a defective ALV provirus that expresses envelope glycoprotein, but not infectious virus, and is very resistant to infection with Subgroup A ALV. In the present experiment the authors sought to prevent or reduce congenital transmission by mating viremic-tolerant hens to males carrying the inserted provirus, thus introducing a gene for resistance into the progeny. Mature viremic females were mated with males hemizygous for the transgene to produce over 80 progeny each with and without the transgene. The chicks were hatched and maintained for 36 wk and observed for viremia, antibody, and the incidence of bursal lymphomas. Over 90% of the transgene-negative controls remained viremic through 36 wk of age and 51% developed bursal lymphomas. In contrast, 27% of the transgene-positive birds remained viremic and 18% died with bursal lymphomas.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of the children with ALL, CNS prophylaxis included no CRT in six, 18 Gy CRT in five, 20 Gy CRT in seven, and 24 Gy CRT in five. Three additional children experienced CNS relapse and received total CRT doses of 24, 40, and 44 Gy. All children received neuropsychologic testing; children with ALL also participated in diagnostic imaging studies. RESULTS: As a group, the children who were treated for ALL did not differ significantly from those who were treated for Wilms' tumor on objective measures of global functional status. However, children treated for ALL had a significantly lower mean intelligence quotient (IQ) (87 v 96), poorer performance on four of six measures of visual and auditory memory, lower achievement with regard to arithmetic skills, and a greater frequency of special educational intervention than those who were treated for Wilms' tumor. IQ and auditory memory performance in the ALL group was correlated inversely with time since the completion of therapy and total CRT dose. CONCLUSIONS: These results reinforce the contemporary trend of prophylactic CRT omission in very young children except for those who are at risk for CNS relapse. For infants and very young children who require CRT, evidence is presented that supports the approach for the delay of CRT until the child is older.","['Mulhern, R K', 'Kovnar, E', 'Langston, J', 'Carter, M', 'Fairclough, D', 'Leigh, L', 'Kun, L E']","['Mulhern RK', 'Kovnar E', 'Langston J', 'Carter M', 'Fairclough D', 'Leigh L', 'Kun LE']","[""Division of Psychology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101-0318.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Electroencephalography', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Kidney Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Wilms Tumor/radiotherapy']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.7.1095 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Jul;10(7):1095-102. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.7.1095.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nude-passaged cell lines were rejected by immunocompetent H-2q NIH mice, were recognized by specific CTL clones, and expressed new retroviral Ag. The aim of the present work was to investigate whether somatically acquired proviral sequences were present in the genome of nude-passaged cells and to test directly for a causative relationship between murine leukemia virus (MuLV) expression and immunogenicity. Southern blot analysis of PstI-digested DNA indicated that in contrast to the parental NIH/3T3 transformed cell lines (pT, T12N/5a, NS-1) all the nude-passaged immunogenic variants (pT-nude, T12N/5a-nude, NS-1-nude) contained newly acquired ecotropic-related proviruses. Immediately after in vitro establishment, these tumors displayed multiple integration sites as assessed by analysis of 3' proviral-cellular junctions. Long term in vitro culture of one of the cell lines (pT-nude) resulted in a cell line (pT-nude/vitro) that was clonal or oligo-clonal with respect to viral integration. Northern blot analysis established that the new proviruses were actively transcribed in all the immunogenic variants. To assess whether the somatically acquired ecotropic proviral sequences encode for target structures recognized by specific CTL, obtained after immunization of NIH mice with pT-nude, the parental cell line pT was transfected with plasmids containing the entire AKV MuLV genome, the cloned AKV gag or env genes. Screening of transfectants for their ability to stimulate the production of TNF by anti-pT-nude effectors indicated that cells transfected with the entire ecotropic virus or with MuLV-env gene products could be recognized by an NIH anti-pT-nude CTL line and NIH anti-pT-nude Kq-restricted CTL clones as well as the immunizing target pT-nude.","['Sensi, M', 'Bergomi, M', 'Panceri, P', 'Castelli, C', 'Lupetti, R', 'Traversari, C', 'Carbone, G', 'Parmiani, G']","['Sensi M', 'Bergomi M', 'Panceri P', 'Castelli C', 'Lupetti R', 'Traversari C', 'Carbone G', 'Parmiani G']","['Division of Experimental Oncology D, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/growth & development', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude/immunology/microbiology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/*microbiology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Jul 1;149(1):277-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In seven lines (19.4%), cells with trisomy 12 were noted, with clonality in two of these lines. In two of 11 metaphases with such trisomy, chromosome 12 was involved in structural rearrangements [t(8;12)(q12;p12) and t(12;12)(q11;q24)]. No cells with trisomy 12 were observed in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated PBL cultures of these individuals. In 250 individuals (normal and with nonhematologic malignancies) examined in our laboratory in the last 5 years, extra copies of chromosome 12 in PHA-stimulated PBL cultures were observed in only five of 23,216 cells (0.02%). There were no cases of clonality in these samples. The frequency of an extra chromosome 12 was comparable to that of the other chromosomes except 21 and X, whose frequency of occurrence was 0.08% and 0.09%, respectively. These findings should be considered random events in PHA-stimulated PBL. On the contrary, in lymphoblastoid cell lines established by EBV transformation, trisomy of chromosome 12 was the most frequent numerical abnormality. It was observed in 64.7% of all cases with chromosome gains and therefore could not be considered a random occurrence. The specificity of this phenomenon for EBV transformation is supported by the results of cytogenetic analysis of eight lymphoblastoid cell lines established by an alternative procedure in our laboratory [1]. In 400 cells analyzed not a single cell with trisomy 12 was observed. We suggest that EBV transformation might either randomly induce formation of such cells in immortalized B-cell populations or show potentially blastomogenic cells or proneness to their formation in certain individuals who could be predisposed to develop lymphoproliferative diseases, especially chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in which trisomy of chromosome 12 is the most common alteration.","['Risin, S', 'Hopwood, V L', 'Pathak, S']","['Risin S', 'Hopwood VL', 'Pathak S']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas M.

This syndrome is distinct clinically, pathologically and cytogenetically from classical therapy-related myelodysplasia and AML. There is also evidence that other topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as the intercalating agents (including doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and actinomycin D) may be leukemogenic. Furthermore, there may be further interactions from concomitant topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents. Topoisomerase II inhibitors induce DNA cleavage and other chromosomal aberrations, including sister chromatid exchanges. These clastogenic abnormalities are not fully understood, and may be specific for each cytotoxic agent. Work is in progress to clone breakpoints such as the t(9;11) and t(8;21) and the use of the resultant DNA probes will enhance our understanding of the leukemogenic process. Given the potential diversity in patients with secondary leukemia, cytogenetic studies should be mandatory for both enhancing our knowledge base and guiding treatment in individual patients. Clinicians must also be wary of the leukemogenic potential of 'dose-intense' regimens including agents such as etoposide and doxorubicin.","['Ratain, M J', 'Rowley, J D']","['Ratain MJ', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/chemically induced/*enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/*enzymology/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*enzymology/etiology/genetics', 'Podophyllotoxin/adverse effects', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058121 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)65150-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1992 Feb;3(2):107-11. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058121.,['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Ann Oncol. 1992 Nov;3(9):772.

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: A university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty consecutive patients with recurrent or refractory germ cell tumors treated at Indiana University between September 1986 and June 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with high-dose carboplatin (900 to 2000 mg/m2 body surface area) and etoposide (1200 mg/m2). Three patients also received ifosfamide (10 g/m2). All patients had autologous bone marrow rescue. Of the 40 study patients, 26 received two full courses of therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Patient charts were reviewed to determine the rate and duration of complete and partial remission and the number of long-term, disease-free survivors. The influence of cisplatin-refractory disease and the site of the primary tumor on the incidence of remission and survival were also investigated. RESULTS: Of the 40 study patients, 26 (65%) responded to treatment; 12 (30%) achieved a complete response, and 14 (35%) achieved a partial response. Of the 12 complete responders, 5 relapsed, and 1 died of treatment-related acute leukemia 27.5 months after treatment without evidence of germ cell cancer. Six (15%) of the original 40 patients, of whom 3 were refractory to cisplatin, remained in complete remission after at least 24 months of follow-up. Eight of 40 patients had primary mediastinal germ cell tumors with no complete remissions and a median survival of 2 months (range, 0.5 to 9.0 months). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with high-dose carboplatin and etoposide in conjunction with autologous bone marrow rescue in patients with relapsed or refractory germ cell tumors is a potentially curative therapeutic option, even for heavily pretreated or cisplatin-refractory patients. Some degree of disease resistance to cisplatin can be overcome with dose escalation of platinum compounds. Patients with multiple recurrences of relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal germ cell tumors were not helped by this approach.","['Broun, E R', 'Nichols, C R', 'Kneebone, P', 'Williams, S D', 'Loehrer, P J', 'Einhorn, L H', 'Tricot, G J']","['Broun ER', 'Nichols CR', 'Kneebone P', 'Williams SD', 'Loehrer PJ', 'Einhorn LH', 'Tricot GJ']","['Indiana University Hospital, Indianapolis, Indiana.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,['Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1992/07/15 00:00,1992/07/15 00:01,['1992/07/15 00:00'],"['1992/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-117-2-124 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1992 Jul 15;117(2):124-8. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-117-2-124.,['R35 CA 38844-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of Epstein-Barr virus in a subset of peripheral T-cell lymphomas.,1315-25,"This study analyzes the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) arising in patients without pre-existing overt immunodeficiency. The authors examined 201 lymphomas (105 high-grade B-cell, 82 peripheral T-cell, 7 high-grade non-B-cell, non-T-cell, and 7 hairy-cell leukemia) for EBV gene expression by immunohistologic procedures using monoclonal antibodies to EBV latent, immediate early, and replicative infection antigens. Transformation-associated EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP 1) was detected in 13 (6%) NHL, comprising 4 (4%) high-grade B-cell, 8 (10%) peripheral T-cell, and 1 non-B-cell, non-T-cell lymphomas. Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma of T-cell type was consistently LMP 1-negative. EBV nuclear antigen 2 was demonstrated in only three (1%) cases. Induction of replication as defined by expression of the immediate early BamHI Z leftward reading frame 1 (BZLF1) protein was detected in five cases, but early (EA) and late (VCA and MA) lytic cycle antigens were only found in two cases and in one case, respectively. The presence of EBV was confirmed by in situ DNA hybridization in 9 of 11 EBV antigen-positive lymphomas. This study shows the surprisingly frequent presence of EBV in peripheral T-cell NHL in European patients without pre-existing overt immunodeficiency. Interestingly, most sporadic B-cell NHL are not associated with the virus. Furthermore, the usefulness of selected monoclonal antibodies for the routine immunohistological diagnosis of EBV infection was confirmed.","['Hamilton-Dutoit, S J', 'Pallesen, G']","['Hamilton-Dutoit SJ', 'Pallesen G']","['Laboratory of immunohistology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (BZLF1 protein, Herpesvirus 4, Human)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*microbiology/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Trans-Activators', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1992 Jun;140(6):1315-25.,,,,PMC1886555,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To inhibit BLV replication, a recombinant plasmid pAGR with an antisense RNA gene targeted at the R-U5 region (147th-342th nt) of the viral genome has been engineered. Cotransfection of CC81 cells with infectious BLV DNA and pAGR led to effective inhibition of BLV replication by the antisense RNA, evidenced by a drop in the number of syncytia and reverse transcriptase activity.

Since HIV-1 seropositive individuals have high numbers of B cells carrying Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and are at high risk for development of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases, we studied the mode of HIV-1 infection in four EBV-positive lymphoblastoid B-cell lines (LCLs) as well as some molecular and biological features of the B cells infected by both viruses. We found that LCL cells were successfully infected in vitro by HIV-1, despite the lack of CD4 antigen expression on the cell membrane. LCL cells displayed a persistent, productive, and non-cytopathic infection. Moreover, HIV-1 infection induced reactivation of EBV latent genomes in one cell line. Following HIV-1 infection, LCL cells showed a decrease in B-cell activation markers CD23 and CD39, and an increase in CD10 immature B-cell antigen. Not all cells in each LCL expressed HIV-1 antigens, but all CD10+ cells also co-expressed the HIV-1 envelope protein gp 120. Furthermore, HIV-1 infected LCL cells grew as disperse suspensions, and formed more agar colonies than control, non-HIV-1-infected LCLs. These findings raise the possibility that HIV-1 might play a role in EBV reactivation, and in B-cell lymphoma pathogenesis in AIDS patients.","['De Rossi, A', 'Calabro, M L', ""D'Andrea, E"", 'Panozzo, M', 'Saggiori, D', 'Mammano, F', 'Roncella, S', 'Ferrarini, M', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L']","['De Rossi A', 'Calabro ML', ""D'Andrea E"", 'Panozzo M', 'Saggiori D', 'Mammano F', 'Roncella S', 'Ferrarini M', 'Chieco-Bianchi L']","['Institute of Oncology, University of Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.5 (Apyrase)', 'EC 3.6.1.5 (CD39 antigen)']",IM,"['*Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Apyrase', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'HIV Infections/*microbiology/pathology', '*HIV-1', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'Virus Activation']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992;6 Suppl 3:38S-40S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is in contrast to other primate colonies and wild monkeys, which have low seroprevalence and very few if any ATL-type T-cell malignancies. To characterize the type of T-cell lymphoma retrovirus involved in the Sukhumi disease, a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) DNA analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and of various tissues of healthy ""at-risk"", or ill baboons was performed. Proviral STLV/HTLV sequences were detected in all monkeys with symptoms of T-cell malignancy and/or antibodies to STLV-I/HTLV-I. For precise identification and characterization of the Sukhumi T-cell lymphoma virus, parts of the virus genome were mapped and sequenced from PCR derived fragments. A 420 nucleotide fragment of the env (gp 46) gene (analysed from 3 different DNA's) revealed 16.2% nucleotide divergence to the Japanese strain of HTLV-I and 14.8% to the Japanese strain of STLV-I including one deletion of a triplet. On the level of amino acid (a.a) sequence this revealed an exchange of 6 a.a. to STLV-I (4.3%), but only of 4 a.a. to HTLV-I (2.8%). The analysis of 120 nucleotides of the tax sequence (identical in 6 different DNAs) resulted in 5% nucleotide divergence to the HTLV-I (2.4% on the a.a. level) and 10% (7.3% a.a.) to the STLV-1. These results indicate that the Sukhumi T-cell lymphoma virus is a representative of the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus family, apparently more closely related to HTLV-I than to STLV-I genome. Furthermore, the infected monkeys from Sukhumi develop at a high rate a T-cell malignancy not observed among other baboons carrying STLV.","['Schatzl, H', 'Yakovleva, L', 'Lapin, B', 'Rose, D', 'Inzhiia, L', 'Gaedigk-Nitschko, K', 'Deinhardt, F', 'von der Helm, K']","['Schatzl H', 'Yakovleva L', 'Lapin B', 'Rose D', 'Inzhiia L', 'Gaedigk-Nitschko K', 'Deinhardt F', 'von der Helm K']","['Max von Pettenkofer Institute, University of Munich, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry', '*Genes, env', '*Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/microbiology', 'Lymphocytes/*chemistry/microbiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Papio', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992;6 Suppl 3:158S-160S.,,,"['env', 'tax']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other recombinants within the env genes of FeLV-A and endogenous FeLV are recognized as belonging to a second subgroup, FeLV-B, the presence of which is correlated with an increased risk of infection with FeLV and a higher incidence of leukemia. Mutants of FeLV which affect the env gene are phenotypically of a third subgroup, FeLV-C, and have a close association with erythroid aplasia.

This paper reviews progress in research related to natural infection and its control. Subgroup A ALVs causing lymphoid leukosis are the most common viruses in the field, but variant viruses can arise and cause losses. In Israel in recent years, epidemic outbreaks of haemangiosarcomas caused by a virus of unusual cytopathogenicity have occurred. In the UK, an ALV belonging to a new subgroup for chickens has been recently isolated; this virus is able to cause myeloid leukosis and nephromas. ALV infection of commercial stock is controlled by virus eradication schemes that prevent vertical transmission of ALV from one generation to the next. In this regard, endogenous leukosis viruses and ev loci, notably ev21 linked to the K slow-feathering gene, have been shown to have a detrimental influence on responses to infection by exogenous ALVs, and on the success of eradication schemes. Tolerogenic properties of the ev loci are involved. Attention has also been directed to whether ev loci have any direct influence on performance traits. Although eradication provides the main means of controlling ALV, the development of transgenic techniques in chickens has renewed interest in genetic resistance, and some progress has also been made in developing recombinant vaccines.","['Payne, L N']",['Payne LN'],"['AFRC Institute for Animal Health, Houghton Laboratory, Huntington, Cambs, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animal Husbandry/methods', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics/microbiology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/isolation & purification', 'Research']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992;6 Suppl 3:150S-152S.,,,,,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,

Restriction of energy intake reduces the number of fat cells in fat depots whether the restriction is started soon after weaning or in adult life. The capacity for diet to modulate fat cell number is maintained through most, if not all, of the life span. Restriction of energy intake delayed death due to neoplasms; restriction of dietary fat or protein without restriction of energy did not have this action. In the case of leukemia/lymphoma, the data indicated that it was the age of occurrence that was delayed by the restriction of energy intake. Because restriction of dietary energy maintains most physiologic systems in a youthful state and retards a broad spectrum of disease processes, the importance of its effects on cellularity and cell proliferation in its anti-aging action remains to be established.","['Masoro, E J']",['Masoro EJ'],"['Department of Physiology, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio 78284-7756.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Lab Anim Sci,Laboratory animal science,1266503,,IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology/physiology', 'Aging/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', '*Diet', 'Energy Intake/*physiology', 'Homeostasis/*physiology', 'Longevity', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/mortality', 'Rodentia/*physiology']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Anim Sci. 1992 Apr;42(2):132-7.,,,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attachment of myristic acid to the N terminus of the Gag precursor polyprotein has been shown to be essential for membrane localization and virus morphogenesis. Here, we report that the matrix (MA) protein contains regions that in conjunction with myristylation are important for Gag protein stability and the assembly of murine leukemia viruses. We identified these domains by generating a series of Akv murine leukemia virus mutants carrying small in-frame deletions within the coding region of the MA protein encompassing 129 amino acids. Studies show that mutants with deletions within the segment encoding the first 102 amino acids were all replication defective, whereas the C-terminal residues 103 to 124 seem not to have any critical function in virus maturation. Cells expressing the replication-defective genomes did not release any detectable Gag proteins. In one mutant, deletion of 3 amino acids in the N terminus resulted in an inefficiently myristylated, stable Gag polyprotein. The remaining defect genomes encoded unstable Gag proteins, although they were modified with myristic acid.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether intracellular pathways responsible for antigen- or mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis were also responsible for induction of BLV expression. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-3-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (3-methyl H7) decreased blastogenesis in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, in unstimulated, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated and phorbol ester (PMA)-stimulated BLV-infected PBMC. Similarly, 3-methyl H7 decreased BLV expression, as measured by production of gp51 envelope antigen or p24gag antigen, in BLV-infected PBMC under the same conditions. Using an RNase protection assay, the inhibition of BLV expression by 3-methyl H7 was shown to be due to decreased transcriptional activity. The cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA1004) did not inhibit either BLV expression or blastogenesis of BLV-infected bovine PBMC. Additional evidence for the PKC-dependent expression of BLV was obtained by using a persistently BLV-infected B-lymphocyte cell line, NBC-13. Activation of PKC by PMA in NBC-13 cells increased BLV expression. 3-methyl H7 decreased the PMA-induced expression of BLV in NBC-13 cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas HA1004 did not inhibit this expression. These results identify a mechanism for the induction of BLV expression through PKC activation and therefore indicate that latency and replication of BLV is controlled by normal B-lymphocyte intracellular signaling pathways.","['Jensen, W A', 'Wicks-Beard, B J', 'Cockerell, G L']","['Jensen WA', 'Wicks-Beard BJ', 'Cockerell GL']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/microbiology', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/microbiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Leukemia/microbiology/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/drug effects/*physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/enzymology/microbiology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.7.4427-4433.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Jul;66(7):4427-33. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.7.4427-4433.1992.,,,,PMC241250,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the experiments reported herein, we compared the gene expression of the murine ecotropic retroviral receptor (ERR) and its human homolog (H13) in rapidly proliferating cells versus resting cells using four different systems. (i) The expression of ERR gene is enhanced during activation of T and B lymphocytes by concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide, respectively. Similar enhancement is observed by adding phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or calcium ionophore (A23187). These phenomena appear to involve protein kinase C; two PMA analogs, 4 alpha-phorbol and 4 alpha-PMA, lacking the ability to activate protein kinase C fail to induce elevated levels of gene expression, and the protein kinase C inhibitor, H7 [1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride[, inhibits the enhancement induced by PMA. (ii) Friend murine leukemia virus induces rapid splenomegaly, and acute erythroleukemia in sensitive mice. Concomitantly with splenomegaly, ERR gene expression in spleen cells increases dramatically. (iii) The level of expression of the ERR or H13 gene in a variety of tumor cells is highly elevated compared with the level in noncancerous cells. (iv) H13 gene expression decreases upon terminal differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 into granulocytes or macrophages by dimethyl sulfoxide or PMA, respectively.

Growth inhibition induced by 3'-NH2-dCyd was dependent on the levels of anabolic enzymes, particularly dCyd kinase (dCydK), whereas cytotoxicity induced by ara-C was dependent on the expression of both anabolic and catabolic enzyme activities. Competition kinetics using purified enzyme revealed that the binding affinity of ara-C to dCydK was 5-fold that of the amino analog. However, this binding advantage is apparently offset in cells that contain high levels of dCydD, since the Ki values for this enzyme were 0.2 and 23 mM for ara-C and 3'-NH2-dCyd, respectively. This was reflected in the decrease in analog sensitivity observed between the two cell lines, whereby the concentrations of ara-C and 3'-NH2-dCyd required to inhibit growth by 50% were 200 and 7 times higher, respectively, in the dCydD-containing HeLa cells as compared with the dCydD-deficient L1210 cells. The metabolic stability and cytotoxicity of 3'-NH2-dCyd was independent of cell number. An unexpected finding was the extent to which the effectiveness of ara-C could be mitigated by the number of dCydD-containing cells. A completely cytotoxic concentration of ara-C was rendered nontoxic by a 10-fold increase in cell number. This observation was supported by an increase in I-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (ara-U) formation, a decrease in ara-C 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) accumulation, and a rise in cell viability with increasing cell number. These findings indicate that unlike ara-C, the effectiveness of 3'-NH2-dCyd is independent of the level of deaminase, which suggests its possible utility in situations in which high levels of deaminase are manifest.","['Mancini, W R']",['Mancini WR'],"['Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '6L3XT8CB3I (Zalcitabine)', ""84472-90-2 (3'-amino-2',3'-dideoxycytidine)"", 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (deoxycytidine deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Deoxycytidine/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Zalcitabine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686406 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1992;30(2):139-44. doi: 10.1007/BF00686406.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results show that immunocompromised mice fed low levels of dietary protein form significantly increased immunogenic lipid peroxidation adducts during cocaine treatment.","['Odeleye, O E', 'Lopez, M C', 'Smith, B T', 'Eskelson, C D', 'Watson, R R']","['Odeleye OE', 'Lopez MC', 'Smith BT', 'Eskelson CD', 'Watson RR']","['Department of Family Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Canada,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,0372712,"['0 (Triglycerides)', 'EC 2.6.1.- (Transaminases)', 'I5Y540LHVR (Cocaine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/*etiology/pathology', 'Cocaine/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/complications/physiopathology', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Organ Size', 'Protein-Energy Malnutrition/*complications', 'Retroviridae Infections/*complications', 'Steatitis/chemically induced/metabolism', 'Transaminases/blood', 'Triglycerides/metabolism']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1139/y92-042 [doi]'],ppublish,Can J Physiol Pharmacol. 1992 Mar;70(3):338-43. doi: 10.1139/y92-042.,"['AA-08037/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA-04827/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two markedly distinct cDNAs coding for formyl peptide receptors have recently been isolated from a rabbit and a human cDNA library respectively. To examine the hitherto unknown signal transduction properties of the formyl peptide receptor encoded by the human cDNA, we have used the PCR to clone this cDNA from poly(A)+ RNA of myeloid differentiated human leukaemia (HL-60) cells, and have injected the cDNA-derived receptor cRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes. Receptor activity was determined electrophysiologically by measuring the agonist-dependent opening of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)-independent Cl- channels. Injection of pure formyl peptide receptor cRNA did not lead to peptide-dependent changes in membrane current. In contrast, marked alterations of membrane current were observed in response to formyl peptides when the receptor cRNA was supplemented with poly(A)+ RNA isolated from undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Injection of the latter RNA did not lead to formyl-peptide-dependent alterations of membrane current. Binding studies using a radioiodinated formyl peptide revealed that injection of formyl peptide receptor cRNA alone led to expression of the formyl peptide receptor on the oocyte surface, and that co-injection of poly(A)+ RNA from undifferentiated HL-60 cells did not alter the level of receptor expression. Size fractionation of poly(A)+ RNA from undifferentiated HL-60 cells showed that the mRNA required to complement formyl-peptide-dependent signal transduction in oocytes had a size of approx. 3-3.5 kb. These results strongly suggest that the human formyl peptide receptor requires a specific cofactor(s), which is lacking in Xenopus oocytes but is present in undifferentiated HL-60 cells, to activate the second messenger pathway in oocytes. Identification of this factor will provide important information about the molecular mechanisms by which G-protein-coupled granulocyte-activating receptors stimulate phospholipase C.","['Schultz, P', 'Stannek, P', 'Voigt, M', 'Jakobs, K H', 'Gierschik, P']","['Schultz P', 'Stannek P', 'Voigt M', 'Jakobs KH', 'Gierschik P']","['Pharmakologisches Institut, Universitat Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Oocytes/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenopus laevis/genetics/*physiology']",1992/05/15 00:00,1992/05/15 00:01,['1992/05/15 00:00'],"['1992/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2840207 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1992 May 15;284 ( Pt 1):207-12. doi: 10.1042/bj2840207.,,,,PMC1132717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis showed rearrangement of one allele of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene while the immunoglobulin kappa and T-cell receptor beta chain genes were in the germline configuration. Thus, the immunophenotypic and molecular findings in this case correspond to an early stage of B-cell differentiation, the pre-pre B-cell stage as has been named by others. In contrast with LBL of immature T-cell lineage, precursor B-cell LBLs involving the mediastinum are truly rare. Occasional cases have been reported that have arisen elsewhere and subsequently involved the mediastinum at time of relapse or tumor progression. Well-documented examples of immature B-cell LBL arising in the mediastinum are virtually unreported. The site and cell population giving rise to this neoplasm is unknown.

Its biological effect is a highly regulated process that is controlled by specific proteins. In the nucleus, different retinoic acid receptors have been identified and their genes cloned. In the cytosol, retinoid binding proteins, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein and cellular retinol-binding protein, have been correlated with normal and malignant tissue differentiation. Recently, differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemias (AML3 subtype) with all-trans-retinoic acid has been shown to be an efficient alternative to chemotherapy. The retinoic acid receptor alpha gene has been shown to be specifically rearranged in AML3 through the t(15;17) translocation. The molecular basis of the effect to reverse the leukemic phenotype of all-trans-retinoic acid is not yet elucidated. To further study retinoic acid efficacy in AML3 leukemia, retinoic acid-binding proteins were studied in the cytosol extracts of hematopoietic cells. No retinoic acid binding activity was detected in normal or malignant hematopoietic cells whether sensitive or not to retinoic acid. However, detectable binding to a cytosolic protein corresponding to cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (M(r) 15,000, Kd 3 nM) was observed in the bone marrow cells of AML3 patients undergoing all-trans-retinoic acid therapy.

We have compared the binding and Ca2+ mobilizing properties of various full agonists, partial agonists and a non-peptide antagonist at the neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor of human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. 2. [125I]-NPY binding to intact HEL cells was rapid, saturable, of high affinity and with a specificity typical for the Y1-like subtype: NPY, peptide YY (PYY) and [Pro34]-NPY competed for [125I]-NPY binding with high affinity whereas NPY13-36 and NPY18-36 had only low affinity. 3. NPY, PYY and [Pro34]-NPY potently increased intracellular Ca2+ in HEL cells and had equal efficacy. NPY13-36, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) increased intracellular Ca2+ only poorly. 4. Whereas VIP and PP did not significantly affect NPY-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization, NPY13-36 inhibited NPY-stimulated Ca2+ increases and shifted the NPY concentration-response curve to the right without altering its maximal effect. 5. The agonist (pEC50) potencies of the various peptides corresponded well with the affinities of these compounds in the binding assay (pKi), whereas the antagonist potencies (pKb) of the peptide partial agonists and the pA2 value of the non-peptide NPY antagonist (He 90481), calculated from functional data, were lower than the respective affinities determined in the binding studies. 6. A plot of the fractional Ca2+ response vs the fractional receptor occupancy did not reveal any non-linear receptor-effector coupling for NPY or [Pro34]-NPY; a small receptor reserve might exist for PYY. 7. We conclude that the binding and functional properties of HEL cell NPY receptors are very similar. NPY, PYY and [Pro34]NPY are full agonists at these receptors, whereas NPY13-36 is a partial agonist.","['Feth, F', 'Rascher, W', 'Michel, M C']","['Feth F', 'Rascher W', 'Michel MC']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (Receptors, Neurotransmitter)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Neuropeptide Y', 'Receptors, Neurotransmitter/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1476-5381.1992.tb14212.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 1992 Jan;105(1):71-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1992.tb14212.x.,,,,PMC1908622,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for MAP2 kinase activation since its activity is inhibited by treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, erbstatin analog. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is important in GM-CSF-mediated signal transduction and that MAP2 kinase activation may be a central biochemical event involved in its signaling.","['Raines, M A', 'Golde, D W', 'Daeipour, M', 'Nel, A E']","['Raines MA', 'Golde DW', 'Daeipour M', 'Nel AE']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'WDH83K6T5P (erbstatin)']",IM,"['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1992/06/15 00:00,1992/06/15 00:01,['1992/06/15 00:00'],"['1992/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71196-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jun 15;79(12):3350-4.,"['AI15332/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL42107/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Italian Cooperative Study Group ""GIMEMA"".",3331-6,"Seventy patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were characterized at the DNA level using genomic retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha) probes on Southern blot experiments. Sixty-two cases were defined as M3 according to the French-American-British (FAB) criteria, and eight had a diagnosis of microgranular or variant (M3v) APL. The use of two restriction enzymes and three probes exploring the second intron of the RAR-alpha gene allowed us to detect specific abnormal DNA fragments in every case, with clustering of rearrangements within the 20-kb intronic region between RAR-alpha exons II and III. A more detailed mapping of APL breakpoints was performed in 52 cases in which three EcoRI subregions of the RAR-alpha second intron were analyzed with corresponding probes. Comparison of clinical and hematological features in the three subgroups of patients with distinct RAR-alpha breakpoints did not show significant differences regarding age, peripheral blood (PB) counts, presence of coagulopathy, or FAB classification (M3 v M3v). Interestingly, a significant difference was observed in the M/F ratio of the three subgroups, with a higher incidence of rearrangements at the 5' end of the RAR-alpha second intron in female patients, and more frequent 3' breakpoints in males. The results of this study indicate that a unique genomic alteration consistently occurs on the 17q- derivative of the APL specific t(15;17) aberration. Moreover, the clinical relevance of RAR-alpha gene analysis both at diagnosis and in follow-up studies is further emphasized.","['Diverio, D', 'Lo Coco, F', ""D'Adamo, F"", 'Biondi, A', 'Fagioli, M', 'Grignani, F', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Rossi, V', 'Avvisati, G', 'Petti, M C']","['Diverio D', 'Lo Coco F', ""D'Adamo F"", 'Biondi A', 'Fagioli M', 'Grignani F', 'Rambaldi A', 'Rossi V', 'Avvisati G', 'Petti MC', 'et al.']","['Human Biopathology Department, University La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease HindIII)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI', 'Deoxyribonuclease HindIII', 'Exons', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid']",1992/06/15 00:00,1992/06/15 00:01,['1992/06/15 00:00'],"['1992/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71193-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jun 15;79(12):3331-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our analysis of C57BL/6 x DBA/2 recombinant inbred strains of mouse revealed three Mtv-9-negative strains that nevertheless have a low frequency of V beta 5-expressing T cells.

We have used a novel polymerase chain reaction-based assay to survey DNA and chromatin for the precise distribution of many integration sites. Integration into naked DNA targets is non-uniform, implying a nucleotide sequence bias. In chromatin, integration occurs preferentially at positions where the major groove is on the exposed face of the nucleosomal DNA helix, generating a 10 bp periodic spacing of preferred sites. Chromatin assembly enhances the reactivity of many sites, so that integration occurs most frequently at sites in nucleosomal, rather than nucleosome-free, regions of minichromosomes. In contrast, integration is prevented in a region occupied by a site-specific DNA-binding protein. Comparisons of integration events mediated by viral nucleoprotein complexes or by two different retroviral integrases show that the integration machinery also affects target site selection.","['Pryciak, P M', 'Varmus, H E']","['Pryciak PM', 'Varmus HE']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",1992/05/29 00:00,1992/05/29 00:01,['1992/05/29 00:00'],"['1992/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(92)90289-O [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(92)90289-o [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1992 May 29;69(5):769-80. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(92)90289-o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether these differences are due to different activity on cellular oncogenes, drug-induced topoisomerase II cleavage sites were mapped and sequenced in the human c-myc protooncogene. In the presence of purified murine L1210 topoisomerase II, amsacrine induces prominent cleavage in the P2 promoter (site 2499/2502). Footprinting experiments indicate that topoisomerase II binds to the entire promoter region (approximately 20 base pairs on the sides of the P2 site). In the case of teniposide or etoposide, cleavage is more diffuse and markedly less at the P2 site. Mapping of cleavage sites in human small cell lung carcinoma cells (NCI N417) also shows that cleavage in the P2 promoter region is induced preferentially by amsacrine but not by demethylepipodophyllotoxins. Thus, selective gene damage among topoisomerase II inhibitors may contribute to differential anticancer activity.","['Pommier, Y', 'Orr, A', 'Kohn, K W', 'Riou, J F']","['Pommier Y', 'Orr A', 'Kohn KW', 'Riou JF']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Jun 1;52(11):3125-30.,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high percentage of early deaths, about 20%, experienced by acute promyelocytic leukemia patients, is generally due to the hemorrhagic syndrome. A new finding is the high effectiveness of treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative, for inducing complete remission. The induction of cellular maturation by this agent represents the first model of differentiation therapy. Furthermore, recent molecular studies revealed that the breakpoints of the t(15;17) translocation are clustered in the gene of retinoic acid receptor-alpha, generating a hybrid gene product. Gene transfection experiments disclosed the impairment of gene transactivation due to the hybrid gene products, opening new concepts for understanding leukemogenesis.

An expression of the exogenous synthetase gene inhibited the interferon-gamma- and phorbol ester-dependent induction of HLA-DR and interleukin-1.

METHODS: The system consists of seven attributes: sensation, mobility, emotion, cognition, self-care, pain, and fertility. Three to five levels of functioning are defined for each attribute. Any specific combination of seven attribute levels constitutes a health state. In the first survey, the system was used to classify the health status of 20 children currently undergoing therapy for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Wilms' tumor, or neuroblastoma, and eight who had completed treatment. A second survey consisted of 13 children with brain tumors on active treatment. RESULTS: In general, independent ratings by clinicians were in agreement, and consensus was readily achieved in 1 to 2 minutes per patient. Children on therapy experienced a higher burden of morbidity than those off treatment. Brain tumor patients experienced more morbidity than patients in the first survey. CONCLUSION: The multiattribute system provides a compact but comprehensive tool for long-term follow-up of survivors of childhood cancer. It captures both multiple sequelae and varying levels of severity. By using a mathematical utility function, a single summary score of health-related quality of life may be assigned to each health state.

The extent of inhibition of TNF binding by receptor-specific antisera, as well as the size of the complexes formed after cross-linking TNF to its receptors on intact cells, indicated that both receptor species were expressed on the surface of the undifferentiated HL60 cells. Differentiation into granulocyte-like cells resulted in some increase in TNF binding. The increase was apparently due to enhanced expression of the 75-kDa TNF-R, whereas the amounts of the 55-kDa TNF-R did not change significantly. In contrast, in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate into macrophage-like cells, expression of the 55-kDa TNF-R species was completely abolished. The pattern of TNF-R expression in the differentiated HL-60 cells was similar to that observed in leukocytes isolated from peripheral blood: on granulocytes, there were about equal amounts of both receptor species, whereas on monocytes the 75-kDa receptor was predominant. The loss of 55-kDa receptors during differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophage-like cells was accompanied by a pronounced decrease in the level of the mRNA for that receptor, suggesting that at least part of the change in TNF-R expression is due to mechanisms that control the amounts of receptor mRNA. Although little is yet known regarding the functional differences between the two receptor species, marked changes in the pattern of their expression, as observed during HL-60 cell differentiation, are likely to alter the kind of response of the cells to TNF and may therefore play an important role in the coordination of TNF effects in the organism.","['Winzen, R', 'Wallach, D', 'Engelmann, H', 'Nophar, Y', 'Brakebusch, C', 'Kemper, O', 'Resch, K', 'Holtmann, H']","['Winzen R', 'Wallach D', 'Engelmann H', 'Nophar Y', 'Brakebusch C', 'Kemper O', 'Resch K', 'Holtmann H']","['Institute of Molecular Pharmacology, Medical School, Hannover, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*physiology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Jun 1;148(11):3454-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that MHC-unrestricted cytotoxic effector cells in the peripheral blood of BMT recipients are highly effective at killing EBV-infected target cells, but are inactive against CMV-infected target cells. Differential cytotoxicity is associated with disparate target structure expression. Although both EBV- and CMV-infected target cells express viral antigens, it is only those infected with EBV that express the adhesion molecule lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1; CD11a/18). Thus, EBV-infected target cells are able to interact with the principal LFA1 ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1; CD54), which is expressed on posttransplant peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) effector cells. CMV-infected target cells cannot utilize this ligand. Posttransplant cytotoxicity against EBV-infected target cells is abolished by target and effector cell blockade with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to LFA1 and ICAM1, respectively, demonstrating the functional relevance of this additional ligand interaction. These results provide an illustration both of the importance and of the limitations of MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity in vivo and may explain the frequency of CMV disease and the relative rarity of EBV-related disease following allogeneic transplantation from MHC-matched siblings. The increased immunosuppression used following MHC-mismatched/matched unrelated-donor BMT may cause this MHC-unrestricted defense mechanism to fail and may contribute to the greatly increased incidence of EBV lymphoproliferative syndrome in these patients.","['Duncombe, A S', 'Grundy, J E', 'Oblakowski, P', 'Prentice, H G', 'Gottlieb, D J', 'Roy, D M', 'Reittie, J E', 'Bello-Fernandez, C', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Brenner, M K']","['Duncombe AS', 'Grundy JE', 'Oblakowski P', 'Prentice HG', 'Gottlieb DJ', 'Roy DM', 'Reittie JE', 'Bello-Fernandez C', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Brenner MK']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital and Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/immunology/surgery', 'Tumor Virus Infections/etiology/immunology']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71241-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Jun 1;79(11):3059-66.,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the major cause of treatment failure is relapse, it is unknown if this arises entirely because of residual disease in the patient or whether contaminating cells in the rescuing marrow contribute. Attempts to purge marrow of its putative residual malignant cells may delay hematopoietic reconstitution and are of uncertain efficacy. We now describe how retrovirus-mediated gene transfer may be used to elucidate the source of relapse after ABMT for acute myeloid leukemia and to evaluate the efficacy of purging. Clonogenic myeloid leukemic blast cells in patient marrow can be transduced with the NeoR gene-containing helper-free retrovirus, LNL6, with an efficacy of 0% to 23.5% (mean, 10.5%). Transduced colonies grow in selective media and the presence of the marker gene can be confirmed in individual malignant colonies by polymerase chain reaction. If such malignant cells remain in harvested ""remission"" marrow, they will therefore be marked after exposure to LNL6. Detection of the marker gene in the malignant cells present at any later relapse would be firm evidence that residual disease contributed to disease recurrence, and would permit rapid subsequent evaluation of purging techniques. The technique also marks normal marrow progenitors from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. These colony-forming cells can be detected in long-term marrow cultures at a frequency of 1% to 18% for up to 10 weeks after exposure to the vector. Animal models and analysis of probability tables both suggest that these levels of marking in vitro are sufficient to provide information about the mechanisms of relapse and the biology of marrow regeneration in vivo. These preclinical data form part of the basis for current clinical studies of gene transfer into marrow before ABMT.","['Rill, D R', 'Moen, R C', 'Buschle, M', 'Bartholomew, C', 'Foreman, N K', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Krance, R A', 'Ihle, J N', 'Brenner, M K']","['Rill DR', 'Moen RC', 'Buschle M', 'Bartholomew C', 'Foreman NK', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Krance RA', 'Ihle JN', 'Brenner MK']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Gentamicins)', 'A08F5XTI6G (antibiotic G 418)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Genetic Markers', 'Gentamicins/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/*surgery', 'Phosphotransferases/genetics', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Retroviridae/genetics', '*Transfection', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1992/05/25 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/05/25 19:15'],"['1992/05/25 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/05/25 19:15 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)72942-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 May 15;79(10):2694-700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differences in time course or tissue distribution of viral antigen in some cats appeared to be attributable to the challenge virus preparations, consisting of cell-free tumor homogenate or infectious plasma.

To characterize a receptor for feline leukemia virus (FeLV), we extensively purified the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp70, from culture supernatants of FeLV-61E (subgroup A)-infected cells by immunoaffinity chromatography. Binding of purified 125I-labeled gp70 to the feline T-cell line 3201 was specific and saturable, and Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of receptor binding sites with an average number of 1.6 x 10(5) receptors per cell and an apparent affinity constant (Ka) of 1.15 x 10(9) M-1. Cross-linking experiments identified a putative gp70-receptor complex of 135 to 140 kDa. Similarly, coprecipitation of 125I-labeled cell surface proteins with purified gp70 and a neutralizing but noninterfering anti-gp70 monoclonal antibody revealed a single cell surface protein of approximately 70 kDa.

A clonal cell line infected at a low multiplicity of infection (2 x 10(-3)) was derived to provide a source of virus with high genetic homogeneity. Virus stocks from this cell line were used to infect cells at a low multiplicity of infection, and the cells were seeded soon after infection to obtain secondary clonal cell lines. RNase T1-oligonucleotide fingerprinting analyses of virion RNAs from 93 secondary lines revealed only 3 base changes in nearly 130,000 bases analyzed. To obtain an independent assessment of the mutation rate, we directly sequenced virion RNAs by using a series of DNA oligonucleotide primers distributed across the genome. RNA sequencing detected no mutations in over 21,000 bases analyzed. The combined fingerprinting and sequencing analyses yielded a mutation rate for infectious progeny viruses of one base change per 50,000 (2 x 10(-5)) bases per replication cycle. Our results suggest that over 80% of infectious progeny MuLVs may be replicated with complete fidelity and that only a low percentage undergo more than one point mutation during a replication cycle. Previous estimates of retroviral mutation rates suggest that the majority of infectious progeny viruses have undergone one or more point mutations. Recent studies of the mutation rates of marker genes in spleen necrosis virus-based vectors estimate a base substitution rate lower than estimates for infectious avian retroviruses and nearly identical to our determinations with AKV. The differences between mutation rates observed in studies of retroviruses may reflect the imposition of different selective conditions.","['Monk, R J', 'Malik, F G', 'Stokesberry, D', 'Evans, L H']","['Monk RJ', 'Malik FG', 'Stokesberry D', 'Evans LH']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.27.3 (Ribonuclease T1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muridae', 'Mutagenesis/*genetics', 'Nucleotide Mapping', 'Oligonucleotides/analysis', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease T1/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.6.3683-3689.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Jun;66(6):3683-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.6.3683-3689.1992.,,,,PMC241152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary tumor contained three classes of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) provirus, which have now been characterized in more detail as (i) v-tcr-containing recombinant proviruses, (ii) v-myc-containing recombinant proviruses, and (iii) apparently full-length helper FeLV proviruses. The two transductions appear to have been independent events, with distinct recombinational junctions and no sequence overlap in the host-derived inserts. The T17 tumor cell line releases large numbers of FeLV particles of low infectivity; all three genomes are encapsidated, but passage of FeLV-T17 on feline fibroblast and lymphoma cells led to selective loss of the recombinant viruses. The oncogenic potential of the T17 virus complex was, therefore, tested by infection of neonatal cats with virus harvested directly from the primary T17 tumor cell line. A single inoculation of FeLV-T17 caused persistent low-grade infection culminating in thymic lymphosarcoma and acute thymic atrophy, which was accelerated by coinfection with the weakly pathogenic FeLV subgroup A (FeLV-A)/Glasgow-1 helper. Molecularly cloned FeLV-tcr virus (T-31) rescued for replication by a weakly pathogenic FeLV-A/Glasgow-1 helper virus was similarly tested in vivo and induced thymic atrophy and thymic lymphosarcomas. Most FeLV-T17-induced tumors manifested either v-myc or an activated c-myc allele and had undergone rearrangement of endogenous T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain genes, supporting the proposition that the oncogenic effects of c-myc linked to the FeLV long terminal repeat are targeted to a specific window in T-cell differentiation. However, neither the FeLV-T17-induced tumors nor the T-31 + FeLV-A-induced tumors contained clonally represented v-tcr sequences. Only one of the FeLV-T17-induced tumors contained detectable v-tcr proviruses, at a low copy number. While v-tcr does not have a readily transmissible oncogenic function, a more restricted role is not excluded, perhaps involving antigenic peptide-major histocompatibility complex recognition by the T-cell receptor complex. Such a function could be obscured by the genetic diversity of the outbred domestic cat host.","['Terry, A', 'Fulton, R', 'Stewart, M', 'Onions, D E', 'Neil, J C']","['Terry A', 'Fulton R', 'Stewart M', 'Onions DE', 'Neil JC']","['Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Cancer Research Campaign Beatson Laboratories, Bearsden, Glasgow.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Atrophy', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, myc', 'Helper Viruses', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Serial Passage', 'Thymus Gland/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*microbiology', 'Transduction, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*pathology']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.6.3538-3549.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Jun;66(6):3538-49. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.6.3538-3549.1992.,,,,PMC241135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This virus infects the central nervous system (CNS) at low levels. In contrast, a chimeric virus, FrCasE, containing env and 3' pol sequences of 15-1 in a Friend murine leukemia virus background, infects the CNS at high levels and causes a rapid neurodegenerative disease with an incubation period of only 16 days. With both viruses, the induction of neurologic disease is dependent on inoculation during the perinatal period. Since the length of the incubation period of this disease appears to be a function of the relative level of CNS infection, we have attempted to identify the viral and host factors which determine the relative level of virus infection of the CNS. It was previously shown that the CNS is susceptible to infection only during the perinatal period (M. Czub, S. Czub, F. J. McAtee, and J. L. Portis, J. Virol. 65:2539-2544, 1991). Here we have found that the susceptibility of the CNS wanes progressively or gradually as a function of the age of the host, this age-dependent resistance being complete by 12 to 14 days of age. Utilizing a group of chimeric viruses, we found that the relative level of CNS infection achieved after inoculation of mice at 1 day of age was a function of the kinetics of virus replication and spread in peripheral organs. Viruses which reached peak viremia titers early (5 to 7 days of age) infected the CNS at high levels, and viruses which reached peak titers later infected the CNS at lower levels. Among the group of viruses examined in the current study, the kinetics of peripheral virus replication and spread appeared to be influenced primarily by sequences within the R-U5-5' leader region of the viral genome. These results suggested that the relative level of CNS infection was determined very early in life and appeared to be a function of a dynamic balance between the kinetics of virus replication in the periphery and a progressively developing restriction of virus replication in the CNS.","['Czub, M', 'McAtee, F J', 'Portis, J L']","['Czub M', 'McAtee FJ', 'Portis JL']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/immunology/*microbiology', 'Chimera', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/growth & development', 'Genome, Viral', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae/growth & development/pathogenicity', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*microbiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/microbiology', 'Viremia', 'Virus Replication']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.6.3298-3305.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Jun;66(6):3298-305. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.6.3298-3305.1992.,,,,PMC241107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elimination with various antibiotics.,55-62,"19 suspension cell lines were treated with antibiotics for elimination of chronic contamination with mycoplasma. We compared the efficiency, cytotoxicity and cross-resistance of the commercially available antibiotics MRA (Mycoplasma Removal Agent, a quinolone derivative and DNA gyrase inhibitor), Ciprobay (ciprofloxacin, also a quinolone derivative and DNA gyrase inhibitor), and BM-cyclin (a combination of tiamulin, a pleuromutilin derivative, and minocycline, a tetracycline derivative, both inhibitors of protein synthesis on ribosomes). Contaminants were eliminated in all 19 cell lines by BM-Cyclin. Only 74% of the cell lines were cleared of contamination by both MRA and Ciprobay. Successful treatment was monitored by three mycoplasma detection assays. Cross-resistance was noted between MRA and Ciprobay in four of the five cell lines not cleared by either reagent. This resistance could, however, be overcome by consecutive exposure to BM-cyclin. Employed at the recommended concentrations, the antibiotics did not cause marked cytotoxicity, but the growth of the cells was affected to various degrees by some antibiotics. The elimination of mycoplasma from chronically contaminated cell lines is an effective alternative to other treatment protocols, but is cost-intensive and time-consuming; lasting damaging effects of the treatments on the eukaryotic cells cannot be excluded. Long-term post-treatment monitoring is mandatory, since contaminants may only be suppressed and then recur.","['Uphoff, C C', 'Gignac, S M', 'Drexler, H G']","['Uphoff CC', 'Gignac SM', 'Drexler HG']","['German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Human and Animal Cell Cultures Collection, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Quinolones)', '118277-12-6 (BM-cyclin)', '141513-63-5 (mycoplasma removal agent)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/immunology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cell Line', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Diterpenes/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*microbiology', 'Minocycline/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Mycoplasma Infections/*drug therapy', 'Quinolones/therapeutic use/toxicity']",1992/04/27 00:00,1992/04/27 00:01,['1992/04/27 00:00'],"['1992/04/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/27 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-1759(12)80048-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(12)80048-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1992 Apr 27;149(1):55-62. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(12)80048-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moderate to marked cytotoxicity (CPE) developed in co-cultures of BMMC and FEA-C cells on Days 5 to 7 of incubation but not in co-cultures of BMMC and FEA-A or BMMC and uninfected cells (FEA-CT).

Stimulation of adherent cells with phorbol ester or addition of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rhTNF-alpha) caused similar CPE in FEA-CT cells. The TNF-alpha concentrations in the culture supernatants of BMMC+FEA-C were higher than those of BMMC+FEA-A or BMMC+FEA-CT, and addition of anti-TNF antibodies to the cultures blocked the CPE. These data support the hypothesis that macrophages exposed to FeLV-C cause CPE in co-cultures of BMMC and FEA cells by a mechanism involving TNF-alpha.

Sensitive (WEHI-3B/S) and novobiocin-resistant (WEHI-3B/NOVO) sublines were cloned in vitro. WEHI-3B/NOVO cells were stable in the absence of novobiocin for more than 3 months, and the sensitive and resistant clones displayed the same growth rate, cell cycle distribution, cell size, DNA and protein content, and cloning efficiency. Novobiocin has been shown to compete with ATP for the ATP-binding site of topoisomerase II; therefore, intracellular ATP levels can influence the cellular sensitivity to novobiocin. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of total cell extracts demonstrated that no difference exists between WEHI-3B/S and WEHI-3B/NOVO cells in the content of ATP. Furthermore, exposure of both cell lines to novobiocin did not affect intracellular ATP levels. In addition to an approximately 2-fold level of resistance to novobiocin, the WEHI-3B/NOVO subline was also 7- and 11-fold cross-resistant to the topoisomerase II-targeted drugs, teniposide and etoposide (VP-16), respectively. A lower level of cross-resistance, comparable to that of novobiocin, was observed in WEHI-3B/NOVO cells for the intercalating topoisomerase II-reactive drugs, doxorubicin, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide and aclacinomycin A, while the sensitivity to the cytotoxic action of the non-topoisomerase II-acting agents, camptothecin and vincristine, was not altered. After 3-6 h of exposure to 1 microM VP-16, WEHI-3B/S cells accumulated in the S and G2 + M phases of the cell cycle. Similar changes were detected in WEHI-3B/NOVO cells only after exposure to a 10-fold higher concentration of VP-16. Exposure to 150 microM novobiocin caused an accumulation of WEHI-3B/S cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle but did not affect the cell cycle distribution of WEHI-3B/NOVO cells, while camptothecin induced the same type and extent of changes in the cell cycle distribution of both cell lines. Although the WEHI-3B/NOVO subline appeared to be less responsive to the differentiation-inducing activity of novobiocin and teniposide, the capacity of WEHI-3B/NOVO cells to respond to the differentiation-inducing agent 13-cis-retinoic acid was not significantly different from that of WEHI-3B/S cells. A slight decrease in the accumulation of VP-16 occurred in the resistant cell line, which did not appear to be of sufficient magnitude to account for the 11-fold increase in the degree of resistance to this agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Rappa, G', 'Lorico, A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Rappa G', 'Lorico A', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Novobiocin/*pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/15 00:00,1992/05/15 00:01,['1992/05/15 00:00'],"['1992/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 May 15;52(10):2782-90.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these, the inhibition of the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase II appears to be instrumental in cytotoxicity. Tumour cells can acquire resistance to these drugs by several molecular mechanisms. The alteration of target protein sensitivity is one of these. In the present study, we directly measured the inhibition of topoisomerase II by cytostatic drugs. The procedure included isolation of cell nuclei, extraction of nuclear proteins, fractionation of nuclear extracts by anion exchange chromatography and measurement of the catalytic activity in the presence of various concentrations of the drugs. All steps can be performed within one day and require a minimum sample of 10(7)-10(8) malignant cells. We used cell samples from a multidrug-resistant subclone of the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 to study the feasibility of the approach. We found an increased resistance of topoisomerase II to etoposide and amsacrine, which correlates with the increased cellular resistance to these drugs as determined by exposure in short term liquid cultures.","['Boege, F', 'Gieseler, F', 'Biersack, H', 'Meyer, P']","['Boege F', 'Gieseler F', 'Biersack H', 'Meyer P']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, Universitat Wurzburg, Bundesrepublik Deutschland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Clin Chem Clin Biochem,European journal of clinical chemistry and clinical biochemistry : journal of the Forum of European Clinical Chemistry Societies,9105775,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Clin Chem Clin Biochem. 1992 Feb;30(2):63-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently cloned and sequenced a cDNA encoding an NDP-kinase of the rat mucosal mast cell line RBL-2H3 [Hemmerich, S., Yarden, Y., & Pecht, I. (1992) Biochemistry (preceding paper in this issue)]. The enzyme itself has been isolated by means of its affinity to the bischromone cromoglycate. Here we report several of its biochemical characteristics: A structural model for the native protein is proposed in which two disulfide-linked pairs of similar 18-kDa subunits (p18) associate to form a 72-kDa tetramer (p72). This is based on the migration properties of the purified enzyme on gel filtration columns, sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis, and two-dimensional electrophoresis, together with peptide mapping data. In the absence of NDP, both intact p72 and the dissociated 18-kDa subunits (p18) were shown to undergo Mg(2+)-dependent stoichiometric autophosphorylation utilizing adenosine and guanosine triphosphate or gamma-thiotriphosphate as phosphate donor. This autophosphorylation activity was found to be retained by the 18-kDa subunits even following fractionation by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose. The Michaelis constant of this autophosphorylation reaction with either ATP, ATP gamma S, GTP, or GTP gamma S was determined to be 6.5 +/- 1 microM, and maximally 2 mol of phosphate were found to be incorporated per p72 molecule, thus indicating that phosphorylation occurs at a single site on only two of the four 18-kDa subunits of the holoenzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Hemmerich, S', 'Pecht, I']","['Hemmerich S', 'Pecht I']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,['EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology', 'Mast Cells/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mucous Membrane/enzymology', 'Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Species Specificity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tissue Distribution']",1992/05/19 00:00,1992/05/19 00:01,['1992/05/19 00:00'],"['1992/05/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/19 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00134a007 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1992 May 19;31(19):4580-7. doi: 10.1021/bi00134a007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1991) Biochemistry 30, 1523-1532]. In contrast to cromoglycate itself, which is membrane impermeant and ineffective in these cells, its bis-acetoxymethyl ester derivative (CG/AM) can diffuse across the plasma membrane into the cytosol, where it is hydrolyzed into the impermeant CG dianion, which presumably may interact with intracellular components involved in the Fc epsilon R signal transduction pathway. In order to identify cytosolic components involved in the stimulus-secretion coupling that interact with this drug, we coupled CG to an insoluble matrix. This matrix was indeed effective in the affinity isolation from RBL cells of a cytosolic protein that exhibits an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa on reducing SDS gels. This protein was purified to homogeneity and then fragmented, and the amino acid sequence of three resultant peptides was determined. Using the corresponding synthetic oligonucleotides, we cloned and sequenced a cDNA that encodes the full-length 18-kDa polypeptide (p18).

(4) The TCR delta chain was rearranged in eight cases (40%) and rarely deleted; the rearrangements observed were those most frequently observed in B cell-precursor ALL. Two cases were evaluated both at presentation and at relapse. While the immunophenotype had remained unmodified, comparison of Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements revealed clonal variations in both cases.

The tests were repeated at monthly intervals on five occasions. When examining the specimens from cows and heifers, a close agreement was found between the results of the various methods. The newborn calves, which were the offspring of BLV infected mothers, were consequently negative in PCR throughout the experimental period. However, in the indirect tests the calves were positive during the first samplings and became negative only around four months of age.

The present study was therefore initiated with the view that the two growth factors may trigger the same early events in the cell, leading to suppression of apoptosis. We provide evidence here for a role of protein kinase C and of the Na+/H+ antiporter in the signal transduction pathways activated by binding of GM-CSF or IL-3 to their respective receptors, resulting in suppression of apoptosis in target cells. First, kinetic studies indicate that the process is irreversible after two hours of deprivation. The suppression of apoptosis by GM-CSF and IL-3 is dose-dependent, with half-efficient concentrations that are in the range of the dissociation constants of the high affinity GM-CSF or IL-3 receptor, respectively. Second, the use of three inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), H7, staurosporine, and sphingosine, in concentrations that are below their toxicity limits, revert the suppression of apoptosis by IL-3 and GM-CSF. Conversely, the use of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a PKC activator, allows a bypass of receptor activation in suppression of apoptosis. Western blotting of cytosolic and membrane proteins indicate that exposure of the cells to GM-CSF, IL-3, or TPA results in translocation of PKC to the cell membrane. Our data, therefore, indicate that the activation of PKC is important in suppression of apoptosis by GM-CSF and IL-3. Third, the two amiloride derivatives 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride that specifically block the function of the Na+/H+ antiport also revert the protective effect of GM-CSF, IL-3, and TPA on MO7-E cells. Further, exposure of the cells to GM-CSF, IL-3, or TPA results in sustained pHi alkalinizatio, which is abrogated when the cells are preincubated with 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride, a specific inhibitor of the antiport. Preincubation of the cells with staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, also significantly reduces the effect of GM-CSF or IL-3 on pHi. Taken together, our data indicate that a functional antiport is required in suppression of apoptosis by GM-CSF, IL-3, or TPA. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the view that GM-CSF or IL-3 receptor activation initiates the sequential activation of PKC and of the Na+/H+ antiporter, resulting in suppression of apoptosis in target cells.","['Rajotte, D', 'Haddad, P', 'Haman, A', 'Cragoe, E J Jr', 'Hoang, T']","['Rajotte D', 'Haddad P', 'Haman A', 'Cragoe EJ Jr', 'Hoang T']","['Department of Medicine, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Amiloride/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1992/05/25 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/05/25 19:15'],"['1992/05/25 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/05/25 19:15 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)50188-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 May 15;267(14):9980-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The normal values of serum Mn-SOD (mean +/- SD) of children below 4 and above 8 years old were 48 +/- 10.2 ng/ml and 84 +/- 22.5 ng/ml, respectively. Assuming the upper limit of normal Mn-SOD level in serum to be the mean value +/- 2 SD of children at each age, high serum levels of Mn-SOD were found for 8 of 12 patients with neuroblastoma, three of four patients with Wilms tumor, and four of five patients with acute myeloid leukemia. The patients with neuroblastoma exhibited a transient increase in Mn-SOD following chemotherapy, but after 1 week the levels decreased markedly to the control levels. The changes in serum Mn-SOD levels in the patients with neuroblastoma correlated well with the levels of neuron-specific enolase. Mn-SOD was intensely stained in bone marrow cells of patients whose cancer cells had moved into the bone marrow. High levels of Mn-SOD were also found in cultured human neuroblastoma cells. These data indicate that Mn-SOD is expressed in neuroblastoma cells, may serve as one of the diagnostic and prognostic markers for the neuroblastoma, and may be useful to predict the effectiveness of chemotherapy for neuroblastoma and the recurrence of this disease.","['Kawamura, N', 'Suzuki, K', 'Ishikawa, M', 'Iizuka, S', 'Miyake, M', 'Mino, M', 'Taniguchi, N']","['Kawamura N', 'Suzuki K', 'Ishikawa M', 'Iizuka S', 'Miyake M', 'Mino M', 'Taniguchi N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aging/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', '*Manganese', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/enzymology', 'Neuroblastoma/*enzymology', 'Reference Values', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*blood', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wilms Tumor/enzymology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0891-5849(92)90115-W [pii]', '10.1016/0891-5849(92)90115-w [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1992;12(4):281-6. doi: 10.1016/0891-5849(92)90115-w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During such diapedesis, the cells must traverse tissue barriers such as basement membrane, which has type IV collagen as its principal structural element. We studied whether the expression of type IV collagenase activity, invasion through basement membrane, and the response to inflammatory chemoattractants are related to each other and to the process of differentiation of murine M1 myeloid leukemia cells into macrophages. M1 cells stimulated with mouse lung-conditioned medium (MLCM) or interleukin 6 (IL6) differentiate into macrophages by 72 h, as determined by expression of Fc receptors, induction of lysozyme, and morphological changes from blast cells to mature macrophages. During this process of differentiation the invasive ability of the cells and the amount of type IV collagenase in the supernatants from the invading cells continuously increased up to 72 h. Zymographic analysis of supernatants of the invading cells revealed a single 100-kd metalloproteinase with gelatinolytic activity. Chemotaxis towards arachidonic acid metabolites, which are present in inflamed tissues, was detected only in differentiated cells. Studies with thioglycolate (TG)-elicited peritoneal macrophages gave results similar to those obtained with differentiated M1 cells, showing that the ability to invade basement membrane, the expression of type IV collagenase, and the chemotactic response to inflammatory chemoattractants all increased with the differentiation of myeloid cells and reached their highest expression in fully differentiated cells.","['Pluznik, D H', 'Fridman, R', 'Reich, R']","['Pluznik DH', 'Fridman R', 'Reich R']","['Division of Cytokine Biology, CBER, FDA, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Thioglycolates)', 'EC 3.4.24.3 (Microbial Collagenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology/*pathology/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Macrophages/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microbial Collagenase/*analysis', 'Phagocytes/*cytology/*enzymology/physiology', 'Thioglycolates/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology/pathology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Jan;20(1):57-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cutoff definitions should be expressed, separate for the main kinds of samples, defined as a dilution of the standard. Those definitions can replace the mostly awkward and involved test descriptions as usual in official regulations. To guarantee a high grade of reliability it is a matter of urgent necessary to test (if possible by the producer) each serial (lot) of ELISA and to describe their capacities with regard of sensitivity and specificity. Separate pretests may be done with the main kinds of samples with well known reactions (negative and weak positive). The results are to compare to those of the cutoff-related dilutions of the standard in the same matrix. These descriptions of the capacities of each serial (lot) are safe bases for use of the serial.

During the course of life-long infection, cattle maintain a high anti-BLV titer during an apparent latent infection of B cells from which proviral DNA but not transcripts can be detected. To investigate if BLV infection is truly latent and restricted only to B lymphocytes, peripheral blood leukocytes were purified from cattle with naturally acquired BLV infection with various stages of subclinical and clinical disease. These cells were purified into populations of polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes and subsequently B cells and T cells by fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of provirus in monocytes and B cells but not T cells. Secondly, the ability of provirus containing cell types to express BLV antigens was then confirmed by mitogen stimulation in vitro. Subsequently, the pattern of expression of BLV antigens was studied in situ in tissue sections to determine the location of BLV antigen expressing cells in vivo. Antigen expressing cells were infrequent and solitary in intrafollicular and marginal zone cells of architecturally normal lymph nodes of chronic, BLV-infected cattle. These results demonstrate that BLV persists in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in addition to B lymphocytes and that expression of BLV antigens in cattle doses occur but rarely in lymph nodes of BLV infected cattle. The high frequency of provirus containing cells and infrequent expression of BLV antigen in vivo suggests that BLV expression is not truly latent but highly regulated, possibly triggered by rare events in host lymphoid tissue.","['Heeney, J L', 'Valli, P J', 'Jacobs, R M', 'Valli, V E']","['Heeney JL', 'Valli PJ', 'Jacobs RM', 'Valli VE']","['Department of Chronic and Infectious Diseases, Institute of Applied Radiobiology and Immunology TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/immunology/microbiology', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Leukemia/*immunology/microbiology/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/microbiology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology/microbiology', 'Proviruses/*immunology/isolation & purification']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1992 May;66(5):608-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because another activator of protein phosphorylation, phorbol esters, stimulates hematopoietic differentiation, we sought to determine whether okadaic acid could also induce the differentiation of the human leukemic cell line U937. Differentiation was assessed by measuring changes in the following: mRNA levels, cell growth, morphology, cell surface markers, and the ability to induce superoxide. We found that okadaic acid treatment of U937 cells induces immediate increases in total cellular levels of both c-jun and c-fos mRNAs. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrate that initial increases are secondary to increases in transcription, whereas latter changes may be secondary to mRNA stabilization. Like phorbol esters, okadaic acid treatment also activates AP-1 enhancer activity and induces the phosphorylation of c-Jun protein. Approximately 6-12 hours after treatment with okadaic acid, mRNA levels of c-myc, p34cdc2, and p58GTA, two cell cycle regulated protein kinases, decrease. Okadaic acid inhibits the growth of U937 cells, induces changes in nuclear morphology, stimulates increases in Mac-1 and Leu 11 surface antigens, and induces these cells to produce superoxide. These changes, taken together, suggest that U937 cells have been induced by okadaic acid to differentiate towards a more mature cell type.","['Adunyah, S E', 'Unlap, T M', 'Franklin, C C', 'Kraft, A S']","['Adunyah SE', 'Unlap TM', 'Franklin CC', 'Kraft AS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Ethers, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/genetics', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041510223 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1992 May;151(2):415-26. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041510223.,"['CA09128/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA42533-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we report that retinoic acid (RA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells causes an approximately 18-fold increase in the steady-state mRNA levels for the Na+/H+ antiporter. This was due to an increase in the rate of Na+/H+ antiporter gene transcription as measured by nuclear run-on analysis. Antiporter protein synthesis increased by seven-fold during RA-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells as measured by immunoprecipitation of 35S-methionine-labeled proteins with the RP1-c28 Na+/H+ antiporter antibody. No increase in antiporter mRNA was observed in response to etretinate, an analogue of retinoic acid, which did not induce differentiation. Thus, Na+/H+ antiporter gene expression is associated with RA-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells. The present findings and our previous data (Rao et al., 1991) demonstrate that Na+/H+ antiporter gene expression is a generalized feature of HL60 cell differentiation.","['Rao, G N', 'Sardet, C', 'Pouyssegur, J', 'Berk, B C']","['Rao GN', 'Sardet C', 'Pouyssegur J', 'Berk BC']","['Cardiology Division, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '65M2UDR9AG (Etretinate)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Etretinate/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041510217 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1992 May;151(2):361-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041510217.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transgene is expressed in many tissues, with particularly high levels of expression in the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. One of these transgenic lines, B-less, displays a dramatic phenotype characterized by an acute susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections. Analysis of this strain shows it to be profoundly deficient in both immature (pre-B) and mature B cells, as well as in circulating immunoglobulin. The pre-B and B cell defects are cell autonomous, as judged by cell culture and bone marrow graft chimeras. Despite this B cell deficiency, the T cell lineage appears grossly normal as assessed by flow cytometric analysis and by its response to mitogen stimulation. Since an independently derived transgenic strain bearing the same human lambda construct displays a partial B-less phenotype, it is likely that the B lineage deficiency is due to a dominant effect of transgene expression rather than to the insertional perturbation of an endogenous mouse gene. It is interesting that the deficiency phenotype is fully expressed in the FVB/N genetic background, but is suppressed in F1 hybrids formed between the FVB/N and C57BL/6 inbred strains.

The resulting PACE regimen was given every 21 days for the first three courses and then every 28 days for the next five courses. PACE was used in two trials: the first, for both limited and extensive disease, was conducted at the University of Maryland Cancer Center and North Shore University Hospital; and the second, for extensive disease, was carried out as a Cancer and Leukemia Group B pilot study. Chest irradiation was not used. Prophylactic cranial irradiation at a dose of 3,000 cGy was given to all patients achieving a complete response (CR). A total of 33 subjects were entered in the first study; 8 of the 15 (53%) presenting with limited disease and 7 of the 18 (39%) exhibiting extensive disease achieved a CR. A partial response (PR) was obtained in 27% and 33% of cases, respectively. Of the 34 patients entered in the second study, 25 were eligible; 8 (32%) achieved a CR and 6 (24%) showed a PR. Toxicity was severe in both studies, including greater than 90% severe or life-threatening leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Serial creatinine-clearance evaluations in the first study indicated progressive deterioration, which required discontinuation of the cisplatin before the planned completion of treatment in most cases. Since the response rate was no higher than the historic data reported for the three-drug ACE combination and because the toxicity was severe, the studies were stopped and patients were followed for survival. After a follow-up period of greater than 6 years, the median survival was 24 months for limited disease, with 33% and 27% of the patients being alive at 3 and 6.5 years, respectively.

Both diasteromeres of the phosphorothioate derivatives were growth inhibitory, exhibiting a concentration inhibiting 50% of cell proliferation of 3-100 microM. Among the analogues tested, Rp-8-Cl-cAMPS and Sp-8-Br-cAMPS were the two most potent. Rp-8-Cl-cAMPS was 5- to 10-fold less potent than 8-Cl-cAMP while Sp-8-Br-cAMPS was approximately 6-fold more potent than 8-Br-cAMP. The growth inhibition was not due to a block in a specific phase of the cell cycle or due to cytotoxicity. Rp-8-Cl-cAMPS enhanced its growth-inhibitory effect when added together with 8-Cl-cAMP and increased differentiation in combination with N6-benzyl-cAMP. The binding kinetics data showed that these Sp and Rp modifications brought about a greater decrease in affinity for Site B than for Site A of RI (the regulatory subunit of type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase) and a substantial decrease of affinity for Site A of RII (the regulatory subunit of type II protein kinase) but only a small decrease in affinity for Site B of RII, indicating the importance of the Site B binding of RII in the growth-inhibitory effect. These results show that the phosphorothioate analogues of cAMP are useful tools to investigate the mechanism of action of cAMP in growth control and differentiation and may have practical implication in the suppression of malignancy.","['Yokozaki, H', 'Tortora, G', 'Pepe, S', 'Maronde, E', 'Genieser, H G', 'Jastorff, B', 'Cho-Chung, Y S']","['Yokozaki H', 'Tortora G', 'Pepe S', 'Maronde E', 'Genieser HG', 'Jastorff B', 'Cho-Chung YS']","['Cellular Biochemistry Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Receptors, Cyclic AMP)', ""142754-28-7 (8-chloroadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate)"", 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cyclic AMP/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Protein Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 May 1;52(9):2504-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have further characterized the process of lymphoma development in hu-PBL-SCID mice. We report that EBV-seropositive donors differ markedly in the capacity of their PBL to give rise to immunoblastic lymphomas in SCID mice; some donors (high incidence) generated tumors rapidly in all hu-PBL-SCID mice, other donors (intermediate-low incidence) gave rise to sporadic tumors after a longer latent period (greater than 10 weeks), and some donors failed to produce tumors. B-cell lymphomas arising from high incidence donors were multiclonal in origin, and EBV replication was detected in all tumors. Tumors derived from intermediate-low incidence donors were monoclonal or oligoclonal and often had no evidence of viral replication. All tumors, regardless of the donor, resembled EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines in surface phenotype but differed from lymphoblastoid cell lines by having less Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2 and CD23 expression. The variable patterns of lymphomagenesis seen among different EBV-sero-positive donors may be explained by lower levels of specific immunity to EBV in high incidence donors, permitting activation of EBV replication and potential transformation of secondary B-cell targets. In addition, there may be differences in the transforming potential of EBV infecting different donors. The use of the hu-PBL-SCID model may help predict patients at high risk for posttransplant or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated lymphomas.","['Picchio, G R', 'Kobayashi, R', 'Kirven, M', 'Baird, S M', 'Kipps, T J', 'Mosier, D E']","['Picchio GR', 'Kobayashi R', 'Kirven M', 'Baird SM', 'Kipps TJ', 'Mosier DE']","['Division of Immunology, Medical Biology Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'DNA Replication', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Virus Replication']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 May 1;52(9):2468-77.,"['AI-22871/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-24526/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-29182/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, there is a need to determine the ability of biological response modifiers (BRMs) to specifically reduce virus-infected cells, as compared to their non-specific anti-proliferative effects. To address this need, a BRM, imexon, was evaluated in this study using three strains of mice having different Friend virus (FV)-specific immunological capabilities. The first strain, (B10.A x A/WySn)F1, was genetically capable of producing FV-specific neutralization and cytotoxic antibodies, the second, Balb/c, was not, and the third, SCID mice, lacked functional T and B cell immunity. Imexon treatment reduced virally-induced splenomegaly in all 3 strains; however, the concentration of splenic viral infectious centers (IC) were not affected. Since imexon was efficacious in reducing splenomegaly in SCID mice, the mode of action was concluded to not require functional T or B cell immunity. The observation that imexon did not affect splenic IC titers also suggested that imexon did not specifically eliminate virally infected cells, but may have functioned by other mechanisms. This study also demonstrated the use of various mouse strains as a strategy for delineating the modes of action of BRMs against murine retroviral infections.","['Morrey, J D', 'Mead, J R', 'Warren, R P', 'Okleberry, K M', 'Burger, R A', 'Sidwell, R W']","['Morrey JD', 'Mead JR', 'Warren RP', 'Okleberry KM', 'Burger RA', 'Sidwell RW']","['AIDS Research Program, Utah State University, Logan 84322-5600.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Hexanones)', '59643-91-3 (4-imino-1,3-diazabicyclo(3.1.0)hexan-2-one)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*drug effects/immunology', 'Hexanones/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Retroviridae Infections/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0166-3542(92)90043-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0166-3542(92)90043-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 1992 Mar;17(3):223-33. doi: 10.1016/0166-3542(92)90043-5.,['N01-A1-72662/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the human factor-dependent myeloid leukemia cell line M07E, pim-1 protein was induced by interleukin 3 (IL-3) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), with maximum expression by 4 h. Expression continued for the duration of growth factor exposure, but declined rapidly when cytokines were removed. GM-CSF induced pim-1 protein in a dose-dependent manner, with expression being proportional to the proliferative effect of the cytokine. To examine the specificity of pim-1 protein induction, we compared pim-1 protein levels in myeloid cells which demonstrated different GM-CSF response phenotypes. We also examined the effects on pim-1 protein expression of different growth factors which induced similar response phenotypes. GM-CSF induced pim-1 protein in several myeloid cell lines, most of which demonstrated a proliferative response, but did not induce pim-1 protein expression in neutrophils or monocytic cells. In contrast, the murine cell line Mac-11 expressed pim-1 message in response to IL-3 and GM-CSF, but not in response to bryostatin or M-CSF, which were equivalent mitogens. In human U937 myeloid cells sustained expression of pim-1 protein was induced by GM-CSF, G-CSF and IL-6, but not by bryostatin. Expression of the pim-1 kinase protein in response to myeloid cytokines depends on both the nature of the growth factor and the response phenotype. The pim-1 kinase may be an important intermediate in transmembrane signaling or response phenotype induced by IL-3, GM-CSF and other cytokines whose receptors are structurally similar. Its constitutive expression in some myeloid leukemia cell lines suggests activation of signal cascades utilized by myeloid growth factors.","['Lilly, M', 'Le, T', 'Holland, P', 'Hendrickson, S L']","['Lilly M', 'Le T', 'Holland P', 'Hendrickson SL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1992 Apr;7(4):727-32.,,,['pim-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Administration of 40 micrograms selenium daily for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in the longevity of mice inoculated with 10(5) L797 cells. However, no remarkable increase of the longevity was observed in either L615- or L7712-inoculated mice after treatment with sodium selenite for 7 days. Treatment of the HL-60 leukaemic cell line with selenium caused a dose- and time-related decrease in DNA, RNA and protein syntheses as measured by [3H]-thymidine, [3H]-uridine and [3H]-leucine uptake respectively. The inhibitory effect of selenium on DNA synthesis was reversed when selenium was removed from the medium, demonstrating that selenium-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis was due to interference with DNA biosynthesis rather than DNA template damage. These results suggest that the anti-leukaemic effect of sodium selenite is associated with inhibition of DNA replication, transcription and translation.","['Jiang, X R', 'Macey, M G', 'Lin, H X', 'Newland, A C']","['Jiang XR', 'Macey MG', 'Lin HX', 'Newland AC']","['Department of Haematology, Royal London Hospital, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Selenium/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sodium Selenite', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(92)90136-u [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992;16(4):347-52. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90136-u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfer of pRSVcat into all cell lines was effected by electroporation and the resultant CAT activity was measured 24 h later by a rapid single vial CAT assay. CAT activity corresponding to an average of 0.06 units of purified CAT enzyme was expressed by WIL2-NS cells. Very low to no expression of the CAT vector was observed in all other cell lines studied, despite the presence of intracellular levels of 3H-labelled pRSVcat comparable to WIL2-NS. Epstein-Barr virus transformed B cells (SKW 6.4 and RPMI 1788) did not successfully perform host cell reactivation. In WIL2-NS cells, platination of pRSVcat to defined levels of 5-40 platinum molecules per plasmid led to a graded reduction in CAT activity expressed following transfection. Platination levels of 20 and 40 platinum molecules per plasmid did not alter the efficiency of transfer of pRSVcat into these cells by electroporation.

The brain tumors had histologic and immunohistochemical features of primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), including neuroblastic rosettes, rhythmic arrangement of tumor cells, and immunohistochemical expression of glial, and in one patient neuronal, marker proteins. Using polymerase chain reaction-mediated DNA amplification from paraffin-embedded tissues and subsequent DNA sequence analysis, an activating point mutation was detected in the K-ras protooncogene in one tumor. This mutation was a G to A transition in position 2 of codon 12, substituting aspartate (GAT) for glycine (GGT). This type of mutation has not been observed before in human brain tumors, but it is frequent in radiation-induced murine lymphomas. These observations suggest that PNET can be induced after completion of the embryonal and fetal development of the human CNS. Oncogene-activating point mutations may represent a pathogenetic mechanism involved in the genesis of radiation-induced brain tumors.","['Brustle, O', 'Ohgaki, H', 'Schmitt, H P', 'Walter, G F', 'Ostertag, H', 'Kleihues, P']","['Brustle O', 'Ohgaki H', 'Schmitt HP', 'Walter GF', 'Ostertag H', 'Kleihues P']","['Laboratory of Neuropathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Codon)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Aspartic Acid/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Codon/genetics/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Genes, ras/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Glycine/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*etiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19920501)69:9<2385::aid-cncr2820690929>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 May 1;69(9):2385-92. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19920501)69:9<2385::aid-cncr2820690929>3.0.co;2-3.,,,['K-ras'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LGL were shown to have a natural killer (NK) cell, CD3- CD16- CD56+ CD57- phenotype and mediated strong nonspecific major histocompatability complex-unrestricted (NK) cytotoxic activity. A progressive increase in the peripheral blood LGL count was associated with a rapid deterioration, hepatic necrosis, and death. Widespread organ infiltration with LGLs suggested a malignant lymphoproliferative condition, but no lymphoid (T-cell receptor or IgH) gene rearrangement or cytogenetic marker was detected. However, molecular analysis identified EBV genomic DNA present in a single episomal form within the LGL, establishing the clonal nature of the LGL proliferation. Confirmation that the EBV had infected the leukemic LGL was obtained by in situ hybridization studies that showed EBV RNA within the LGLs. Immunoblotting of LGL protein extracts established that, of the EBV gene products, EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) was expressed but EBNA-2 and the latent membrane protein (LMP-1) were not detectable in the leukemic cells.

In glucocorticoid-sensitive clones of CEM, a human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia line, two genes correlate with glucocorticoid-induced cell lysis. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) itself is induced by standard glucocorticoids in sensitive clones and not in insensitive clones. The phenylpyrazolo-glucocorticoid cortivazol (CVZ) is capable of lysing several clones resistant to high concentrations of standard potent glucocorticoids. When these clones were tested for cortivazol responses, they were not only lysed by cortivazol but also showed induction of GR mRNA. Thus receptor induction appears to correlate with the lysis function of receptor in these cells. To determine what parts of the GR are required for lysis, we have mapped this function by transfecting and expressing GR and GR fragment genes in a GR-deficient CEM clone. Our results indicate that none of the known trans-activation regions of the GR are required. Removal of the steroid binding domain gives a fragment that is fully constitutive. Only one and one-half ""Zn fingers"" of the DNA binding region are required. We also find in CEM cells rapid suppression of the c-myc protooncogene, preceding growth arrest and cell lysis by glucocorticoids. This occurs only in clones possessing both intact receptors and lysis function. Thus the simple presence of GR alone is not sufficient to guarantee c-myc down-regulation. Introduction into the cells of c-myc driven by a promoter that does not permit suppression by glucocorticoids confers resistance to steroids. Furthermore, suppression of c-myc by antisense oligonucleotides also kills the cells. Therefore, c-myc appears to be a pivotal gene related both to ability of steroid to kill and to cell viability.","['Thompson, E B', 'Nazareth, L V', 'Thulasi, R', 'Ashraf, J', 'Harbour, D', 'Johnson, B H']","['Thompson EB', 'Nazareth LV', 'Thulasi R', 'Ashraf J', 'Harbour D', 'Johnson BH']","['University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Pregnatrienes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)', 'YM183K0H63 (cortivazol)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Clone Cells', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, myc', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Pregnatrienes/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/pharmacology', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0960-0760(92)90352-j [doi]'],ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 1992 Mar;41(3-8):273-82. doi: 10.1016/0960-0760(92)90352-j.,['CA-41407-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neurotrophic factors promote neuronal survival both in vivo and in vitro. Neuronal differentiation factors influence transmitter phenotypes without affecting neuronal survival. The list of neurotrophic factors is increasing partly because certain growth factors and cytokines have been shown to possess neurotrophic activities and also because new neurotrophic factors including new members of the nerve growth factor (NGF) family have been identified at the molecular level. In vitro assays using recombinant neurotrophic factors and distributions of their mRNAs and proteins have indicated that members of a neurotrophic gene family may play sequential and complementary roles during development and in the adult nervous system. Most of the receptors for neurotrophic factors contain tyrosine kinase domains, suggesting the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent signal transduction for their effects. Molecules such as LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) and CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic factor) have been identified as neuronal differentiation factors in vitro. At the moment, however, it remains to be determined whether or not the receptors for a group of neuronal differentiation factors constitute a gene family or contain domains of kinase or phosphatase activity.

LC-FeLV infection in kittens may induce, but does not necessarily induce, thymic lymphosarcoma in viremic animals after a short latency. These observations suggest that infection with LC-FeLV is not sufficient to induce complete transformation and that another genetic event(s) is required. One possibility for such an event is that the integrating provirus acts as an insertional mutagen and thereby disrupts the structure or function of another proto-oncogene. Using a strategy of transposon tagging, this possibility was examined in eight feline T-cell lymphosarcomas, including four induced by experimental infection with LC-FeLV, three induced by natural infection with FeLV, and one FeLV-negative tumor. The analysis demonstrated one locus, termed flvi-2, to be structurally altered in six of the tumors examined, including three induced by LC-FeLV and three in which no activated myc oncogene is apparent. Inverse polymerase chain reaction was used to demonstrate the presence and transcriptional orientation of proviruses integrated at flvi-2 in five of these tumors. The flvi-2 locus does not hybridize to cloned probes representing 21 previously identified proto-oncogenes or common domains of retroviral integration. Thus, the data suggest that interruption of the flvi-2 locus cooperates with the myc oncogene in the induction of T-cell lymphomas by LC-FeLV; indeed, the observations indicate that the insertional mutagenesis of flvi-2 plays a role in T-cell lymphomagenesis even in the absence of feline v-myc.","['Levy, L S', 'Lobelle-Rich, P A']","['Levy LS', 'Lobelle-Rich PA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112-2699.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cats', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.5.2885-2892.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 May;66(5):2885-92. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.5.2885-2892.1992.,['CA-48801/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['flvi-2'],PMC241047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the putative accessory genes (tat) of the bovine immunodeficiency-like virus (BIV) bears sequence similarity to other lentivirus tat genes. This finding suggests that BIV may encode a trans-activating protein capable of stimulating LTR-directed gene expression. To test this hypothesis in vitro, BIV LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene plasmids were constructed and transfected into three cell lines established from canine, bovine, or lapine tissues that are susceptible to BIV infection. The level of BIV LTR-directed CAT gene expression was significantly elevated in BIV-infected cells compared with uninfected cells. The relatively high basal-level expression of BIV LTR-CAT in uninfected canine and bovine cell lines suggests that cellular factors play a role in regulating BIV LTR-directed gene expression. Additionally, by using a clonal canine cell line in which the BIV LTR-CAT plasmid is stably expressed, BIV LTR-directed CAT expression is elevated 15- to 80-fold by cocultivation with BIV-infected cells, supporting the notion that BIV encodes a trans activator. The relative specificity of this viral activation was assessed by coculturing the clonal BIV LTR-CAT cell line with bovine leukemia virus- or bovine syncytial virus-infected cells; these bovine retroviruses increased expression from the BIV LTR only two- to threefold. Thus, BIV LTR regulatory elements in infected cells, like those of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and other lentiviruses, are trans activated, presumably through the action of a Tat-like protein and cellular factors.","['Pallansch, L A', 'Lackman-Smith, C S', 'Gonda, M A']","['Pallansch LA', 'Lackman-Smith CS', 'Gonda MA']","['Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Structure, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702-1201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'Dogs', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tat/biosynthesis', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Lentivirus Infections/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Spumavirus/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.5.2647-2652.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 May;66(5):2647-52. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.5.2647-2652.1992.,['N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC241018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since it was possible that the species responsible for growth inhibition are polyglutamylated metabolites, the di-, tri-, and tetraglutamates of dmAMT were synthesized and tested as inhibitors of purified recombinant human DHFR, murine L1210 leukemia thymidylate synthase (TS), chicken liver glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), and murine L1210 leukemia aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (AICARFT). The compounds with three and four gamma-glutamyl residues were found to bind two orders of magnitude better than dmAMT itself to DHFR, TS, and AICARFT, with 50% inhibitory concentration values in the 200 to 300 nM range against all three enzymes. In contrast, at a concentration of 10 microM, dmAMT polyglutamates had no appreciable effect on GARFT activity. These findings support the hypothesis that dmAMT requires intracellular polyglutamylation for activity and indicate that replacement of the 2-amino group by 2-methyl is as acceptable a structural modification in antifolates targeted against DHFR as it is in antifolates targeted against TS. In growth assays against methotrexate (MTX)-sensitive H35 rat hepatoma cells and MTX-resistant H35 sublines with a transport defect, dmAMT was highly cross-resistant with MTX, but not with the TS inhibitors N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid and N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-ox-oquinazolin-6-yl)-N- methylamino]thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid, implicating DHFR rather than TS as the principal target for dmAMT polyglutamates in intact cells. On the other hand, an H35 subline resistant to 2'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine by virtue of increased TS activity was highly cross-resistant to N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid and not cross-resistant to MTX, but showed partial cross-resistance to dmAMT. Both thymidine and hypoxanthine were required to protect H35 cells treated with concentrations of dmAMT and MTX that inhibited growth by greater than 90% relative to unprotected controls. In contrast, N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid and N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-yl)-N-methylamino] thenoyl)- L-glutamic acid required only thymidine for protection. Like MTX, therefore, dmAMT appears to inhibit purine as well as pyrimidine de novo synthesis, and its effect on cell growth probably reflects the ability of dmAMT polyglutamates to not only block dihydrofolate reduction but also interfere with other steps of folate metabolism, either directly or indirectly via alteration of reduced folate pools.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Rosowsky, A', 'Galivan, J', 'Beardsley, G P', 'Bader, H', ""O'Connor, B M"", 'Russello, O', 'Moroson, B A', 'DeYarman, M T', 'Kerwar, S S', 'Freisheim, J H']","['Rosowsky A', 'Galivan J', 'Beardsley GP', 'Bader H', ""O'Connor BM"", 'Russello O', 'Moroson BA', 'DeYarman MT', 'Kerwar SS', 'Freisheim JH']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '118869-52-6 (2-desamino-2-methylaminopterin)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.2.3 (Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/15 00:00,1992/04/15 00:01,['1992/04/15 00:00'],"['1992/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Apr 15;52(8):2148-55.,"['CA19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25933/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of adenosine receptors linked to adenylate cyclase activity and their functional role in calcium-evoked 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) release was investigated in rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells, a widely used model for studying the molecular mechanisms responsible for stimulus-secretion coupling. 2. In [3H]-5-HT-loaded cells triggered to release by the calcium ionophore A23187, a biphasic modulation of 5-HT secretion was induced by adenosine analogues, with inhibition of stimulated release at nM and potentiation at microM concentrations, suggesting the presence of adenosine receptor subtypes mediating opposite effects on calcium-dependent release. This was also confirmed by results obtained with other agents interfering with adenosine pharmacology, such as adenosine deaminase and the non-selective A1/A2 antagonist 8-phenyl-theophylline. 3. Similar biphasic dose-response curves were obtained with a variety of adenosine analogues on basal adenylate cyclase activity in RBL cells, with inhibition and stimulation of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production at nM and microM concentrations, respectively. The rank order of potency of adenosine analogues for inhibition and stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity and the involvement of G-proteins in modulation of cyclic AMP levels suggested the presence of cyclase-linked A1 high-affinity and A2-like low-affinity adenosine receptor subtypes. However, the atypical antagonism profile displayed by adenosine receptor xanthine antagonists on cyclase stimulation suggested that the A2-like receptor expressed by RBL cells might represent a novel cyclase-coupled A2 receptor subtype.4. Micromolar concentrations of adenosine analogues could also increase inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and inositol tris-phosphate formation in both unstimulated cells and in cells triggered to release by the calcium ionophore.

It is concluded that RBL cells express both A1 and A2-like adenosine receptors which exert opposite effects on 5-HT release and intracellular cyclic AMP levels. However, besides modulation of cyclic AMP levels, additional transduction pathways, such as modulation of phospholipase C activity, may contribute to the release response evoked by adenosine analogues in this cell-line.","['Abbracchio, M P', 'Paoletti, A M', 'Luini, A', 'Cattabeni, F', 'De Matteis, M A']","['Abbracchio MP', 'Paoletti AM', 'Luini A', 'Cattabeni F', 'De Matteis MA']","['Institute of Pharmacological Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Purinergic Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', '132-06-9 (Inosine Triphosphate)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Basophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Inosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membranes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Purinergic Antagonists', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1476-5381.1992.tb14266.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 1992 Feb;105(2):405-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1992.tb14266.x.,,,,PMC1908671,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One third of CGD patients have an autosomal gene defect resulting in absence of p47phox protein, a cytoplasmic component critical to superoxide production by phagocytic cells. cDNA encoding p47phox has been cloned and recombinant p47phox (rp47phox) restores superoxide-generating activity to a cell-free assay containing cell membranes and cytosol from p47phox-deficient CGD neutrophils. The goal of the present study was to determine the feasibility of retrovirus mediated expression of rp47phox in the HL60 and U937 human hematopoietic cell lines, and in an Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-lymphocyte cell line (EBV-BCL) derived from a p47phox-deficient CGD patient. Normal EBV-BCL contain p47phox and generate small amounts of superoxide, while this CGD EBV-BCL lacks any detectable p47phox protein. Defective amphotropic retrovirus containing p47phox sequence inserted in the LXSN vector in sense and antisense orientations were used to transduce HL60, U937, and CGD EBV-BCL. p47phox mRNA sequence was detected in cells transduced with either sense or antisense retroviral constructs while rp47phox protein was detected only with the sense construct. The amount of rp47phox protein produced within these cells was greater than the native p47phox present in uninduced HL60 or U937 cells, but substantially less than that present in normal neutrophils, induced HL60 cells, or even normal EBV-BCL. Differentiation of transduced HL60 cells and the associated production of native p47phox in response to dimethyl sulfoxide was not affected. These studies demonstrate that retrovirus constructs can be used to mediate stable expression of rp47phox protein in human hematopoietic cell lines and can restore rp47phox protein within the cytosol of p47phox-deficient EBV-BCL from patients with CGD.","['Cobbs, C S', 'Malech, H L', 'Leto, T L', 'Freeman, S M', 'Blaese, R M', 'Gallin, J I', 'Lomax, K J']","['Cobbs CS', 'Malech HL', 'Leto TL', 'Freeman SM', 'Blaese RM', 'Gallin JI', 'Lomax KJ']","['Laboratory of Host Defenses, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/genetics/*metabolism/therapy', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/biosynthesis/deficiency/*genetics', 'NADPH Oxidases', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73680-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Apr 1;79(7):1829-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify genes that may be aberrantly expressed in APL, a subtraction cDNA library of an APL patient with t(15;17) was constructed. A cDNA, pRD1, specifically expressed in APL was identified. DNA sequence analysis of pRD1 showed that this gene is similar to the DNA sequence of annexin VIII, a gene which encodes a vascular anticoagulant. The annexin VIII gene was assigned to chromosome 10, which indicates that specific expression of this gene in APL is not directly involved in the t(15;17) breakpoint region. We have analyzed the expression of annexin VIII gene in nine t(15;17)-positive APL patients and one APL patient with a chromosome 17q-abnormality. We found that all APL samples expressed high levels of the annexin VIII gene. Expression of the annexin VIII gene in all other leukemias, including acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was undetectable, except in one patient with acute myelogenous leukemia in which a very low level of expression was detected. Annexin VIII is highly expressed in the APL cell line, NB4. Its expression was significantly reduced after 8 hours of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment, whereas the expression of RARA increased several-fold within 4 hours postinduction. Thus, increased expression of RARA preceded the downregulation of annexin VIII after ATRA induction, suggesting an inverse relationship between RARA and annexin VIII expression. Since increased expression of the fusion transcript was seen after ATRA induction and an APL without a t(15;17) translocation expressed high levels of annexin VIII, it appears that increased expression of annexin VIII in APL is not related to the fusion transcript. Therefore, dysregulation of the RARA gene may be related to the overexpression of annexin VIII in APL.","['Chang, K S', 'Wang, G', 'Freireich, E J', 'Daly, M', 'Naylor, S L', 'Trujillo, J M', 'Stass, S A']","['Chang KS', 'Wang G', 'Freireich EJ', 'Daly M', 'Naylor SL', 'Trujillo JM', 'Stass SA']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Annexins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Annexins', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73676-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Apr 1;79(7):1802-10.,['CA 39809-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['RARA', 'pRD1']",,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/L12691', 'GENBANK/M80678', 'GENBANK/M80679', 'GENBANK/M81844', 'GENBANK/M91429', 'GENBANK/M91430', 'GENBANK/M93301', 'GENBANK/X64637', 'GENBANK/X64638', 'GENBANK/X64639']",,,,,,

Seventy-three White Leghorn non-viremic hens with antibody to ALV were used. Eleven of the hens shed infectious ALV into their egg albumen, whereas only 7 of the 11 ALV-positive hens shed ALV antigens. The egg albumen test for infectious ALV was shown to be more effective in detecting the congenitally transmitting hens than that for ALV antigens. Then, twenty of the 62 hens which shed no infectious ALV into the albumen were studied for transmission of ALV to their embryos and for discharging ALV into the oviduct and vagina. Six of the 50 embryos from 4 hens were found to be infected with ALV but all of the 227 embryos from remaining 16 hens were free from the infection. Discharge of the virus into the oviduct and vagina was found both in the 4 transmitting hens and in 6 of the 16 non-transmitting hens. These results suggest that the hens discharging ALV into the oviduct, even though they do not shed ALV into egg albumen, may transmit the virus sporadically to their embryos.","['Tsukamoto, K', 'Hasebe, M', 'Kakita, S', 'Taniguchi, Y', 'Hihara, H', 'Kono, Y']","['Tsukamoto K', 'Hasebe M', 'Kakita S', 'Taniguchi Y', 'Hihara H', 'Kono Y']","['Poultry Disease Laboratory, National Institute of Animal Health, Gifu, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Avian Leukosis/congenital/*transmission', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/immunology/*physiology', 'Chick Embryo/microbiology', '*Chickens', 'Egg White/*microbiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Oviducts/*microbiology', 'Vagina/microbiology']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1292/jvms.54.99 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 1992 Feb;54(1):99-103. doi: 10.1292/jvms.54.99.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The agents which raise intracellular cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP, 8-bromo cAMP, prostaglandin E1, and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, little increased the PAI-2 production when tested alone, but showed significant synergistic effects with PMA or OAG. The synergistic effect between PMA and dibutyryl cAMP was further verified by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody against the PAI-2.

HL60 cells, expressing some characteristics of promyelocytes, can be induced to monocytoid differentiation by calcitriol. Specific nuclear translocation of [3H]calcitriol/VDR was examined after exposure of whole cells to 10(-9) M/l calcitriol in the presence and absence of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled ligand and subsequent isolation of nuclei. Specific nuclear translocation of [3H]calcitriol/VDR was found to be time dependent reaching a maximum of approximately 2100 binding sites/nucleus after 3 h of incubation in HL60 cells, whereas a maximum of approximately 310 binding sites/nucleus was found after 3 h in PBL. Pulse exposure of HL60 to radiolabeled hormone for 3 h followed by culture in medium without serum and calcitriol lead to nuclear retention of approximately 1600 radiolabeled VDR by 8 h and approximately 1000 VDR by 24 h. Radiolabeled VDR disappeared from the nuclear compartment with a halflife of approximately 30 min if cells were cultured with identical concentrations of unlabeled hormone after the pulse (pulse/chase-experiments). No difference of VDR retention in pulse and pulse/chase-experiments was seen in PBL, where VDR halflife was approximately 30 min. No specific translocation into the nuclear compartment was seen when isolated nuclei were incubated in [3H]calcitriol. Radiolabeled hormone/receptor complexes of nuclei isolated from cells exposed for 3 h to radiolabeled hormone--in contrast to identical experiments with intact cells--did not disappear from the nuclear compartment upon incubation of nuclei with identical concentrations of the unlabeled compound. The activity of DNA relaxing enzymes (e.g. topoisomerases I and II) in nuclear extracts was measured using a PBR 322-relaxation-assay. Enhanced overall enzyme activity was found in nuclear extracts by 1 h after incubation with calcitriol (final ethanol concentration 0.0001% v/v) in HL60 and PBL. The enhanced activity disappeared after 2 h in PBL, whereas it was still enhanced by 4 h in HL60. No effect was seen in ethanol treated controls. We conclude that a specific nuclear translocation mechanism exists for calcitriol in both cell types examined, most likely due to translocation of receptor proteins after hormone binding. Translocated hormone/receptor complexes compete for a limited number of specific nuclear binding sites. Enhanced activity of topoisomerases in nuclear extracts upon translocation of VDR might reflect interaction of both within the nuclear compartment, thus initiating DNA-unwinding, a prerequisite of transcription initiation.","['Jakob, F', 'Gieseler, F', 'Tresch, A', 'Hammer, S', 'Seufert, J', 'Schneider, D']","['Jakob F', 'Gieseler F', 'Tresch A', 'Hammer S', 'Seufert J', 'Schneider D']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, University of Wurzburg, Fed.

The control group comprised 92 ALL and 25 NHL patients receiving chemotherapy in remission who were nonvaccinated and susceptible to varicella.

The PBL-ELISA demonstrated that antigen expression levels in infected cattle could vary by more than 50-fold. Inoculation of sheep with dilutions of lymphocytes from two BLV-infected cattle, differentiated in the PBL-ELISA by 50 to 100-fold, suggested that antigen expression levels were correlated with infectivity. Haematological data indicated that increased antigen expression in PBL cultures was associated with an increased number of circulating B-lymphocytes, irrespective of whether or not an animal had lymphocytosis. This supported the hypothesis that BLV-infected cattle that are PBL-ELISA positive are more infectious and may present a greater risk of transmitting the disease. The applicability of the PBL-ELISA to a field situation was assessed with 98 BLV-infected cattle from three commercial dairy herds with infection prevalences of 11%, 23% and 47%. Similar percentages (49%, 50% and 52%) of PBL-ELISA positive cattle were identified among those infected cattle available for testing in the three herds. An additional 22 infected cattle from an experimental herd were tested to assess the stability of antigen expression levels over an 8 month period.

The PCR products subjected to amplification with each primer pair were found to possess sites of digestion by a restriction enzyme, as hypothesized. They did not react with feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected or feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV)-infected cell-derived DNA, and specifically amplified FIV-infected cell-derived DNA. FIV proviral DNA was detected by the PCR method with either primer pair (one-step amplification: single PCR) in DNA derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 7 of 12 FIV antibody-positive cats. When PCR products in each of the 12 cats were subjected to a second amplification using the same primer pair (two-step amplification: double PCR), FIV proviral DNA was detected in all of the cats. When PBL samples collected from three cats that were negative and three that were positive in the single PCR were cultured for a few weeks in the presence of interleukin 2, FIV proviral DNA was detected in all six cats by the single PCR method.

Distinguishable roles for proteolysis and phosphorylation.,6044-50,"Loss of sensitivity to thrombin following an initial response is characteristic of a number of cell types, including platelets. It has recently been proposed that thrombin receptors resemble other G protein-coupled receptors, but that activation involves a novel mechanism in which thrombin cleaves the receptor, exposing a new N terminus that serves as the ligand for the receptor. Based upon this model, we have examined the mechanism of thrombin receptor desensitization by comparing the effects of thrombin with those of a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of the receptor following proteolysis by thrombin: SFLLRNPNDKYEPF or TRP42/55. Like thrombin, TRP42/55 stimulated pertussis toxin-sensitive inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, raised cytosolic Ca2+, and inhibited cAMP formation in the megakaryoblastic HEL cell line. Exposure to either thrombin or TRP42/55 desensitized the cells to both, but not to a third agonist, neuropeptide Y. The rate of recovery after desensitization depended upon the order of agonist addition. Resensitization of the cell to thrombin following a brief exposure to thrombin required up to 24 h and could be inhibited with cycloheximide. Resensitization to TRP42/55 after exposure to thrombin, or to thrombin after exposure to TRP42/55, on the other hand, was detectable within 30 min and could be inhibited by serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors, but not by cycloheximide. Loss of responsiveness to thrombin and TRP42/55 was also observed following addition of the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). However, while the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine completely prevented the desensitization caused by TPA, it had only a limited effect on the desensitization caused by TRP42/55. These results demonstrate that the G protein-mediated effects of thrombin can be reproduced by a receptor-derived peptide and suggest that desensitization occurs by at least two mechanisms. The first, which is seen with thrombin, but not TRP42/55, involves proteolysis and requires protein synthesis for recovery. The second, which occurs with TRP42/55 and TPA, as well as with thrombin, involves phosphorylation, possibly of the receptor itself. Although protien kinase C is activated by thrombin and is presumably responsible for the desensitization caused by TPA, it does not appear to play a major role in receptor desensitization caused by thrombin and TRP42/55. This suggests that other kinases, such as those which inactivate adrenergic receptors and rhodopsin, are involved in the down-regulation of thrombin receptor function.","['Brass, L F']",['Brass LF'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombin)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '4L6452S749 (Inositol)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inositol/metabolism', 'Inositol Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombin', 'Staurosporine', 'Thrombin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1992/03/25 00:00,1992/03/25 00:01,['1992/03/25 00:00'],"['1992/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42659-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Mar 25;267(9):6044-50.,['P01-HL40387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was increased by PGE1 and PGE2 over the same concentration range at which PLD activation was seen. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin greatly inhibited the PGE-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i, implying that a G protein participates in the PGE receptor signaling process. The peak level and also the plateau level of Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by these prostaglandins were markedly decreased in Ca(2+)-depleted medium, indicating that both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ stores contribute to the changes in [Ca2+]i. Likewise, activation of PLD by PGE1 and PGE2 was abolished by pertussis toxin pretreatment or incubation in Ca(2+)-depleted medium. U73122, a putative phospholipase C inhibitor, blocked both Ca2+ mobilization and PLD activation in PGE-stimulated cells. Furthermore, the intracellular loading of BAPTA, a Ca2+ chelator, inhibited both Ca2+ mobilization and PLD activation by PGE1 and PGE2 in a similar dose-dependent manner. Simultaneous measurement of [Ca2+]i and PLD activity in the same cell samples indicated that PLD activity increases as a function of [Ca2+]i in a similar fashion in cells stimulated either by PGEs or by the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Taken together, these findings suggest that a rise in [Ca2+]i is necessary for PGE-stimulated PLD activity in human erythroleukemia cells.","['Wu, H', 'James-Kracke, M R', 'Halenda, S P']","['Wu H', 'James-Kracke MR', 'Halenda SP']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Missouri, Columbia 65212.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Estrenes)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '112648-68-7', '(1-(6-((3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Alprostadil/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/biosynthesis', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Estrenes/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Prostaglandins E/*pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1992/04/07 00:00,1992/04/07 00:01,['1992/04/07 00:00'],"['1992/04/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/07 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00128a010 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1992 Apr 7;31(13):3370-7. doi: 10.1021/bi00128a010.,['HL38406/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The flavones differed from the catechins in causing unwinding of duplex DNA, but both classes of compound induced enzymic DNA breakage at the same sites on DNA. Moreover, the cleavage specificity was the same as that for the known intercalator 4'-(acridin-9-ylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide, suggesting that these agents trap the same cleavable complex. Analysis of some 30 flavonoid compounds allowed elucidation of the structure-function relationships for topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage. For flavonoid inhibitors an unsaturated double bond between positions 2 and 3 of the pyrone ring and hydroxy groups at the 5, 7, 3' and 4' positions favoured efficient cleavage. Hydroxy substitutions could be tolerated at the 3, 6 and 5' positions. Indeed, the absence of substituents at the 3', 4' and 5' positions could be compensated by a hydroxy group at position 6 (baicalein). Similar requirements have been reported for flavonoid inhibitors of protein kinase C that act competitively with ATP, suggesting interaction with a conserved protein feature. Formation of the cleavable complex is a cytotoxic lesion that may contribute to the growth-inhibitory properties of flavones observed for three human tumour cell lines. These results are discussed in regard to the selectivity of antiviral agents.","['Austin, C A', 'Patel, S', 'Ono, K', 'Nakane, H', 'Fisher, L M']","['Austin CA', 'Patel S', 'Ono K', 'Nakane H', 'Fisher LM']","[""Department of Cellular and Molecular Science, St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '49QAH60606 (baicalein)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA, Superhelical/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction', '*Flavanones', 'Flavonoids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2820883 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1992 Mar 15;282 ( Pt 3):883-9. doi: 10.1042/bj2820883.,,,,PMC1130870,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell-surface antigen analysis revealed the expression of CD7, CD28, CD30, CD45R0, TLiSA and S6F1 antigen besides the originally recorded CD25, CD56 and HLA-DR antigen. Gene rearrangement analysis showed the germ-line genotype, including TCR gamma and delta as well as beta chain. The Northern blot study using the CD3 epsilon and CD3 delta chain gene probes revealed CD3 epsilon, but not CD3 delta RNA. The YT-0 cells exhibited NK and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity, but the YT2C2 and YTC3 cells did not. It was not resolved whether the fresh neoplastic NK-like cells of the YT-cell donor carry EBV genome, but YT cells, the first lymphoid cell line found to have EBV genome and non-B lymphoid properties, are valuable for investigating the relationship between EBV and human non-B lymphoid hematopoietic cells.","['Yoneda, N', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Kawano, S', 'Teshigawara, K', 'Oka, T', 'Fukuda, M', 'Yamaguchi, N']","['Yoneda N', 'Tatsumi E', 'Kawano S', 'Teshigawara K', 'Oka T', 'Fukuda M', 'Yamaguchi N']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Viral/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*microbiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Feb;6(2):136-41.,,,['GD3&egr;'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe here a sensitive and readily applicable assay for the detection of bovine leukemia proviral DNA. Detection relies on initial amplification of proviral DNA by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by an enzyme-linked assay (PCR-ELA). Amplification is carried out by using one biotinylated primer and a second primer containing the GCN4 protein binding site. DNA is detected by a colorimetric assay after it is coupled to GCN4-coated plates and subsequently incubated with horseradish-streptavidin peroxidase and the appropriate substrate to produce a chromogenic reaction. It was possible to detect proviral DNA for all of eight bovine leukemia virus-infected calves by 2 weeks postinfection. Use of the more conventional agar gel immunodiffusion assay failed to reveal the presence of the virus in any of the animals up to 4 weeks postinfection. The PCR-ELA detected as little as 0.1 to 0.2 ng of amplified DNA per well, which compares very favorably with ethidium bromide staining of gels, by which 1 to 2 ng per lane was detected. This method lends itself to mass screening, is carried out in a similar way to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and does not require gel electrophoresis or the use of radioactive gene probes.","['Naif, H M', 'Daniel, R C', 'Cougle, W G', 'Lavin, M F']","['Naif HM', 'Daniel RC', 'Cougle WG', 'Lavin MF']","['Queensland Cancer Fund Research Unit, Bancroft Centre, Herston, Brisban, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/diagnosis', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/diagnosis', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Genes, env', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proviruses/genetics/isolation & purification']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jcm.30.3.675-679.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1992 Mar;30(3):675-9. doi: 10.1128/jcm.30.3.675-679.1992.,,,,PMC265131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kinetic (pulse-chase) analysis of synthesis and processing, coupled with endoglycosidase (endo H) and neuraminidase digestions revealed the existence of a novel high molecular weight processing intermediate, gp95, containing endo H-resistant terminally glycosylated oligosaccharide chains. In contrast to previously published conclusions, our data indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the envelope precursor occurs after the acquisition of endo H-resistant chains and terminal glycosylation and thus after the mannosidase II step. In the same W7MG1 cell line, the type and order of murine leukemia virus envelope protein processing events was identical to that for the mouse mammary tumor virus envelope protein. Interestingly, complete mouse mammary tumor virus envelope protein processing requires the addition of glucocorticoid hormone, whereas murine leukemia virus envelope protein processing occurs constitutively in these W7MG1 cells. We propose that all retroviral envelope proteins share a common processing pathway in which proteolytic processing is a late event that follows acquisition of endo H resistance and terminal glycosylation.","['Bedgood, R M', 'Stallcup, M R']","['Bedgood RM', 'Stallcup MR']","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California Health Sciences Center, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.96 (Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase)']",IM,"['Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycosylation', 'Golgi Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Hexosaminidases/metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase', 'Neuraminidase/metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",1992/04/05 00:00,1992/04/05 00:01,['1992/04/05 00:00'],"['1992/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)50536-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Apr 5;267(10):7060-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This tumor should be considered strongly in the differential diagnosis of anterior mediastinal masses. Benign teratomas are common in this site, and complete surgical resection results in cure of nearly all patients. Malignant mediastinal seminomas are highly curable and either radiotherapy (mediastinal disease) or cisplatin-based chemotherapy (metastatic disease) will result in long-term survival in 80% or more of patients. Mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell malignancies represent a clinically and biologically distinct subset of mediastinal germ cell neoplasms. Relative to their testicular counterparts, these tumors carry a poor prognosis, but, with newer refinements in cisplatin-based chemotherapy, approximately half of these patients will survive their illness. The history of success with chemotherapy should prompt thorough pathologic and serologic evaluation of all patients with mediastinal malignancies in hopes of defining a curable process. In particular, poorly differentiated carcinomas at this site should be treated as germ cell tumors, and so long-term survival will be attainable. Mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumors are associated with the development of nongerm cell malignancies such as embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas and hematologic malignancies such as acute megakaryocytic leukemia and malignant histiocytosis. The development of these associated malignancies is not related to therapy and represents a true biological link between these malignancies. It is likely that the development of these malignancies is an expression of the multipotential nature of primitive germ cells. Careful clinical and biologic investigations of these rare transformations may lead to greater understanding of the regulation of events in the malignant process.","['Nichols, C R']",['Nichols CR'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,8917640,,IM,"['Humans', 'Klinefelter Syndrome/etiology', '*Mediastinal Neoplasms/diagnosis/etiology/pathology/therapy', '*Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/diagnosis/etiology/pathology/therapy']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1992 Jan;4(1):45-50.,,,,,,,39,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cells at various stages of development, including concanavalin A-activated splenic T cells, immature pre-T cells, and even small cortical thymocytes, could be successfully transfected. A variety of model DNA constructs were compared in which different viral promoter regions were used to drive expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. All showed enhanced expression in cells that had been acutely stimulated with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and phorbol ester as chemical proxies for T-cell receptor-mediated signals. In addition, splenocytes but not thymocytes required prior treatment with a mitogen and interleukin-2 in order to express these constructs, implying that even postmitotic thymocytes may be held in a quasiactivated state. A most striking result was the finding that the viral regulatory sequences in the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat and the simian virus 40 early region were subject to sharply differential regulation, with a rank order that changed depending on the developmental stage of the T cells. The most immature thymic blasts and several lymphoma cell lines expressed the pRSV-Cat and pSV2-Cat constructs similarly, but cortical thymocytes exhibited a strong preference for pSV2-Cat. Splenic concanavalin A-stimulated blasts, on the other hand, slightly preferred pRSV-Cat, a tendency which became exaggerated in factor-dependent T-cell lines. The ratio of pRSV-Cat to pSV2-Cat expression varied according to cell type by as much as 500-fold. These results argue against a trivial linkage of promoter preference to cell cycle status but instead provide evidence that activation of T cells at distinct stages of differentiation results in the expression of different ensembles of nuclear regulatory proteins. In contrast to the simian virus 40 and Rous sarcoma virus promoter regions, the long terminal repeats of the retroviruses mink cell focus-forming virus and Akv were expressed well in all primary T-lineage cells. Thus, they represent excellent model promoters for engineering developmental stage-independent expression of exogenous genes in murine T cells.","['Novak, T J', 'Yoshimura, F K', 'Rothenberg, E V']","['Novak TJ', 'Yoshimura FK', 'Rothenberg EV']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral/*genetics', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', '*Transfection']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.12.4.1515-1527.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Apr;12(4):1515-27. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.4.1515-1527.1992.,"['AI19752/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC369593,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify mouse strains resistant to MAIDS, and to understand the genetic factors controlling susceptibility to the disease, we screened more than 20 inbred strains of mice for their susceptibility to MAIDS. For this study, mice of the Fv-1n/n, Fv-1b/b, or Fv-1n/b genotype were inoculated with stocks of defective MAIDS virus pseudotyped with N-tropic, B-tropic, or NB-tropic helper murine leukemia virus, respectively. Strains could be classified as susceptible, resistant, or moderately resistant. None of the individual H-2 haplotypes examined appears to explain resistance to MAIDS by itself. However, a very good correlation between the susceptibility or resistance phenotype and the presence or absence of defective proviral DNA and RNA in the spleen of these animals was found. Since the presence of defective proviral DNA and RNA reflects the oligoclonal proliferation of the cells infected by the defective MAIDS virus, our results strongly suggest that this target cell expansion is genetically controlled and is necessary and perhaps even sufficient for the development of the disease.","['Huang, M', 'Simard, C', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Huang M', 'Simard C', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/genetics/*immunology/microbiology/pathology', 'Proviruses/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Virus Replication']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.4.2398-2406.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Apr;66(4):2398-406. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.4.2398-2406.1992.,,,,PMC289035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we describe a rapid, sensitive immunofluorescence assay useful for characterizing the initial binding of MuLV to cells. By using the rat monoclonal antibody 83A25 (L. H. Evans, R. P. Morrison, F. G. Malik, J. Portis, and W. J. Britt, J. Virol. 64:6176-6183, 1990), which recognizes an epitope of the envelope gp70 molecule common to the different classes of MuLV, it is possible to analyse the binding of ecotropic, amphotropic, or xenotropic MuLV by using only a single combination of primary and secondary antibodies. The MuLV binding detected by this assay is envelope receptor specific and matches the susceptibility to infection determined for cells from a variety of species. The binding of amphotropic MuLV to NIH 3T3 cells was shown to be rapid, saturable, and temperature dependent. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells normally lack the ability to bind ecotropic virus and are not infectible by ecotropic vectors. Expression of the cloned ecotropic retrovirus receptor gene (Rec) in CHO-K1 cells confers high levels of ecotropic virus-specific binding and confers susceptibility to infection. Characterization of MuLV binding to primary cells may provide insight into the infectibility of cells by retroviruses and aid in the selection of appropriate vectors for gene transfer experiments.","['Kadan, M J', 'Sturm, S', 'Anderson, W F', 'Eglitis, M A']","['Kadan MJ', 'Sturm S', 'Anderson WF', 'Eglitis MA']","['Gene Transfer Laboratory, Genetic Therapy, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.4.2281-2287.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Apr;66(4):2281-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.4.2281-2287.1992.,,,,PMC289022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus the alteration of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activity could be linked to the resistance of H2O2 of human leukemia cells.","['Kasugai, I', 'Yamada, M']","['Kasugai I', 'Yamada M']","['Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Catalase/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*toxicity', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(92)90129-u [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992;16(2):173-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90129-u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATRA is able to activate the maturation of malignant cells from patients with APL either in vitro or in vivo. Complete remission was obtained without any feature of aplastic phase and the severe bleeding diathesis rapidly disappeared. The major adverse effect is the occurrence of hyperleukocytosis which is prevented by the addition of chemotherapy. A progressive acquired resistance appears during ATRA treatment and prolonged event free survival time is obtained after consolidation with cytotoxic drugs. In APL the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene is rearranged and fused with a novel gene called PML. The hybrid PML-RAR product could have a role in the leukemogenesis blocking the effect of the normal RAR on target genes. Retinoic acid exerts a differentiating effect either by the induction of a normal activity of the aberrant product in the presence of pharmacological concentration, or by an over-expression of the normal allele. The results obtained by cellular and molecular biology gave opportunities to confirm the diagnosis, to follow the assessment of the minimal residual disease and to understand the acquired resistance.","['Degos, L']",['Degos L'],"[""Institut d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530100202 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1992 Mar;10(2):63-9. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530100202.,,,['RARa'],,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although at least seven isoenzymes of PLC have been characterized in different mammalian cells, the isoenzyme involved in Fc epsilon RI-mediated signal transduction and the mechanism of its activation have not been demonstrated. We now report that PLC-gamma 1 is translocated to the membrane of mast cells after aggregation of Fc epsilon RI. Activation of rat basophilic leukemia cells, a rat mast cell line, with oligomeric IgE resulted in an increase in PLC activity in washed membrane preparations in a cell free assay containing exogenous [3H]phosphatidylinositol (PI). The increase in PLC activity has the same dose-response to oligomeric IgE as receptor mediated hydrolysis of inositol lipids (PI hydrolysis) in intact cells. Analysis by Western blot probed with anti-PLC-gamma 1 antibody revealed that there is a three- to fourfold increase in PLC-gamma 1 in membranes from activated cells. The increase in PLC activity is augmented a further 20% by the addition of orthovanadate to the incubation medium suggesting that a tyrosine phosphatase is involved in the down-regulation of this phenomenon. These findings demonstrate translocation of PLC-gamma 1 to the membrane following activation of a receptor which does not contain intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Activation of PLC-gamma 1 by this pathway may account for Fc epsilon RI-mediated PI hydrolysis.","['Atkinson, T P', 'Kaliner, M A', 'Hohman, R J']","['Atkinson TP', 'Kaliner MA', 'Hohman RJ']","['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Temperature', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Apr 1;148(7):2194-200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients eligible for this study had advanced recurrent indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients had symptomatic or progressive disease, a performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. Only patients failing one or two regimens of prior chemotherapy were eligible. Patients who had received prior extended field irradiation were ineligible. Patients received TBI twice weekly (Tuesday and Friday) to a total of 10 doses at 15 cGy/fx. WR-2721 was given intravenously over 15 min beginning 30 min before irradiation. The escalation of WR-2721 was Level 1: 740 mg/m2 and Level 2: 910 mg/m2. The MTD of WR-2721 was that dose which produced predictable and reversible toxicity and would not interfere with patient well-being. Seven patients were entered onto the study, three at 740 mg/m2 and four at 910 mg/m2. Five patients had CLL and two patients small lymphocytic NHL. No patient had hypotension or nausea requiring reduction in dose level or even interruption of infusion of WR-2721. At 740 mg/m2 no grade 3 or 4 toxicities related to WR-2721 were observed, but two patients could not complete treatment because of TBI-induced prolonged thrombocytopenia following treatments 5 and 8. One patient completed all 10 treatments. At 910 mg/m2 of WR-2721, two patients requested removal from study because of malaise, one after 5 cycles and one after 7 cycles. One patient completed all 10 treatments. One patient was treated with a modified schedule of 7 treatments of 20 cGy/fx and tolerated and completed all treatments but developed significant thrombocytopenia following completion of treatment. No patients had disease progression during treatment. The median survival was 11 months. This study indicates that WR-2721 given at 910 mg/m2 twice weekly with TBI is well tolerated for at least 5 treatments and that 910 mg/m2 of WR-2721 is the MTD with this regimen. In view of the importance of total radiation dose in achieving a response with TBI, a dose escalation study of TBI with 910 mg/m2 of WR-2721 should be performed in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['Coia, L', 'Krigel, R', 'Hanks, G', 'Comis, R', 'Algazy, K', 'Peters, R', 'McCulloch, W', 'Schien, P']","['Coia L', 'Krigel R', 'Hanks G', 'Comis R', 'Algazy K', 'Peters R', 'McCulloch W', 'Schien P']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center/University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19111.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,['M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)'],IM,"['Amifostine/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(92)90525-M [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(92)90525-m [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1992;22(4):791-4. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(92)90525-m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ouabain, known to bind extracellularly to the alpha-subunit of the Na(+)-K+ pump, inhibits the pump activity. The L 1210 cells were found to possess ouabain binding sites at 7.5 fmol/10(6) cells. Ouabain significantly inhibited the Spd uptake in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum inhibition of Spd uptake by ouabain was observed beyond 200 microM. Spd transport was inversely correlated with the [3H]ouabain binding to L 1210 cells: an increase in the saturation of ouabain binding to L 1210 cells resulted in a decrease of the Spd uptake process. Treatment of L 1210 cells with protein kinase C activator phorbol esters increased the Spd transport and, also, ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake, a measure of the activity of the Na(+)-K+ pump. H-7, a protein kinase C inhibitor, significantly inhibited the ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake by L 1210 cells. Phorbol esters stimulated the level, but not the rate, of 22Na+ influx. Addition of H-7 to L 1210 cells inhibited the 22Na+ influx process.

Four weeks later LTC cells were harvested and injected into lethally irradiated female recipients either alone or together with 2 x 10(5) female marrow cells with selectively compromised long-term repopulating potential to assay for totipotent and competitive repopulating units (CRU), respectively. A total of 46 unique clones were detected in recipients 5 wk to 7 mo after transplant. Half of these clones (22 of 46) included both lymphoid and myeloid progeny. Eight of the 22 lympho-myeloid clones were represented in multiple recipients, in some cases after injection of limiting numbers of CRU, thus indicating repopulation from sibling totipotent stem cells generated during the initial 4-wk period in LTC. Serial analysis of cells released into the nonadherent fraction of LTC for up to 7 wk provided additional evidence of the continuing proliferation in LTC of totipotent stem cells with long-term repopulating potential. The frequency of CRU determined from limiting-dilution analyses of LTC-derived cells was the same for recipients analyzed at 5 wk or 7 mo after transplantation and was also the same whether marrow or thymus repopulation was assessed. These assays showed that concurrent with the expansion of some totipotent cells revealed by retroviral marking, there was a slow but net 6.5-fold decrease in total CRU numbers after 4 wk in LTC. These results show the capacity of some totipotent hematopoietic stem cells to be maintained and amplified over extensive time periods in vitro without diminution of their long-term in vivo repopulating potential. These results also set the stage for analogous studies of human stem cell selection and expansion in vitro, which may be important for future gene therapy protocols.","['Fraser, C C', 'Szilvassy, S J', 'Eaves, C J', 'Humphries, R K']","['Fraser CC', 'Szilvassy SJ', 'Eaves CJ', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Integration']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.5.1968 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Mar 1;89(5):1968-72. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.5.1968.,,,,PMC48575,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that a monoclonal antibody (IIIA4) raised against LK63 recognized a glycosylated, cell-surface 135-kDa molecule (HEK), which displayed tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. The HEK protein was purified by using a IIIA4 antibody column and both N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences were obtained. A 51-mer degenerate oligonucleotide based on the internal amino acid sequence was used to screen an LK63-derived lambda gt10 cDNA library under low-stringency hybridization conditions. One clone of 2.5 kilobases (kb) was isolated and characterized and used to rescreen the library under more-stringent hybridization conditions. A 4.5-kb clone containing the entire HEK coding region was isolated and its complete DNA sequence was determined. The 4.5-kb insert was subcloned into the expression vector CDM8 and transfected into COS cells. COS cells transfected with the sense HEK/CDM8 construct stained specifically with the IIIA4 antibody, thereby confirming that the antigen recognized by the IIIA4 antibody and the expressed protein product of the HEK cDNA clone were identical. DNA sequence analysis revealed that HEK is a newly discovered member of the EPH/ELK family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Northern blot analysis of a number of cell lines demonstrated the expression of 5.5- to 6.0-kb HEK transcripts in LK63 and the T-cell lines JM and HSB-2. Southern blot analysis of DNA from LK63 suggested that the HEK gene was neither amplified nor rearranged in the LK63 tumor.","['Wicks, I P', 'Wilkinson, D', 'Salvaris, E', 'Boyd, A W']","['Wicks IP', 'Wilkinson D', 'Salvaris E', 'Boyd AW']","['Lions Clinical Cancer Laboratory, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor, EphA3', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transfection']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.5.1611 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Mar 1;89(5):1611-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.5.1611.,,,,PMC48502,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/M83941'],,,,,,

This study demonstrates that these binding sites have the characteristics of receptors specific for HrHF, and the binding characteristics and internalization of HrHF to MOLT-4 cells have now been examined. Iodinated HrHF was displaced by an excess of unlabeled HrHF. Heavy ferritin was the major subunit bound with only a small amount of light-ferritin binding, consistent with our immunofluorescence studies. Scatchard plot analysis of the competitive binding data for HrHF revealed an association constant of 6.3 to 6.7 x 10(7) L/mol with approximately 6000 to 15,000 receptor sites per MOLT-4 cell. Internalization of HrHF was demonstrated with pronase. Chloroquine substantially reduced the uptake of HrHF. Release of internalized HrHF was not observed when cells were rewarmed to 37 degrees C. These results indicate that HrHF is internalized by a mechanism consistent with receptor-mediated endocytosis, with possible involvement of the lysosome. The internalized HrHF remains associated with the cell.

We have previously identified the protein product of the nm23-H1 gene in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels and have designated it p19/nm23. In neuroblastoma, higher levels of p19/nm23, which are associated with amplification of the N-myc oncogene, large tumor mass, and metastasis, were observed in advanced stage tumors compared with limited stage disease. Because of the variable expression of nm23-H1 in different tumors, we have investigated the relationship between amounts of the protein and cell proliferation. The levels of p19/nm23 were compared between resting and mitotically stimulated normal human PBLs and in leukemia cells. The amount of p19/nm23 increased in normal lymphocytes in response to mitotic stimulation and paralleled the increase in DNA synthesis. In leukemia cells obtained from patients with different subtypes of acute leukemia, p19/nm23 levels were also increased relative to resting normal lymphocytes. Treatment of mitotically stimulated lymphocytes with cyclosporin, which inhibits proliferation, blocked the increase in p19/nm23; treatment of the leukemia cell line HL-60 with dimethylsulfoxide, which induces terminal differentiation, resulted in diminished levels of p19/nm23.

The results show that the presence of histones does not alter the bimodal DNA binding process. Intercalation of the acridine and groove binding of the netropsin part of the drug are both observed with chromatin preparations. Moreover, the hybrid has a clear topoisomerase II-DNA cleavable complex-inducing activity close to that of m-AMSA. The role of the two parts of the hybrid ligand is discussed in relation to ternary complex formation. Two cell lines (L1210 leukemia and MCF7 mammary carcinoma) were compared in their sensitivity to the tested ligand. The drug, which appears to be an efficient growth inhibitor of leukemic cells in vitro, reveals moderate activity against P388 leukemia in vivo. The biological activity of the hybrid may derive from a mechanism that involves DNA binding and topoisomerase II inhibition. This study demonstrates that agents which intercalate and bind to the minor groove of DNA simultaneously represent a new class of drugs interfering with topoisomerase II and provide opportunities for the development of new antitumour agents.","['Bailly, C', ""Collyn-d'Hooghe, M"", 'Lantoine, D', 'Fournier, C', 'Hecquet, B', 'Fosse, P', 'Saucier, J M', 'Colson, P', 'Houssier, C', 'Henichart, J P']","['Bailly C', ""Collyn-d'Hooghe M"", 'Lantoine D', 'Fournier C', 'Hecquet B', 'Fosse P', 'Saucier JM', 'Colson P', 'Houssier C', 'Henichart JP']","['INSERM Unite 16, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '64B3O0RD7N (Netropsin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Design', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Netropsin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/toxicity', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1992/02/04 00:00,1992/02/04 00:01,['1992/02/04 00:00'],"['1992/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/04 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(92)90564-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(92)90564-y [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1992 Feb 4;43(3):457-66. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(92)90564-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The induction of differentiation of M1 cells can be inhibited by protein inhibitors termed differentiation inhibiting factors (I-factors) in a cell lysate and conditioned medium of differentiation resistant M1 cells. Production of the I-factor activity in resistant M1 cells is well associated with development of resistance of M1 cells to differentiation inducers. We have now purified one of the I-factors from conditioned medium of differentiation resistant M1 cells. The purified I-factor has a relative molecular mass of approximately 16000-17000 Da (16K I-factor). The amino acid sequence of all fragments of the 16K I-factor we have found are identical with Nm23/nucleoside diphosphate kinase (EC2.7.4.6) protein involved in tumor metastasis. The findings indicate that the I-factor, a candidate suppressor protein for differentiation of leukemic cells, is Nm23/nucleoside diphosphate kinase protein.","['Okabe-Kado, J', 'Kasukabe, T', 'Honma, Y', 'Hayashi, M', 'Henzel, W J', 'Hozumi, M']","['Okabe-Kado J', 'Kasukabe T', 'Honma Y', 'Hayashi M', 'Henzel WJ', 'Hozumi M']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Dexamethasone', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification', 'Phagocytosis', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1992/02/14 00:00,1992/02/14 00:01,['1992/02/14 00:00'],"['1992/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-291X(92)91829-F [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(92)91829-f [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1992 Feb 14;182(3):987-94. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(92)91829-f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The topoisomerase II (Topo II)-mediated DNA cleavage activities induced by representative compounds 3-(2-chloroethylamino) methyl-1,8-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone (SK-31690), 3-bis [(2-chloroethyl)amino]methyl-1,8-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone (SK-31662), and 3-(2-hydroxyethylamino)methy-1,8-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinon e (SK-31694), and their cytotoxicities, have been investigated. All three compounds inhibited the kinetoplast DNA decatenation catalyzed by DNA Topo II. These compounds inhibited leukemia cell growth and stimulated, in a dose-dependent manner from 0.5 to 60 microM, the formation of Topo II-DNA cleavable complexes, when 3'-32P-labeled DNA was used. The mapping of Topo II-mediated DNA cleavage sites using HindIII-digested 3'-32P-labeled DNA showed that, at 10 microM, these compounds induced protein-linked DNA breaks that correlated with cytotoxicity, with respect to their maximal efficacy or the reciprocal concentration for the half-maximal effect. The reversibility study showed that the amounts of protein-linked DNA cleavage induced by 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide and VP-16 as well as SK-31694, which lacks alkylating potential, were markedly decreased during 30-sec exposure to 65 degrees or 0.5 M NaCl. In contrast, protein-linked DNA cleavages induced by SK-31662, which has two alkylating functionalities, and by SK-31690, which has one alkylating functionality in its structure, cannot be reversed during the 15-min exposure to 65 degrees or 0.5 M NaCl. These data suggest that Topo II is a major cellular target for cytotoxicity of these compounds. Furthermore, DNA intercalators with alkylating potential interact with Topo II-DNA cleavable complexes in an irreversible manner, with enhanced toxicity.","['Kong, X B', 'Rubin, L', 'Chen, L I', 'Ciszewska, G', 'Watanabe, K A', 'Tong, W P', 'Sirotnak, F M', 'Chou, T C']","['Kong XB', 'Rubin L', 'Chen LI', 'Ciszewska G', 'Watanabe KA', 'Tong WP', 'Sirotnak FM', 'Chou TC']","['Laboratory of Biochemical Pharmacology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '111822-93-6 (3-bis((2-chloroethyl)amino)methyl-1,8-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone)', '121210-80-8 (3-(2-hydroxyethylamino)methyl-1,8-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Anthraquinones/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1992 Feb;41(2):237-44.,['CA18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular clone pNE-8 retains pathogenic properties of Cas-Br-E. The neurotropic determinants are known; however, the mechanism of neuropathogenesis is unknown. We examined the temporal development of disease after infection of SWR/J mice with pNE-8 virus. Development of CNS lesions, cellular targets of viral replication, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and integrity of blood-brain barrier were determined in mice infected with pNE-8 virus; and compared with uninfected, sham-infected, and nonneuropathogenic virus-infected mice. During 24 weeks of pNE-8 infection, noninflammatory spongiform lesions developed initially in the lumbar spinal cord and progressed to involve the brainstem and deep cerebellar nuclei. Virions and viral antigens accumulated for 18 weeks postinfection and then declined. Major sites of viral infection outside the CNS were splenic megakaryocytes, and skeletal muscle. Cellular targets of viral replication in the CNS included neurons, oligodendrocytes, and capillary endothelium. No astrocytic infection was observed; however, a reactive gliosis marked the development of clinical symptoms and histopathology. Spongiform lesions began as swelling of perivascular astrocytic processes. Intramyelinic vacuoles with splitting of myelin at major dense lines were prominent around dystrophic axons at later time points. Dendritic processes showed vacuolization and local degeneration. Viral particles were most commonly observed in extracellular spaces and within rough endoplasmic reticulum of neurons, oligodendrocytes, and splenic megakaryocytes. Infected megakaryocytes and regions of spleen containing viral aggregates showed accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Areas of histopathology in the CNS showed accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins but unlike spleen, viral proteins were not highly ubiquitinated. Disruption of the blood brain barrier was only evident at late stages of infection. In conclusion, the neuropathogenic damage associated with pNE-8 infection appears to be tightly associated with direct viral infection of oligodendroglia and neurons.","['Nagra, R M', 'Burrola, P G', 'Wiley, C A']","['Nagra RM', 'Burrola PG', 'Wiley CA']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California, San-Diego, La Jolla.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/physiology', 'Brain/microbiology/*pathology', 'Brain Diseases/*microbiology/pathology', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*pathology', 'Spinal Cord/microbiology/pathology', 'Viral Proteins/analysis']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1992 Mar;66(3):292-302.,['NS27417/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence identity comparisons between eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II and bacterial gyrase (bacterial DNA topoisomerase II) indicate that the position of the common mutation observed in mAMSA-resistant human TOP2 corresponds to that of the point mutation nal-31 in the Escherichia coli gyrase B gene, which confers resistance to nalidixic acid. Because mAMSA and nalidixic acid are known to act on their respective targets by a common mechanism of trapping the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediates, these results provide strong evidence that the 170 kDa form of human DNA topoisomerase II is a major cellular target of mAMSA, and that Arg486 of this enzyme is involved in mAMSA-mediated trapping of the covalent enzyme-DNA complex.","['Lee, M S', 'Wang, J C', 'Beran, M']","['Lee MS', 'Wang JC', 'Beran M']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.

Exposure to low concentrations of okadaic acid (2-8nM) for 24-48 hr caused greater than 70% of cells to arrest at G2/M, with up to 40% of the cells arrested in early mitosis. Cell viability decreased rapidly after 48 hr of treatment, and morphological and DNA structure analysis indicated that this was primarily due to the induction of apoptosis. The cells arrested in mitosis by 8 nM okadaic acid could be highly enriched by density gradient centrifugation and underwent apoptosis when further cultured either with or without okadaic acid, indicating that the effects of okadaic acid were irreversible. In contrast to the effects of low concentrations of okadaic acid, high concentrations (500 nM), inhibited proliferation in less than 3 hr. Remarkably, the majority of cells also entered a mitosis-like state characterized by dissolution of the nuclear membrane and condensation and partial separation of chromosomes. However, these cells had a diploid content of DNA, indicating that the cell cycle arrest occurred at G1/S with premature chromosome condensation (PCC), rather than at G2/M. If cells were first blocked at G1/S with hydroxyurea and then treated with okadaic acid, greater than 90% developed PCC in less than 3 hr without replicating their DNA.
