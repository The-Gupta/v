METHODS: The mRNA expression of individual NF-kappaB subunits in CD5(+)CD19(+) cells (CLL B-cells) from bone marrow (BM) of 56 patients with B-CLL was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. An ELISA-based NF-kappaB family transcription factor activity assay was performed to quantify the kappaB DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts from CLL B-cells. Cell death of CLL-B cells was determined by PI staining, RelA and RelB expression at protein level of CLL B-cells by Western blot analyses. RESULTS: The expression levels of RelA, p50, RelB and p52 mRNA in CLL B-cells were all higher than that of normal B cells with statistical significance (P<0.05). RelA was activated in almost all the patients detected while RelB activity was induced in part of samples. The average RelA activity in CLL B-cells was increased compared to that in normal B cells while the average RelB activity was similar to that of normal B cells. When cultured in vitro for 24, 48 and 72 hours, the frequencies of cell death of CLL B-cells from RelA(+)/RelB(-) group were(35.54+/-4.43)%,(50.92+/-8.44)%, and(49.24+/-8.16)%, respectively; that of the RelA(+)/RelB(+) group were (20.65+/-2.37)%, (18.17+/-1.36)%, and (26.55+/-4.08)%, respectively. When the cells from RelA+/RelB(-) group were co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs), the frequencies of cell death of CLL B-cells were decreased compared to that of the cells cultured alone, while the frequencies of cell death of RelA(+)/RelB(-) CLL B-cells were higher than that of CLL B-cells from RelA(+)/RelB(+) group when co-cultured with hBMSCs. RelA and RelB expression in CLL-B cells from the RelA(+)/RelB(-) group was induced after co-cultured with hBMSCs for 48 h. RelB was reduced in the cytoplasm and increased in the nucleus in CLL-B cells from the RelA+/RelB+ group. CONCLUSION: The alternative NF-kappaB was indeed activated and presented heterogeneous in CLL B-cells from BM. Activation of RelB combined with RelA activity could provide the survival advantage to CLL B-cells from BM. Co-culture with hBMSCs could protect CLL-B cells through the induction of RelA and Rel B expressions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chromosome reciprocal translocations of 356 AML cases were detected by multiplex RT-nPCR and karyotyping. The positive samples were further confirmed by split- out PCR and FISH. RESULTS: The fusion genes were detected in 172 patients with the positive detection rate of 48.31%(172/356), which was higher than that of karyotyping (31.46%) (chi(2)=70.314, P<0.01). Multiplex RT-nPCR is superior to karyotyping and FISH in identifying the rare, cryptic chromosome translocation (chi(2)=96.074, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The multiplex RT-nPCR used in this study can quickly, effectively and accurately screen the fusion genes in AML patients, which can provide important evidence for assessing diagnosis and treatment, and also provide necessary information for minimal residual disease (MRD) and prognosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only one study addressed the immunophenotypic changes in refractory disease. We studied changes in leukemia-associated aberrant immunophenotype (LAIP) in patients with refractory and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHOD: We analyzed 47 patients (refractory = 22; relapsed = 25) by MFC, morphology, and cytogenetic studies. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (74%) showed variably changed LAIPs. The frequently altered LAIPs were lack of lineage-specific antigen and lineage infidelity. The most frequently changed marker was CD13, followed by CD33, CD56, CD7, CD4, and CD11b. Cytogenetic clonal evolution at persistence/relapse was observed in 15 patients (32%). Morphologically, three patients (6%) showed significant changes at relapse. Patients with refractory AML had a higher association with poor cytogenetic risk and classification of AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Positive MRD at postinduction was of prognostic significance. Allogeneic stem cell transplant improved overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: LAIP alterations in refractory/relapsed AMLs are common findings. Presence of persistent disease indicates a poor prognosis, regardless of cytogenetic risk or expression of CD7 or CD56. Discordance between cytogenetic and LAIP changes suggests that gross cytogenetic clonal evolution during disease progression only partly contributes to immunophenotypic instability.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],20140306,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia-associated aberrant immunophenotype', 'bone marrow', 'minimal residual disease', 'refractory acute myeloid leukemia', 'relapsed acute myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He presented with febrile neutropenia and a lingual ulcer that did not respond to antibiotic and antifungal regimens. He developed weight gain, lower limb edema, polyserositis, and acute renal failure. Retinoic acid syndrome syndrome was diagnosed. RESULTS: An exhaustive attempt to exclude infectious causes was made performing repeated cultures, histologic examinations, and direct immunofluorescence for HSV. No causative agent was identified. Re-epithelialization of the ulcer was achieved with ATRA cessation and treatment with systemic steroids. DISCUSSION: As far as we are concerned, we report the first case of a lingual ulceration associated with RAS. CONCLUSION: It is important for dermatologists to recognize this cutaneous complication of ATRA as it poses many differential diagnoses in neutropenic patients.",['(c) 2014 The International Society of Dermatology.'],20140306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without proper DNA repair mechanisms, abnormal DNA exchange takes place between sister chromatids and results in genetic instability that may lead to cancer, especially lymphoma and acute myelogenous leukemia, lower and upper gastrointestinal tract neoplasias, cutaneous tumors, and neoplasias in the genitalia and urinary tract. BS patients are usually of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and exhibit narrow facial features, elongated limbs, and several dermatologic complications including photosensitivity, poikiloderma, and telangiectatic erythema. The most concerning manifestation of BS is multiple malignancies, which require frequent screenings and strict vigilance by the physician. Therefore, distinguishing between BS and other dermatologic syndromes of similar presentation such as Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome, Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, and Cockayne Syndrome is paramount to disease management and to prolonging life. BS can be diagnosed through a variety of DNA sequencing methods, and genetic testing is available for high-risk populations. This review consolidates several sources on BS sequelae and aims to suggest the importance of differentiating BS from other dermatologic conditions.

The cause has been attributed to a failure of control of glucose levels. Recent studies have challenged this, and have suggested that there is no evidence for a consistent glycemic threshold in various populations relating to the incidence of retinopathy. The Ehrlichia have been recently suggested as having a role in diabetes. The action of this obligate parasitic bacterium which often affects the cells involved in immunity has the potential of affecting various tissues randomly. This includes self-reactive T or B cells which may be erroneously altered or released from the marrow because of infection of marrow precursors by an Ehrlichia. The discovery of a gene obtained by molecular methodology from a leukemia patient, has given us a tool to identify by molecular methods, the presence of this gene and assumed bacterium in the blood of patients with various syndromes that includes diabetes. Because of the inconsistent evidence of a uniform glycemic threshold in retinopathy and the failure of its control, this hypothesis raises the question of something else that might be causing this damage. The suspected bacterium in diabetes may have as a significant side effect of its infection of the immune system, specifically the site of action of damage to the small vessels of the retina which could lead to what is regularly described in retinopathy; further, and that may include damage to other vessels seen in peripheral and coronary arteries. The availability of a molecular test in whole blood specimens from diabetics suggests a survey for the gene of the bacterium described in diabetic patients and matched controls. Such an investigation could lead to other therapies directed against the bacterium's presence in the marrow if discovered, and strategies to eliminate the harmful self-reactive T or B cells, if found in diabetes.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Diaberic retinopathy', 'Ehrlichia', 'Pathophysiology']",PMC3939746,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TRIM5alpha from many Old World and some New World monkeys can restrict the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), while human TRIM5alpha restricts N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV). TRIM5alpha forms highly dynamic cytoplasmic bodies (CBs) that associate with and translocate on microtubules. However, the functional involvement of microtubules or other cytoskeleton-associated factors in the viral restriction process had not been shown. Here, we demonstrate the dependency of TRIM5alpha-mediated restriction on microtubule-mediated transport. Pharmacological disruption of the microtubule network using nocodazole or disabling it using paclitaxel (originally named taxol) decreased the restriction of N-MLV and HIV-1 by human or simian alleles of TRIM5alpha, respectively. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of dynein motor complexes using erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA) and small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of the dynein heavy chain (DHC) similarly decreased TRIM5alpha-mediated restriction. The loss in restriction resulting from either the disassembly of microtubules or the disruption of dynein motor activity was seen for both endogenous and overexpressed TRIM5alpha and was not due to differences in protein stability or cell viability. Both nocodazole treatment and DHC depletion interfered with the dynamics of TRIM5alpha CBs, increasing their size and altering their intracellular localization. In addition, nocodazole, paclitaxel, and DHC depletion were all found to increase the stability of HIV-1 cores in infected cells, providing an alternative explanation for the decreased restriction. In conclusion, association with microtubules and the translocation activity of dynein motor complexes are required to achieve efficient restriction by TRIM5alpha. IMPORTANCE: The primate innate cellular defenses against infection by retroviruses include a protein named TRIM5alpha, belonging to the family of restriction factors. TRIM5alpha is present in the cytoplasm, where it can intercept incoming retroviruses shortly after their entry. How TRIM5alpha manages to be present at the appropriate subcytoplasmic location to interact with its target is unknown. We hypothesized that TRIM5alpha, either as a soluble protein or a high-molecular-weight complex (the cytoplasmic body), is transported within the cytoplasm by a molecular motor called the dynein complex, which is known to interact with and move along microtubules. Our results show that destructuring microtubules or crippling their function decreased the capacity of human or simian TRIM5alpha to restrict their retroviral targets. Inhibiting dynein motor activity, or reducing the expression of a key component of this complex, similarly affected TRIM5alpha-mediated restriction. Thus, we have identified specific cytoskeleton structures involved in innate antiretroviral defenses.",,20140305,,,PMC4019117,"['MOP-102712/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'MOP-110960/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'MOP-56974/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet the underlying mechanisms associated with this protective effect remain unclear. Genome-wide gene expression profiling of BM-MSCs revealed that coculture with leukemia cells upregulated the transcription of genes associated with nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling. Moreover, primary BM-MSCs from leukemia patients expressed NF-kappaB target genes at higher levels than their normal BM-MSC counterparts. The blockade of NF-kappaB activation via chemical agents or the overexpression of the mutant form of inhibitor kappaB-alpha (IkappaBalpha) in BM-MSCs markedly reduced the stromal-mediated drug resistance in leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. In particular, our unique in vivo model of human leukemia BM microenvironment illustrated a direct link between NF-kappaB activation and stromal-associated chemoprotection. Mechanistic in vitro studies revealed that the interaction between vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) played an integral role in the activation of NF-kappaB in the stromal and tumor cell compartments. Together, these results suggest that reciprocal NF-kappaB activation in BM-MSCs and leukemia cells is essential for promoting chemoresistance in the transformed cells, and targeting NF-kappaB or VLA-4/VCAM-1 signaling could be a clinically relevant mechanism to overcome stroma-mediated chemoresistance in BM-resident leukemia cells.",,20140305,,,PMC3999754,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P50 CA100632-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it becomes more and more important to prevent mortality and morbidity of treatment-associated complications, including venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE occurs predominantly in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma. Pathogenesis of thrombosis in children with cancer is multifactorial. Thrombosis develops due to a combination of the primary disease itself, chemotherapy and supportive care, associated complications, and inherited prothrombotic risk factors probably contributed to the development of thrombosis in these children. Mortality as a result of VTE is low, but both symptomatic and asymptomatic thrombosis cause significant morbidity to justify primary thromboprophylaxis in children with cancer. Identification of risk factors is important to develop predictive models to identify patients at highest risk of thrombosis. Due to variations in risk factors, these models should be tailored to treatment protocols and patient populations. Multicenter studies are needed to investigate which prophylactic strategies are effective and safe to prevent thrombosis in children with cancer.","['Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.']",20140305,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lack of response to chemotherapeutic treatments shows the importance of exploring new therapeutic methods. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharma), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was originally developed for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Several studies revealed that imatinib mesylate inhibits osteoclast differentiation through the M-CSFR pathway and activates osteoblast differentiation through PDGFR pathway, two key cells involved in the vicious cycle controlling the tumour development. The present study investigated the in vitro effects of imatinib mesylate on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and migration ability of five osteosarcoma cell lines (human: MG-63, HOS; rat: OSRGA; mice: MOS-J, POS-1). Imatinib mesylate was also assessed as a curative and preventive treatment in two syngenic osteosarcoma models: MOS-J (mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic osteosarcoma) and POS-1 (undifferentiated osteosarcoma). Imatinib mesylate exhibited a dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect in all cell lines studied. The drug induced a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in most cell lines, except for POS-1 and HOS cells that were blocked in the S phase. In addition, imatinib mesylate induced cell death and strongly inhibited osteosarcoma cell migration. In the MOS-J osteosarcoma model, oral administration of imatinib mesylate significantly inhibited the tumour development in both preventive and curative approaches. A phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array kit revealed that PDGFRalpha, among 7 other receptors (PDFGFRbeta, Axl, RYK, EGFR, EphA2 and 10, IGF1R), appears as one of the main molecular targets for imatinib mesylate. In the light of the present study and the literature, it would be particularly interesting to revisit therapeutic evaluation of imatinib mesylate in osteosarcoma according to the tyrosine-kinase receptor status of patients.",,20140305,,,PMC3944320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Auranofin (Ridaura) is approved for use in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but it exhibited preclinical efficacy in CLL cells. By inhibiting thioredoxin reductase activity and increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, auranofin induced a lethal endoplasmic reticulum stress response in cultured and primary CLL cells. In addition, auranofin displayed synergistic lethality with heme oxygenase-1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase inhibitors against CLL cells. Auranofin overcame apoptosis resistance mediated by protective stromal cells, and it also killed primary CLL cells with deletion of chromosome 11q or 17p.

A systematic literature review on the prevalence, measurement methods, consequences and risk factors for non-adherence to BCR-ABL inhibitors and adherence-enhancing interventions was performed and critically appraised.

Average adherence varied from 19% to almost 100% of the proportion of prescribed drug taken, but it was measured through various different methods and within different study groups. Suboptimal adherence was associated with a negative impact on both clinical and economic outcomes. There is a lack of supportive evidence demonstrating a difference in adherence across BCR-ABL inhibitors and even contradictory results between the 2(nd) generation inhibitors. Drug-related adverse events and forgetfulness were common reasons for intentional and unintentional non-adherence, respectively, but further research is required to identify additional reasons behind non-adherence or patients at risk of non-adherence.

In both conditions, an aberrantly activated oncoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity, namely BCR-ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia, and mutant KIT, mostly KIT D816V, in systemic mastocytosis, is key to disease evolution. The appreciation of the role of such tyrosine kinases in these diseases has led to the development of improved therapies with tyrosine kinase-targeted inhibitors. However, most drugs, including new KIT D816V-blocking agents, have failed to achieve long-lasting remissions in advanced systemic mastocytosis, and there is a similar problem in chronic myeloid leukemia, where imatinib-resistant patients sometimes fail to achieve remission, even with second- or third-line BCR-ABL1 specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. During disease progression, additional signaling pathways become activated in neoplastic cells, but most converge into major downstream networks. Among these, the AKT and STAT5 pathways appear most critical and may result in drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia and systemic mastocytosis. Inhibition of phosphorylation of these targets has proven their crucial role in disease-evolution in both malignancies. Together, these observations suggest that STAT5 and AKT are key drivers of oncogenesis in drug-resistant forms of the diseases, and that targeting STAT5 and AKT might be an interesting approach in these malignancies. The present article provides an overview of our current knowledge about the critical role of AKT and STAT5 in the pathophysiology of chronic myeloid leukemia and systemic mastocytosis and on their potential value as therapeutic targets in these neoplasms.",,,,,PMC3943304,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have suggested that some genetic susceptibility variants are associated with multiple complex traits (pleiotropy). OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether common risk variants identified in cancer GWAS may also increase the risk of developing NHL as the first primary cancer. METHODS: As part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) consortium, 113 cancer risk variants were analyzed in 1,441 NHL cases and 24,183 controls from three studies (BioVU, Multiethnic Cohort Study, Women's Health Initiative) for their association with the risk of overall NHL and common subtypes [diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)] using an additive genetic model adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity. Study-specific results for each variant were meta-analyzed across studies. RESULTS: The analysis of NHL subtype-specific GWAS SNPs and overall NHL suggested a shared genetic susceptibility between FL and DLBCL, particularly involving variants in the major histocompatibility complex region (rs6457327 in 6p21.33: FL OR=1.29, p=0.013; DLBCL OR=1.23, p=0.013; NHL OR=1.22, p=5.9 x E-05). In the pleiotropy analysis, six risk variants for other cancers were associated with NHL risk, including variants for lung (rs401681 in TERT: OR per C allele=0.89, p=3.7 x E-03; rs4975616 in TERT: OR per A allele=0.90, p=0.01; rs3131379 in MSH5: OR per T allele=1.16, p=0.03), prostate (rs7679673 in TET2: OR per C allele=0.89, p=5.7 x E-03; rs10993994 in MSMB: OR per T allele=1.09, p=0.04), and breast (rs3817198 in LSP1: OR per C allele=1.12, p=0.01) cancers, but none of these associations remained significant after multiple test correction.

The mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear: the question of whether tyrosine kinase inhibitors are inactive inside leukemia stem cells or whether leukemia stem cells do not require breakpoint cluster region (Bcr)-Abl signaling is currently under debate. Herein, I propose an alternative model: perhaps the leukemia stem cell requires Bcr-Abl, but is dependent on its kinase-independent functions. Kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor and Janus kinase 2 possess kinase-independent roles in regulation of gene expression; it is worth investigating whether Bcr-Abl has similar functions. Mechanistically, Bcr-Abl is able to activate the Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and/or the Src-kinase Hck/Stat5 pathways in a scaffolding-dependent manner. Whereas the scaffolding activity of Bcr-Abl with Grb2 is dependent on autophosphorylation, kinases such as Hck can use Bcr-Abl as substrate, inducing phosphorylation of Y177 to enable scaffolding ability in the absence of Bcr-Abl catalytic activity. It is worth investigating whether leukemia stem cells exclusively express kinases that are able to use Bcr-Abl as substrate. A kinase-independent role for Bcr-Abl in leukemia stem cells would imply that drugs that target Bcr-Abl's scaffolding ability or its DNA-binding ability should be used in conjunction with current therapeutic regimens to increase their efficacy and eradicate the stem cells of chronic myeloid leukemia.",,20140305,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'Cancer', 'Chemotherapy', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Leukemia']",PMC3973707,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using a Markov model, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of no RT, EBRT, and IMRT over 10 years. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IMRT compared with EBRT under different scenarios to determine the necessary improvement in effectiveness for newer modalities to be cost-effective. We estimated model inputs using women in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database fulfilling the Cancer and Leukemia Group B C9343 trial criteria. RESULTS: The incremental cost of EBRT compared with no RT was $9500 with an ICER of $44600 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The ICERs increased with age, ranging from $38300 (age 70-74 years) to $55800 (age 80 to 94 years) per QALY. The ICERs increased to more than $63800 per QALY for women aged 70 to 74 years with an expected 10-year survival of 25%. Reduction in local recurrence by IMRT compared with EBRT did not have a substantial impact on the ICER of IMRT. IMRT would have to increase the utility of baseline state by 20% to be cost-effective (<$100000 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: EBRT is cost-effective for older women with favorable risk breast cancer, but substantially less cost-effective for women with shorter expected survival. Newer RT modalities would have to be substantially more effective than existing therapies in improving quality of life to be cost-effective.",,20140305,,,PMC3982782,"['P30CA016359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA149045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) were separated from newly diagnosed Ph(+)ALL patients, and injected into 2.1 Gy of (60)Co irradiated and anti-CD122-conditioned NOD/SCID mice through intra femoral injection. Human hematopoietic chimerism in bone marrow and spleen of the recipients was detected by flow cytometry. Morphological analysis of murine marrow cells were performed using May-Giemsa staining. BCR/ABL1 level was detected by RQ-PCR and FISH assays. Furthermore, leukemia infiltration in the organs was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining with anti-human CD19 and anti-human CD34 antibodies. The results indicated that the unsorted BMMNC from Ph(+)ALL patients were able to repopulate human Ph(+)ALL in vivo. The percentages of human CD45(+)CD19(+) cells in bone marrow, and spleen of the recipient mice were 87.2% +/- 10.1% and 79.9% +/- 9.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the engrafted cells possessed same morphology, phenotypic and cytogenetic characteristics as cells from the original Ph(+)ALL patients. Compatible with the clinical features, transplanted Ph(+)ALL cells infiltrated into the brain, liver, and kidney of the recipients.

The peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMNC) of healthy persons were isolated and divided into A and B group. The CIK cells in A group were obtained by using traditional culture method, the CIK cells in B group were prepared by PHA induction. During the cultivation, the cell survival rate and cell absolute value in the cell culture system were counted every 3 days. On day 15 of culture, the cell immunophenotype of 2 groups were detected by flow cytometry, and the ratios of CD3(+)CD56(+), CD3(+)CD8(+) and CD3(+)CD4(+) cells in total cell amount of culture system were accounted. Meantime, the killing activity to K562 cells in different effector-target ratios was detected by using CCK-8 kit between the 2 groups. The results showed that the method of preparing CIK by PHA induction promoted the cell proliferation more than that of the traditional method (P < 0.05), moreover, both the survival rate of cells in 2 groups was more than 90%. The CD3(+)CD8(+), CD3(+)CD56(+) cell ratio in 2 groups obviously increased. As compared with traditional method, the CD3(+)CD8(+) cell level in B group was enhanced (P < 0.05); but there were no statistical differences in increase of CD3(+)CD56(+) cell level and decrease of CD3(+)CD4(+) cell level between 2 groups. while the effector-target ratio is 5:1, 10:1, 20:1 and 40:1, the killing activity of PHA-induced CIK cells to K562 cells was more stronger than traditionally-prepared CIK cells (P < 0.05), moreover, along with increase of effector-target ratio, the difference of killing activity to K562 cells in 2 groups significantly increased. It is concluded that compared with traditional method for preparing CIK cells, the new way by PHA induction can increase the proliferation of CIK cells obviously, enhance the ratio of CD3(+)CD8(+) cells and strengthen the killing activity to the K562 cells.

The autologous CIK cells thus obtained were infused back to individual patients, 28 days as one cycle. The changes in cellular immune function, incidence of infection, independence of hematoglobin or blood transfusion, and progression of disease were observed and assessed before and after therapy. The results showed that the 46 cycles of CIK cell infusion were performed for 5 patients, no adverse reaction was observed in these patients. The percentages of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD8(+) and CD3(+)CD56(+) increased significantly (P < 0.05), The therapy of CIK could significantly reduce the incidence of infection (P < 0.05) and shorten the time of high fever in AML patients (P < 0.05). CIK also could reduce the volume of erythrocyte infusion to maintenance hematoglobin level (P < 0.05). We found that although CIK could not change the outcome of AML, the combination of CIK and chemotherapy could control patients' condition and prolong their survival during the development and end stage of AML.

The results from PCR-microchip electrophoresis showed that there were 151 FLT3-ITD mutation negative, 58 FLT3-ITD mutation positive (58/214, 27.1%) and 5 FLT3-ITD mutation doubtful positive (5/214, 2.3%), while the outcomes from PCR-capillary electrophoresis displayed that there were 147 FLT3-ITD mutation negative and 67 FLT3-ITD mutation positive (67/214, 31.3%) without doubtful positive. In the 67 FLT3-ITD mutation positive samples detected by using PCR-capillary electrophoresis, 4 samples were detected as the negative while 5 samples were measured as the doubtful positive by using PCR-microchip electrophoresis. The followed sequencing analysis demonstrated that the above 9 samples were all FLT3-ITD mutation positive, indicating that PCR-capillary electrophoresis was more accurate and sensitive in screening the FLT3-ITD mutation, although statistic analysis showed that there were no significant differences in the detected results between PCR-microchip electrophoresis and PCR-capillary electrophoresis groups (Pearson Chi-squared Test, P > 0.05). It is concluded that both PCR-microchip electrophoresis and PCR-capillary electrophoresis were convenient and fast for screening FLT3-ITD mutation, but the accuracy of PCR-microchip electrophoresis awaits further improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical characteristics of patients with CEBPA mutation displayed as follows: 75% of AML patients with CEBPA mutation were AML-M1 and AML-M2, the hemoglobin level at newly diagnosis was higher and the platelet count at newly diagnosis time was lower than those of AML patients without CEBPA mutation [(98.30 +/- 20.33) g/L vs (81.69 +/- 23.74) g/L (P < 0.05); and (33.30 +/- 38.27) x10(9)/L vs (64.79 +/- 61.60) x10(9)/L (P < 0.05)]. The leukemic cells highly expressed CD7 and CD34. The therapeutic efficacy of 1 cycle for AML patients with CEBPA mutation was satisfactory (72.2%), was higher than that of patients without CEBPA mutation(68.6%), but there was no statistical significance (P > 0.05). It is concluded that AML with CEBPA mutation is more observed in AML-M1 and AML-M2, and accompanies by high level of hemoglobin and lower platelet count, expression of CD7 and CD34. Early-term therapeutic efficacy is satisfactory. The frequency of CEBPA mutation may be higher in Chinese patients with AML compared with that reported in Western world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AML clinical data and bone marrow samples of patients were collected. The diagnosis and classification were based on WHO criteria. The genomic DNA was extracted and NPM1 mutation was detected by sequencing after PCR. The specimens of 389 AML patients were tested. The results showed that the NPM1 mutation was found in 14.1% samples (55/389). The incidence of FLT3-ITD mutation was 14.7% (57/389) . The incidence of IDH1 mutation was 6.4% (25/389) . NPM1 mutation was not detected in AML with AML1-ETO, PML-RARA or CBF-MYH11 fusion genes. The incidences of FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation were 29.1% and 12.7% respectively in AML with NPM1 mutation. The incidences of FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation were 12.3% and 5.4% respectively in AML without NPM1 mutation. The incidences of FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation were significantly higher in AML with NPM1 mutation than that in AML without NPM1 mutation. The incidence of NPM1 mutation in normal karyotype AML was 26.5% (35/132) which significantly higher than that in other AML. The AML with NPM1 mutation characterized by older age, high platelet number, higher incidence in AML-M5, lower CD34 positive cells, more possible co-existence with FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation and other clinical features. The complete remission rate after one cycle of induction chemotherapy was 69.8% in AML without NPM1 mutation. The complete remission rate after one cycle of induction chemotherapy was 72.2% in AML with NPM1 mutation, there was no significant difference between them (P = 0.07). It is concluded that AML with NPM1 mutation has distinct clinical features. NPM1 mutation can co-exists with FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation, but not with AML1-ETO, PML-RARA or CBF-MYH11 fusion genes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consecutive newly diagnosed Ph(+)ALL patients (n = 49) in Peking University Institute of Hematology from January 2010 to April 2012 were prospectively enrolled in this study. At diagnosis and different time points during treatment, CD123 expression on CD34(+)CD19(+) cells was examined by multiparameter flow cytometry(MFC). More than 10 CD34(+)CD19(+) cells with CD123 overexpression in bone marrow samples after complete remission were defined as FCM positive (FCM(+)). The BCR-ABL1[STBZ] transcript was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) concurrently. The results showed that mean fluorescence intensity of CD123 on CD34(+)CD19(+) cells in newly diagnosed Ph(+)ALL and relapsed Ph(+)ALL patients was significantly higher than that of normal B-cell progenitors [8.52(3.71-32.35) vs 8.93(4.79-29.74) vs 1.31(0.21-1.75), P < 0.05]. In addition, ratio of the CD34(+)CD19(+) cells with CD123 overexpression in newly diagnosed Ph(+)ALL and relapsed Ph(+)ALL patients were significantly higher than that of normal B-cell progenitors [84.63% (55.07%-99.96%) vs 84.50% (57.68%-99.80%) vs 0.99% (0.45%- 1.83%), P < 0.05]. CD34(+)CD19(+) cells with CD123 overexpression were detected in all newly diagnosed and relapsed Ph(+)ALL patients. A good correlation was found between the MRD results of CD34(+)CD19(+) cells with CD123 overexpression detected by MFC and that detected by RQ-PCR (n = 360 pairs, Spearman r = 0.90, P < 0.0001). Among 13 cases relapsed during follow up, 11 cases of them were detected by FCM(+) at a median time of 60 (30-73) days before the recurrence. It is concluded that as a complementary to RQ-PCR, detection of the CD34(+)CD19(+) cells with CD123 overexpression by MFC promises to be an efficient tool for MRD assessment and risk stratification in human Ph(+)ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This method leads to improvement of immune function and the ability of engraftment, and is effective for treatment of autoimmune chronic pancreatitis and sialoadenitis in aging, lupus nephritis in hosts with radioresistance, and supralethal irradiation, in which conventional HSCT alone is ineffective.

Although increased beta-catenin signaling in AML has been associated with oncogenic translocation products and activating mutations in the FLT3R, the mechanisms that activate beta-catenin in AML more broadly are still unclear. Here, we describe a novel link between IL-3 signaling and the regulation of beta-catenin in myeloid transformation and AML. In a murine model of HoxB8 and IL-3 cooperation, we show that beta-catenin protein levels are modulated by IL-3 and that Cre-induced deletion of beta-catenin abolishes IL-3-dependent growth and colony formation. In IL-3-dependent leukemic TF-1.8 cells, we observed increased beta-catenin protein levels and nuclear localization in response to IL-3, and this correlated with transcriptional induction of beta-catenin target genes. Furthermore, IL-3 promoted beta-catenin accumulation in a subset of AML patient samples, and gene-expression profiling of these cells revealed induction of WNT/beta-catenin and TCF4 gene signatures in an IL-3-dependent manner. This study is the first to link beta-catenin activation to IL-3 and suggests that targeting IL-3 signaling may be an effective approach for the inhibition of beta-catenin activity in some patients with AML.",['(c) 2014 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],20140305,['NOTNLM'],"['Hox', 'gene-expression profiling', 'leukemic stem cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize all of these studies in order to clarify the correlation between the RFC1 G80A polymorphism and MTX toxicity in pediatric ALL.

Compared with the use of DEX or low-dose anisomycin alone, co-treatment with them resulted in a significant increase of growth inhibition, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in CEM-C1 cells through induction of activated caspase-3 and up-regulation of Bim, p21and p27, and down-regulation of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, c-myc, cyclin A and cyclin D1.

NOTCH1 mutations correlated with a shorter treatment-free interval (p = 0.058), an unmutated immunoglobulin heavy variable gene (IGHV) status (p < 0.0001), CD38 and ZAP-70 expression (p = 0.0025 and 0.026, respectively) and trisomy 12 (p = 0.0028), SF3B1 mutations with an unmutated IGHV status (p = 0.02), and BIRC3 disruptions with an unmutated IGHV configuration (p = 0.01) and 11q deletion (p < 0.0001). NOTCH1 and SF3B1 did not appear to impact on overall response, while an inferior response was observed for BIRC3- and TP53-disrupted cases in the LLC0405 and ML21445 protocols, respectively. Progression-free survival, evaluable in the LLC0405 protocol - not affected by NOTCH1, SF3B1 and TP53 - appeared inferior for BIRC3 disruption. NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations may be overcome by aggressive regimens, while BIRC3 might impact on outcome also in intensive regimens.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'first-line treatment', 'novel gene mutations']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Limited data in dogs and no studies in cats have been published to investigate this claim. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To characterize the feline population affected by DLS and to determine if the presence and severity of DLS are associated with increased risk of euthanasia or death. ANIMALS: One hundred and eight cats with DLS (cases) and 322 cats without DLS (controls) presented to the University of California, Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital between April 1, 1995 and April 1, 2010. METHODS: Retrospective case-control study. All cases had a CBC performed within 24 hours of presentation in which immature granulocytic precursors exceeded mature neutrophils. Controls were matched by year of presentation and primary diagnosis. Survival analysis was used to determine risk of death or euthanasia from DLS and other potential predictors of outcome. RESULTS: Cases were more likely to die or be euthanized in hospital compared to controls (60/108 [56%] versus 107/322 [33%]). DLS was a significant predictor of death or euthanasia in hospitalized cats in both univariate and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-2.18). Trend analysis showed an increasing trend in the hazard of euthanasia or death with increasing severity of DLS. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Cats with DLS are 1.57 times more likely to die or be euthanized in hospital than cats without DLS.

However, all retroviruses must bypass this checkpoint for replication. Indeed, their primary polycistronic transcript (Full-Length) must reach the cytoplasm to be either translated or packaged as genomic RNA in progeny viruses.Murine leukemia virus (MLV) is a prototype of simple retroviruses with only two well-regulated splicing events that directly influence viral leukemogenic properties in mice. Several cis-elements have been identified in the FL RNA that regulate its cytoplasmic accumulation. However, their connection with an export mechanism is yet unknown. Our goal was to identify the cellular pathway used by MLV to export its RNAs into the cytoplasm of the host cells. RESULTS: Since other retroviruses use the CRM1 and/or the Tap/NXF1 pathways to export their unspliced RNA from the nucleus, we investigated the role of these two pathways in MLV replication by using specific inhibitors. The effects of export inhibition on MLV protein synthesis, RNA levels and RNA localization were studied by Western blotting, RT-qPCR, fluorescence microscopy and ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assays. Taken together, our results show for the first time that MLV requires the Tap/NXF1-mediated export pathway, and not the CRM1 pathway, for the expression of its spliced and unspliced RNAs and for FL RNA nuclear export. CONCLUSIONS: By contrast to HIV-1, MLV recruits the same pathway for the cytoplasmic expression of its spliced and unspliced RNAs. Thus, MLV RNA expression depends upon coordinated splicing/export processes. In addition, FL RNA translation relies on Tap/NXF1-dependent export, raising the critical question of whether the pool of FL RNA to be packaged is also exported by Tap/NXF1.",,20140305,,,PMC4015919,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All neoplastic tissues were positive for the REV envelope (env) gene by PCR. In a retrospective molecular study of FPV-infected 77-day-old chickens from the same flock, we identified nearly full-length REV provirus integrated into the genome of FPV as well as the REV env gene in trachea samples, whereas only the REV LTR region was present in the FPV strain used to vaccinate this flock. The 622-bp REV env gene nucleotide sequence derived from the trachea and neoplastic tissues was identical. Commercial ELISA of serum samples revealed that all chickens aged between 17 and 263 days in this flock were positive for REV but not for avian leukosis virus. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the visceral lymphomas were caused by a REV-integrated FPV field strain.

The KIT D816H mutation was detected in the blood and bone marrow (BM). Induction chemotherapy with high-dose ARA-C and fludarabine (FLAG) was administered. Unexpectedly, the patient entered a hematologic remission with almost complete disappearance of neoplastic MC and a decrease of serum tryptase levels to normal range after 2 cycles of FLAG. Consecutively, the patient was prepared for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, shortly after the third cycle of FLAG, tryptase levels increased again, immature MC appeared in the blood, and the patient died from cerebral bleeding. Together, this case shows that intensive chemotherapy regimens, like FLAG, may induce remission in acute MCL.

However, realization of this potential requires a significant therapeutic window for MYB inhibition, given its essential role in normal hematopoiesis, and an approach for developing an effective therapeutic. We previously showed that the interaction of c-Myb with the coactivator CBP/p300 is essential for its transforming activity. Here, by using cells from Booreana mice which carry a mutant allele of c-Myb, we show that this interaction is essential for in vitro transformation by the myeloid leukemia oncogenes AML1-ETO, AML1-ETO9a, MLL-ENL, and MLL-AF9. We further show that unlike cells from wild-type mice, Booreana cells transduced with AML1-ETO9a or MLL-AF9 retroviruses fail to generate leukemia upon transplantation into irradiated recipients. Finally, we have begun to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations by gene expression profiling.

One such approach involves the transfer of T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) for a specific cell-surface antigen. This strategy depends upon preferential expression of the target on tumor cells. To date, the lack of AML-specific surface markers has impeded development of such CAR-based approaches. CD123, the transmembrane alpha chain of the interleukin-3 receptor, is expressed in the majority of AML cells but is also expressed in many normal hematopoietic cells. Here, we show that CD123 is a good target for AML-directed CAR therapy, because its expression increases over time in vivo even in initially CD123(dim) populations, and that human CD123-redirected T cells (CART123) eradicate primary AML in immunodeficient mice. CART123 also eradicated normal human myelopoiesis, a surprising finding because anti-CD123 antibody-based strategies have been reportedly well tolerated. Because AML is likely preceded by clonal evolution in ""preleukemic"" hematopoietic stem cells, our observations support CART123 as a viable AML therapy, suggest that CART123-based myeloablation may be used as a novel conditioning regimen for hematopoietic cell transplantation, and raise concerns for the use of CART123 without such a rescue strategy.",,20140304,,,PMC3983612,"['K12CA076931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA184418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA076931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI045008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD044331/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA128583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Blood. 2016 Nov 24;128(21):2585.

Long-term survival is achieved in approximately 80% of patients. One of the more common complications of ALL treatment is immunosuppression. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to assess the reconstruction rate of the most important immune system parameters in children after ALL treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 47 children (22 boys, 25 girls) diagnosed and treated for ALL in Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology at Wroclaw Medical University. The study used peripheral blood collected at the time treatment was completed and in the first, second, third and sixth months following treatment, then at yearly intervals up to 10 years after treatment. In order to determine the immune status of the tested samples the following parameters were assessed: white blood cell count, absolute lymphocyte count, the proportions of individual subpopulations of lymphocytes - T (CD3 +), Th (CD4 +), Ts (CD8 +), B (CD19 +), NK (CD16 + 56 +), the concentration of immunoglobulins A, G and M, interleukin 10 activity, as well as the expression of ICAM-1 adhesion molecules. RESULTS: At the end of anti-neoplastic therapy a reduction in both the absolute number leukocytes and various subpopulations of lymphocytes was observed. The lower limits of normal range were achieved about two years after the end of treatment. The concentrations of immunoglobulin IgA, IgG and IgM at the end of treatment were within low normal limits. Normal concentrations of immunoglobulin levels and stability were observed about two years after the end of treatment. There was a slow, steady increase in the production of interleukin-10 and the expression of ICAM-1 adhesion molecules. These results confirm previous observations that after ALL treatment children are in an immunocompromised state for up to 12 months, in terms of both humoral and cellular immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Knowing the average growth trends for the main immune system parameters after ALL treatment can be important in clinical practice for children in whom immune reconstruction proceeds slowly. Predicting the expected time required to restore immune function could be of help, for example in combating infections and planning vaccinations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) causes not only malignant transformation and tumor progression, but also allows tumor cells to evade immune surveillance, NF-kappaB signaling components might constitute a potential target for future therapy in CLL. OBJECTIVES: The current study is an attempt to characterize proteins regulated by thalidomide. Thalidomide's influence on NF-kappaB proteins and on regulatory T cells (Treg) in CLL was investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 15 patients with CLL were treated with a combined thalidomide/fludarabine regimen. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. To evaluate glucocorticoid induced tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-related protein (GITR) expression in regulatory T cells, cells incubated with anti-CD3, ani-CD4 and anti-CD25 were permeabilized and then stained with anti-FOXP3 and analyzed using flow cytometry. Human TNF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels in the serum. To evaluate NF-kappaB activity, chemiluminescent oligonucleotide-based ELISA was performed. RESULTS: It was found that thalidomide regulates NF-kappaB activity differentially, and the activity of certain NF-kappaB components correlated with TNF levels and T regulatory cell (CD4 + CD25 high GITR + ). CONCLUSIONS: These results might indicate that thalidomide not only regulates TNF but also directly interferes with NF-kappaB components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed mutations in 19 genes reported in CMML to determine if and how these mutations impacted the respective prognosis of the two classes. We defined four major mutated pathways (DNA methylation, ASXL1, splicing, and signaling) and determined their prognostic impact. The number of mutated pathways impacted overall survival in the myelodysplastic class but not in the myeloproliferative class. The myeloproliferative class had a worse prognosis than the myelodysplastic class and was impacted by RUNX1 mutations only.

Epub 2014 Mar 5.,,"PURPOSE: The aim of this chart review of adult patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with total body irradiation (TBI) was to evaluate early and late toxicity and long-term outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 110 adult patients (34 +/- 12 years) with ALL underwent TBI (6 fractions of 2 Gy for a total of 12 Gy) as a part of the treatment regimen before transplantation. Treatment-related toxicity, mortality, and hematologic outcome are reported. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 70 months. The 2- and 5-year leukemia-free survival rates were 78 and 72%, respectively. In all, 29% (32/110) patients suffered from medullary recurrence after a median time of 7 months. Gender was the only statistically significant prognostic factor in terms of overall survival in favor of female patients. Treatment-related mortality and overall survival after 2 and 5 years were 16 and 22%, and 60 and 52.7%, respectively. The most frequent late reaction wascGVHD of the skin (n = 33, 30%). In addition, 15.5% (17/110 patients) suffered pulmonary symptoms, and 6 patients developed lung fibrosis. Eyes were frequently affected by the radiation (31/110 = 28%); 12 of 110 patients (11%) presented with symptoms from osteoporosis, 5 of 110 patients (4.5%) developed hypothyreosis and 2 patients diabetes mellitus. Of the male patients, 11% reported erectile dysfunction or loss of libido, while 2 of 36 women reported menopausal syndrome at the mean time of 28 months after treatment with requirement for substitution. No women became pregnant after treatment. No acute or late cardiac toxicities were documented in our patients. No secondary malignancies were documented. CONCLUSION: Although hematologic outcome was in the upper range of that reported in the literature, treatment-related mortality (TRM) and medullary recurrences remain a challenge. Sophisticated radiation techniques allow for decreasing toxicity to certain organs and/or dose escalation to the bone marrow in highly selected patients in order to improve therapeutic breadth.",,20140305,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ocaratuzumab is a novel Fc-engineered humanized IgG1 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed for effective antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) at very low concentrations that may facilitate sub-cutaneous (vs. intravenous) dosing. Here, we report ocaratuzumab's potency against CLL cells. In vitro assessment of ocaratuzumab's direct cytotoxicity (DC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and ADCC was performed on CLL cells. Ocaratuzumab induced DC, CDC, and ADCP similarly to rituximab or ofatumumab (anti-CD20 mAbs). However, ocaratuzumab showed an advantage in NK cell-mediated ADCC over these antibodies. In allogeneic ADCC, [E:T (effector:target) ratios = 25:1, 12:1, 6:1], ocaratuzumab (10 microg/mL) improved ADCC by ~3-fold compared with rituximab or ofatumumab (P<0.001 all tested E:T ratios). Notably, the superiority of ocaratuzumab-induced ADCC was observed at low concentrations (0.1-10 ug/ml; P<0.03; allogeneic assays). In extended allogeneic ADCC E:T titration, ocaratuzumab (0.1 microg/mL) demonstrated 19.4% more cytotoxicity than rituximab (E:T = 0.38:1; P = 0.0066) and 21.5% more cytotoxicity than ofatumumab (E:T = 1.5:1; P = 0.0015). In autologous ADCC, ocaratuzumab (10 microg/mL) demonstrated ~1.5-fold increase in cytotoxicity compared with rituximab or ofatumumab at all E:T ratios tested (E:Ts = 25:1,12:1,6:1; all P<0.001). Obinutuzumab, a glyco-engineered anti-CD20 mAb, showed no improvement in ADCC activity compared with ocaratuzumab. The enhanced ADCC of ocaratuzumab suggests that it may be effective at low concentrations.

Consequently, there is a critical need for strategies capable of targeting Mcl-1-dependent drug resistance in MM. The present results indicate that a regimen combining Chk1 with MEK1/2 inhibitors effectively kills cells displaying multiple forms of drug resistance stemming from Mcl-1 up-regulation in association with direct transcriptional Mcl-1 down-regulation and indirect disabling of Mcl-1 anti-apoptotic function through Bim up-regulation and increased Bim/Mcl-1 binding. These actions release Bak from Mcl-1, accompanied by Bak/Bax activation. Analogous events were observed in both drug-naive and acquired bortezomib-resistant MM cells displaying increased Mcl-1 but diminished Bim expression, or cells ectopically expressing Mcl-1. Moreover, concomitant Chk1 and MEK1/2 inhibition blocked Mcl-1 up-regulation induced by IL-6/IGF-1 or co-culture with stromal cells, effectively overcoming microenvironment-related drug resistance.

Paradoxically, however, some patients administered vitamin K1 injection for the first time have adverse reactions. Using beagle dogs, the present study tested the hypothesis that the response to vitamin K1 is an anaphylactoid reaction. The results showed that serious anaphylaxis-like symptoms appeared in beagle dogs after the administration of vitamin K1 injection for the first time. The plasma histamine concentration increased, and blood pressure decreased sharply. After sensitization, dogs were challenged with vitamin K1 injection and displayed the same degree of symptoms as prior to sensitization. However, when the vitamin K1 injection-sensitized dogs were challenged with a vitamin K1-fat emulsion without solubilizers such asTween-80, the abnormal reactions did not occur. Furthermore, there was no significant change in the plasma immunoglobulin E concentration after vitamin K1 challenge. Following treatment with vitamin K1 injection, the release of histamine and beta-hexosaminidase by rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells as well as the rate of apoptosis increased. The Tween-80 group displayed results similar to those observed following vitamin K1 injection in vivo. However, the dogs in the vitamin K1-fat emulsion group did not display any abnormal behavior or significant change in plasma histamine. Additionally, degranulation and apoptosis did not occur in rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells. Our results indicate that the adverse reaction induced by vitamin K1 injection is an anaphylactoid reaction, not anaphylaxis. Vitamin K1 injection induces the release of inflammatory factors via a non-IgE-mediated immune pathway, for which the trigger may be the solubilizer.",,20140304,,,PMC3942416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficient production of hGCSF using E. coli is challenging because the hormone tends to aggregate and forms inclusion bodies. This study examined the ability of seven different N-terminal fusion tags to increase expression of soluble hGCSF in E. coli. Four tag proteins, namely maltose-binding protein (MBP), N-utilization substance protein A, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and the b'a' domain of PDI (PDIb'a'), increased the solubility of hGCSF under normal conditions. Lowering the expression temperature from 30 degrees C to 18 degrees C also increased the solubility of thioredoxin-tagged and glutathione S-transferase-tagged hGCSF. By contrast, hexahistidine-tagged hGCSF was insoluble at both temperatures. Simple conventional chromatographic methods were used to purify hGCSF from the overexpressed PDIb'a'-hGCSF and MBP-hGCSF proteins. In total, 11.3 mg or 10.2 mg of pure hGCSF were obtained from 500 mL cultures of E. coli expressing PDIb'a'-hGCSF or MBP-hGCSF, respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis and silver staining confirmed high purity of the isolated hGCSF proteins, and the endotoxin levels were less than 0.05 EU/microg of protein. Subsequently, the bioactivity of the purified hGCSF proteins similar to that of the commercially available hGCSF was confirmed using the mouse M-NFS-60 myelogenous leukemia cell line. The EC50s of the cell proliferation dose-response curves for hGCSF proteins purified from MBP-hGCSF and PDIb'a'-hGCSF were 2.83+/-0.31 pM, and 3.38+/-0.41 pM, respectively. In summary, this study describes an efficient method for the soluble overexpression and purification of bioactive hGCSF in E. coli.",,20140303,,,PMC3940694,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, we tested the use of anti-CD137-saporin immunotoxin to selectively deplete mouse and human alloreactive T-cells. Anti-CD137 antibodies were internalized by cells within 4 h of binding to the cell surface CD137, and anti-CD137-saporin immunotoxin effectively killed polyclonally activated T-cells or antigen-stimulated T-cells. Transfer of donor T-cells after allodepletion with anti-CD137-saporin immunotoxin failed to induce any evident expression of GVHD; however, a significant GVL effect was observed. Targeting of CD137 with an immunotoxin was also effective in killing polyclonally activated or alloreactive human T-cells.

These recommendations are based on clinical trial outcomes computed from treatment start. Conditional survival estimates take into account the changing hazard rates as time from treatment elapses as a continuum. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed conditional survival analyses among patients with CML to improve prognostication at any time point during the course of therapy. We used 2 cohorts of patients with CML in chronic phase: 1 treated in the frontline DASISION (Dasatinib versus Imatinib Study in Treatment - Naive CML) phase III study (n = 519) and another treated after imatinib treatment had failed in the dasatinib dose-optimization phase III CA180-034 study (n = 670). Conditional survival estimates were calculated. A modified Cox proportional hazards model was used to build a prognostic nomogram. RESULTS: As the time alive or free from events from commencement of treatment increased, conditional survival estimates changed. No differences were observed regarding future outcomes between patients treated with imatinib or dasatinib in the frontline setting for patients with the same breakpoint cluster region-abelson 1 (BCR-ABL1) transcript levels evaluated at the same time point. Age older than 60 years greatly affected future outcomes particularly in the short-term. Conditional survival-based nomograms allowed the prediction of future outcomes at any time point. CONCLUSION: In summary, we designed a calculator to predict future outcomes of patients with CML at any time point during the course of therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, all patients signed written informed consent as a requisite to undergo PET/CT examination. However, due to its observational nature, approval from the ethical committee was not deemed necessary. Twenty-two previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients underwent PET/CT for disease progression. PET/CT images were analyzed by using dedicated software, capable of recognizing an external 2-pixel bone ring whose Hounsfield coefficient served as cutoff to recognize trabecular and compact bone. PET/CT data from 22 age- and sex-matched control subjects were used as comparison. All data are reported as means +/- standard deviations. The Student t test, log-rank, or Cox proportional hazards model were used as appropriate, considering a difference with a P value of less than .05 as significant. RESULTS: Trabecular bone was expanded in ACLL patients and occupied a larger fraction of the skeleton with respect to control subjects (mean, 39% +/- 5 [standard deviation] vs 31% +/- 7; ie, 32 of 81 mL/kg of ideal body weight vs 27 of 86 mL/kg of ideal body weight, respectively; P < .001). After stratification according to median value, patients with a ratio of trabecular to skeletal bone volume of more than 37.3% showed an actuarial 2-year survival of 18%, compared with 82% for those with a ratio of less than 37.3% (P < .001), independent from age, sex, biological markers, and disease duration. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that computational assessment of skeletal alterations might represent a new window for prediction of the clinical course of the disease.",,20140305,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in the majority of patients given all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)/anthracycline-based induction therapy, PML-RARalpha transcript remains even when haematologic complete remission is achieved. To facilitate maximal therapeutic efficacy for patients with APL, this study tested whether the addition of arsenic trioxide (ATO) would increase the rate of molecular complete remission after ATRA/anthracycline-based induction therapy. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with APL were induced with a regimen (designated 'AAA') consisting of ATO in combination with ATRA and daunorubicin. After this, a consolidation phase of daunorubicin-based chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with ATRA, ATO and methotrexate was administered. The noted outcomes were rates of complete remission, overall survival and disease-free survival. In addition, PML-RARalpha transcripts were monitored in 48 patients via RT-PCR. RESULTS: Rates of complete remission, overall survival and 5-yr disease-free survival were 95.89%, 94.52% and 96.28%, respectively. At the preconsolidation checkpoint, 68.75% (33/48) of patients had a negative reading for the PML-RARalpha fusion transcript. These outcomes were not influenced by mutations in FLT3 (fms-related tyrosine kinase 3) or other prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ATO in the induction regimen was associated with an improved overall outcome for patients with de novo APL, with rather low relapse rate and better long-term survival.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Surfactant proteins are secreted by alveolar type II cells in the lung epithelium, the differentiation of which is regulated by Fgf10 elaborated by the adjacent mesenchyme. However, the molecular regulation of mesenchymal Fgf10 during lung development has not been fully understood. Here, we show that Pbx1, a homeodomain transcription factor, is required in the lung mesenchyme for the expression of Fgf10. Mouse embryos lacking Pbx1 in the lung mesenchyme show compact terminal saccules and perinatal lethality with failure of postnatal alveolar expansion. Mutant embryos had severely reduced expression of Fgf10 and surfactant genes (Spa, Spb, Spc, and Spd) that are essential for alveolar expansion for gas exchange at birth. Molecularly, Pbx1 directly binds to the Fgf10 promoter and cooperates with Meis and Hox proteins to transcriptionally activate Fgf10. Our results thus show how Pbx1 controls Fgf10 in the developing lung.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",20140314,['NOTNLM'],"['Fgf10', 'Pbx1', 'lung development', 'mesenchyme']",,"['R01HL085345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL118087/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL121197/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), internal tandem duplication (ITD) of FLT3 at the juxtamembrane (JMD) and tyrosine kinase (TKD) domains (FLT3-ITD(+)) occurs in 30% of patients and is associated with inferior clinical prognosis. TKD mutations (FLT3-TKD(+)) occur in 5% of cases. We made use of zebrafish to examine the role of flt3 in developmental hematopoiesis and model human FLT3-ITD(+) and FLT3-TKD(+) AML. Zebrafish flt3 JMD and TKD were remarkably similar to their mammalian orthologs. Morpholino knockdown significantly reduced the expression of l-plastin (pan-leukocyte), csf1r, and mpeg1 (macrophage) as well as that of c-myb (definitive HSPCs), lck, and rag1 (T-lymphocyte). Expressing human FLT3-ITD in zebrafish embryos resulted in expansion and clustering of myeloid cells (pu.1(+), mpo(+), and cebpalpha(+)) which were ameliorated by AC220 and associated with stat5, erk1/2, and akt phosphorylation. Human FLT3-TKD (D835Y) induced significant, albeit modest, myeloid expansion resistant to AC220.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 22 CML cases of pregnancies and reported 9 accidental and 13 planned pregnancies that were on imatinib therapy. Willing female patients remaining in complete hematological, cytogenetic and major molecular responses for at least 2 years planned for pregnancy and were advised to stop imatinib for 1 month prior to conception and 3 months after conception (first trimester). Willing male patients stopped therapy 1 month prior to conception of their wives. In unplanned cases, all patients were in exposure to imatinib during conception. Twenty-two pregnancies resulted in seven male children and eight female children. There were three spontaneous abortions and four elective abortions along with one case of hypospadia and another one of mild hydrocephalus. CONCLUSION: We may suggest that planned pregnancy during therapy may be encouraged but imatinib therapy in unplanned pregnancy can cause spontaneous abortion or congenital anomaly.",,20140304,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This unusual combination is correlated to the clinical manifestations with high risk of both bleeding and thrombosis. Recent studies have revealed that the leukemic promyelocytes in APL express increased amounts of tissue factor as well as elements of the fibrinolytic system, including tissue plasminogen activator, annexin A2, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. These changes are responsive to differentiation therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) or with arsenic trioxide (ATO). Despite a dramatic reduction in mortality seen since the introduction of differentiation therapy with ATRA or with ATO, a large number of deaths still occur before complete remission is achieved. The early deaths are mostly attributable to the presenting coagulopathy.

We previously reported that SPARC was among the most upregulated genes in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) patients with gene-expression profiles predictive of unfavorable outcome, such as mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2-R172) and overexpression of the oncogenes brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic (BAALC) and v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG). In contrast, SPARC was downregulated in CN-AML patients harboring mutations in nucleophosmin (NPM1) that are associated with favorable prognosis. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that SPARC expression is clinically relevant in AML. Here, we found that SPARC overexpression is associated with adverse outcome in CN-AML patients and promotes aggressive leukemia growth in murine models of AML. In leukemia cells, SPARC expression was mediated by the SP1/NF-kappaB transactivation complex. Furthermore, secreted SPARC activated the integrin-linked kinase/AKT (ILK/AKT) pathway, likely via integrin interaction, and subsequent beta-catenin signaling, which is involved in leukemia cell self-renewal. Pharmacologic inhibition of the SP1/NF-kappaB complex resulted in SPARC downregulation and leukemia growth inhibition.

However, its function in cancer has never been studied. Melanoma is a tumor composed of transformed cells within the melanocyte lineage deriving from the embryonic neural crest. It has been shown that developmental pathways in neural crest cells have a direct bearing on melanoma formation and human metastatic melanoma cells express a dedifferentiated phenotype. We found that the expression levels of AATK are lower in metastatic melanoma cell lines compared with primary melanoma cell lines and normal human melanocytes. We found that depletion of AATK mRNA in metastatic melanoma cell lines enhanced cell migration in cell line derived from metastatic melanomas. Overexpression of AATK inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and promoted apoptosis in melanoma cell lines derived from primary and metastatic melanomas. Signal transduction pathway analysis revealed that Src is involved in regulating AATK.

SUMMARY: Ruxolitinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the Janus-associated kinases (JAKs) 1 and 2, has been recently approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis. Unlike previous treatment options for patients with myelofibrosis, ruxolitinib offers a targeted therapy option for these patients who often suffer with severe and debilitating symptoms associated with the disease process. After oral administration, ruxolitinib is rapidly absorbed and can be given without regard to meals. Ruxolitinib is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme system; therefore, if concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is unavoidable, an initial dosage reduction is warranted. Two Phase III randomized trials comparing ruxolitinib to either placebo or best available therapy found a rapid and sustained response in the reduction of spleen size and improvements in constitutional symptoms and quality of life, with one study demonstrating an improvement in overall survival. The most commonly reported serious adverse effects of ruxolitinib are anemia and thrombocytopenia. Ruxolitinib is administered as an oral tablet given twice daily, with the initial starting dosage based on the baseline platelet count. Dosage reductions are based on the development of thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: By directly targeting both JAK1 and JAK2 through small-molecule inhibition, ruxolitinib elicits a reduction in splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms in patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile and a low treatment-discontinuation rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the cytoplasm, MKL1 binds to G-actin through RPXXXEL (RPEL) motifs. However, dissociation of MKL1 from G-actin triggers its translocation into the nucleus where it stimulates SRF-mediated gene expression. Previous characterization of rat MKL1 gene products has identified several isoforms: full-length MKL1, basic, SAP, and coiled-coil domain (BSAC), MKL1-elongated derivative of yield (MELODY), and MKL1met. In this study, we have investigated whether these MKL1 isoforms, which contain different numbers of RPEL motifs, differ in their subcellular localization, transcriptional activity, and effect on dendritic number and axonal length. Immunofluorescent staining of cultured cortical neurons expressing individual FLAG-tagged MKL1 isoforms indicated that all MKL1 isoforms are present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. However, MKL1met, which contains two RPEL motifs, shows enhanced nuclear staining compared with the other three isoforms, full-length MKL1, basic, SAP, and coiled-coil domain, and MKL1-elongated derivative of yield, which contain three RPEL motifs. Consistent with its preferential nuclear localization, overexpression of MKL1met, but not other isoforms, increases SRF-mediated transcriptional responses and reduces the number of dendrites. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of MKL1met on dendritic number, axonal length is not affected by overexpression of any of the MKL1 isoforms. These findings suggest that the subcellular localization of MKL1 isoforms, which is mediated by the number of actin-binding RPEL motifs, regulates their effect on SRF-mediated gene expression and dendritic morphology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The discovery of the first recurrent FGFR fusion in glioblastoma was followed by discoveries of FGFR fusions in bladder, lung, breast, thyroid, oral, and prostate cancers. Drug targeting of FGFR fusions has shown promising results and should soon be translating into clinical trials. FGFR fusions form as a result of various mechanisms - predominantly deletion for FGFR1, translocation for FGFR2, and tandem duplication for FGFR3. The ability to exploit the unique targetability of FGFR fusions proves that FGFR-derived therapies could have a promising future in cancer therapeutics. Drug targeting of fusion genes has proven to be an extremely effective therapeutic approach for cancers such as the recurrent BCR-ABL1 fusion in chronic myeloid leukaemia. The recent discovery of recurrent FGFR family fusions in several cancer types has brought to attention the unique therapeutic potential for FGFR-positive patients.

SAMHD1 is conserved in mammals but its role in restricting virus replication and controlling interferon production in non-primate species is not well understood. We show that SAMHD1 is catalytically active and expressed at high levels in mouse spleen, lymph nodes, thymus and lung. siRNA knock-down of SAMHD1 in bone marrow-derived macrophages increased their susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. shRNA knock-down of SAMHD1 in the murine monocytic cell-line RAW264.7 increased its susceptibility to HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus and increased the levels of the dNTP pool.

Interference with BRCA1 expression and/or functions leads to high risk of breast or/and ovarian cancer. Another multifunctional protein, HTLV-1Tax oncoprotein, is widely regarded as crucial for developing adult T-cell leukemia and other clinical disorders. Tax profile reveals that it can antagonize BRCA1 expression and/or functionality. Therefore, we hypothesize that Tax expression in breast cells can sensitize them to malignant transformation by environmental carcinogens. Here we examined Tax effect on BRCA1 expression by testing its influence on E2-induced expression of BRCA1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter (BRCA1-Luc). We found that E2 strongly stimulated this reporter expression by liganding to ERalpha, which consequently associated with BRCA1 promoter, while ERalpha concomitantly recruited CBP/p300 to this complex for co-operative enhancement of BRCA1 expression. Introducing Tax into these cells strongly blocked this E2-ERalpha-mediated activation of BRCA1 expression. We noted, also, that Tax exerted this inhibition by binding to CBP/p300 without releasing them from their complex with ERalpha. Chip assay revealed that the binding of Tax to the CBP/p300-ERalpha complex, prevented its link to AP1 site. Interestingly, we noted that elevating the intracellular pool of CBP or p300 to excessive levels dramatically reduced the Tax-mediated inhibition of BRCA1 expression. Exploring the mechanism of this reduction revealed that the excessive co-factors were sufficient to bind separately the free Tax molecules, thus lowering their amount in the CBP/p300-ERalpha complex and relieving, thereby, the inhibition of BRCA1 expression.",,20140221,,,PMC3931753,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ponatinib, also known as AP24534, is an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), and it has been investigated in a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial. The histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) has been evaluated for its significant clinical activity in hematological malignancies. Thus, treatments combining ABL TKIs with additional drugs may be a promising strategy in the treatment of leukemia. In the current study, we analyzed the efficacy of ponatinib and vorinostat treatment by using BCR-ABL-positive cell lines. Treatment with ponatinib for 72 h inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. We found that ponatinib potently inhibited the growth of Ba/F3 cells ectopically expressing BCR-ABL T315I mutation. Upon BCR-ABL phosphorylation, Crk-L was decreased, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was activated in a dose-dependent manner. Combined treatment of Ba/F3 T315I mutant cells with vorinostat and ponatinib resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity. Additionally, the intracellular signaling of ponatinib and vorinostat was examined. Caspase 3 and PARP activation increased after combination treatment with ponatinib and vorinostat. Moreover, an increase in the phosphorylation levels of gammaH2A.X was observed. Previously established ponatinib-resistant Ba/F3 cells were also resistant to imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. We investigated the difference in the efficacy of ponatinib and vorinostat by using ponatinib-resistant Ba/F3 cells. Combined treatment of ponatinib-resistant cells with ponatinib and vorinostat caused a significant increase in cytotoxicity.

The CYP2B6 enzyme detoxifies many genotoxic xenobiotics, protecting cells from oxidative damage. The CYP2B6 gene is subjected to a single-nucleotide polymorphism (G(5)(1)(6)T) with heterozygotes (GT) and homozygotes (TT) presenting decreased enzymatic activity. This case-control study aimed to investigate the association of CYP2B6 G(5)(1)(6)T polymorphism with the susceptibility of AML and its cytogenetic and clinical characteristics. Genotyping was performed on 619 AML patients and 430 healthy individuals using RCR-RFLP and a novel LightSNip assay. The major finding was a statistically higher frequency of the variant genotypes (GT and TT) in patients compared to the controls (GT:38.8% vs 29.8% and TT:9.3% vs 5.3% respectively) (p<0.001). More specifically, a significantly higher frequency of GT+TT genotypes in de novo AML patients (46.6%) and an immensely high frequency of TT in secondary AML (s-AML) (20.5%) were observed. The statistical analysis showed that the variant T allele was approximately 1.5-fold and 2.4-fold higher in de novo and s-AML respectively than controls. Concerning FAB subtypes, the T allele presented an almost 2-fold increased in AML-M2. Interestingly, a higher incidence of the TT genotype was observed in patients with abnormal karyotypes. In particular, positive correlations of the mutant allele were found in patients carrying specific chromosomal aberrations [-7/del(7q), -5/del(5q), +8, +21 or t(8;21)], complex or monosomal karyotypes. Finally, a strikingly higher frequency of TT genotype was also observed in patients stratified to the poor risk group. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for the involvement of the CYP2B6 polymorphism in AML susceptibility and suggest a possible role of the CYP2B6 genetic background on the development of specific chromosomal aberrations.",,20140224,,,PMC3933334,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analogs of the allosteric mTOR inhibitor rapamycin are approved for mantle cell lymphoma but have limited efficacy in other blood cancers. ATP-competitive ""active-site"" mTOR inhibitors produce more complete mTOR inhibition and are more effective than rapamycin in preclinical models of leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In parallel to clinical trials of active-site mTOR inhibitors, it will be important to identify resistance mechanisms that might limit drug efficacy in certain patients. From a panel of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines, we found that the VAL cell line is particularly resistant to apoptosis in the presence of active-site mTOR inhibitors. Mechanistic investigation showed that VAL does not express eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4EBP1), a key negative regulator of translation controlled by mTOR. Although VAL cells express the related protein 4EBP2, mTOR inhibitor treatment fails to displace eukaryotic initiation factor 4G from the mRNA cap-binding complex. Knockdown of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, or re-expression of 4EBP1, sensitizes cells to apoptosis when treated with active-site mTOR inhibitors.

The aim of this study is to derive a more precise estimation of the association between MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) polymorphisms and acute myeloid leukemia risk. PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies from their inception to August 2013. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were the metric of choice. Thirteen studies were selected for C677T polymorphism (1838 cases and 5318 controls) and 9 studies (1335 patients and 4295 controls) for A1298C polymorphism. Overall, pooled results showed that C677T polymorphism was not significant associated with AML risk(OR, 0.98-1.04; 95% CI, 0.86-0.92 to 1.09-1.25). Similar results were observed for the A1298C polymorphism and in subgroup analysis. All comparisons revealed no substantial heterogeneity nor did we detect evidence of publication bias. In summary, this meta-analysis provides evidence that MTHFR polymorphisms were not associated with AML risk.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook testing Tempol--a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic and pleiotropic intracellular antioxidant--in cells relevant to malaria pathogenesis in the context of coagulation and inflammation. Tempol was also tested in a murine model of CM induced by Plasmodium berghei Anka infection. Tempol was found to prevent transcription and functional expression of procoagulant tissue factor in endothelial cells (ECs) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This effect was accompanied by inhibition of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) production. Tempol also attenuated platelet aggregation and human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells oxidative burst. In dendritic cells, Tempol inhibited LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-12p70, downregulated expression of co-stimulatory molecules, and prevented antigen-dependent lymphocyte proliferation. Notably, Tempol (20 mg/kg) partially increased the survival of mice with CM. Mechanistically, treated mice had lowered plasma levels of MCP-1, suggesting that Tempol downmodulates EC function and vascular inflammation. Tempol also diminished blood brain barrier permeability associated with CM when started at day 4 post infection but not at day 1, suggesting that ROS production is tightly regulated. Other antioxidants-such as alpha-phenyl N-tertiary-butyl nitrone (PBN; a spin trap), MnTe-2-PyP and MnTBAP (Mn-phorphyrin), Mitoquinone (MitoQ) and Mitotempo (mitochondrial antioxidants), M30 (an iron chelator), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG; polyphenol from green tea) did not improve survival. By contrast, these compounds (except PBN) inhibited Plasmodium falciparum growth in culture with different IC50s. Knockout mice for SOD1 or phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (gp91(phox-/-)) or mice treated with inhibitors of SOD (diethyldithiocarbamate) or NADPH oxidase (diphenyleneiodonium) did not show protection or exacerbation for CM. CONCLUSION: Results with Tempol suggest that intracellular ROS contribute, in part, to CM pathogenesis. Therapeutic targeting of intracellular ROS in CM is discussed.",,20140228,,,PMC3938406,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transgenic mice expressing two potent collaborating oncogenes in the germ line (CD2-MYC, -Runx2) develop rapid onset tumours that can be accelerated and rendered polyclonal by neonatal Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MoMLV) infection. RIM/DS analysis of 28 polyclonal lymphomas identified 771 common insertion sites (CISs) defining a 'progression network' that encompassed a remarkably large fraction of known MoMLV target genes, with further strong indications of oncogenic selection above the background of MoMLV integration preference. Progression driven by RIM was characterised as a Darwinian process of clonal competition engaging proliferation control networks downstream of cytokine and T-cell receptor signalling. Enhancer mode activation accounted for the most efficiently selected CIS target genes, including Ccr7 as the most prominent of a set of chemokine receptors driving paracrine growth stimulation and lymphoma dissemination. Another large target gene subset including candidate tumour suppressors was disrupted by intragenic insertions. A second RIM/DS screen comparing lymphomas of wild-type and parental transgenics showed that CD2-MYC tumours are virtually dependent on activation of Runx family genes in strong preference to other potent Myc collaborating genes (Gfi1, Notch1). Ikzf1 was identified as a novel collaborating gene for Runx2 and illustrated the interface between integration preference and oncogenic selection.

Several PML isoforms generated from a single PML gene by alternative splicing, share the same N-terminal region containing the RBCC/tripartite motif but differ in their C-terminal sequences. Recent studies of all the PML isoforms reveal the specific functions of each. The knockout of PML renders mice more sensitive to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Here we report that among PML isoforms (PMLI to PMLVIIb), only PMLIII and PMLIV confer resistance to VSV. Unlike PMLIII, whose anti-VSV activity is IFN-independent, PMLIV can act at two stages: it confers viral resistance directly in an IFN-independent manner and also specifically enhances IFN-beta production via a higher activation of IRF3, thus protecting yet uninfected cells from oncoming infection. PMLIV SUMOylation is required for both activities. This demonstrates for the first time that PMLIV is implicated in innate immune response through enhanced IFN-beta synthesis. Depletion of IRF3 further demonstrates the dual activity of PMLIV, since it abrogated PMLIV-induced IFN synthesis but not PMLIV-induced inhibition of viral proteins. Mechanistically, PMLIV enhances IFN-beta synthesis by regulating the cellular distribution of Pin1 (peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase), inducing its recruitment to PML NBs where both proteins colocalize. The interaction of SUMOylated PMLIV with endogenous Pin1 and its recruitment within PML NBs prevents the degradation of activated IRF3, and thus potentiates IRF3-dependent production of IFN-beta. Whereas the intrinsic antiviral activity of PMLIV is specific to VSV, its effect on IFN-beta synthesis is much broader, since it affects a key actor of innate immune pathways. Our results show that, in addition to its intrinsic anti-VSV activity, PMLIV positively regulates IFN-beta synthesis in response to different inducers, thus adding PML/TRIM19 to the growing list of TRIM proteins implicated in both intrinsic and innate immunity.",,20140227,,,PMC3937294,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found that after applying mechanical forces to ICAM-1 clusters, there is an increase in cellular stiffening and enhanced RhoA signaling compared with ICAM-1 clustering alone. We have identified that leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG), also known as Rho GEF 12 (ARHGEF12) acts downstream of clustered ICAM-1 to increase RhoA activity, and that this pathway is further enhanced by mechanical force on ICAM-1.

Suspension culture of iPSC aggregates can offer high cell yields but sometimes results in excess aggregation or cell death by shear stress. Hydrogel-based microencapsulation can solve such problems observed in Suspension culture, but there is no systematic evaluation of the possible capsule formulations. In addition, their biological effects on entrapped cells are still poorly studied so far. We, therefore, immobilized mouse iPSCs in three different types of calcium-alginate (Alg-Ca) hydrogel-based microcapsules; (i) Alg-Ca capsules without further treatment (Naked), (ii) Alg-Ca capsules with poly-l-lysine (PLL) coating (Coated), and (iii) Alg-PLL membrane capsules with liquid cores (Hollow). After 10 days of culture within the medium containing serum and leukemia inhibitory factor, we obtained good cellular expansions (10-13-fold) in Coated and Hollow capsules that were similar to Suspension culture. However, 32 +/- 9% of cellular leakage and lower cell yield (about threefold) were observed in Naked capsules. This was not observed in Coated and Hollow capsules. In addition, immunostaining and quantitative RT-PCR showed that the formation of primitive endodermal layers was suppressed in Coated capsules contrary to all other formulations. This agenesis of primitive endoderm layers in Coated capsules is likely to be the main cause of the significantly better pluripotency maintenance in hydrogel-based encapsulation culture. These results are helpful in further optimizing hydrogel-based iPSC culture, which can maintain better local cellular environments and be compatible with mass culture.",['(c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.'],20140311,['NOTNLM'],"['alginate', 'encapsulation', 'iPS cells', 'pluripotency']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a coculture set-up, we could further demonstrate that hSKPs inhibit the proliferation of allogeneic activated T cells and alter their cytokine secretion profile, in a dose-dependent manner. Cotransplantation of hSKP and human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) into severe combined immune-deficient mice also showed a significant impairment of the graft-versus-host response 1 week post-transplantation and a drastic increase in survival time of 60%. From a mechanistic point of view, we found that hSKPs require cell contact as well as secretion of soluble inhibitory factors in order to modulate the immune response. The expression/secretion levels of these factors further increases upon inflammation or in the presence of activated T cells.

The biology underlying this mechanism was unravelled by a young post-doctoral student, Bertha K Madras (1942-) who hypothesized that cells with low asparagine synthetase are those that die following treatment with asparaginase. To test her theory, Madras developed an assay for asparagine synthetase.

PROCEDURE: Study subjects (age >/= 18 years and >/=10 years post-diagnosis) participated in an institutional follow-up protocol and risk-based clinical evaluation based on Children's Oncology Group guidelines. Trabecular volumetric BMD was ascertained using quantitative computed tomography, reported as age- and sex-specific Z-scores. RESULTS: At median age 31 years, 5.7% of 845 subjects had a BMD Z-score of </=-2 and 23.8% had a Z-score of -1 to -2. Cranial radiation dose of >/=24 Gy, but not cumulative methotrexate or prednisone equivalence doses, was associated with a twofold elevated risk of a BMD Z-score of </=-1. The cranial radiation effect was stronger in females than in males. In a subset of 400 subjects, 67% of those who previously had a BMD Z-score of </=-2 improved by one or more categories a median of 8.5 years later. CONCLUSIONS: Very low BMD was relatively uncommon in this sample of adult survivors of childhood ALL, and BMD Z-scores tended to improve from adolescence to young adulthood. High-dose cranial or craniospinal radiation exposure was the primary predictor of suboptimal BMD in our study. Given that cranial radiation treatment for childhood ALL is used far more sparingly now than in earlier treatment eras, concerns about persistently low BMD among most current childhood ALL patients may be unwarranted.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",20140228,['NOTNLM'],"['cranial radiation', 'epidemiology', 'late effects', 'osteopenia', 'osteoporosis']",PMC4300194,['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS653058'],,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Feb;62(2):369-370.

However, resistance and intolerance are still a challenge in the treatment of CML. Autophagy has been proposed to play a role in IM resistance. To investigate the anti-leukemic activity of specific and potent autophagy inhibitor-1 (spautin-1) in CML, we detected its synergistic effect with IM in K562 and CML cells. Our results showed that spautin-1 markedly inhibited IM-induced autophagy in CML cells by downregulating Beclin-1. Spautin-1 enhanced IM-induced CML cell apoptosis by reducing the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2. We further demonstrated that the pro-apoptotic activity of spautin-1 was associated with activation of GSK3beta, an important downstream effector of PI3K/AKT. The findings indicate that the autophagy inhibitor spautin-1 enhances IM-induced apoptosis by inactivating PI3K/AKT and activating downstream GSK3beta, leading to downregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, which represents a promising approach to improve the efficacy of IM in the treatment of patients with CML.",,20140227,,,PMC6904104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2014 Mar 2.,"['0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Glutamate)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)']","Glutamate is the most important excitatory neurotransmitter of the nervous system, critically needed for the brain's development and function. Glutamate has also a signaling role in peripheral organs. Herein, we discuss glutamate receptors (GluRs) and glutamate-induced direct effects on human T cells. T cells are the most important cells of the adaptive immune system, crucially needed for eradication of all infectious organisms and cancer. Normal, cancer and autoimmune human T cells express functional ionotropic and metabotropic GluRs. Different GluR subtypes are expressed in different T cell subtypes, and in resting vs. activated T cells. Glutamate by itself, at low physiological 10(-8)M to 10(-5)M concentrations and via its several types of GluRs, activates many key T cell functions in normal human T cells, among them adhesion, migration, proliferation, intracellular Ca(2+) fluxes, outward K(+) currents and more. Glutamate also protects activated T cells from antigen-induced apoptotic cell death. By doing all that, glutamate can improve substantially the function and survival of resting and activated human T cells. Yet, glutamate's direct effects on T cells depend dramatically on its concentration and might be inhibitory at excess pathological 10(-3)M glutamate concentrations. The effects of glutamate on T cells also depend on the specific GluRs types expressed on the target T cells, the T cell's type and subtype, the T cell's resting or activated state, and the presence or absence of other simultaneous stimuli besides glutamate. Glutamate also seems to play an active role in T cell diseases. For example, glutamate at several concentrations induces or enhances significantly very important functions of human T-leukemia and T-lymphoma cells, among them adhesion to the extracellular matrix, migration, in vivo engraftment into solid organs, and the production and secretion of the cancer-associated matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 and its inducer CD147. Glutamate induces all these effects via activation of GluRs highly expressed in human T-leukemia and T-lymphoma cells. Glutamate also affects T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. With regards to multiple sclerosis (MS), GluR3 is highly expressed in T cells of MS patients, and upregulated significantly during relapse and when there is neurological evidence of disease activity. Moreover, glutamate or AMPA (10(-8)M to 10(-5)M) enhances the proliferation of autoreactive T cells of MS patients in response to myelin proteins. Thus, glutamate may play an active role in MS. Glutamate and its receptors also seem to be involved in autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Finally, T cells can produce and release glutamate that in turn affects other cells, and during the contact between T cells and dendritic cells, the latter cells release glutamate that has potent effects on the T cells. Together, these evidences show that glutamate has very potent effects on normal, and also on cancer and autoimmune pathological T cells. Moreover, these evidences suggest that glutamate and glutamate-receptor agonists might be used for inducing and boosting beneficial T cell functions, for example, T cell activity against cancer and infectious organisms, and that glutamate-receptor antagonists might be used for preventing glutamate-induced activating effects on detrimental autoimmune and cancerous T cells.",,20140302,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, responses to these inhibitors have been transient, suggesting that resistance limits their clinical efficacy. Here we modeled T-ALL resistance, identifying GSI-tolerant 'persister' cells that expand in the absence of NOTCH1 signaling. Rare persisters are already present in naive T-ALL populations, and the reversibility of their phenotype suggests an epigenetic mechanism. Relative to GSI-sensitive cells, persister cells activate distinct signaling and transcriptional programs and exhibit chromatin compaction. A knockdown screen identified chromatin regulators essential for persister viability, including BRD4. BRD4 binds enhancers near critical T-ALL genes, including MYC and BCL2. The BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 downregulates expression of these targets and induces growth arrest and apoptosis in persister cells, at doses well tolerated by GSI-sensitive cells. Consistently, the GSI-JQ1 combination was found to be effective against primary human leukemias in vivo.

Alterations in JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 signaling contribute to different disease states, and dysregulated JAK-STAT signaling is associated with hematologic malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and immune-deficient conditions. Genetic alterations of JAK2 occur in the majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and occur in a subset of patients with acute leukemias. JAK-mediated signaling critically relies on STAT transcription factors, and on activation of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling axes. Hyperactive JAK at the apex of these potent oncogenic signaling pathways therefore represents an important target for small-molecule kinase inhibitors in different disease states. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib and the JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib were recently approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, and additional ATP-competitive JAK inhibitors are in clinical development. Although these agents show clinical activity, the ability of these JAK inhibitors to induce clinical/molecular remissions in hematologic malignancies seems limited and resistance upon chronic drug exposure is seen. Alternative modes of targeting JAK2 such as allosteric kinase inhibition or HSP90 inhibition are under evaluation, as is the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Combination therapy approaches integrating inhibition of STAT, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK pathways with JAK kinase inhibitors might be critical to overcome malignancies characterized by dysregulated JAK signaling.",['(c)2014 AACR.'],20140228,,,PMC3990645,"['R01 CA151949/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA15194901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS570746'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We, therefore, explored the preclinical and clinical anti-AML activity of an oral AKT inhibitor, MK-2206. Experimental Methods: We first studied the effects of MK-2206 in human AML cell lines and primary AML specimens in vitro. Subsequently, we conducted a phase II trial of MK-2206 (200 mg weekly) in adults requiring second salvage therapy for relapsed/refractory AML, and assessed target inhibition via reverse phase protein array (RPPA). RESULTS: In preclinical studies, MK-2206 dose-dependently inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. We then treated 19 patients with MK-2206 but, among 18 evaluable participants, observed only 1 (95% confidence interval, 0%-17%) response (complete remission with incomplete platelet count recovery), leading to early study termination. The most common grade 3/4 drug-related toxicity was a pruritic rash in 6 of 18 patients. Nevertheless, despite the use of MK-2206 at maximum tolerated doses, RPPA analyses indicated only modest decreases in Ser473 AKT (median 28%; range, 12%-45%) and limited inhibition of downstream targets. CONCLUSIONS: Although preclinical activity of MK-2206 can be demonstrated, this inhibitor has insufficient clinical antileukemia activity when given alone at tolerated doses, and alternative approaches to block AKT signaling should be explored.",['(c)2014 AACR.'],20140228,,,PMC3989412,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA015704-35S6/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-CA159285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA159285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS568236'],,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01253447'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether inhibition of S100A6 can induce an effective GVL effect on MLL/AF4-positive ALL in a mouse model. MLL/AF4-positive ALL cell lines (SEM) transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing both S100A6 siRNA and luciferase (SEM-Luc-S100A6 siRNA) were produced. SEM-Luc-S100A6 siRNA cells and SEM-Luc-control siRNA cells were injected into groups of five SCID mice (1 x 10(7)/body). After confirmation of engraftment of SEM cells by in vivo imaging, the mice in each group were injected with 4.8 x 10(7) human PBMCs. SEM-Luc-S100A6 siRNA-injected mice showed significantly longer survival periods than SEM-Luc-control siRNA-injected mice (P=0.002). SEM-Luc-S100A6 siRNA-injected mice showed significantly slower tumor growth than those injected with SEM-Luc-control siRNA (P<0.0001).

Epub 2014 Feb 12.,,"Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) have been found to act as etiological cofactors in several chronic diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity and neurological dysfunction. Immunosuppressive domain (ISD) is a conserved region of transmembrane protein (TM) in envelope gene (env) of retroviruses. In vitro and vivo, evidence has shown that retroviral TM is highly immunosuppressive and a synthetic peptide (CKS-17) that shows homology to ISD inhibits immune function. ISD is probably a potential pathogenic element in HERVs. However, only less than one hundred ISDs of HERVs have been annotated by researchers so far, and universal software for domain prediction could not achieve sufficient accuracy for specific ISD. In this paper, a computational model is proposed to identify ISD in HERVs based on genome sequences only. It has a classification accuracy of 97.9% using Jack-knife test. 117 HERVs families were scanned with the model, 1002 new putative ISDs have been predicted and annotated in the human chromosomes. This model is also applicable to search for ISDs in human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) because of the evolutionary relationship between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. Furthermore, software named ISDTool has been developed to facilitate the application of the model.

Although shikonin demonstrates potent anticancer efficacy in numerous types of human cancer cells, the cellular targets of shikonin have not been fully defined. We report here that shikonin may interact with the cytosolic thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1), an important selenocysteine (Sec)-containing antioxidant enzyme with a C-terminal -Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly active site, to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Shikonin primarily targets the Sec residue in TrxR1 to inhibit its physiological function, but further shifts the enzyme to an NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide anions, which leads to accumulation of ROS and collapse of the intracellular redox balance. Importantly, overexpression of functional TrxR1 attenuates the cytotoxicity of shikonin, whereas knockdown of TrxR1 sensitizes cells to shikonin treatment. Targeting TrxR1 with shikonin thus discloses a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying the biological activity of shikonin and provides an in-depth insight into the action of shikonin in the treatment of cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

More recently, different groups have reported an association between CMV replication and reduced risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse. Given the conflicting results, we evaluated the impact of CMV replication and other covariates on the outcome of a retrospective cohort of 265 adults with B cell lymphoma receiving allogeneic HSCT from HLA-identical siblings or alternative donors. In time-dependent multivariate analysis, CMV replication, evaluated by pp65 antigenemia, had no independent effect on the risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], .6 to 1.6; P = .9), although it was associated with a reduced overall survival (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.2; P = .001) and an increased NRM (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.3; P = .01). Consistently, donor and/or recipient CMV seropositivity were not associated with a different outcome relative to CMV double-negative serostatus. In multivariate models, a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (P < .0001) and pretransplantation complete remission status (P < .0001) were the main independent predictors for improved relapse-free survival. In summary, contrary to what is observed in patients with AML, this report identifies no independent role for CMV replication or serostatus on the relapse of patients with B cell lymphomas undergoing allogeneic HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

HTLV-I has been clinically linked to the development of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL), an aggressive blood cancer, and HAM/TSP, a progressive neurological and inflammatory disease. Infected individuals typically mount a large, persistently activated CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against HTLV-I-infected cells, but ultimately fail to effectively eliminate the virus. Moreover, the identification of determinants to disease manifestation has thus far been elusive. A key issue in current HTLV-I research is to better understand the dynamic interaction between persistent infection by HTLV-I and virus-specific host immunity. Recent experimental hypotheses for the persistence of HTLV-I in vivo have led to the development of mathematical models illuminating the balance between proviral latency and activation in the target cell population. We investigate the role of a constantly changing anti-viral immune environment acting in response to the effects of infected T-cell activation and subsequent viral expression. The resulting model is a four-dimensional, non-linear system of ordinary differential equations that describes the dynamic interactions among viral expression, infected target cell activation, and the HTLV-I-specific CTL response. The global dynamics of the model is established through the construction of appropriate Lyapunov functions. Examining the particular roles of viral expression and host immunity during the chronic phase of HTLV-I infection offers important insights regarding the evolution of viral persistence and proposes a hypothesis for pathogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Risks of leukemia from acute and high doses of gamma-radiation are well-characterized, but risks from lower doses and dose-rates and from RDP exposures are controversial. Few studies have evaluated risks of other hematologic cancers in uranium workers. The purpose of this study was to analyze radiation-related risks of hematologic cancers in the cohort of Eldorado uranium miners and processors first employed in 1932-1980 in relation to cumulative RDP exposures and gamma-ray doses. The average cumulative RDP exposure was 100.2 working level months and the average cumulative whole-body gamma-radiation dose was 52.2 millisievert. We identified 101 deaths and 160 cases of hematologic cancers in the cohort. Overall, male workers had lower mortality and cancer incidence rates for all outcomes compared with the general Canadian male population, a likely healthy worker effect. No statistically significant association between RDP exposure or gamma-ray doses, or a combination of both, and mortality or incidence of any hematologic cancer was found. We observed consistent but non-statistically significant increases in risks of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) incidence and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) mortality with increasing gamma-ray doses. These findings are consistent with recent studies of increased risks of CLL and NHL incidence after gamma-radiation exposure.

Analyses were performed by real-time PCR using cDNA synthesized from plasma RNAs. In both disease groups differential levels of plasma lncRNAs were observed. LincRNA-p21 was the only molecule displaying significant changes in the CLL group while all remaining lncRNAs showed significant differences in the MM group. In the MM group only TUG1 showed higher levels than the healthy volunteers.

In a previous work, the potential anticancer activity of three naphthylchalcones named R7, R13 and R15 was shown. In this study, the mechanism of actions of these chalcones was originally shown. The chalcones presented concentration and time-dependent cytotoxicity. To determine the type of cell death induced by chalcones, we assessed a series of assays including measurements of the caspase-8, -9 and -12 activities, expression of important apoptosis-related genes and proteins, changes in the cell calcium concentration and cytochrome c release. The activities of caspase-8, -9 and -12 increased after the treatment of L1210 cells with the three compounds. Chalcones R7 and R13 induced an increase of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Bid and Bak (only chalcone R13), as well as a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression. These chalcones also induced an increase in Fas and a decrease in p21 and p53 expression. Chalcone R15 seems to act by a different mechanism to promote cell death, as it did not change the mitochondrion-related proteins, nor did it induce the cytochrome c release. All compounds induced an increase in cell calcium concentration and an increase in CHOP expression, which together with an increase in caspase-12 activity, suggest that chalcones could induce an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Taken together, these results suggest that chalcones induce apoptosis by different pathways, being an interesting strategy to suggest for cancer therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Less is known about the relationship between socio-economic determinants and survival from paediatric ALL, studied here for the first time in German children. METHODS: ALL cases were diagnosed between 1992 and 1994 and their parents interviewed during a previous nationwide case-control study. Children were followed-up for 10 years after diagnosis by the German Childhood Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards models estimating hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated to assess the impact of selected socio-demographic characteristics on overall and event-free survival. RESULTS: Overall survival was 82.5%, with a higher proportion of girls than boys surviving (85% versus 81%). We found a non-linear relationship between age at diagnosis and survival, with poorer survival in infants and children aged >5 years. There was no association between socio-economic factors and survival or risk of relapse. For five levels of increasing family income, all HRs were close to one. No relationship was seen with parental educational level. CONCLUSION: Socio-economic determinants did not affect ALL survival in West German children, in contrast to studies from some other countries. Dissimilarities in social welfare systems, including access to health care, lifestyle and differences in treatment may contribute to these differences in findings. Our observation of no social inequalities in paediatric ALL survival is reassuring, but needs continued monitoring to assess the potential impact of evolvement of treatment options and changes in paediatric health service.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the expression level of FoxM1 and analyzed the correlation of FoxM1 expression with AML patient characteristics and prognoses. Changes in FoxM1 expression were detected after MV4-11 cells, which have an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3-ITD), and control THP1 cells (encoding wild-type FLT3) were treated with the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AC220 (quizartinib) or FLT3 ligand (FL). Finally, we determined the apoptosis rates after the addition of the FoxM1 inhibitor thiostrepton (TST) to AML cells with or without FLT3-ITD. The expression of FoxM1 in AML patients was correlated with the presence of FLT3-ITD, genetic groups, and possibly overall survival. Inhibition of FLT3-ITD by AC220 down-regulated FoxM1 expression in MV4-11 cells, and stimulation of FLT3 by FL up-regulated FoxM1 expression in MV4-11 and THP1 cells. TST induced the apoptosis of MV4-11 and THP1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, FoxM1 is a potential prognostic marker and a promising therapeutic target in AML.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

With the advance in metabolomics, early detection and personalised treatment are possible. METHODS: Metabolomic profile of 21 ALL patients treated with 6-mercaptopurine and 10 healthy volunteers were analysed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry quadrupole-time of flight (LC/MS Q-TOF). Principal components analysis (PCA), recursive analysis, clustering and pathway analysis were performed using MassHunter Qualitative and Mass Profiler Professional (MPP) software. RESULTS: Several metabolites were found to be expressed differently in patients treated with 6-mercaptopurine. Interestingly, 13 metabolites were significantly differently expressed [p-value <0.01 (unpaired t-test) and 2-fold change] in 19% of the patients who had relapses in their treatment. Down-regulated metabolites in relapsed patients were 1-tetrahexanoyl-2-(8-[3]-ladderane-octanyl)-sn-GPEtn, GPEtn (18:1(9Z)/0:0), GPCho(O-6:0/O-6:0), GPCho(O-2:0/O-1:0), methyl 8-[2-(2-formyl-vinyl)-3-hydroxy-5-oxo-cyclopentyl]-octanoate and plasma free amino acids (PFAA). Characterizing the subjects according to their ITPA 94C>A genotypes reveal differential expression of metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: Our research contributes to identification of metabolites that could be used to monitor disease progress of patients and allow targeted therapy for ALL at different stages, especially in preventing complication of relapse.","['Copyright (c) 2014 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

We assessed the risk of myeloid disorders, such as acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, in a large cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in France. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study of 19,486 patients with IBD enrolled in the Cancers Et Surrisque Associe aux Maladies inflammatoires intestinales En France (CESAME) study from May 2004 through June 2005; patients were followed through December 31, 2007. The incidence of myeloid disorders in the general population, which was used for reference, was determined from the French Network of Cancer Registries. RESULTS: During 49,736 patient-years of follow-up, 5 patients were diagnosed with incident myeloid disorders (2 with acute myeloid leukemia and 3 with myelodysplastic syndromes). Four of these patients had been exposed to thiopurines (1 with ongoing treatment and 3 with past exposure). The risk of myeloid disorders was not increased among the overall IBD population, compared with the general population; the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-4.20). The risk of myeloid disorders was not increased among patients with IBD and ongoing thiopurine treatment (SIR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.05-8.54), but patients with past exposures to thiopurines had an increased risk of myeloid disorders (SIR, 6.98; 95% CI, 1.44-20.36). CONCLUSIONS: Past exposure to thiopurines increases the risk of myeloid disorders 7-fold among patients with IBD.

During an NK-mediated anti-microbial response, the final fate (survival or death) of a potential infected target cell depends primarily on the type and the number of receptor/ligand interactions occurring at the effector/target immune synapse. The identification of an array of receptors involved in NK cell triggering has been crucial for a better understanding of the NK cell biology. In this context, NCR play a predominant role in NK cell activation during the process of natural cytotoxicity. Regarding the NK-mediated pathogen recognition and NK cell activation, an emerging concept is represented by the involvement of TLRs and activating KIRs. NK cells express certain TLRs in common with other innate cell types. This would mean that specific TLR ligands are able to promote the simultaneous and synergistic stimulation of these innate cells, providing a coordinated mechanism for regulating the initiation and amplification of immune responses. Evidences have been accumulated indicating that viral infections may have a significant impact on NK cell maturation, promoting the expansion of phenotypically and functionally aberrant NK cell subpopulations. For example, during chronic HIV-infection, an abnormal expansion of a dysfunctional CD56neg NK cell subset has been detected that may explain, at least in part, the defective NK cell-mediated antiviral activity. An analogous imbalance of NK cell subsets has been detected in patients receiving HSCT to cure high risk leukemias and experiencing HCMV infection/reactivation. Remarkably, NK cells developing after CMV reactivation may contain ""memory-like"" or ""long-lived"" NK cells that could exert a potent anti-leukemia effect.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, developing effective agents for treating these illnesses is critical. In this study, essential oils from two tea tree species, kanuka (Kunzea ericoides) and manuka (Leptospermum scoparium), were evaluated for use in treating diseases and inflammation caused by microorganism infection. METHODS: Isolates of clinically common bacteria and fungi were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and from Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for Trichosporon mucoides, Malassezia furfur, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis were determined by the broth microdilution method with Sabouraud dextrose broth. The antibacterial susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, and Escherichia coli were determined by the broth microdilution method. A human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was cultured to test the effects of the essential oils on the release of the two inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-4. RESULTS: Multiple analyses of microorganism growth confirmed that both essential oils significantly inhibited four fungi and the four bacteria. The potent fungicidal properties of the oils were confirmed by minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.78% to 3.13%. The oils also showed excellent bactericidal qualities with 100% inhibition of the examined bacteria. In THP-1 cells, both oils lowered tumor necrosis factor-alpha released after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Finally, the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of the oils were obtained without adversely affecting the immune system. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the potent antimicroorganism and anti-inflammation properties of kanuka and manuka essential oils make them strong candidates for use in treating infections and immune-related disease. The data confirm the potential use of kanuka and manuka extracts as pharmaceutical antibiotics, medical cosmetology agents, and food supplements.",['Copyright (c) 2014.

Epub 2014 Feb 28.,,"BACKGROUND AIMS: Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells may offer a novel therapeutic approach for patients with malignancies relapsing after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Although CIK cells display negligible alloreactivity and cause minimal graft versus-host-disease (GVHD), high CIK cell doses required during relapse may pose a risk for severe GVHD, specifically in the mismatched or haploidentical transplantation setting. Manipulation of CIK cells may reduce risk for GVHD without affecting the anti-tumor potential. METHODS: In this pre-clinical study, we provide a detailed functional comparison of conventional and irradiated, CD56-enriched or T-cell receptor alpha/beta-depleted CIK cells. RESULTS: In vitro analysis showed retained anti-leukemic and anti-tumor potential after CIK cell manipulation. Even being sequentially infused into immunodeficient mice grafted with malignant cells, cytotoxic effects were fewest after irradiation but were improved by CD56 enrichment and were best with conventional CIK cells. Hence, considering the proliferative capacity of inoculated malignancies and effector cells, a single dose of conventional CIK cells resulted in prolonged disease-free survival and elimination of rhabdomyosarcoma cells, whereas sequential infusions were needed to achieve comparable results in leukemia-bearing mice. However, this mouse model has limitations: highly effective conventional CIK cells demonstrated both limited xenogenic GVHD and low alloreactive potential in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that conventional CIK cells demonstrate no significant alloreactive potential but provide the strongest anti-tumor efficacy compared with manipulated CIK cells. Conventional CIK cells may therefore be tested in high numbers and short-term intervals in patients with impending relapse even after mismatched transplantation.","['Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

In parallel, mitochondrial signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was found to be involved in ATP production. However, the regulation of mitochondrial STAT3 function and its connection to mast cell exocytosis is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore the role played by mitochondrial STAT3 in mast cell exocytosis. METHODS: Experiments were performed in vitro with human and mouse mast cells and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and in vivo in mice. OXPHOS activity was measured after immunologic activation. The expression of STAT3, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 in the mitochondria during mast cell activation was determined, as was the effect of STAT3 inhibition on OXPHOS activity and mast cell function. RESULTS: Here we show that mitochondrial STAT3 is essential for immunologically mediated degranulation of human and mouse mast cells and RBL cells. Additionally, in IgE-antigen-activated RBL cells, mitochondrial STAT3 was phosphorylated on serine 727 in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-dependent manner, which was followed by induction of OXPHOS activity. Furthermore, the endogenous inhibitor of STAT3, protein inhibitor of activated STAT3, was found to inhibit OXPHOS activity in the mitochondria, resulting in inhibition of mast cell degranulation. Moreover, mice injected with Stattic, a STAT3 inhibitor, had a significant decrease in histamine secretion. CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of a regulatory role for mitochondrial STAT3 in mast cell functions, and therefore mitochondrial STAT3 could serve as a new target for the manipulation of allergic diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The main outcome was the risk of traumatic LP; exploratory analysis included the risks of symptomatic spinal hematoma and progression/recurrence of the thrombotic event. Analyses were conducted using logistic regression analysis with a generalized estimating equation approach. RESULTS: Twenty-two children with ALL receiving an AC underwent a total of 396 LPs. Although traumatic LP was associated with full-dose AC therapy in univariable analysis, a multiple logistic regression model controlling for other risk factors for traumatic LP showed that AC therapy was not significantly associated with the risk of traumatic LP when the ACs were held as per the institutional protocol. No patient developed symptomatic spinal hematoma. Exploratory analysis revealed that AC dose, a likely marker of thrombus burden, was significantly associated with progression/recurrence of the thrombotic event in univariable analysis. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, recent AC therapy was not statistically associated with an increased risk of bleeding after LP when following a specific protocol for periprocedural AC management.

However, the high efficacy of IM has been hampered by the issue of clinical resistance that might due to pharmacogenetic variability. In the current study, the contribution of three common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCB1 (T1236C, G2677T/A and C3435T) and two SNPs of ABCG2 (G34A and C421A) genes in mediating resistance and/or good response among 215 CML patients on IM therapy were investigated. Among these patients, the frequency distribution of ABCG2 421 CC, CA and AA genotypes were significantly different between IM good response and resistant groups (P=0.01). Resistance was significantly associated with patients who had homozygous ABCB1 1236 CC genotype with OR 2.79 (95%CI: 1.217-6.374, P=0.01). For ABCB1 G2677T/A polymorphism, a better complete cytogenetic remission was observed for patients with variant TT/AT/AA genotype, compared to other genotype groups (OR=0.48, 95%CI: 0.239-0.957, P=0.03). Haplotype analysis revealed that ABCB1 haplotypes (C1236G2677C3435) was statistically linked to higher risk to IM resistance (25.8% vs. 17.4%, P=0.04), while ABCG2 diplotype A34A421 was significantly correlated with IM good response (9.1% vs. 3.9%, P=0.03). In addition, genotypic variant in ABCG2 421C>A was associated with a major molecular response (MMR) (OR=2.20, 95%CI: 1.273-3.811, P=0.004), whereas ABCB1 2677G>T/A variant was associated with a significantly lower molecular response (OR=0.49, 95%CI: 0.248-0.974, P=0.04).

SETTING: Reproductive biology laboratory, academic medical center. PATIENT(S): Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells from three patients and testicular cells from three other patients. INTERVENTION(S): Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were cultured alone or in combination with testicular cells, at various concentrations, in a system that has recently been developed to propagate human spermatogonial stem cells. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Viability of ALL and testicular cells during culture was evaluated by flow cytometry using markers for live/dead cells. Furthermore, the presence of ALL cells among testicular cells was determined by highly sensitive (1:10,000 to 1:100,000 cells) patient-specific antigen-receptor minimal residual disease polymerase chain reaction. The presence of spermatogonia at the end of culture was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for ZBTB16, UCHL1, and GPR125. RESULT(S): The ALL cells cultured separately did not survive beyond 14 days of culture. When cultured together with testicular cells, even at extremely high initial concentrations (40% ALL cells), ALL cells were undetectable beyond 26 days of culture. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of spermatogonia at the end of the culture period. CONCLUSION(S): Our pilot study shows that the described testicular cell culture system not only allows for efficient propagation of spermatogonial stem cells but also eliminates contaminating ALL cells.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Murphy Roths large (MRL)/lpr mice and New Zealand mixed (NZM)2410 mice, murine models of lupus, with decreased expression of Fli-1 had significantly prolonged survival and reduced nephritis. Lupus nephritis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients, and inflammatory cell infiltration plays a key role in the development of the disease. To study how the expression of Fli-1 affects the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the kidneys, we generated congenic enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic MRL/lpr mice. A significantly increased number of GFP-expressing inflammatory cells infiltrated the kidneys of wild-type MRL/lpr mice compared to Fli-1 heterozygous (Fli-1(+/-)) MRL/lpr mice after injection of GFP(+) cells. Expression of inflammatory chemokine mRNA, including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, was significantly lower in the kidneys from Fli-1(+/-) MRL/lpr mice compared to wild-type littermates. Numbers of infiltrated cells into the kidneys correlate with expression levels of CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5, but not the titres of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in these mice. Significantly increased inflammatory cells from wild-type MRL/lpr mice infiltrated into kidneys compared to the cells from Fli-1(+/-) MRL/lpr mice. The chemotaxis of inflammatory cells from Fli-1(+/-) MRL/lpr mice towards each chemokine was decreased significantly compared to inflammatory cells from wild-type MRL/lpr mice in the transwell migration assay in vitro.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational series of cases with acute thallium poisoning was analyzed retrospectively in West China Hospital of Sichuan University between 2000 and 2010. The clinical data including symptom, determination of thallium level, treatment, neurophysiological examination, and neuropsychological evaluation were analyzed. The patients were followed up until December 2012. RESULTS: Seven men and six women were enrolled in the study. The median patient age was 37 years (range: 15-53 years). The median duration of hospitalization was 44 days (range: 7-72). All the patients were misdiagnosed initially. One patient died in the hospital. The other 12 patients were followed for a median of 7 years (range: 1-12 years) after discharge from hospital. One patient died from leukemia in the first year of follow-up. Long-term outcome results showed peripheral neuropathy improved substantially. However, many patients have mild or moderate sequelae in sensory nerve fibers of distal lower extremity. A sural nerve biopsy in one patient revealed shrunken axons, distorted myelin sheath, and myelinated fibers loss. During follow-up period, problem of intelligence (4/12 patients, 33%), memory impairment (4/12, 33%), anxiety (6/12, 50%), and depression (5/12, 42%) were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological symptoms may lead to misdiagnosis of thallium poisoning. Mild or moderate neurological sequelae may last for a long time after thallium poisoning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The response rate [complete remission and complete remission with incomplete count recovery] was 52%, significantly higher than our previous trial with clofarabine/cytarabine alone, where the response rate was 17%.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play a crucial role in this process as their functions decline during aging. Sirtuins are a family of protein lysine modifying enzymes that have diverse roles in regulating metabolism, genome stability, cell proliferation, and survival, and have been implicated in mammalian aging and longevity. Here we provide an updated overview of sirtuins in aging research; particularly, how increased activity of SIRT1, SIRT3, or SIRT6 improves several aging parameters, and may possibly increase lifespan in mice. We review the literature on how sirtuins may play a role in HSC aging and hematological malignancies, and how key signaling pathways of HSCs may be affected by sirtuins. Among them, SIRT1 plays a critical role in chronic myelogenous leukemia, an age-dependent malignancy, and inhibition of SIRT1 sensitizes leukemic stem cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment and blocks acquisition of resistant oncogene mutations. In-depth understanding of sirtuins in HSC aging and malignancy may help design novel strategies to deter hematological aging and improve treatment of hematological malignancies.",,,,,PMC3951433,"['R01 CA143421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA143421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS559126'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that, to perform these activities in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, both proteins competitively heterodimerize with pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox-1 (Pbx1). Meis1 alone transforms Prep1-deficient fibroblasts, whereas Prep1 overexpression inhibits Meis1 tumorigenicity. Pbx1 can, therefore, alternatively act as an oncogene or tumor suppressor. Prep1 posttranslationally controls the level of Meis1, decreasing its stability by sequestering Pbx1. The different levels of Meis1 and the presence of Prep1 are followed at the transcriptional level by the induction of specific transcriptional signatures. The decrease of Meis1 prevents Meis1 interaction with Ddx3x and Ddx5, which are essential for Meis1 tumorigenesis, and modifies the growth-promoting DNA binding landscape of Meis1 to the growth-controlling landscape of Prep1. Hence, the key feature of Prep1 tumor-inhibiting activity is the control of Meis1 stability.",,20140227,,,PMC3956142,,,,['GEO/GSE54221'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional prognostic factors such as age at onset, initial white blood cell count, and National Cancer Institute risk have also no impact on OS in both cohorts. Surprisingly, the pattern of relapse in JACLS cohort, 9 of 82 patients, was unique: eight of nine patients relapsed during the maintenance phase and one patient had primary induction failure. However, bone marrow status and assessment of minimal residual disease on days 15 and 33 did not identify those patients. Interestingly, the two patients with IKZF1 deletion eventually relapsed in JACLS cohort, as did one patient in CCLSG cohort.

In this study, the authors reviewed the outcomes of patients with myc-positive and double-hit NHL at The Ohio State University. METHODS: All patients who had non-Burkitt, aggressive B-cell NHL from 2008 to 2011 were assessed for the t(14;18) translocation and for v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (CMYC) rearrangements at diagnosis, and all myc-positive patients were included in the current analysis. Associations with clinical characteristics were described, and univariable and multivariable models were used to assess correlations between clinical variables and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 49 myc-positive patients, 29 patients also had BCL2 rearrangements (double-hit NHL). No patients underwent autologous stem cell transplantation in first remission. For all myc-positive patients, the median PFS was 16.6 months, and the median OS was 37.7 months. For patients who had double-hit NHL, the median PFS was 8 months, and the median OS was 12.5 months; whereas the median PFS and OS were not reached for myc-positive patients. A complete response (CR) after front-line therapy, the presence of t(14;18), International Prognostic Index (IPI) group, and age were associated with PFS; whereas only the achievement of a CR and age >60 years were associated with OS in the multivariable setting. The median PFS was 3.3 months, and the median and OS was 7.0 months for patients who did not attain a CR; and the medians were not reached for patients who achieved a CR (P < .00001). CONCLUSIONS: The achievement of a CR with front-line therapy is associated with a prolonged PFS and OS in patients with myc-positive NHL, even after adjusting for type of initial therapy, histology, age, IPI, or the presence of a concurrent BCL2 translocation.",['(c) 2014 American Cancer Society.'],20140227,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma', 'C-myc genes', 'immunoglobulin heavy chain genes', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma']",PMC4291121,['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS649877'],,,,,,['Cancer. 2014 Jun 1;120(11):1611-3.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of prostate cancer patients diagnosed between 1986 and 2011 at Cleveland Clinic, comparing those who underwent definitive treatment with radical prostatectomy (RP) to radiotherapy either external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or prostate interstitial brachytherapy (PI) and to population-based registries. Competing risk regression analyses were used to determine the cumulative risk of developing MDS. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of 10924 patients, 5119 (47%) received radiation (n = 2183 [43%] in EBRT group and n = 2936 [57%] in PI group) and 5805 (53%) were treated with RP. Overall, 31 cases of MDS were observed, with age-adjusted incidence rates no higher than in population-based registries. In univariate analyses, advancing age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 1.20; P < .001) and radiotherapy exposure (HR = 3.44; 95% CI = 1.41 to 8.37; P = .007) were statistically significantly associated with development of MDS. In multivariable analyses, although advanced age (HR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.19; P < .001) remained statistically associated with MDS, radiation did not, although a small non-statistically significant trend existed for PI-treated patients. MDS rates were no higher than in population-based registries. CONCLUSIONS: With relatively short follow-up, prostate cancer patients definitively treated with radiation did not appear to have a statistically increased risk of subsequent MDS.",,20140227,,,,,,,,,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2014 Mar;106(3):dju025.

DIAGNOSIS: Hypereosinophilia (HE) has generally been defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count greater than 1,500/mm(3) and may be associated with tissue damage. After exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia, diagnostic evaluation of primary eosinophilias relies on a combination of morphologic review of the blood and marrow, standard cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ hybridization, flow immunocytometry, and T-cell clonality assessment to detect histopathologic or clonal evidence for an acute or chronic myeloid or lymphoproliferative disorder. RISK STRATIFICATION: Disease prognosis relies on identifying the subtype of eosinophilia. After evaluation of secondary causes of eosinophilia, the 2008 World Health Organization establishes a semimolecular classification scheme of disease subtypes including ""myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1', chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified"" (CEL, NOS), lymphocyte-variant HE, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), which is a diagnosis of exclusion. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The goal of therapy is to mitigate eosinophil-mediated organ damage. For patients with milder forms of eosinophilia (e.g., <1,500/mm(3)) without symptoms or signs of organ involvement, a watch and wait approach with close-follow-up may be undertaken. Identification of rearranged PDGFRA or PDGFRB is critical because of the exquisite responsiveness of these diseases to imatinib. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for patients with lymphocyte-variant HE and HES. Hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha have demonstrated efficacy as initial treatment and steroid-refractory cases of HES. In addition to hydroxyurea, second-line cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and hematopoietic cell transplant have been used for aggressive forms of HES and CEL with outcomes reported for limited number of patients. Although clinical trials have been performed with anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) and anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) antibodies, their therapeutic role in primary eosinophilic diseases and HES has yet to be established.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had a history of aHSCT for chronic myelogeneous leukemia at the age of 17 years. Six months after undergoing aHSCT, he had developed cGvHD involving skin, mouth, eye, lung, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. At the time of PICU admission he had respiratory distress and required ventilation support. Thorax high-resolution computed tomography was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans. Although bronchiolitis obliterans is an obstructive lung defect, a restrictive pattern became prominent in the clinical course because of the sclerotic chest wall skin. The activity of cGvHD kept increasing despite the therapy and we lost the patient because of severe respiratory distress and massive hemoptysis secondary to bronchiectasis. In conclusion, pulmonary cGvHD can present with restrictive changes related with the advanced sclerosis of the chest wall skin.

One-tailed paired t test was used to compare the groups. RESULTS: Survivors were similar to siblings in cardiovascular risk measures but had poorer vascular health as measured by reactive hyperemia index (survivor RHI 1.54 vs. sibling 1.77; P=0.0474).

For some patients with limited disease stages I and II, radiotherapy may be associated with durable responses; however, it is unclear whether patients are cured and new approaches such as the combination of irradiation with rituximab or even single-agent rituximab need to be explored. Whereas watch and wait is the current standard for stage III and IV disease with low tumour burden, better indices are warranted to potentially select patients for whom early intervention is preferred. For advanced stages with a high tumour burden, immunochemotherapy followed by 2 years of rituximab maintenance is widely accepted as standard therapy, although re-treatment at recurrence may be an alternative option. Highly attractive new therapeutic options have recently arisen from new antibodies, and from new agents targeting oncogenic pathways such as B-cell receptor signalling pathways or inhibition of bcl 2. Furthermore, immunomodulatory drugs may add to the therapeutic armamentarium and may lead to 'chemotherapy-free' therapies in the near future. Hence, the management of FLs has become a moving target and the hope is justified that the long-term perspectives of patients suffering from the disease will be further improved in the near future.",,20140228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study demonstrates that rocaglamide and silvestrol, closely related natural products from the flavagline class of compounds, are able to preferentially kill functionally defined leukemia stem cells, while sparing normal stem and progenitor cells. In addition to efficacy as single agents, flavaglines sensitize leukemia cells to several anticancer compounds, including front-line chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat leukemia patients. Mechanistic studies indicate that flavaglines strongly inhibit protein synthesis, leading to the reduction of short-lived antiapoptotic proteins. Notably though, treatment with flavaglines, alone or in combination with other drugs, yields a much stronger cytotoxic activity toward leukemia cells than the translational inhibitor temsirolimus. These results indicate that the underlying cell death mechanism of flavaglines is more complex than simply inhibiting general protein translation.

Later years with imatinib and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors showed a variety of resistance mechanisms and it became obvious that the bcr-abl chimeric gene is not the only enemy to fight. Some studies assumed the decreased rate of programmed cell death (apoptotic) to be the primary mechanism by which BCR-ABL affects expansion of the leukemic clone in CML. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of c-kit inhibition in treatment response. METHODS: Cytogenetic analysis, real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, flow-cytometric analysis and imatinib serum level quantification were applied. RESULTS: The percentage of CD34+ cells expressing c-kit (CD117) isolated from bone marrow samples of 54 CML patients treated with standard-dose imatinib was significantly lower among imatinib responders. The fraction of apoptotic CD34+CD117+ cells in this patient group was significantly higher than in nonresponders. CONCLUSION: To achieve optimal treatment response in CML patients, the elimination of CD34+CD117+ may be necessary through an apoptotic pathway.","['(c) 2014 S.

NPM1/B23 deregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of several human malignancies. This protein exerts its functions through the interaction with a multiplicity of biological partners. Very recently it is has been shown that NPM1/B23 specifically recognizes DNA G-quadruplexes through its C-terminal region. METHODS: Through a rational dissection approach of protein here we show that the intrinsically unfolded regions of NPM1/B23 significantly contribute to the binding of c-MYC G-quadruplex motif. Interestingly, the analysis of the ability of distinct NPM1/B23 fragments to bind this quadruplex led to the identifications of distinct NPM1/B23-based peptides that individually present a high affinity for this motif. RESULTS: These results suggest that the tight binding of NPM1/B23 to the G-quadruplex is achieved through the cooperation of both folded and unfolded regions that are individually able to bind it. The dissection of NPM1/B23 also unveils that its H1 helix is intrinsically endowed with an unusual thermal stability. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for the unfolding mechanism of NPM1/B23, for the G-quadruplex affinity of the different NPM1/B23 isoforms and for the design of peptide-based molecules able to interact with this DNA motif. GENERAL OBSERVATION: This study sheds new light in the molecular mechanism of the complex NPM1/G-quadruplex involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) disease.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we showed the modulation of Flvcr1 gene expression in different tissues and cell lines in response to hypoxia.

Analysis of Caco2 cells in which HIF2alpha or ETS1 were silenced or overexpressed demonstrated that, both HIF2alpha and ETS1 are involved in the transcriptional regulation of Flvcr1a and that HIF2alpha is absolutely required for Flvcr1a induction upon hypoxia.

In Brazil there is no self-service fuel in gas stations and attendants fill the fuel themselves. Due to this they are chronically exposed to high concentration of BTX. Occupational exposure to benzene has been associated with increased chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using whole chromosome painting (wcp) probes allows the rapid detection of chromosomal aberration. In the present study three-color wcp probes for chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 were used for monitoring 60 gas station attendants. RESULTS: Blood tests were done and interviews were conducted for each worker. For searching for possible associations between the clinical characteristics and the frequency of chromosomal aberrations the workers were divided into two groups (</= 10 chromosomal abnormalities per 1,000 metaphases and > 10 chromosomal abnormalities per 1,000 metaphases).The studied workers had a low median age (36 year), albeit long period of BTX exposure (median was 16 years). Low prevalence of smoking and moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages were found in this population. The cytogenetic analysis showed 16.6% (10/60) of workers with a high frequency of chromosomal abnormalities (>10 chromosomal abnormalities per 1,000 metaphases). Translocations were the most frequently observed chromosome aberration. The statistical analysis revealed highly significant differences in skin color (p = 0.002) and a weak significant differences in gender (p = 0.052) distribution between the two groups. CONCLUSION: 16.6% of the studied population showed elevated frequencies of chromosomal abnormalities, which is highly likely to be correlated with their exposure to BTX during their work. Therefore, further studies are needed for better characterize the work associated damage of the genome in gas station workers. It is necessary to better understand the risks that these workers are exposed, so that we can be effective in preventing diseases and maintaining the health of these workers and possibly the offspring.",,20140227,,,PMC3974043,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some epidemiological studies have shown a relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and some childhood cancers. In the present study, an attempt was made to assess socioeconomical status in a case-control study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2010, a case-control study was conducted on 100 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia aged 1 to14 years in Department of Pediatric Oncology of Dr.Sheikh Hospital in Mashhad - Iran and matched age and sex with 400 healthy controls. Data was collected by interview using a questionnaire. Ninety five percent confidence intervals were used to measure the relationship between childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and parental education, income status, father's job (Socioeconomic status), number of children, birth score and paternal smoking. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in parental education level, income status, and number of children, birth score, father's job and paternal smoking between two groups. Regression analysis showed that the risk of childhood ALL associated with paternal smoking, and father's high risk job. Fifty percent cases and thirty five percent of control groups located in upper lower and lower middle class of socioeconomic status, respectively. There is a meaningful different between socioeconomic status in two groups. But the risk of childhood ALL did not associate with socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that paternal smoking and father's high risk job are related to risk of childhood leukemia.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxic effects of crude aqueous Catharanthus roseus extract on Jurkat cells and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The aqueous extract was standardised to vinblastine by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and was used to determine cytotoxicity by the MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr azolium] assay. DNA fragmentation assay was employed to determine if cell death was due to apoptosis. The results showed that the aqueous extract induced cell death of Jurkat cells at 24, 48 and 72 hours post-treatment in a time- and dose-dependent manner. However, cells treated at 48 and 72 hours produced higher cytotoxic effects with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 2.55 mug/ml and 2.38 mug/ml, respectively. In contrast, the extract induced normal PBMC proliferation, especially after 24 hours treatment with 1000 mug/ml. This result indicates that the C. roseus crude aqueous extract showed differential effects of inhibiting the proliferation of the Jurkat cell line and promoting the growth of PBMCs.

Aberrantly spliced genes included a number of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and genes involved in regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell differentiation. Among the most commonly mis-spliced genes (>70% of AML patients) were 2, NOTCH2 and FLT3, that encode myeloid cell surface proteins. The splice variants of NOTCH2 and FLT3 resulted from complete or partial exon skipping and utilization of cryptic splice sites. Longitudinal analyses suggested that NOTCH2 and FLT3 aberrant splicing correlated with disease status. Correlation analyses between splice variants of these genes and clinical features of patients showed an association between NOTCH2-Va splice variant and overall survival of patients. Our results suggest that NOTCH2 and FLT3 mis-splicing is a common characteristic of AML and has the potential to generate transcripts encoding proteins with altered function.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by the activity of BCR-ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. CML therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is highly effective; however, due to the persistence of residual LICs, it is not curative. Several factors are known to support CML LICs, but purification of LICs and a thorough understanding of their niche signals have not yet been achieved. Using a CML-like mouse model of myeloproliferative disease, we demonstrate that CML LICs can be divided into CD25(+)FcepsilonRIalpha(-) Lineage marker (Lin)(-) Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) (F(-)LSK) cells and CD25(-)F(-)LSK cells. The CD25(+)F(-)LSK cells had multilineage differentiation capacity, with a preference toward cytokine-producing mast cell commitment. Although cells interconverted between CD25(-)F(-)LSK and CD25(+)F(-)LSK status, the CD25(+)F(-)LSK cells exhibited higher LIC capacity. Our findings suggest that interleukin-2 derived from the microenvironment and CD25 expressed on CML LICs constitute a novel signaling axis. The high levels of CD25 expression in the CD34(+)CD38(-) fraction of human CML cells indicate that CD25(+) LICs constitute an ""LIC-derived niche"" that could be preferentially targeted in therapy for CML.",,20140226,,,,,,,,,,,['Blood. 2014 Apr 17;123(16):2443-5.

Inconsistent annotation quality and lack of annotation specificity, however, limit the statistical power of enrichment methods and make it difficult to replicate enrichment results across biologically similar datasets. RESULTS: We propose a novel algorithm for optimizing gene set annotations to best match the structure of specific empirical data sources. Our proposed method, entropy minimization over variable clusters (EMVC), filters the annotations for each gene set to minimize a measure of entropy across disjoint gene clusters computed for a range of cluster sizes over multiple bootstrap resampled datasets. As shown using simulated gene sets with simulated data and Molecular Signatures Database collections with microarray gene expression data, the EMVC algorithm accurately filters annotations unrelated to the experimental outcome resulting in increased gene set enrichment power and better replication of enrichment results.

Here we interrogate adult rat SSCs using an established model in which only undifferentiated spermatogonial cells remain in the testis at 15 weeks following irradiation, and spermatogonial differentiation is induced within 4 weeks by gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH-ant) administration. Synthesis of Hh pathway components in untreated adult rat testes was compared with that in irradiated testes prior to and after GnRH-ant exposure using in situ hybridization. In adult testes with complete spermatogenesis, the Desert Hedgehog ligand transcript, Dhh, was detected in Sertoli cells, some spermatogonia and in spermatocytes by in situ hybridization. Spermatogenic cells were identified as sites of Hh signalling through detection of transcripts encoding the Hh receptor, Ptc2 transcripts and proteins for the key downstream target of Hh signalling, Gli1 and the Hh transcriptional activator, Gli2. Remarkably, the undifferentiated spermatogonia present in irradiated adult rat testes contained Dhh in addition to Ptc2, Gli1 and Gli2, revealing the potential for an autocrine Hh signalling loop to sustain undifferentiated spermatogonial cells. These transcripts became undetectable by in situ hybridization following GnRH-ant induction of spermatogonial differentiation, however, detection of Gli1 protein in spermatogonia in all groups indicates that Hh signalling is sustained.

TSLP signals through a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of an interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain and a unique TSLP receptor (TSLPR) [also known as cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2)]. Cellular targets of TSLP include dendritic cells, B cells, mast cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The TSLP/TSLPR axis can activate multiple signaling transduction pathways including the JAK/STAT pathway and the PI-3 kinase pathway. Aberrant TSLP/TSLPR signaling has been associated with a variety of human diseases including asthma, atopic dermatitis, nasal polyposis, inflammatory bowel disease, eosinophilic eosophagitis and, most recently, acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A centralized resource of the TSLP signaling pathway cataloging signaling events is not yet available. In this study, we present a literature-annotated resource of reactions in the TSLP signaling pathway. This pathway map is publicly available through NetPath (http://www.netpath.org/), an open access signal transduction pathway resource developed previously by our group. This map includes 236 molecules and 252 reactions that are involved in TSLP/TSLPR signaling pathway. We expect that the TSLP signaling pathway map will provide a rich resource to study the biology of this important cytokine as well as to identify novel therapeutic targets for diseases associated with dysregulated TSLP/TSLPR signaling.

Little is known about the physicians who provide their routine medical care. OBJECTIVE: To determine general internists' self-reported attitudes and knowledge about the care of CCSs. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Mailed survey delivered between September 2011 and August 2012. PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of 2000 U.S. general internists. MEASUREMENTS: Care preferences, comfort levels with caring for CCSs (7-point Likert scale: 1 = very uncomfortable, 7 = very comfortable), familiarity with available surveillance guidelines (7-point Likert scale: 1 = very unfamiliar, 7 = very familiar), and concordance with Children's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines in response to a clinical vignette. RESULTS: The response rate was 61.6% (1110 of 1801). More than half the internists (51.1%) reported caring for at least 1 CCS; 72.0% of these internists never received a treatment summary. On average, internists were ""somewhat uncomfortable"" caring for survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and osteosarcoma. Internists reported being ""somewhat unfamiliar"" with available surveillance guidelines. In response to a clinical vignette about a young adult survivor of Hodgkin lymphoma, 90.6% of respondents did not appropriately recommend yearly breast cancer surveillance, 85.1% did not appropriately recommended cardiac surveillance, and 23.6% did not appropriately recommend yearly thyroid surveillance. Access to surveillance guidelines and treatment summaries were identified as the most useful resources for caring for CCSs. LIMITATION: Findings, based on self-report, may not reflect actual clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Although most general internists report involvement in the care of CCSs, many seem unfamiliar with available surveillance guidelines and would prefer to follow patients in collaboration with a cancer center.

Because Tregs express high levels of the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, they may selectively expand in vivo in response to doses of IL-2 insufficient to stimulate T effector T-cell populations, thereby preventing GVHD. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We prospectively evaluated the effects of ultra low-dose (ULD) IL-2 injections on Treg recovery in pediatric patients after alloSCT and compared this recovery with Treg reconstitution post alloSCT in patients without IL-2. Sixteen recipients of related (n = 12) or unrelated (n = 4) donor grafts received ULD IL-2 post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; 100,000-200,000 IU/m(2) x3 per week), starting <day 30 and continuing for 6 to 12 weeks. RESULTS: No grade 3/4 toxicities were associated with ULD IL-2. CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs increased from a mean of 4.8% (range, 0%-11.0%) pre IL-2 to 11.1% (range, 1.2%-31.1%) following therapy, with the greatest change occurring in the recipients of matched related donor (MRD) transplants. No IL-2 patients developed grade 2-4 acute GVHD (aGVHD), compared with 4 of 33 (12%) of the comparator group who did not receive IL-2. IL-2 recipients retained T cells reactive to viral and leukemia antigens, and in the MRD recipients, only 2 of 13 (15%) of the IL-2 patients developed viral infections versus 63% of the comparator group (P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Hence, ULD IL-2 is well tolerated, expands a Treg population in vivo, and may be associated with a lower incidence of viral infections and GVHD.",['(c)2014 AACR.'],20140226,,,PMC3989436,"['P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA149967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 R21 CA149967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS568238'],,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00539695'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent progress in biological insights and therapeutics, WM remains clinically challenging to diagnose and is difficult to manage with significant morbidity and lack of established curative therapies. Recently, the use of whole-genome sequencing has helped to identify a highly recurrent somatic mutation, myeloid differentiation factor 88 [MYD88] L265P in WM. This has fueled major interest in the field and as newer evidence accumulates, it is clear that that discovery of MYD88 L265P mutation may represent an important breakthrough in understanding the pathogenesis of WM and lymphoproliferative disorders. Recent scientific work in this field has also guided the identification of new targets such as CXCR4 and PI3K-delta that may have major implications in the future treatment of WM. This review discusses the role of MYD88 L265P mutations as well as targets beyond MYD88 in the setting of pathogenesis and development of future rational therapeutic trials focusing on patients diagnosed with WM.",,20140227,,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A case-case study was conducted in order to explore maternal and child exposures to tobacco smoking associations with early age leukaemia (EAL). METHODS: Covariables of reference were MLL rearrangements (MLL-r), RASmut and NQO1 rs1800566 (C609T). Samples from 150 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 85 AML were included. Maternal exposures were assessed using a structured questionnaire with demographic, personal habits and residence history information. Restriction fragment length polymorphism and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography were used to screen FLT3, KRAS, and NRAS mutations; direct sequencing was performed to validate the results. NQO1 polymorphism was detected by real-time allelic discrimination technique. RESULTS: Overall, RASmut were detected in 28.7% of EAL cases; BRAFmut was found only in one AML patient. Higher rate of KRASmut was found in ALL (30.3%) compared to AML (20.8%) with MLL-r; RASmut showed an association with second-hand tobacco smoking exposures (OR, 3.06, 95% CI, 1.03-9.07). A considerable increased risk for EAL with the combination of RASmut and NQO1 609CT (OR, 4.24, 95% CI, 1.24-14.50) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated the increased risk association between maternal smoking and EAL with MLL-r. Additionally, suggests that children second-hand tobacco exposures are associated with increased risk of EAL with RASmut modulated by NQO1 rs1800566 (C609T).",,20140226,,,PMC3946262,,,,,,['Brazilian Collaborative Study Group of Infant Acute Leukaemia'],,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: RNA-seq data from 614 NSCLC [355 adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and 259 squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC)] and 92 normal lung specimens were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to evaluate the mRNA expression of insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) and insulin receptor isoform B (IR-B). The differential expression status of the insulin receptor isoforms in NSCLC patients was confirmed using qRT-PCR assays with lung cancer cDNA arrays and primary tumor samples. RESULTS: The mRNA expression levels of IR-B were significantly lower in some NSCLC samples compared to normal lung specimens, including both LUAD and LUSC. Notably, no IR-B transcripts were detected - only the IR-A isoform was expressed in 11% of NSCLC patients. This decrease in IR-B expression contributed to an elevated IR-A/IR-B ratio, which was also associated with lower epithelial-mesenchymal transition gene signatures in NSCLC and longer patient survival under standard of care in LUSC. In addition to NSCLC, RNA-seq data from TCGA revealed a similar increase in IR-A/IR-B ratio in many other cancer types, with high prevalence in acute myeloid leukemia, glioblastoma multiforme, and brain lower grade glioma. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a common reduction of the mRNA expression level of IR-B and an increased IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio in NSCLC and other tumor types. The relationship of altered IR-A/IR-B ratios with cancer progression and patient survival should be prospectively explored in future studies.",,20140226,,,PMC3974050,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that the patients of both myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myeloid leukaemia with BMI1 overexpression had a higher risk in malignant myeloid progression. In vitro gene transfection studies showed that BMI1 inhibited cell myeloid and erythroid differentiation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate respectively. BMI1 also resisted apoptosis induced by arsenic trioxide. Moreover, the transcript levels of Runx1 and Pten were down-regulated in Bmi1-transfected cells in company with histone deacetylation modification. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) collaborated with secondary generation sequencing and verified by ChIP-PCR, we found that BMI1 directly bound to the promoter region of Zmym3, which encodes a component of histone deacetylase-containing complexes. In addition, as one of the downstream target genes of this complex, c-fos was activated with increasing histone acetylation when ZMYM3 was suppressed in the Bmi1-transfected cells. These results suggested that BMI1 may reprogramme the histone acetylation profile in multiple genes through either indirect or direct binding effects which probably contributes to the malignant progression of myeloid progenitor cells.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

While Nanog levels remained elevated over the investigated time period, Oct4 levels decreased at later time points. Additionally, OCT4 target genes were also found to be upregulated upon Brg1 knockdown. SiRNA-mediated BRG1 knockdown in embryonic stem (ES) cells led to Oct4 and Nanog upregulation, whereas F9 cells showed primarily Oct4 upregulation. BRG1 knockdown upregulated the expression of differentiation markers in mouse ES cells as well as differentiated morphology under reduced leukemia inhibitory factor conditions.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The British Columbia Cancer Registry was used to identify all patients 18-80 years of age diagnosed with DLBCL between January 2003 and December 2008. Home and treatment center postal codes were used to determine urban versus rural status and driving distance to access treatment. RESULTS: We identified 1,357 patients. The median age was 64 years (range: 18-80 years), 59% were male, 50% were stage III/IV, 84% received chemotherapy with curative intent, and 32% received radiotherapy. There were 186 (14%) who resided in rural areas, 141 (10%) in small urban areas, 183 (14%) in medium urban areas, and 847 (62%) in large urban areas. Patient and treatment characteristics were similar regardless of location. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 62% for patients in rural areas, 44% in small urban areas, 53% in medium urban areas, and 60% in large urban areas (p = .018). In multivariate analysis, there was no difference in OS between rural and large urban area patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.7-1.4), although patients in small urban areas (HR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0-2.0) and medium urban areas (HR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0-1.9) had worse OS than those in large urban areas.

As reported here, we show that exhaustion is a major mechanism by which TGF-beta inhibits Tm cells, and TGF-beta mediated exhaustion is associated with upregulation of CD70. We found that TGF-beta upregulates CD70 expression on effector Tm cells while it preferentially induces Foxp3 expression in naive T cells. CD70 induction by TGF-beta is Smad3-dependent and involves IL-2/Stat5 signaling. CD70+ T cells account for TGF-beta-induced exhaustion of effector Tm cells. Both TGF-beta-induced and preexisting intratumoral CD70+ effector Tm cells from B-cell NHL have an exhausted phenotype and express higher levels of PD-1 and TIM-3 compared with CD70- T cells. Signaling transduction, proliferation and cytokine production are profoundly decreased in these cells, and they are highly susceptible to apoptosis. Clinically, intratumoral CD70-expressing T cells are prevalent in follicular B-cell lymphoma (FL) biopsy specimens, and increased numbers of intratumoral CD70+ T cells correlate with an inferior patient outcome. These findings confirm TGF-beta-mediated effector Tm cell exhaustion as an important mechanism of immune suppression in B-cell NHL.",,20140226,,,PMC4145058,"['P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS574897'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report a mechanism for the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2)-dependent regulation of PTEN phosphatase activity via the dephosphorylation of PTEN at the Ser380, Thr382 and Thr383 cluster within the C-terminal tail. We show that NDRG2 is a PTEN-binding protein that recruits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to PTEN. The expression of NDRG2 is frequently downregulated in ATLL, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of PTEN at the Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 cluster and enhanced activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Given the high incidence of T-cell lymphoma and other cancers in NDRG2-deficient mice, PI3K-AKT activation via enhanced PTEN phosphorylation may be critical for the development of cancer.",,20140226,,,PMC3948061,,,,['GEO/GSE43017'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A hallmark of differentiation is a pronounced change in cell shape, which is determined by dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Here we show that regulation of the transcriptional coactivator MKL1 (megakaryoblastic leukemia 1) by actin cytoskeleton dynamics drives adipocyte differentiation mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a master transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis. Induction of adipocyte differentiation results in disruption of actin stress fibres through downregulation of RhoA-ROCK signalling. The consequent rapid increase in monomeric G-actin leads to the interaction of G-actin with MKL1, which prevents nuclear translocation of MKL1 and allows expression of PPARgamma followed by adipogenic differentiation.

As a consequence, significant effort is being invested in the development of AKR1C3-selective inhibitors. METHODS: We report the screening of an in-house drug library to identify known drugs that selectively inhibit AKR1C3 over the closely related isoforms AKR1C1, 1C2 and 1C4. This screen initially identified tetracycline as a potential AKR1C3-selective inhibitor. However, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance studies identified that the active agent was a novel breakdown product (4-methyl(de-dimethylamine)-tetracycline (4-MDDT)). RESULTS: We demonstrate that, although 4-MDDT enters AML cells and inhibits their AKR1C3 activity, it does not recapitulate the anti-leukaemic actions of the pan-AKR1C inhibitor medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Screens of the NCI diversity set and an independently curated small-molecule library identified several additional AKR1C3-selective inhibitors, none of which had the expected anti-leukaemic activity. However, a pan AKR1C, also identified in the NCI diversity set faithfully recapitulated the actions of MPA. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we have identified a novel tetracycline-derived product that provides an excellent lead structure with proven drug-like qualities for the development of AKR1C3 inhibitors. However, our findings suggest that, at least in leukaemia, selective inhibition of AKR1C3 is insufficient to elicit an anticancer effect and that multiple AKR1C inhibition may be required.",,20140225,,,PMC3960632,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RAS proteins are difficult to target pharmacologically; therefore, targeting the downstream PI3K and RAF/MEK/ERK pathways represents a promising approach to treat RAS-addicted tumors. The p110alpha isoform of PI3K (encoded by Pik3ca) is an essential effector of oncogenic KRAS in murine lung tumors, but it is unknown whether p110alpha contributes to leukemia. To specifically examine the role of p110alpha in murine hematopoiesis and in leukemia, we conditionally deleted p110alpha in HSCs using the Cre-loxP system. Postnatal deletion of p110alpha resulted in mild anemia without affecting HSC self-renewal; however, deletion of p110alpha in mice with KRASG12D-associated JMML markedly delayed their death. Furthermore, the p110alpha-selective inhibitor BYL719 inhibited growth factor-independent KRASG12D BM colony formation and sensitized cells to a low dose of the MEK inhibitor MEK162. Furthermore, combined inhibition of p110alpha and MEK effectively reduced proliferation of RAS-mutated AML cell lines and disease in an AML murine xenograft model. Together, our data indicate that RAS-mutated myeloid leukemias are dependent on the PI3K isoform p110alpha, and combined pharmacologic inhibition of p110alpha and MEK could be an effective therapeutic strategy for JMML and AML.",,20140224,,,PMC3973083,"['K08 CA149208/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometric method for quantifying 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidine (5hmdC), 5-methyldeoxycytidine (5mdC), and deoxyguanosine (dG) levels using stable isotope labeled internal standards, and used this method to estimate the global level of 2 modified cytosines in genomic DNA prepared from small number of cells. The quantification limits for 5hmdC, 5mdC and dG were 20pM, 2nM and 10nM, respectively. MRM transitions for isotopologue (isotopologue-MRM) were used to quantify the 5mdC and dG levels because of the abundance of these nucleosides relative to 5hmdC. The use of isotopologue-MRM for the abundant nucleosides could also avoid the saturation of the detector, and allow for all three nucleosides to be analyzed simultaneously without the need for the dilution and re-injection of samples into the instrument. The global ratios of modified cytosine nucleosides to dG were estimated following the quantification of each nucleoside in the hydrolysate of genomic DNA. The limit of estimation for the global 5hmC level was less than 0.001% using 200ng of DNA. Using this method, we found that MLL-TET1, which a fusion protein in acute myelogenous leukemia, did not produce 5hmC, but interfered with TET1 activity to produce 5hmC in cells.

METHODS: Ninety-one children with ALL were divided into treatment (n=47) and control groups (n=44) by a randomized double-blind method. During remission induction chemotherapy, the treatment group was given Huangqi injection (0.5 mL/kg.d) for 35 days, while an equal volume of normal saline was used instead in the control group; the other supportive care was the same for the two groups. After remission induction chemotherapy, the incidence of infection, duration of infection, white blood cell and neutrophil counts, site of infection, and positive rate of pathogenic bacteria in secretion were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Four cases in the treatment group dropped out of the study due to allergic reaction. After remission induction chemotherapy, compared with the control group, the treatment group had a significantly lower incidence of infection (P<0.05), a shorter duration of infection at any site (P<0.05), a higher neutrophil count after chemotherapy (P<0.05), and lower incidence rates of respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, blood infection, and skin and soft tissue infections (P<0.05). Gram-negative bacteria were the main pathogens. Among the infected children, the positive rate of pathogenic bacteria in secretion was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (P<0.05).

These children were randomly divided into treatment group (18 low-risk cases, 7 medium-risk cases, and 24 high-risk cases) and control group (21 low-risk cases, 7 medium-risk cases, 28 high-risk cases). Both groups were given remission induction therapy based on the levels of risk. Throughout the remission induction therapy, the treatment group also received Huangqi injection (0.5-1.0 mL/kg per day) by intravenous infusion, while the control group was given 0.9% sodium chloride injection instead. The two groups were compared in terms of distribution of prognostic factors and complete remission (CR) rate after remission induction therapy, as well as the incidence of minimal residual disease (MDR) (>/= 10(-4) and < 10(-4)) among all patients in the two groups on day 19 of remission induction therapy and among B-ALL patients in the two groups when achieving a CR at the end of remission induction therapy. RESULTS: Of the 105 children with ALL, 99 had B-ALL, and 6 had T-ALL. There were no significant differences in the distribution of prognostic factors between the two groups (P>0.05). The overall CR rate of 105 patients was 79%; there was no significant difference in CR rate between the treatment and control groups (82% vs 77%; P>0.05); also, no significant differences were found between the two groups in the CR rates among high-, medium-, and low-risk cases (P>0.05). On day 19 of remission induction therapy, the incidence of MRD>/=10(-4) in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group (69% vs 95%; P<0.05); among 80 children with B-ALL who achieved a CR (43 cases in the control group and 37 cases in the treatment group), the incidence of MRD>/=10-4 was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (27% vs 58%; P<0.05); in both circumstances above, the high- and low-risk cases in the treatment group had a significantly lower incidence of MRD>/=10(-4) than the control group (P<0.05).

METHODS: K562 cells were divided into blank control, negative control, and RNA interference (RNAi) group. For the RNAi group, the pGPHI-GFP-Neo-Apollon eukaryotic expression vector based on the best Apollon siRNA fragments screened out in previous experiments was constructed; the blank control group received no treatment, and the negative control group was transfected with negative plasmid vector. The mRNA and protein expression of Apollon was measured by RT-PCR and cell immunofluorescence, respectively. Additionally, TMP (320 mug/mL) was applied to set TMP, TMP+negative control, and TMP+RNAi groups. The cell viability and apoptosis rate were determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: The constructed vector was stably expressed in K562 cells. The RNAi group had significantly lower mRNA and protein expression of Apollon than the blank control group and negative control (P<0.05).

RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR were used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of expression of EVI1. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used for determining the immunophenotypes of bone marrow cells. Multiparameter FCM was used for monitoring minimal residual disease. The karyotypes were determined. RESULTS: Of 241 children with AML, 33 (13.7%) were positive for EVI1 expression. There were no significant differences in age at first visit as well as the white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count in peripheral blood between EVI1-positive and EVI1-negative children with AML (P>0.05), but EVI1-positive children had a significantly increased proportion of females compared with EVI1-negative children (P<0.05). The change in EVI1 expression was not synchronous with clinical remission and the change of MRD: some children had clinical remission or negative conversion of MRD before negative conversion of EVI1, while some had negative conversion of EVI1 before clinical remission or while MRD showed positive. EVI1 gene was usually co-expressed with other fusion genes. CD33 (100%), CD38 (88%), and HLADR (76%) were highly expressed in EVI1-positive children with AML. Abnormal chromosome structure or number was found in 15 patients.

Infection with HIV not only weakens the immune system leading to AIDS and increasing the risk of opportunistic infections, but also increases the risk of several types of cancer. The enormous biodiversity of marine habitats is mirrored by the molecular diversity of secondary metabolites found in marine animals, plants and microbes which is why this work was designed to assess the anti-HIV and cytotoxic activities of some marine organisms of the Red Sea. METHODS: The lipophilic fractions of methanolic extracts of thirteen marine organisms collected from the Red Sea (Egypt) were screened for cytotoxicity against two human cancer cell lines; leukaemia (U937) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) were used as normal non-malignant control cells. The extracts were also tested for their inhibitory activity against HIV-1 enzymes, reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR). RESULTS: Cytotoxicity results showed strong activity of the Cnidarian Litophyton arboreum against U-937 (IC50; 6.5 mug/ml +/-2.3) with a selectivity index (SI) of 6.45, while the Cnidarian Sarcophyton trochliophorum showed strong activity against HeLa cells (IC50; 5.2 mug/ml +/-1.2) with an SI of 2.09. Other species showed moderate to weak cytotoxicity against both cell lines. Two extracts showed potent inhibitory activity against HIV-1 protease; these were the Cnidarian jelly fish Cassiopia andromeda (IC50; 0.84 mug/ml +/-0.05) and the red algae Galaxura filamentosa (2.6 mug/ml +/-1.29). It is interesting to note that the most active extracts against HIV-1 PR, C. andromeda and G. filamentosa showed no cytotoxicity in the three cell lines at the highest concentration tested (100 mug/ml). CONCLUSION: The strong cytotoxicity of the soft corals L. arboreum and S. trochliophorum as well as the anti-PR activity of the jelly fish C. andromeda and the red algae G. filamentosa suggests the medicinal potential of crude extracts of these marine organisms.",,20140225,,,PMC3939812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to examine association of childhood leukemia with maternal factors especially during pregnancy, to help in avoiding risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study included children younger than 18 years diagnosed with leukemia from 2008 to 2012. Controls were randomly selected and individually matched to cases with respect to age, sex, and residency. All variables were compared between cases and control to determine any significant association with leukemia. RESULTS: Statistically significant associations between risk of childhood leukemia with mother's education (p=0.001), occupation (p=0.0005) and pesticides exposure (p=0.005) during pregnancy were found. However, there were no significant links with maternal age (p=0.090), history of fetal loss (0.85), history of radiography during pregnancy (p=0.400), history of drug intake (p=0.689) and infection (p=0.696) during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed increased risk of leukemia in children whose mothers were working in agriculture and were exposed to pesticides during pregnancy.

Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), a death-inhibiting protein that regulates apoptosis, has been shown to be overexpressed in numerous malignancies. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the expression level of the Mcl-1 gene increases at the time of leukemic relapse following chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to target Mcl-1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) and analyze its effects on survival and chemosensitivity of acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. MATERIALS AND METHODS: siRNA transfection was performed with a liposome approach. The expression levels of mRNA and protein were measured by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Trypan blue assays were performed to evaluate tumor cell growth after siRNA transfection. The cytotoxic effects of Mcl-1 siRNA (siMcl-1) and etoposide were determined using MTT assay on their own and in combination. Apoptosis was quantified using a DNA-histone ELISA assay. RESULTS: Transfection with siMcl-1 significantly suppressed the expression of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein in a time- dependent manner, resulting in strong growth inhibition and spontaneous apoptosis. Surprisingly, pretreatment with siMcl-1 synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effect of etoposide. Furthermore, Mcl-1 down-regulation significantly increased apoptosis sensitivity to etoposide. No significant biological effects were observed with negative control siRNA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that specific suppression of Mcl-1 by siRNA can effectively induce apoptosis and overcome chemoresistance of leukemic cells. Therefore, siMcl-1 may be a potent adjuvant in leukemia chemotherapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the effect of age on the radiation response of these cells. In this study, we examined the radiation response of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in infant (1-week-old), juvenile (3-week-old), and adult (8- and 14-week-old) C3H/He mice, which are susceptible to radiation-induced myeloid leukemia. We first observed an age-dependent increase in the radioresistance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells after in vivo irradiation. However, in vitro irradiation of progenitor cells did not show any age differences, suggesting that radiation sensitivity in vivo is dependent on the bone marrow microenvironment rather than to intrinsic properties of progenitors themselves. Expression profiles of bone marrow tissues identified chemokine and cytokine family genes, whose expression differed between infant and adult tissues at time points before and after irradiation. Among the selected thirteen cytokines reported to be radioprotective, we observed increased expression of Csf1, Csf2, Cxcl12, Fgf1, Fgf7, Il1a, Il1b and Kitl after irradiation, mostly in adult tissues. Specifically, Csf2, Fgf1 and Il1b expression, as revealed by qPCR, were significantly enhanced in adult bone marrow tissue after irradiation, but were unresponsive to irradiation in infant tissue. These results suggest that the higher susceptibility of infant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to the cell killing effect of ionizing radiation may be attributed to a failure to induce a subset of radioprotective cytokines in the immature bone marrow microenvironment.",,20140225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The European project p-medicine is currently building an innovative ICT infrastructure to meet this need. This platform provides tools and services for conducting research and clinical trials in personalised medicine. In this paper, we describe one of its main components, the biobank access framework p-BioSPRE (p-medicine Biospecimen Search and Project Request Engine). This generic framework enables and simplifies access to existing biobanks, but also to offer own biomaterial collections to research communities, and to manage biobank specimens and related clinical data over the ObTiMA Trial Biomaterial Manager. p-BioSPRE takes into consideration all relevant ethical and legal standards, e.g., safeguarding donors' personal rights and enabling biobanks to keep control over the donated material and related data. The framework thus enables secure sharing of biomaterial within open and closed research communities, while flexibly integrating related clinical and omics data.

Deoxycytidine (dC) triphosphate (dCTP) can be produced both by the de novo pathway (DNP) and by the nucleoside salvage pathway (NSP). However, the role of the NSP in dCTP production and DNA synthesis in cancer cells is currently not well understood. We show that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells avoid lethal replication stress after thymidine (dT)-induced inhibition of DNP dCTP synthesis by switching to NSP-mediated dCTP production. The metabolic switch in dCTP production triggered by DNP inhibition is accompanied by NSP up-regulation and can be prevented using DI-39, a new high-affinity small-molecule inhibitor of the NSP rate-limiting enzyme dC kinase (dCK). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was useful for following both the duration and degree of dCK inhibition by DI-39 treatment in vivo, thus providing a companion pharmacodynamic biomarker. Pharmacological co-targeting of the DNP with dT and the NSP with DI-39 was efficacious against ALL models in mice, without detectable host toxicity.

Recent studies have shown that fine-tuning of the activity of mTOR complexes contributes to organogenesis and tumorigenesis. Although rapamycin, an allosteric mTOR inhibitor, is an effective immunosuppressant, the precise roles of mTOR complexes in early T-cell development remain unclear. Here we show that mTORC1 plays a critical role in the development of both early T-cell progenitors and leukemia. Deletion of Raptor, an essential component of mTORC1, produced defects in the earliest development of T-cell progenitors in vivo and in vitro. Deficiency of Raptor resulted in cell cycle abnormalities in early T-cell progenitors that were associated with instability of the Cyclin D2/D3-CDK6 complexes; deficiency of Rictor, an mTORC2 component, did not have the same effect, indicating that mTORC1 and -2 control T-cell development in different ways. In a model of myeloproliferative neoplasm and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) evoked by Kras activation, Raptor deficiency dramatically inhibited the cell cycle in oncogenic Kras-expressing T-cell progenitors, but not myeloid progenitors, and specifically prevented the development of T-ALL. Although rapamycin treatment significantly prolonged the survival of recipient mice bearing T-ALL cells, rapamycin-insensitive leukemia cells continued to propagate in vivo. In contrast, Raptor deficiency in the T-ALL model resulted in cell cycle arrest and efficient eradication of leukemia. Thus, understanding the cell-context-dependent role of mTORC1 illustrates the potential importance of mTOR signals as therapeutic targets.",,20140224,,,PMC3956177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the great progress made in terms of molecular therapies for CML, there remain large gaps in our understanding. By comparing mathematical models that describe CML progression and etiology we sought to identify those models that provide the best description of disease dynamics and their underlying mechanisms. Data for two clinical outcomes--disease remission or relapse--are considered, and we investigate these using Bayesian inference techniques throughout. We find that it is not possible to choose between the models based on fits to the data alone; however, by studying model predictions we can discard models that fail to take niche effects into account. More detailed analysis of the remaining models reveals mechanistic differences: for one model, leukemia stem cell dynamics determine the disease outcome; and for the other model disease progression is determined at the stage of progenitor cells, in particular by differences in progenitor death rates. This analysis also reveals distinct transient dynamics that will be experimentally accessible, but are currently at the limits of what is possible to measure. To resolve these differences we need to be able to probe the hematopoietic stem cell niche directly. Our analysis highlights the importance of further mapping of the bone marrow hematopoietic niche microenvironment as the ""ecological"" interactions between cells in this niche appear to be intricately linked to disease outcome.",,20140224,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer progression', 'competition', 'model selection', 'niche dynamics']",PMC3956166,"['G1002092/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose rates from inhalation of resuspended radiocesium were lower than 0.001 mSv/y. In 2012, the average annual doses from radiocesium were close to the average background radiation exposure (2 mSv/y) in Japan. Accounting only for the physical decay of radiocesium, mean annual dose rates in 2022 were estimated as 0.31, 0.87, and 0.53 mSv/y in Kawauchi, Tamano, and Haramachi, respectively. The simple and conservative estimates are comparable with variations in the background dose, and unlikely to exceed the ordinary permissible dose rate (1 mSv/y) for the majority of the Fukushima population. Health risk assessment indicates that post-2012 doses will increase lifetime solid cancer, leukemia, and breast cancer incidences by 1.06%, 0.03% and 0.28% respectively, in Tamano.

Selective targeting of these genetically altered tyrosine kinases has resulted in significant clinical advances, including increased patient survival. This indicates that altered protein tyrosine kinases are the main drivers of many different cancers. However, lost during analyses of genetic lesions are the contributions of activated, wild-type kinases on tumor-dependent pathways. New approaches in phosphoproteomic technologies have identified several wild-type tyrosine kinase activation states, suggesting that non-genetically altered kinases can be essential ""nodes"" for signal transduction.

Abnormal miRNA expression is known to occur in many cancers, including in malignant lymphomas (MLs). Detailed genome-wide miRNA expression analysis has been performed in various ML subtypes, and these analyses have led to the discovery of subtype-specific miRNA alterations. Actually, in B-cell lymphomas, several miRNAs have been used as prognostic markers, and their targets are for new agents for ML therapy. Successful studies for delineating miRNA functions in B-cell lymphomas lead us to hypothesize that miRNA dysregulation may also be deeply associated with the pathogenesis of T-cell lymphomas. Indeed, studies for delineating essential miRNAs have been conduced against comparatively well-defined T-cell lymphoma entities.

The total number of transplant procedures rose from 109 in the first decade (1973-82) to 939 in the last decade (2003-12). Transplant characteristics changed significantly over time: patient age increased, peripheral blood largely replaced bone marrow as stem cell source, unrelated donors became an alternative to matched siblings, and patients are increasingly transplanted in more advanced disease stages. Advances such as improved supportive care and histocompatibility typing resulted in a steady decrease of transplant-related mortality after allogeneic HSCT (43% in the first decade, 22% in the last decade). Despite this, unadjusted survival rates were stable in the last three decades for allogeneic HSCT (approximately 50% 5-year survival) and in the last two decades for autologous HSCT (approximately 60% 5-year survival). After adjustment for covariates such as donor type, age and stage, the relative risk of treatment failure continuously dropped (for allogeneic HSCT: first decade 1.0, second decade 0.58, third decade 0.51, last decade 0.41). Collectively, these data suggest that improvements in peri- and post-transplant care have allowed considerable extension of transplant indications without having a negative impact on outcome.",,20140224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major drawback of HDACi is the broad inhibition of the plethora of HDAC-containing complexes. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), repression by the PML-RARalpha oncofusion protein is mediated by an HDAC-containing complex that can be dissociated by pharmacologic doses of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) inducing differentiation and cell death at the expense of side effects and recurrence. We hypothesized that the context-specific close physical proximity of a retinoid and HDACi-binding protein in the repressive PML-RARalpha-HDAC complex may permit selective targeting by a hybrid molecule of ATRA with a 2-aminoanilide tail of the HDAC inhibitor MS-275, yielding MC2392. We show that MC2392 elicits weak ATRA and essentially no HDACi activity in vitro or in vivo. Genome-wide epigenetic analyses revealed that in NB4 cells expressing PML-RARalpha, MC2392 induces changes in H3 acetylation at a small subset of PML-RARalpha-binding sites. RNA-seq reveals that MC2392 alters expression of a number of stress-responsive and apoptotic genes. Concordantly, MC2392 induced rapid and massive, caspase-8-dependent cell death accompanied by RIP1 induction and ROS production. Solid and leukemic tumors are not affected by MC2392, but expression of PML-RARalpha conveys efficient MC2392-induced cell death. Our data suggest a model in which MC2392 binds to the RARalpha moiety and selectively inhibits the HDACs resident in the repressive complex responsible for the transcriptional impairment in APLs. Our findings provide proof-of-principle of the concept of a context-dependent targeted therapy.",['(c)2014 AACR.'],20140224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To describe morbidity and mortality rates for cancer in Argentinean children and adolescents younger than 15 years old in the 2006-2008 three year period. Method. Specific mortality rates and incidence rates per million inhabitants were analyzed in children and adolescents younger than 15 years old by type of tumor and gender. Vital statistics data were used based on the databases provided by the Statistics and Health Information Department of the Ministry of Health of Argentina and the population of 0-14 year old children estimated by the National Statistics and Censuses Institute of Argentina (Instituto Nacional de Estadisticas y Censos, INDEC). In relation to morbidity data, the information published by the Argentine Hospital Oncopediatric Registry (Registro Oncopediatrico Hospitalario Argentino, ROHA) was used. RESULTS: Mortality rate from malignancies was 43.8 per million (3.5% of total deaths in this age group) and the incidence rate was 123.7 per million. Leukemia had the highest specific mortality rate (14.9 per million), followed by tumors in the central nervous system (12.7 per million). The highest incidence rates were also registered for these tumors (45.2 and 15.5 per million, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality from malignancies accounted for 3.5% of deaths in children and adolescents younger than 15 years old in Argentina. Leukemia and tumors in the central nervous system had the highest specific mortality and incidence rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms of HBV reactivation following chemotherapy remain unclear. Epirubicin is an anthracycline drug used in chemotherapy to treat numerous types of malignancy, including breast cancer, acute leukemia, malignant lymphoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and stomach cancer. Epirubicin acts by intercalating DNA strands and inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis. In this study, it was demonstrated that epirubicin directly upregulated the levels of in vitro HBV replication in a concentration-dependent manner. Exposure to epirubicin for 24 h induced >11- and 6-fold increases in the levels of intracellular and secreted HBV DNA, respectively. In concordance with the elevated levels of HBV DNA, the expression levels of HBV pregenomic RNA, intracellular HBV surface and HBV core antigens, and secreted HBV e antigen were significantly increased by treatment with 0.5 microM epirubicin. Notably, epirubicin promoted cellular excretion of HBV nucleocapsids, which are closely associated with the pathological effects of HBV, including acute liver failure. In conclusion, epirubicin exhibited a direct stimulatory effect on HBV replication and this may be a novel mechanism of HBV reactivation following cytotoxic anticancer chemotherapy.",,20140220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrated that evodiamine, a quinolone alkaloid isolated from the fruit of Evodia fructus, induced apoptosis and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we found that evodiamine significantly reduced the protein levels of Mcl-1 in 253J and T24 bladder cancer cells, and overexpression of this molecule attenuated the apoptosis induced by evodiamine alone, or in combination with TRAIL. Further experiments revealed that evodiamine did not affect the mRNA level, proteasomal degradation and protein stability of Mcl-1. On the other hand, evodiamine inhibited the mTOR/S6K1 pathway, which usually regulates protein translation; moreover, knockdown of S6K1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively reduced Mcl-1 levels, indicating evodiamine downregulates c-FLIP through inhibition of mTOR/S6K1 pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that evodiamine induces apoptosis and enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis possibly through mTOR/S6K1-mediated downregulation of Mcl-1; furthermore, these findings provide a rationale for the combined application of evodiamine with TRAIL in the treatment of bladder cancer.",,20140221,,,PMC3958903,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, some authors have proposed prognostic models, scoring systems involving a set of clinical and biological risk factors and estimates of individual patient survivals. Here, we report our initial results from a study designed to evaluate the statistical association of the distinct clinical and biological parameters with the prognosis and time to initiating treatment for patients with CLL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study incorporated 100 consecutive, treatment naive CLL patients. In each patient all traditional laboratory, clinical and biological prognostic factors were evaluated at their first visit to our Institution. We then combined the following independent characteristics: age, beta-2 microglobulin, absolute lymphocyte count, sex, Rai stage, and number of involved lymph node groups, which are included in some of the already published CLL prognostics index, in association with the CD38 expression and mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene variable region (IGVH). Further, we correlated those factors by multivariable analysis with time to first treatment. This multivariable model was used to develop a nomogram-a weighted tool to calculate 5- and 10-year survival probability and estimate median time to first treatment (TFT). RESULTS: According to the prognostic index, a classification tree was built that identified three subsets of patients whose scores were 1-3 (low risk - 32 pts - 32%), 4-7 (intermediate risk - 48 pts - 48%) and > 8 (high risk - 20 pts - 20%). Estimated median survival in the low risk subset of patients is 141 years, and 10.7 and 4.6 years respectively in the intermediate and high risk subsets of patients. Projected survival in respectively low, intermediate and high-risk groups are 100%, 100%, 25%, and 43%, 34%, 25% at 5 years and 10 years, respectively. Also, statistical analyses showed that among other things CD38 expression and unmutated IGHV mutation status are associated with a shorter time to first treatment. CONCLUSION: Our prognostic model that combines and correlates the distinct clinical and biological markers of CLL patients enables identification of patients who are at high risk of progression. This prognostic model may facilitate the clinical decision for initiating treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we retrospectively analyzed data for patients who had received allo-SCT for ATL in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan, to determine prognostic factors. Fifty-six patients with a median age of 57 years received allo-SCT. Twenty-eight (50.0%) patients had acute type and 22 (46.4%) had lymphoma type. Twenty-three (41.1%) patients received allo-SCT in complete remission (CR), whereas the others were in non-CR. Seventeen (30.4%) patients received myeloablative conditioning and the others received reduced-intensity conditioning. With a median follow-up period of 48 months (range, 17 to 134 months), 1-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year OS rates were 55.4% and 46.1%, respectively. The survival curve reached a plateau at 22 months after stem cell transplantation (SCT). Male sex, high level of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) at SCT, and non-CR at SCT were determined to be significant risk factors for OS. A high level of sIL-2R at SCT was a risk factor for poor OS in patients with non-CR at SCT by univariate analysis (P = .02), and it remained significant after adjustment by sex (hazard ratio, 2.73 [95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 7.90]). A high level of sIL-2R at SCT was also determined to be a risk factor for disease progression (P = .02). This region-wide study showed encouraging results for survival after allo-SCT for ATL and demonstrated for the first time that a high level of sIL-2R at SCT predicts worse SCT outcome.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2014 Feb 22.,,"INTRODUCTION: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been associated with an excess of minor phenotypic variants (MPV), including common variants and minor anomalies, indicative of an altered phenogenesis. The objective of the study was to determine the association between MPV and ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a hospital based case-control study, we studied 120 children with ALL (including standard and high risk) and 120 healthy children as a control group, matched for age and sex, seen in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Dr. Juan I. Menchaca (Guadalajara, Mexico). In both groups, 28 anthropometric measurements were made, as well as a systematic search for 405 MPV, through a physical examination. Adjusted odds ratio was estimated (aOR) with its intervening variables by logistic regression. The confidence interval was 95% (95%CI). RESULTS: Anthropometric signs associated with ALL were: long upper segment (aOR= 2.19, 95%CI: 1.01-4.76), broad jaw (aOR= 2.62, 95%CI: 1.29-5.30), narrow ears (aOR= 6.22, 95%CI: 2.60-14.85), and increase in internipple distance (aOR= 2.53, 95%CI: 1.07-5.98). The hypoplasia mesofacial, broad forehead, small nose, short columella, narrow ears, telethelia, Sydney crease (SC), Greek type feet and cafe-au-lait spots (CALS), had a 3 to 17 times higher frequency in children with ALL. By number, an association was found from >/=4 MPV (aOR= 2.14, 95%CI: 1.25-3.66, P=.004). CONCLUSIONS: From >/=4 MPV, an association was found with ALL, suggesting prenatal factors in phenogenesis and leukemogenesis. CALS and SC were confirmed as MPV in children with ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Asociacion Espanola de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier', 'Espana, S.L.U.

Recently theses mutations were demonstrated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). So far, assessment of these mutations relied on the DNA sequencing technique. AIM OF THE WORK: The aim of this study was to detect somatic mutations in IDH1 gene using mismatched primers suitable for endonuclease based detection, without the need for DNA sequencing, and to estimate its prognostic value, on patients with de novo AML. METHODS: Residual DNA extracted from pretreatment bone marrow (BM) samples of 100 patients with de novo AML was used. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP) was adapted to IDH1gene, codon 132 mutations screening. RESULTS: The frequency of IDH1 mutations was 13%. In the non-acute promyelocytic leukemia group (non-APL), IDH1 mutations were significantly associated with FLT3-ITD negative patients (p=0.03). Patients with IDH1 mutations did not achieve complete remission (CR). There was a trend for shorter overall survival (OS) in patients with IDH1 mutation compared to those with wild type (p=0.08). CONCLUSION: IDH1 mutations are recurring genetic alterations in AML and they may have unfavorable impact on clinical outcome in adult AML. The PCR-RFLP method allows for a fast, inexpensive, and sensitive method for the detection of IDH1 mutations in AML.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

Aberrant lymphocytes and smudge cells were enumerated and correlated with CLL immunophenotype, chromosomal aberrations and prognostic parameters. Herein, we show that the percentages of aberrant and smudge cells was highly variable between patients and did not correlate with each other. Increased aberrant lymphocytes and fewer smudge cells were associated with an atypical immunophenotype including low expression of CD23, higher levels of FMC7 and bright surface levels of CD20. High fraction of aberrant lymphocytes also was associated with trisomy 12. These cells were predominantly of small/medium size, sometimes with cleft nuclei. No correlation was noted between aberrant or smudge cells and clinical stage, CD38, ZA70 or time to first treatment.

Alemtuzumab has been used for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and various autoimmune disorders, and has also shown potential as an induction agent in the prevention of rejection following solid organ transplantation. Alemtuzumab has been studied in randomised controlled trials and has demonstrated low levels of rejection in renal transplant recipients compared with other induction agents, albeit mainly in the early months following transplantation. Studies have shown that alemtuzumab enables the use of lower calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) maintenance drugs; however, this reduction in nephrotoxic immunosuppression has not consistently been matched by an improvement in renal function. The hypothesis has been suggested that alemtuzumab might allow the development of immunosuppressive regimens that avoid CNIs completely; studies have investigated the combination of alemtuzumab with mammalian target of rapamycin-inhibitor maintenance therapy, and, in particular, sirolimus. Initial studies with this combination showed that regimens of sirolimus alone and of sirolimus with mycophenolate mofetil were unsuccessful, with a high rate of rejection and complications. Subsequent studies have targeted the combination of alemtuzumab induction with a short course of a CNI, before switching to maintenance therapy with sirolimus. This regimen might combine good protection from acute cellular rejection and chronic nephrotoxicity. A randomised controlled trial has been established to study this regimen, with results pending.",,20131120,,,PMC3834526,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These consisted of a spectrum of T-cell neoplasms in combination with different B-cell lymphomas/leukemias, with peripheral T-cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma encountered most frequently for each respective neoplastic lineage. Histopathologic evaluation demonstrated 6 patterns of neoplastic distribution, including zone, inverted zone, diffuse mixed, regional/nodular mixed, compartmental, and segmental distributions. Four of 9 cases studied were positive for Epstein-Barr virus, all with a mixed pattern, suggesting that this pattern may predict an Epstein-Barr virus association. None of 14 cases was considered CL at the initial histologic evaluation. Only 6 (46.2%) of 13 cases had coexisting B-cell/T-cell neoplasms highlighted by immunohistochemistry, and the other 7 (53.8%) cases had 1 or both of the neoplastic components hidden. Flow cytometry detected both neoplastic lineages in 4 (44%) but failed to detect a clonal B-cell population in 4 (44%) and missed neoplastic T cells in 1 (11.1%) of 9 cases. Molecular testing detected clonal rearrangement of IGH/K gene in 11 (84.6%) of 13 cases, and clonal rearrangement of the TCRG/B gene in 13 (92.9%) of 14 cases, including 8 with identical amplicons detected in separate samples.

However, the common origin of these two specialized cell types raised the question about the identification of regulatory pathways determining the differentiation fate of MSCs into chondrocyte or osteoblast. METHODS: Chondrogenesis, osteoblastogenesis, and adipogenesis of human and mouse MSC were induced by using specific inductive culture conditions. Expression of promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) or differentiation markers in MSCs was determined by RT-qPCR. PLZF-expressing MSC were implanted in a mouse osteochondral defect model and the neotissue was analyzed by routine histology and microcomputed tomography. RESULTS: We found out that PLZF is not expressed in MSCs and its expression at early stages of MSC differentiation is the mark of their commitment toward the three main lineages. PLZF acts as an upstream regulator of both Sox9 and Runx2, and its overexpression in MSC enhances chondrogenesis and osteogenesis while it inhibits adipogenesis. In vivo, implantation of PLZF-expressing MSC in mice with full-thickness osteochondral defects resulted in the formation of a reparative tissue resembling cartilage and bone. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that absence of PLZF is required for stemness maintenance and its expression is an early event at the onset of MSC commitment during the differentiation processes of the three main lineages.",,20140224,,,PMC4055047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Replacement of two positively charged residues (K139 and K207) on the surface loops with neutral and reverse charges resulted in altered thermo stability in designed variants. Neutral charge substitutions (K139A and K207A) retained greater tolerance and stability followed by negative charge substitutions (K139D and K207D) compared to control mutant K139R and wild enzyme.

Aberrant activation of WNT signaling has been detected in TNBC, which might be important for triggering oncogenic conversion of breast epithelial cell. Therefore, we directed our focus on identifying the WNT ligand and its underlying mechanism in TNBC cells. METHODS: We performed large-scale analysis of public microarray data to screen the WNT ligands and the clinical significance of the responsible ligand in TNBC. WNT5B was identified and its overexpression in TNBC was confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining, Western blot and ELISA. ShRNA was used to knockdown WNT5B expression (shWNT5B). Cellular functional alteration with shWNT5B treatment was determined by using wound healing assay, mammosphere assay; while cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flowcytometry. Mitochondrial morphology was photographed by electron microscope. Biological change of mitochondria was detected by RT-PCR and oxygen consumption assay. Activation of WNT pathway and its downstream targets were evaluated by liciferase assay, immunohistochemistry staining and immunoblot analysis. Statistical methods used in the experiments besides microarray analysis was two-tailed t-test. RESULTS: WNT5B was elevated both in the tumor and the patients' serum. Suppression of WNT5B remarkably impaired cell growth, migration and mammosphere formation. Additionally, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-independent apoptosis was observed. Study of the possible mechanism indicated that these effects occurred through suppression of mitochondrial biogenesis, as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA) and compromised oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In Vivo and in vitro data uncovered that WNT5B modulated mitochondrial physiology was mediated by MCL1, which was regulated by WNT/beta-catenin responsive gene, Myc. Clinic data analysis revealed that both WNT5B and MCL1 are associated with enhanced metastasis and decreased disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: All our findings suggested that WNT5B/MCL1 cascade is critical for TNBC and understanding its regulatory apparatus provided valuable insight into the pathogenesis of the tumor development and the guidance for targeting therapeutics.",,20140224,,,PMC3936852,['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most current PRMT inhibitors display limited specificity and selectivity, indiscriminately targeting many methyltransferase enzymes that use S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a cofactor. Here we report diamidine compounds for specific inhibition of PRMT1, the primary type I enzyme. Docking, molecular dynamics, and MM/PBSA analysis together with biochemical assays were conducted to understand the binding modes of these inhibitors and the molecular basis of selective inhibition for PRMT1. Our data suggest that 2,5-bis(4-amidinophenyl)furan (1, furamidine, DB75), one leading inhibitor, targets the enzyme active site and is primarily competitive with the substrate and noncompetitive toward the cofactor.

The aim of this case-controlled study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IKZF1, ARID5B, and CEBPE could be related to the onset of EAL cases (<24 months-old at diagnosis). METHODS: The SNPs (IKZF1 rs11978267, ARID5B rs10821936 and rs10994982, CEBPE rs2239633) were genotyped in 265 cases [169 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 96 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)] and 505 controls by Taqman allelic discrimination assay. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between SNPs of cases and controls, adjusted on skin color and/or age. The risk was determined by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Children with the IKZF1 SNP had an increased risk of developing MLL-germline ALL in white children. The heterozygous/mutant genotype in ARID5B rs10994982 significantly increased the risk for MLL-germline leukemia in white and non-white children (OR 2.60, 95% CI: 1.09-6.18 and OR 3.55, 95% CI: 1.57-8.68, respectively). The heterozygous genotype in ARID5B rs10821936 increased the risk for MLL-r leukemia in both white and non-white (OR 2.06, 95% CI: 1.12-3.79 and OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.09-5.10, respectively). Furthermore, ARID5B rs10821936 conferred increased risk for MLL-MLLT3 positive cases (OR 7.10, 95% CI:1.54-32.68). Our data do not show evidence that CEBPE rs2239633 confers increased genetic susceptibility to EAL. CONCLUSIONS: IKZF1 and CEBPE variants seem to play a minor role in genetic susceptibility to EAL, while ARID5B rs10821936 increased the risk of MLL-MLLT3. This result shows that genetic susceptibility could be associated with the differences regarding MLL breakpoints and partner genes.",,20140225,,,PMC3948138,,,,,,['Brazilian Collaborative Study Group of Infant Acute Leukemia'],,,,,,,"['Magalhaes IQ', 'Cordoba JC', 'Lafayette TC', 'Coser VM', 'Dorea MD', 'Araujo FN', 'Burlachini LM', 'Nobrega AG', 'Fialho EC', 'Pimenta FC', 'Mamede GT', 'Salles Tde J', 'Dobbin J', 'Apa A', 'Brandalise S', 'Pinheiro VR', 'de Souza AM', 'Rouxinol S', 'Carvalho EG', 'Silva AM', 'de Andrade Agareno JM', 'Pianovski MA', 'Tormen TH', 'de Brito PC', 'Oliveira LS', 'Costa I', 'Bousfield D', 'de Almeida Wernerck F', 'Cardoso TC', 'de Souza MS', 'Baseggio R', 'Melaragno R', 'Neves G', 'Arancibia AM', 'Cristofani LM', 'Mendes W', 'Costa CM', 'Ramos G', 'Neto JC', 'Lee ML', 'de Brito NP', 'Gurgel RS']","['Magalhaes, Isis Quesado', 'Cordoba, Jose Carlos', 'Lafayette, Theresa Christina', 'Coser, Virginia Maria', 'Dorea, Maria D', 'Araujo, Flavia N Serafim', 'Burlachini, Lilian Maria', 'Nobrega, Andrea Gadelha', 'Fialho, Eloisa C E', 'Pimenta, Flavia Cristina F', 'Mamede, Glaceanne Torres da Luz', 'Salles, Terezinha de Jesus Marques', 'Dobbin, Jane', 'Apa, Alexandre', 'Brandalise, Silvia', 'Pinheiro, Vitoria R', 'de Souza, Adriana Martins', 'Rouxinol, Soraya', 'Carvalho, Eny G', 'Silva, Ana M Marinho da', 'de Andrade Agareno, Jozina M', 'Pianovski, Mara A D', 'Tormen, Tiago Hessel', 'de Brito, Patricia Carneiro', 'Oliveira, Loretta S C', 'Costa, Imarui', 'Bousfield, Denise', 'de Almeida Wernerck, Fernando', 'Cardoso, Teresa Cristina', 'de Souza, Marcelo Santos', 'Baseggio, Rosania', 'Melaragno, Renato', 'Neves, Gustavo', 'Arancibia, Alejandro M', 'Cristofani, Lilian Maria', 'Mendes, Wellington', 'Costa, Cecilia M Lima da', 'Ramos, Gilberto', 'Neto, Joaquim C Aguirre', 'Lee, Maria Lucia Marinho', 'de Brito, Nilma Pimentel', 'Gurgel, Renata S Carvalho']",,,

We show here that DEK represses hTERT transcription through its enrichment on the hTERT promoter in cells from chronic and acute myeloid leukemias, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but not acute lymphocytic leukemias where hTERT is overexpressed. We isolated DEK from the hTERT promoter incubated with nuclear extracts derived from fresh acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells and from cells expressing Tax, an hTERT repressor encoded by the human T cell leukemia virus type 1. In addition to the recruitment of DEK, the displacement of two potent known hTERT transactivators from the hTERT promoter characterized both AML cells and Tax-expressing cells. Reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays permitted to map the region that supports the repressive effect of DEK on hTERT transcription, which was proportionate to the level of DEK-promoter association but not with the level of DEK expression. Besides hTERT repression, this context of chromatin redistribution of DEK was found to govern about 40% of overall transcriptional modifications, including those of cancer-prone genes. In conclusion, DEK emerges as an hTERT repressor shared by various leukemia subtypes and seems involved in the deregulation of numerous genes associated with leukemogenesis.",,,,,PMC3927101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro experiments demonstrated that oxymatrine reduced the proliferation of HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner via the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M and S phases. The proteins involved in oxymatrine-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells were also examined using Western blot. The increase in apoptosis upon treatment with oxymatrine was correlated with downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression and upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax expression. Furthermore, oxymatrine induced the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in HL-60 cells. In addition, pretreatment with a specific caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK) or caspase-9 (Z-LEHD-FMK) inhibitor significantly neutralized the pro-apoptotic activity of oxymatrine in HL-60 cells, demonstrating the important role of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in this process. Taken together, these results indicated that oxymatrine-induced apoptosis may occur through the activation of the caspase-9/caspase-3-mediated intrinsic pathway. Therefore, oxymatrine may be a potential candidate for the treatment of human leukemia.",,20140223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clitocine is a natural amino nucleoside isolated from mushroom and has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation in vitro. In this study, we observed that clitocine can effectively induce drug-resistant human cancer cell apoptosis in vitro and inhibit tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Clitocine treatment inhibited drug-resistant human cancer cell growth in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Biochemical analysis revealed that clitocine-induced tumor growth inhibition is associated with activation of caspases 3, 8 and 9, PARP cleavage, cytochrome c release and Bax, Bak activation, suggesting that clitocine inhibits drug-resistant cancer cell growth through induction of apoptosis. Analysis of apoptosis regulatory genes indicated that Mcl-1 level was dramatically decreased after clitocine treatment. Over-expression of Mcl-1 reversed the activation of Bax and attenuated clitocine-induced apoptosis, suggesting that clitocine-induced apoptosis was at least partially by inducing Mcl-1 degradation to release Bax and Bak. Consistent with induction of apoptosis in vitro, clitocine significantly suppressed the drug-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft growth in vivo by inducing apoptosis as well as inhibiting cell proliferation. Taken together, our data demonstrated that clitocine is a potent Mcl-1 inhibitor that can effectively induce apoptosis to suppress drug-resistant human cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, and thus holds great promise for further development as potentially a novel therapeutic agent to overcome drug resistance in cancer therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2014 Feb 22.,,"Over the past decades, main advances in the field of molecular biology, coupled with benefits in genomic technologies, have led to detailed molecular investigations in the genetic diversity generated by researchers. Short tandem repeat (STR) loci are polymorphic loci found throughout all eukaryotic genome. DNA profiling identification, parental testing and kinship analysis by analysis of STR loci have been widely used in forensic sciences since 1993. Malignant tissues may sometimes be the source of biological material for forensic analysis, including identification of individuals or paternity testing. There are a number of studies on microsatellite instability in different types of tumors by comparing the STR profiles of malignant and healthy tissues on the same individuals. Defects in DNA repair pathways (non-repair or mis-repair) and metabolism lead to an accumulation of microsatellite alterations in genomic DNA of various cancer types that result genomic instabilities on forensic analyses. Common forms of genomic instability are loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI). In this study, the applicability of autosomal STR markers, which are routinely used in forensic analysis, were investigated in order to detect genotypes in blood samples collected from leukemic patients to estimate the reliability of the results when malignant tissues are used as a source of forensic individual identification. Specimens were collected from 90 acute and 10 chronic leukemia volunteers with oral swabs as well as their paired peripheral blood samples from the Oncology Centre of the Department of Hematology at Istanbul University, during the years 2010-2011. Specimens were tested and compared with 16 somatic STR loci (CSFIPO, THO1, TPOX, vWA, D2S1338, D3S1358, D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179, D13S317, D16S539, D18S51, D19S433, D21S11 and FGA) widely used in forensic identification and kinship. Only two STR instabilities were encountered among 100 specimens. An MSI in the FGA loci and a LOH in the D2S1338 loci were determined in two individuals separately. Our results demonstrate that the use of the biological samples from leukemia patients in forensic identification and kinship testing is questionable, especially if known microsatellite instability is available. Genetic instabilities may alter the STR polymorphism, leading to potential errors on forensic identification of individuals. Therefore, typing of autosomal STRs from leukemia patients should be performed with both healthy and malignant tissue samples of individual as references.",,20140222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defining pathways that control LSC self-renewal is crucial for a better understanding of underlying mechanisms and for the development of targeted therapies. However, currently available culture conditions do not prevent spontaneous differentiation of LSCs, which greatly limits the feasibility of cell-based assays. To overcome these constraints we conducted a high-throughput chemical screen and identified small molecules that inhibit differentiation and support LSC activity in vitro. Similar to reports with cord blood stem cells, several of these compounds suppressed the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway, which we show to be inactive in vivo and rapidly activated ex vivo in AML cells. We also identified a compound, UM729, that collaborates with AhR suppressors in preventing AML cell differentiation. Together, these findings provide newly defined culture conditions for improved ex vivo culture of primary human AML cells.",,20140223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2014 Feb 21.,,"AIMS: To investigate whether leukaemia risks are related to occupational exposure to low-frequency magnetic fields. METHODS: Leukaemia risks experienced by 73 051 employees of the former Central Electricity Generating Board of England and Wales were investigated for the period 1973-2010. All employees were hired in the period 1952-82 and were employed for at least 6 months with some employment in the period 1973-82. Detailed calculations had been performed by others to enable an assessment to be made of exposures to magnetic fields. Poisson regression was used to calculate relative risks (rate ratios) of developing leukaemia or leukaemia subtypes for categories of lifetime, distant (lagged) and recent (lugged) exposure. RESULTS: Findings for all leukaemias combined were unexceptional; risks were close to unity for all exposure categories and there was no suggestion of risks increasing with cumulative (or recent or distant) magnetic field exposures. There were no statistically significant dose-response effects shown for acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. There was a significant positive trend for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), but this was based, in the main, on unusually low risks in the lowest exposure category. CONCLUSIONS: This study found no convincing evidence to support the hypothesis that exposure to magnetic fields is a risk factor for leukaemia, and the findings are consistent with the hypotheses that both distant and recent magnetic field exposures are not causally related to the generality of leukaemia. The limited positive findings for ALL may well be chance findings.",,20140221,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphocytic leukaemia', 'cohort study', 'electricity supply industry', 'leukaemia subtypes.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is, however, unknown whether hepatocyte growth factor influences microenvironmental cells, such as nurse-like cells, which deliver survival signals to the leukemic clone. We evaluated the expression of c-MET on nurse-like cells and monocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and searched for phenotypic/functional features supposed to be influenced by the hepatocyte growth factor/c-MET interaction. c-MET is expressed at high levels on nurse-like cells and at significantly higher levels than normal on monocytes from patients. Moreover, the hepatocyte growth factor/c-MET interaction activates STAT3(TYR705) phosphorylation in nurse-like cells. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, an enzyme modulating T-cell proliferation and induced on normal monocytes after hepatocyte growth factor treatment, was detected together with interleukin-10 on nurse-like cells, and on freshly-prepared patients' monocytes. Immunohistochemical/immunostaining analyses demonstrated the presence of c-MET(+) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase(+) cells in lymph node biopsies, co-expressed with CD68 and vimentin. Furthermore nurse-like cells and chronic lymphocytic monocytes significantly inhibited T-cell proliferation, prevented by anti-transforming growth factor beta and interleukin-10 antibodies and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors, and supported CD4(+)CD25(high+)/FOXP3(+) T regulatory cell expansion. We suggest that nurse-like cells display features of immunosuppressive type 2 macrophages: higher hepatocyte growth factor levels, produced by leukemic or other microenvironmental surrounding cells, may cooperate to induce M2 polarization. Hepatocyte growth factor may thus have a dual pathophysiological role: directly through enhancement of survival of the leukemic clone and indirectly by favoring T-cell immunosuppression.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],20140221,,,PMC4040912,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein kinase CK2 is known to phosphorylate PTEN thereby driving PTEN protein stabilization and concomitant PTEN functional inactivation. In agreement, we found that adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples show significantly higher CK2 kinase activity and lower PTEN lipid phosphatase activity than healthy controls. Moreover, the clinical-grade CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 (Silmitasertib) reversed PTEN levels in leukemia cells to those observed in healthy controls, and promoted leukemia cell death without significantly affecting normal bone marrow cells.

To combat these two diseases, it is important that new pharmaceutically active compounds have the ability to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer and Plasmodium falciparum strains. In search of effective anti-cancer and anti-malaria hybrids that possess improved properties compared to their parent compounds, a series of novel 1,2,4-trioxane-based hybrids incorporating egonol and/or ferrocene fragments were synthesized and tested in vitro against P. falciparum strains, CCRF-CEM cells and the multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein-over-expressing CEM/ADR5000 cells. The most active compounds against P. falciparum strains were artesunic acid homodimers 12 and 13 (IC50 of 0.32 and 0.30 nM, respectively), whereas novel hybrids 7 (1,2,4-trioxane-ferrocene-egonol), 9 (1,2,4-trioxane-ferrocene) and 11 (artesunic acid-egonol) showed a remarkable cytotoxicity toward CCRF-CEM cells (IC50 of 0.07, 0.25 and 0.18 muM, respectively). A cooperative and synergistic effect of the three moieties 1,2,4-trioxane, ferrocene and egonol in hybrid molecule 7 is significant and is obviously stronger than in hybrids 9 (1,2,4-trioxane-ferrocene) and 11 (artesunic acid-egonol), which comprises of only two of the three considered parent compounds. Interestingly, hybrid 9 containing a 1,2,4-trioxane and a ferrocene fragment has shown to be the most effective among the studied hybrids against the tested multidrug-resistant leukemia CEM/ADR5000 cells (IC50 of 0.57 muM) and possesses a degree of cross-resistance of 2.34.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

There are anecdotal concerns of reduced efficacy related to generic vs. brand name imatinib. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Generic imatinib product monographs approved by Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) were reviewed. Medical information of Novartis, Teva and Apotex were contacted. RESULTS: Several issues have been raised. First, generic imatinib approved outside Canada and the European Union has been associated with reduced efficacy in small case reports and contradictory findings with two case series. However, the clinical bioequivalence of these generic products has not been clearly established. Secondly, use of generic imatinib in other populations has been questioned. However, imatinib absorption is not significantly different in pediatric chronic myeloid leukemia or patients with gastrointestinal tumours compared to adults with chronic myeloid leukemia. Although reduced absorption was reported after gastric bypass and gastrectomy, imatinib absorption occurs mostly in the ileum, duodenum, colon and jejunum. Change in gastric acidity has also been shown to not affecting imatinib absorption. Finally, beta-crystal form of brand name imatinib is more stable than the alpha-crystal form of generic imatinib at room temperature. However, the EMA found both crystal forms to be highly soluble and polymorphism would not significantly influence the performance of generic imatinib. CONCLUSION: Overall, anecdotal concerns appear to be unfounded for generic imatinib approved in Canada and the EU. There is no evidence that these generic imatinib products are less effective than brand name imatinib.","['(c) The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions:', 'sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.']",20140221,,,,,,,,,,,['J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2016 Apr;22(2):382-4.

Interactions between the histone deacetylase inhibitor Givinostat and the RAF/MEK/ERK inhibitor Sorafenib were examined in HDLM-2 and L-540 HL cell lines. Exposure to Givinostat/Sorafenib induced a synergistic inhibition of cell growth (range, 70-80%) and a marked increase in cell death (up to 96%) due to increased H3 and H4 acetylation and strong mitochondrial injury. Gene expression profiling indicated that the synergistic effects of Givinostat/Sorafenib treatment are associated with the modulation of cell cycle and cell death pathways. Exposure to Givinostat/Sorafenib resulted in sustained production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of necroptotic cell death. The necroptosis inhibitor Necrostatin-1 prevented Givinostat/Sorafenib-induced ROS production, mitochondrial injury, activation of BH3-only protein BIM and cell death. Knockdown experiments identified BIM as a key signaling molecule that mediates Givinostat/Sorafenib-induced oxidative death of HL cells. Furthermore, in vivo xenograft studies demonstrated a 50% reduction in tumor burden (P<0.0001), a 5- to 15-fold increase in BIM expression (P < 0.0001) and a fourfold increase in tumor necrosis in Givinostat/Sorafenib-treated animals compared with mice that received single agents. These results provide a rationale for exploring Givinostat/Sorafenib combination in relapsed/refractory HL.",,20140224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000000331440124'],,,,,

The purpose of the present work was to develop PEGylated nanostructured lipid carrier (PEG-NLC) for intravenous delivery of Am80, with the aim to further extend the circulation in blood and decrease the adverse events. Am80-loaded PEG-NLC (Am80-PEG-NLC) modified with PEG-40 stearate (PEG40-SA, molecular weight 2000 Da) was formulated by the method of melt-emulsification and low temperature-solidification technique. Am80-NLC was developed as well as control.

HOX genes encode proteins and need cofactor interactions, to increase their specificity and selectivity. HOX genes contribute to the organization and regulation of hematopoiesis by controlling the balance between proliferation and differentiation. Changes in HOX gene expression can be associated with chromosomal rearrangements generating fusion genes, such as those involving MLL and NUP98, or molecular defects, such as mutations in NPM1 and CEBPA for example. Several miRNAs are involved in the control of HOX gene expression and their expression correlates with HOX gene dysregulation. HOX genes dysregulation is a dominant mechanism of leukemic transformation.

We postulated that components of TP53-centered tumor suppressor network, miR-34b/c, in addition to DAPK1 and miR-34a might be inactivated by DNA hypermethylation. Moreover, we tested if miR-34b/c methylation might correlate with miR-203 or miR-124-1 methylation in CLL. METHODS: miR-34b/c, miR-34a and DAPK1 methylation was studied in 11 normal controls, 7 CLL cell lines, and 78 diagnostic CLL samples by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. MEC-1 cells were treated with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine for reversal of methylation-associated miRNA silencing. Tumor suppressor properties of miR-34b were demonstrated by over-expression of precursor miR-34b in MEC-1 cells. RESULTS: miR-34b/c promoter was unmethylated in normal controls, but completely methylated in 4 CLL cell lines. miR-34b/c expression was inversely correlated with miR-34b/c methylation. Different MSP statuses of miR-34b/c, including complete methylation and complete unmethylation, were verified by quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment resulted in promoter demethylation and miR-34b re-expression in MEC1 cells. Moreover, over-expression of miR-34b resulted in inhibition of cellular proliferation and increased cell death. In primary CLL samples, miR-34a, miR-34b/c and DAPK1 methylation was detected in 2.6%, 17.9% and 34.6% of patients at diagnosis respectively. Furthermore, 39.7%, 3.8% and 2.6% patients had methylation of one, two or all three genes respectively. Overall, 46.2% patients had methylation of at least one of these three genes. Besides, miR-34b/c methylation was associated with methylation of miR-34a (P = 0.03) and miR-203 (P = 0.012) in CLL. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, miR-34b/c is a tumor suppressor miRNA frequently methylated, and hence silenced in CLL. Together with DAPK1 methylation, miR-34b/c methylation is implicated in the disruption of the TP53-centered tumor suppressor network. Moreover, the association of miRNA methylation warrants further study.",,20140222,,,PMC3941938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated whether upregulation of Nrf2-dependent signaling by oleanolic acid (OA), which is known to activate Nrf2, could attenuate renal inflammation and fibrosis in cyclosporine (CsA)-induced kidney injury. METHODS: Male ICR mice were divided into four treatment groups: Vehicle (VH, n = 6), VH + OA (n = 6), CsA (n = 8), and CsA + OA (n = 8). For the OA-treated groups, OA (25 mg/kg/day) was administered by intraperitoneal injection for the final week of the 4-week experimental period. Renal function, morphologies and signaling were evaluated at the end of the study. RESULTS: Treatment with CsA resulted in decreased kidney function and urine osmolality and increased urine volume and urinary albumin levels. The CsA-induced changes were improved by OA treatment. Specifically, administration of OA decreased tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation scores that were increased in CsA-treated mice. Furthermore, OA treatment decreased urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-epi-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha) levels. The beneficial effects of OA were attributed to an increased ratio of nuclear/total Nrf2 and subsequently enhanced expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, as well as a stable level of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) expression, indicating that OA enhanced nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Increased apoptotic cell death and a high ratio of B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax) to Bcl-2 in CsA-treated mice were also significantly ameliorated by OA treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that OA activates Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in chronic CsA nephropathy, which may have beneficial effects on inflammation and oxidative stress.",,20140221,,,PMC3939938,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MEDI-546 is an investigational human monoclonal antibody directed against the type I IFN receptor. This Phase 1 study evaluated the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and multiple intravenous doses of MEDI-546 in adults with SSc. METHODS: Subjects (>/=18 years) with SSc were enrolled in an open-label, dose-escalation study to receive single (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10.0, or 20.0 mg/kg), or 4 weekly intravenous doses (0.3, 1.0, or 5.0 mg/kg/week) of MEDI-546. Subjects were followed for 12 weeks. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), laboratory results, and viral monitoring. Blood samples were collected from all subjects for determination of PK, presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), and expression of type I IFN-inducible genes. RESULTS: Of 34 subjects (mean age 47.4 years), 32 completed treatment and 33 completed the study. Overall, 148 treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported (68.9% mild, 27.7% moderate). TEAEs included one grade 1 infusion reaction (5.0 mg/kg/week multiple dose). Of 4 treatment-emergent serious AEs (skin ulcer, osteomyelitis, vertigo, and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)), only CML (1.0 mg/kg/week multiple dose) was considered possibly treatment-related. MEDI-546 exhibited non-linear PK at lower doses. ADAs were detected in 5 subjects; no apparent impact on PK was observed. Peak inhibition of the type I IFN signature in whole blood was achieved within 1 day and in skin after 7 days. CONCLUSION: The safety/tolerability, PK, and PD profiles observed in this study support further clinical development of MEDI-546.

However, all patients eventually relapse and CLL remains incurable. Newer and more rationally developed compounds are needed to improve CLL therapy, particularly in cases of refractory disease. AREAS COVERED: Following a literature search on PubMed using 'chronic', 'lymphocytic', 'treatment' and 'therapy' as keywords, results obtained with novel agents were critically analyzed. Abstracts presented during 2013 at ASH, EHA, ICML, IWCLL and ASCO meetings were also included in the search. EXPERT OPINION: New monoclonal antibodies, lenalidomide, B-cell receptor-signal transduction inhibitors and pro-apoptotic molecules have shown efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Hopefully, the combined use of these molecules in risk-adapted treatment strategies will improve the outcome of patients with CLL and pave the way for their long-term control.",,20140222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of the current study was to investigate if similar effects may also be applicable to rescue photoreceptors from degeneration in a model of retinitis pigmentosa. Lens injury was performed in the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats at the age of one month. The survival of photoreceptors was evaluated histologically, and retinal function was analysed by electroretinography (ERG). Expression of CNTF was also analysed. Lens injury significantly enhanced the survival of photoreceptors 1 month after surgery compared to untreated controls, which was associated with an enhanced ERG response. In addition, lens injury significantly protected photoreceptors from degeneration in the contralateral eye, although to a much lesser extent. We could show that lens injury is sufficient to transiently delay the degeneration of photoreceptors in the RCS rat. The observed neuroprotective effects may be at least partially mediated by an upregulation of CNTF expression seen after lens injury.",,20130919,,,PMC3914173,,,,,,,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0246-1380', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1816-3014']",,,,,

Treatment failure may be due to transplant complications or relapse. To identify predictive factors for transplantation outcome, we studied 519 patients with MDS or oligoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (AML, <30% marrow blasts) who received an allogeneic HSCT and were reported to the Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo registry between 2000 and 2011. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. High-risk category, as defined by the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), and monosomal karyotype were independently associated with relapse and lower overall survival after transplantation. On the other hand, older recipient age and high hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index (HCT-CI) were independent predictors of nonrelapse mortality. Accounting for various combinations of patient's age, IPSS-R category, monosomal karyotype, and HCT-CI, the 5-year probability of survival after allogeneic HSCT ranged from 0% to 94%. This study indicates that IPSS-R risk category and monosomal karyotype are important factors predicting transplantation failure both in MDS and oligoblastic AML. In addition, it reinforces the concept that allogeneic HSCT offers optimal eradication of myelodysplastic hematopoiesis when the procedure is performed before MDS patients progress to advanced disease stages.",,20140220,,,,,,,,,['Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo'],,,,,,,,,,,

Increased insights in the etiology and the discovery of prediagnostic markers have the potential to improve the clinical course of these neoplasms. METHODS: We investigated in a prospective study global gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 263 incident B-cell lymphoma cases, diagnosed between 1 and 17 years after blood sample collection, and 439 controls, nested within two European cohorts. RESULTS: Our analyses identified only transcriptomic markers for specific lymphoma subtypes; few markers of multiple myeloma (N = 3), and 745 differentially expressed genes in relation to future risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The strongest of these associations were consistently found in both cohorts and were related to (B-) cell signaling networks and immune system regulation pathways. CLL markers exhibited very high predictive abilities of disease onset even in cases diagnosed more than 10 years after blood collection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first investigation on blood cell global gene expression and future risk of B-cell lymphomas.

JWA promoter transcription activity analysis was performed by chloramphenicol acetyl transferase-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (CAT-ELISA). The expression of JWA protein was significantly increased by up to (3.23 +/- 0.57) folds compared to the control in K562 cells after hemin treatment (50 muM for one week), and a similar pattern was observed in the cells after treatment with thermal stress (42 degrees C) for 2 hours [increased by (8.00 +/- 1.73) folds]. The expression of JWA mRNA was also significantly elevated by up to (1.37 +/- 0.06) folds in K562 cells treated with hemin (30 muM for 48 hours), and a similar regulatory pattern [increased by (1.87 +/- 0.13) folds] was observed with thermal stress exposure (42 degrees C) for 30 minutes. However, a combined antagonistic effect was observed in the treatment of K562 cells with hemin (30 muM, 48 h) followed by thermal stress (42 degrees C, 30 min). CAT-ELISA further confirmed that either hemin or thermal stress treatment could up-regulate JWA transcription activity, however, the effects could be counteracted partly by treatment with a combination of both. Hemin and thermal stress might regulate JWA expression via distinct intracellular signal transduction pathways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its incidence increases with disease duration and stage such that it is present in up to 85 % of patients at some point in their disease course. It is therefore important to monitor patients for the development of an antibody deficiency. However, not all patients with antibody deficiency secondary to CLL are symptomatic with bacterial infections. In addition patients are susceptible to viral, fungal and opportunistic infections as a result of iatrogenic immunosuppression and through a variety of disease-related mechanisms, which affect cellular immunity and phagocytes. Published guidelines suggest that patients with a history of recurrent bacterial infections and a documented failure of antibody production should be treated with antibiotic prophylaxis in the first instance, with replacement immunoglobulin reserved for those who continue to suffer with significant bacterial infections. Here we present a review of the existing literature in order to provide a practical approach, based on best available evidence, to the investigation, monitoring and treatment of patients with antibody failure secondary to CLL; and we highlight areas in which further studies are needed.",,20140221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some particles involved in the regulation of an immune system might represent prognostic value for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). The identification of novel prognostic factors in B-CLL may help define patient subgroups that may benefit from early therapeutic intervention. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of HLA-G expression in B-CLL patients and its relationship with other well-established prognostic markers. METHODOLOGY: Thirty B-CLL patients diagnosed by clinical, morphological and immunophenotyping criteria were studied for HLA-G expression by flow cytometry. The relationship between HLA-G expression and some known prognostic markers was evaluated. RESULTS: HLA-G was expressed in 36.7% of CLL patients at diagnosis, with a mean expression level of 35.31 +/- 12.35%. A significant association between HLA-G expression and common prognostic markers of progressive disease was detected. The group of patients with positive HLA-G expression showed significantly higher absolute lymphocyte counts and serum levels of LDH and beta2-microglobulin, lower platelet counts, positive CD38 expression and advanced stages of Binet clinical staging. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that HLA-G expression correlates with prognostic markers of a poor B-CLL outcome, mainly Binet clinical staging and CD38 expression by B-CLL cells, which indicates that this parameter may play a role as an important prognosticator of disease progression and consequently targeted therapy in B-CLL.","['(c) 2014 S.

We documented the characteristics and results of treatment of patients with AML at a single reference center. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with AML between June 2003 and July 2011 at a university hospital in northeast Mexico were studied. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were determined, and risk factors were analyzed with respect to their influence on prognosis. RESULTS: A total of 132 AML patients were included. Median age was 32 years. Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 55% of patients. CR was achieved by 65.1% of patients <60 years (n = 109), compared to 8.7% of those >60 years (n = 23; p < 0.001). In all, 39% of patients >60 years suffered an early death, compared to 14.7% of those <60 years (p < 0.001). OS for patients with AML was 35%, whereas EFS was 32%. On multivariate analysis, patients >60 years had a lower OS and EFS (p < 0.001). A total of 28% of patients received a transplant, and they had high er OS and EFS. Conclusions: Our patients were considerably younger and had remarkably lower survival rates than reported for other populations; those >60 years had a higher early death rate, and fewer of these patients achieved CR.","['(c) 2014 S.

Many cancers repress these apoptotic signals through alterations in the Bcl2 proteins that regulate this process. Therapeutics that target these specific survival biases are in development, and drugs that inhibit Bcl2 activities have shown clinical activity for some cancers. Mcl1 is a survival factor for which no effective antagonists have been developed, so it remains a principal mediator of therapy resistance, including to Bcl2 inhibitors. We used a synthetic-lethal screening strategy to identify genes that regulate Mcl1 survival activity using the pediatric tumor neuroblastoma (NB) as a model, as a large subset are functionally verified to be Mcl1 dependent and Bcl2 inhibitor resistant. A targeted siRNA screen identified genes whose knockdown restores sensitivity of Mcl1-dependent NBs to ABT-737, a small molecule inhibitor of Bcl2, BclXL and BclW. Three target genes that shifted the ABT-737 IC50 >1 log were identified and validated: PSMD14, UBL5 and PRPF8. The latter two are members of a recently characterized subcomplex of the spliceosome that along with SART1 is responsible for non-canonical 5'-splice sequence recognition in yeast. We showed that SART1 knockdown similarly sensitized Mcl1-dependent NB to ABT-737 and that triple knockdown of UBL5/PRPF8/SART1 phenocopied direct MCL1 knockdown, whereas having no effect on Bcl2-dependent NBs. Both genetic spliceosome knockdown or treatment with SF3b-interacting spliceosome inhibitors like spliceostatin A led to preferential pro-apoptotic Mcl1-S splicing and reduced translation and abundance of Mcl1 protein. In contrast, BN82865, which inhibits the second transesterification step in terminal spliceosome processing, did not have this effect. These findings demonstrate a prominent role for the spliceosome in mediating Mcl1 activity and suggest that drugs that target either the specific UBL5/PRPF8/SART1 subcomplex or SF3b functions may have a role as cancer therapeutics by attenuating the Mcl1 survival bias present in numerous cancers.",,20140220,,,PMC3944256,"['P01 CA097323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-HD0433021/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97323,/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

survivin, has been reported to promote cell death in some cancer cells, although it keeps prosurvival function in others, and the mechanisms are unclear. In this report, we discovered that selenite, an antitumor agent, switched protective autophagy to apoptosis in NB4 cells. In this process, the level of survivin-2B was decreased and the interaction between IKK alpha and survivin-2B in the nucleus was attenuated, which further led to the decrease of nuclear IKK alpha. As a result, P73, a known transcript factor of UVRAG, was downregulated. Therefore, the expression of UVRAG, one of the initiators of autophagy, was inhibited. The regulatory status of survivin-2B was also proved in NB4 cells after different chemicals' exposure and in other tumor cell lines (Jurkat, HCT116). Finally, experiments in vivo confirmed that the alterations of survivin-2B, IKK alpha, P73 and UVRAG were the same as that in vitro. Taken together, survivin-2B promoted autophagy and further regulated cell death by accumulating and stabilizing IKK alpha in the nucleus.",,20140220,,,PMC3944251,,,,,,,,,,,,['ORCID: 0000000272690683'],,,,,

However, the effect of thioridazine on tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) sensitization has not yet been studied. Here, we investigated the ability of thioridazine to sensitize TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Combined treatment with thioridazine and TRAIL markedly induced apoptosis in various human carcinoma cells, including renal carcinoma (Caki, ACHN, and A498), breast carcinoma (MDA-MB231), and glioma (U251MG) cells, but not in normal mouse kidney cells (TMCK-1) and human normal mesangial cells. We found that thioridazine downregulated c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 expression at the post-translational level via an increase in proteasome activity. The overexpression of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 overcame thioridazine plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We further observed that thioridazine inhibited the Akt signaling pathway. In contrast, although other phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin) sensitized TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1 expressions were not altered. Furthermore, thioridazine increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Caki cells, and ROS scavengers (N-acetylcysteine, glutathione ethyl ester, and trolox) inhibited thioridazine plus TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as well as Akt inhibition and the downregulation of c-FLIP(L) and Mcl-1.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the anti-apoptotic members of the family, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, exhibit functional redundancy. However, the current evidence is largely indirect, and based mainly on pharmacological data using small-molecule inhibitors. In order to study compensation and redundancy of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins at the molecular level, we used a combined knockdown/overexpression strategy to essentially replace the function of one member with another. The results show that HeLa cells are strictly dependent on Mcl-1 for survival and correspondingly refractory to the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-263, and remain resistant to ABT-263 in the context of Bcl-xL overexpression because endogenous Mcl-1 continues to provide the primary guardian role. However, if Mcl-1 is knocked down in the context of Bcl-xL overexpression, the cells become Bcl-xL-dependent and sensitive to ABT-263. We also show that Bcl-xL compensates for loss of Mcl-1 by sequestration of two key pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bak and Bim, normally bound to Mcl-1, and that Bim is essential for cell death induced by Mcl-1 knockdown. To our knowledge, this is the first example where cell death induced by loss of Mcl-1 was rescued by the silencing of a single BH3-only Bcl-2 family member. In colon carcinoma cell lines, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 also play compensatory roles, and Mcl-1 knockdown sensitizes cells to ABT-263. The results, obtained employing a novel strategy of combining knockdown and overexpression, provide unique molecular insight into the mechanisms of compensation by pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2014 Feb 20.,,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a defect in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. In the last 15 years, an increasing number of patients have been described with biallelic mismatch repair gene mutations causing a syndrome referred to as 'constitutional mismatch repair-deficiency' (CMMR-D). The spectrum of cancers observed in this syndrome differs from that found in LS, as about half develop brain tumours, around half develop digestive tract cancers and a third develop haematological malignancies. Brain tumours and haematological malignancies are mainly diagnosed in the first decade of life, and colorectal cancer (CRC) and small bowel cancer in the second and third decades of life. Surveillance for CRC in patients with LS is very effective. Therefore, an important question is whether surveillance for the most common CMMR-D-associated cancers will also be effective. Recently, a new European consortium was established with the aim of improving care for patients with CMMR-D. At a workshop of this group held in Paris in June 2013, one of the issues addressed was the development of surveillance guidelines. In 1968, criteria were proposed by WHO that should be met prior to the implementation of screening programmes. These criteria were used to assess surveillance in CMMR-D. The evaluation showed that surveillance for CRC is the only part of the programme that largely complies with the WHO criteria. The values of all other suggested screening protocols are unknown. In particular, it is questionable whether surveillance for haematological malignancies improves the already favourable outcome for patients with these tumours. Based on the available knowledge and the discussions at the workshop, the European consortium proposed a surveillance protocol. Prospective collection of all results of the surveillance is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme.",,20140220,['NOTNLM'],"['CMMR-D', 'Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency', 'Guidelines', 'Surveillance', 'Tumour spectrum']",,,,,,,['EU-Consortium Care for CMMR-D (C4CMMR-D)'],,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2014 Feb 18.,,"BACKGROUND: The pattern of endocrine disorders in long-term survivors of childhood cancer has not been investigated comprehensively. Here, we aimed to assess the lifetime risk of these disorders in Nordic survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: From the national cancer registries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, we identified 31,723 1-year survivors of childhood cancer, notified since the start of registration in the 1940s and 1950s. From the national population registries, we randomly selected a comparison cohort of people matched by age, sex, and country. Study participants were linked to the national hospital registries, and observed numbers of first-time hospital contacts for endocrine disorders in survivors of childhood cancer were compared with the expected numbers derived from the population comparison cohort. We calculated the absolute excess risks attributable to status as a childhood cancer survivor and standardised hospitalisation rate ratios (SHRRs). FINDINGS: Of the childhood cancer survivors, 3292 had contact with a hospital for an endocrine disorder, yielding a SHRR of 4.8 (95% CI 4.6-5.0); the highest risks were in survivors of leukaemia (SHRR 7.3 [95% CI 6.7-7.9]), CNS tumours (6.6 [6.2-7.0]), and Hodgkin's lymphoma (6.2 [5.6-7.0]). The absolute excess risk for endocrine disorders was roughly 1000 per 100,000 person-years before 20 years of age, and 400 per 100,000 person-years during the remaining lifetime. For children with cancer diagnosed at 5-9 years of age, the cumulative risk for endocrine disorders was highest, and reached 43% at the age of 60 years. Diagnoses of pituitary hypofunction (SHRR 88.0), hypothyroidism (9.9), and testicular and ovarian dysfunction (42.5 and 4.7, respectively) together constituted 61% (655 of 1078) of all excess disease-induced and treatment-induced endocrine disorders in survivors of childhood cancer. INTERPRETATION: A cumulative risk for endocrine disorders at 60 years of age of above 40% in survivors of childhood cancer emphasises the importance of minimisation of damaging treatment, intensification of secondary prevention, and targeting of survivor follow-up throughout life. Since most long-term childhood cancer survivors are not followed in a specialised late-effect clinic, they are a growing challenge for the primary care physician and medical specialists working outside the late-effect area.

As in human medicine, veterinary medicine faces the problem of cancer prevention as well as early diagnosis and effective therapy. Early diagnosis of cancer is crucial for the successful treatment of the disease and there is a need for biomarkers that could be used as a diagnostic tool, and to guide a targeted therapy or monitor a therapeutic response. Proteomic technologies that were introduced to human cancer research over a decade ago provide the opportunity to identify distinct protein patterns for cancer diagnosis and therapy monitoring.

These equiPSCs are dependent only on leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), placing them in striking contrast to previously derived equiPSCs that have been shown to be co-dependent on both LIF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). These equiPSCs have a normal karyotype and have been maintained beyond 60 passages. They possess alkaline phosphatase activity and express eqNANOG, eqOCT4, and eqTERT mRNA. Immunocytochemistry confirmed that they produce NANOG, REX1, SSEA4, TRA1-60, and TRA1-81. While our equiPSCs are LIF dependent, bFGF co-stimulates their proliferation via the PI3K/AKT pathway. EquiPSCs lack expression of eqXIST and immunostaining for H3K27me3, suggesting that during reprogramming the inactive X chromosome has likely been reactivated to generate cells that have two active X chromosomes. EquiPSCs form embryoid bodies and in vitro teratomas that contain derivatives of all three germ layers. These LIF-dependent equiPSCs likely reflect a more naive state of pluripotency than equiPSCs that are co-dependent on both LIF and bFGF and so provide a novel resource for understanding pluripotency in the horse.",,20140401,,,PMC4066230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, mAbs based on selective B-cell depletion - rituximab, ofatumumab and obinutuzumab - have been approved for use in CLL therapy. More recently, CD37, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily of cell surface antigens, has been considered as a target for B-cell malignancies. AREAS COVERED: The results of preclinical and early clinical studies suggest that in patients with CLL, newer anti-CD37 agents, otlertuzumab (formerly known as TRU-016), BI 836826, IMGN529 and (177)Lu-tetulomab can be useful in the treatment of this disease. EXPERT OPINION: CD37 may offer advantages over CD20 as a target for CLL cells. It is selectively expressed on normal mature B cells and by most B-cell malignancies. Anti-CD37 antibodies may be useful for patients resistant or refractory to anti-CD20 mAb therapy or relapsing after such treatment. The development of these agents into a clinically useful therapy for CLL is probably many years away and will be followed with great interest by laboratory investigators and clinicians.",,20140220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of sub-fractions of acetone extracts of CB stems on growth-associated molecular events of apoptosis and cell division cycle of Jurkat-T (JT) cells. METHODS: Acetone extract of CB stems were subfractioned into n-hexane (F1) and dichloromethane (F2) fractions. After treatment of JT cells with these subfractions, cell proliferation, viability and apoptosis were determined using a haemocytometer, the trypan blue dye exclusion assay, and Hoechst 33258 staining, respectively. Cell division cycle distribution profiles were analysed using an Epics Alba Flow Cytometer and the expression of cell division cycle regulatory genes was analysed using RT-PCR, while immunoreactive proteins were detected on western blots. RESULTS: The F1 and F2 fractions inhibited the proliferation and viability of JT cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 32.5 mug/ml and 56 mug/ml, respectively. The observed cytotoxicity was established to be a consequence of apoptosis. as verified using Hoechst staining method. Both fractions induced a G1/S interphase arrest of the cell division cycle of JT cells.RT-PCR analyses showed an up-regulatory effect by the F1 fraction in the expression of cyclin B1, cdc2 and bax, with a down-regulatory effect in the expression levels of bcl-2. Fraction F1 also increased the protein expression levels of p53 and its downstream regulators, p21 and Cdc2. However, protein Bax and p21 and p53 transcripts were undetectable under the same experimental conditions. On the other hand, fraction F2 increased the mRNA expression levels of bax, bcl-2, cyclin B1 and cdc2. Concomitantly, fraction F2 showed an up-regulation in the protein expression levels of Cdc2, Bcl-2, Cyclin B1 and p21. Despite the up-regulation in protein expression levels by fraction F2, there was no observable expression levels of the p53 protein and p21 and p53 mRNAs under similar experimental conditions. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the F1 and F2 fractions of CB may provide a valuable lead for the development of novel and effective anti-neoplastic drug(s).",,20140220,,,PMC3941970,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Syk is involved in signal transduction processes and appears to regulate allergic, inflammatory and autoimmune responses. It also appears to play a significant role in the development of haematological malignancies. Inhibitors of Syk are potentially useful in treating asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphomas. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the increasing number of patent filings between 2010 and 2013 claiming Syk inhibitors and focuses on the multiple structural classes of Syk inhibitors disclosed. It also comments on recent developments with Syk inhibitors, both clinical results and licensing deals. EXPERT OPINION: The increased interest in the identification of Syk inhibitors has seen a sharp increase in patent filings claiming such compounds. However, the number of these is well below that of filings relating to other pro-inflammatory kinases (p38, JAK). These filings have also claimed an increasingly diverse range of chemical classes moving away from the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine motif present in drugs such as fostamatinib and PRT-06207. Many of the claimed compounds are Syk inhibitors with potencies considerably better than fostamatinib. However, good kinase selectivity is also likely to be essential if a Syk inhibitor is to prove useful enough to emulate the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in gaining marketing authorisation. Recent clinical failures with Syk inhibitors are expected to result in a decrease in the rate of patent filings claiming Syk inhibitors.",,20140220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers have long recognized the catalytic properties of square-planar Ir(I) complexes, such as Crabtree's hydrogenation catalyst, an organometallic complex with cyclooctadiene, phosphane, and pyridine ligands. More recently, chemists have developed half-sandwich pseudo-octahedral pentamethylcyclopentadienyl Ir(III) complexes containing diamine ligands that efficiently catalyze transfer hydrogenation reactions of ketones and aldehydes in water using H2 or formate as the hydrogen source. Although sometimes assumed to be chemically inert, the reactivity of low-spin 5d(6) Ir(III) centers is highly dependent on the set of ligands. Cp* complexes with strong sigma-donor C^C-chelating ligands can even stabilize Ir(IV) and catalyze the oxidation of water. In comparison with well developed Ir catalysts, Ir-based pharmaceuticals are still in their infancy. In this Account, we review recent developments in organoiridium complexes as both catalysts and anticancer agents. Initial studies of anticancer activity with organoiridium complexes focused on square-planar Ir(I) complexes because of their structural and electronic similarity to Pt(II) anticancer complexes such as cisplatin. Recently, researchers have studied half-sandwich Ir(III) anticancer complexes. These complexes with the formula [(Cp(x))Ir(L^L')Z](0/n+) (with Cp* or extended Cp* and L^L' = chelated C^N or N^N ligands) have a much greater potency (nanomolar) toward a range of cancer cells (especially leukemia, colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma) than cisplatin. Their mechanism of action may involve both an attack on DNA and a perturbation of the redox status of cells. Some of these complexes can form Ir(III)-hydride complexes using coenzyme NAD(P)H as a source of hydride to catalyze the generation of H2 or the reduction of quinones to semiquinones. Intriguingly, relatively unreactive organoiridium complexes containing an imine as a monodentate ligand have prooxidant activity, which appears to involve catalytic hydride transfer to oxygen and the generation of hydrogen peroxide in cells. In addition, researchers have designed inert Ir(III) complexes as potent kinase inhibitors. Octahedral cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes not only serve as cell imaging agents, but can also inhibit tumor necrosis factor alpha, promote DNA oxidation, generate singlet oxygen when photoactivated, and exhibit good anticancer activity. Although relatively unexplored, organoiridium chemistry offers unique features that researchers can exploit to generate novel diagnostic agents and drugs with new mechanisms of action.",,20140220,,,PMC3994614,"['G0701062/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The binding to the natural ligand CD40L, which is expressed on T helper cells, leads to APC activation and thus enhancement of immune responses. Treatment with anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies has been exploited in several cancer immunotherapy studies in mice and led to the development of anti-CD40 antibodies for clinical use. Here, Dacetuzumab and Lucatumumab are in the most advanced stage and are being tested as treatment for malignancies such as chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), Multiple Myeloma (MM), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The promising results from these early clinical trials have encouraged clinical drug development in order to investigate the effect of CD40 mAbs in combination with other cancer immunotherapies, in particular interleukin (IL)-2. An in-depth analysis of this immunotherapy is provided elsewhere. In the present review, we provide an update of the most recent clinical trials with anti-CD40 antibodies.

We recommend that critical and regular assessment of the oral mucosa and proper dental care and oral hygiene be emphasized in all pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy. Families of affected children need to be educated about the benefits and modes of optimal oral hygiene for their children and the need to seek immediate care for mouth pain and or lesions. Optimal treatment for mucositis needs to be instituted without delay in this high risk pediatric population.

Among all malignancies, it has the greatest effects on emotional and mental aspects of the patients. While 25-33% of patients with non-hematological malignancies suffer from anxiety disorder, some studies have reported the rate among patients with leukemia as high as 50%. Anxiety can negatively affect other important characteristics and parameters in patients with cancer. Furthermore, cancer increases the patients' spiritual needs. Therefore, spirituality has a significant role in adapting to leukemia and coping with its consequent mental disorders such as anxiety. This study was hence performed to determine the effects of a spiritual care program on anxiety of patients with leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Sayyed-Al-Shohada Hospital affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Isfahan, Iran) in 2012. Sixty four adult patients with leukemia were randomly divided into the experiment and control groups. The spiritual care program including supportive presence and support for religious rituals was implemented for 3 days. Anxiety subscale from the 42-item depression, anxiety and stress scale was completed before and after the intervention for both groups. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods (Chi-square, paired and independent t-tests) in SPSS18. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups before the intervention. However, after the intervention, mean score of anxiety were significantly lower in the experiment group than in the control group (P < 0.01). There was also a significant difference in the scores of the experiment group before and after the intervention (P < 0.01). Such a difference was absent in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our spiritual care program could successfully decrease anxiety levels in patients with leukemia. Therefore, in cases of refractory diseases such as cancer, nurses have to apply a holistic care approach with emphasis on spiritual care.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anxiety', 'Iran', 'leukemia', 'nursing', 'spirituality']",PMC3917191,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in the PHF6 gene have also been associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Approximately half of the disease-associated mutations are distributed in the second conserved extended plant homeodomain (ePHD2) of PHF6, indicating the functional importance of the ePHD2 domain. Here, we report the high resolution crystal structure of the ePHD2 domain of PHF6, which contains an N-terminal pre-PHD (C2HC zinc finger), a long linker, and an atypical PHD finger. PHF6-ePHD2 appears to fold as a novel integrated structural module. Structural analysis of PHF6-ePHD2 reveals pathological implication of PHF6 gene mutations in Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. The binding experiments show that PHF6-ePHD2 can bind dsDNA but not histones. We also demonstrate PHF6 protein directly interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex component RBBP4. Via this interaction, PHF6 exerts its transcriptional repression activity. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that PHF6 may function as a transcriptional repressor using its ePHD domains binding to the promoter region of its repressed gene, and this process was regulated by the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex that was recruited to the genomic target site by NoLS region of PHF6.",,20140219,['NOTNLM'],"['BFLS', 'Extended PHD', 'Genetic Diseases', 'NuRD', 'PHF6', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein-DNA Interaction', 'RBBP4', 'Transcription Regulation', 'Tumor Suppressor Gene']",PMC3974978,,,,['PDB/4NN2'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, MRD and clearance were assessed by both multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and WT1 expression at different time points on 45 AML patients achieving complete remission. Our results by WT1 expression showed that log clearance lower than 1.96 after induction predicted the recurrence better than MRD higher than 77.0 copies WT1/10(4) ABL. Conversely, on MFC, MRD higher than 0.2 % after consolidation was more predictive than log clearance below 2.64. At univariate and multivariate analysis, positive MRD values and log clearance below the optimal cutoffs were associated with a shorter disease-free survival (DFS). At the univariate analysis, positive MRD values were also associated with overall survival (OS). Therefore, post-induction log clearance by WT1 and post-consolidation MRD by MFC represented the most informative approaches to identify the relapse. At the optimal timing of assessment, positive MRD and log-clearance values lower than calculated thresholds similarly predicted an adverse prognosis in AML.",,20140220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2014 Feb 20.,,"Possible health effects of low and protracted doses of ionizing radiation are relevant for persons who are exposed to an occupational context like nuclear industry workers. A historical cohort study was therefore conducted to examine mortality risks following occupational radiation exposure among 4,844 German nuclear power plant workers. This cohort included workers from ten nuclear power plants with an observational period from 1991 until 1997. The results of an enlarged cohort with 8,972 workers from all 17 nuclear power plants in West Germany are now available. During the extended follow-up period from 1991 to 2008, a total of 310 deaths among men were observed. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) from all causes of deaths was estimated at 0.50 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.56]. A total of 126 deaths due to cancer occurred (SMR = 0.65; 95 % CI 0.51-0.82) and seven deaths due to leukemia (SMR = 1.23; 95 % CI 0.42-2.84). Overall, a reduced mortality compared to the general population of West Germany was observed indicating a healthy worker effect. In the dose-response analysis, no statistically significant risk due to ionizing radiation was seen. The hazard ratio (HR/mSv) for leukemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia was estimated at 1.004 (95 % CI 0.997-1.011). In conclusion, the cohort is small and made up of young workers, most of whom were still employed at the end of the observational period in 2008. Results of the external analysis are difficult to interpret as influenced by a healthy worker effect. In the internal analysis, no excess of risk due to radiation was detected.",,20140220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We present a single-center report of a series of 12 imatinib-refractory patients in advanced phases, 9 of whom harbored BCR-ABL1 mutations. All of them were treated with 2nd TKI, followed by allo-SCT. RESULTS: Dasatinib or nilotinib reinduced complete hematologic responses in 11 patients and complete cytogenetic responses in 4 patients. All patients engrafted successfully. Five patients experienced acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), including 4 with grade III-IV disease. Four patients experienced chronic GVHD, including 1 with extensive disease. Post-transplant prophylactic dasatinib or nilotinb was administrated in 9 patients and discontinued 1 year later, all of whom sustained complete molecular remission, even after a median follow-up of 13 months after withdrawal of the TKI. No hematologic relapse was observed. Four patients died: 1 of primary disease and 3 of transplant-related complications. After a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 12-37 months) after SCT, 8 (66.7%) of 12 patients are alive, including 7 with complete molecular remission. CONCLUSIONS: Allo-SCT has a satisfactory outcome when combined with 2nd-generation TKI, which could provide a good quality of remission before transplantation and prevent relapse after transplantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, we found that serum C-reactive protein, a readily available laboratory study, can serve as a reliable indicator for the severity of the CRS.

LIF also promotes invasion and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro and metastasis of breast cancer in vivo. We found that LIF activates the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer. Inhibiting the AKT activity can largely block the activation of the mTOR pathway by LIF, suggesting that LIF activates the mTOR pathway through AKT.

We found a vastly reduced expression of NR4A1 and NR4A3 in chronic lymphocytic B-cell leukemia (71%), in follicular lymphoma (FL, 70%), and in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 74%). In aggressive lymphomas (DLBCL and FL grade 3), low NR4A1 expression was significantly associated with a non-germinal center B-cell subtype and with poor overall survival. To investigate the function of NR4A1 in lymphomas, we overexpressed NR4A1 in several lymphoma cell lines. Overexpression of NR4A1 led to a higher proportion of lymphoma cells undergoing apoptosis. To test the tumor suppressor function of NR4A1 in vivo, the stable lentiviral-transduced SuDHL4 lymphoma cell line harboring an inducible NR4A1 construct was further investigated in xenografts. Induction of NR4A1 abrogated tumor growth in the NSG mice, in contrast to vector controls, which formed massive tumors. Our data suggest that NR4A1 has proapoptotic functions in aggressive lymphoma cells and define NR4A1 as a novel gene with tumor suppressor properties involved in lymphomagenesis.",,20140219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous metabolic changes are required for malignant transformation, and they render malignant cells more prone to disturbances in the metabolic framework. Despite the high incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), metabolism of CLL cells remains a relatively unexplored area. The examined untreated CLL patients displayed a metabolic condition known as oxidative stress, which was linked to alterations in their lymphoid compartment. Our studies identified mitochondrial metabolism as the key source for abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS). Unlike in other malignant cells, we found increased oxidative phosphorylation in CLL cells but not increased aerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, CLL cells adapted to intrinsic oxidative stress by upregulating the stress-responsive heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Our data implicate that HO-1 was, beyond its function as an antioxidant, involved in promoting mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus ROS, adaptation to ROS, and mitochondrial biogenesis appear to form a self-amplifying feedback loop in CLL cells. Taking advantage of the altered metabolic profile, we were able to selectively target CLL cells by PK11195. This benzodiazepine derivate blocks the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase, leads to a surplus production of mitochondrial superoxide, and thereby induces cell death in CLL cells. Taken together, our findings depict how bioenergetics and redox characteristics could be therapeutically exploited in CLL.",,20140219,,,,,,,,,,,['Blood. 2014 Apr 24;123(17):2596-7.

D816V KIT is found in approximately 80% of the patients with systemic mastocytosis, and is resistant to the first and second generations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). The purpose of this investigation was aimed at exploring whether ponatinib (AP24534), a novel effective TKI against T315I Bcr-Abl, was active against D816V KIT. We discovered that ponatinib abrogated the phosphorylation of KIT harboring either V560G (sensitive to imatinib) or D816V mutation (resistant to imatinib) and the downstream signaling transduction. Ponatinib inhibited the growth of D816V KIT-expressing cells in culture and nude mouse xenografted tumor. Ponatinib triggered apoptosis by inducing the release of cytochrome c and AIF, downregulation of Mcl-1. Furthermore, ponatinib abrogated the phosphorylation of beta-catenin at the site Y654, suppressed the translocation of beta-catenin, and inhibited the transcription and DNA binding of TCF and the expression of its targets (e.g., AXIN2, c-MYC, and CCND1). Moreover, ponatinib was highly active against xenografted D816V KIT tumors in nude mice and significantly prolonged the survival of mice with aggressive systemic mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia by impeding the expansion and infiltration of mast cells with imatinib-resistant D814Y KIT. Our findings warrant a clinical trial of ponatinib in patients with systemic mastocytosis harboring D816V KIT.",,20140219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we assessed the growth inhibitory potential of PR-924 in three human hematologic malignancy cell lines (CCRF-CEM, THP1, and 8226) and their bortezomib-resistant sublines. Parental cells displayed equal sensitivity to PR-924 (IC(5)(0): 1.5-2.8 muM), whereas their bortezomib-resistant tumor lines displayed a 10-12 fold cross-resistance to PR-924. However, PR-924 cross-resistance factors for bortezomib-resistant sublines were markedly lower compared to the resistance factors to bortezomib. Proteasome inhibition experiments confirmed that PR-924 specifically inhibited beta5i activity, even far below concentrations that exerted anti-proliferative activity. We further determined whether PR-924 activity might be compromised by acquisition of drug resistance phenomena. Indeed, CEM cells rendered stepwise resistant to 20 muM PR-924 (CEM/PR20) displayed 13-fold PR-924-resistance and 10-fold cross-resistance to bortezomib. CEM/PR20 cells were devoid of mutations in the PSMB8 gene (encoding beta5i), but acquired Met45Ile mutation in the PSMB5 gene (encoding constitutive beta5), consistent with beta5 mutations observed in bortezomib-resistant cells. Furthermore, compared to parental CEM cells, CEM/PR20 cells exhibited 2.5-fold upregulation of constitutive proteasome subunit expression, whereas immunoproteasome subunit expression was 2-fold decreased. In conclusion, PR-924 displayed potent anti-leukemic activity including toward bortezomib-resistant leukemia cells. Despite the specificity of PR-924 to the beta5i immunoproteasome subunit, its anti-leukemic effect required concentrations that blocked both beta5 and beta5i subunits.

Several variables have been identified but there are no data about the incidence of this complication in individuals given HSCT using reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) methods. OBJECTIVE: Define the incidence of SMN in patients given HSCT using a RIC preparative regimen conducted on an outpatient basis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients given HSCT in two institutions between October 1998 and 2012 were analyzed. To appraise the SMN appearance, those patients dead were also regarded as censored at that moment, as well as those lost to follow up and those alive at the closing of the study. 95% Confidence intervals (CI) for the survival or failure estimate were calculated with the Greenwood's method. RESULTS: A total of 416 allografted patients with a Karnofsky performance index of 100% were included in the study. All patients received peripheral blood stem cells allografts. The conditioning regimen was delivered as an outpatient procedure in all individuals. No patient was given radiotherapy nor antithymocyte globulin during the conditioning. Three hundred and sixty five patients (88%) were never admitted to the hospital, whereas 12% were admitted because of grade III-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), fever, or mucositis. Median survival time was 15.7 months. Survival at 6 months (95% CI): 66.4% (61.5-70.8%), at 12 months: 53.3% (48.1-58.1%), at 60 months: 30.6% (30.5-41.5%). Eight patients with a SMN were identified in the group of 416 allografted patients, SMN rates (95% CI) were: one year post graft: 1.9% (0.7-4.9%), 5 years: 3.8% (1.6-9.2%), 10 years: 6.8% (2.6-17.7%) and 13 years post-graft: 20.2% (5.5-59.2%), the cumulative probability of SMN being 6.8 at 10 years. Since the number of expected cases in the general population is 0.62, the ratio of observed to expected cases is 12.9 (P < 0.001). This figure means that the risk of developing a malignant neoplasm in allografted individuals using our method is 12.9 times higher than that in the general population. There were three non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, two M2 acute myelogenous leukemias, one hairy cell leukemia, one tongue epidermoid carcinoma, and one breast carcinoma.

The purpose of the present study is to investigate the expression of IL-9 from patients with CLL and to evaluate its correlation with clinical characteristics. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with CLL were analyzed using ELISA, RT-PCR, and western blot. ELISA analysis indicated IL-9 could be detected in 20 of 47 sera from CLL patients while none serum sample from healthy volunteers contained detectable levels of IL-9. There was a higher expression of IL-9 within PBMCs from patients with CLL compared with B cells of healthy blood donors using RT-PCR and western blot. The upregulated IL-9 was correlated to the clinical staging, ZAP-70 expression, beta2 microglobulin expression and IgVH status of CLL patients (P<0.05).

We reported previously that LRRC33, a transmembrane protein of the LRR family, might potentially affect TLR-mediated activity. Here, we demonstrate that LRRC33 is a negative physiological regulator for multiple TLRs. Lrrc33(-/-) and Lrrc33(+/-) mice were more susceptible to TLR ligand challenges. The macrophages and DCs from Lrrc33(-/-) mice produced more proinflammatory cytokines than those of WT mice through increased activation of MAPK and NF-kappaB. Silencing LRRC33 also promoted multiple TLR-mediated activation in human moDCs. Notably, LRRC33 expression could be down-regulated by TLR ligands LPS, poly I:C, or PGN through H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modification. In LPS-conditioned moDCs, reduced enrichment of H3K4me3 and increased H3K27me3 could be observed at the promoter region of LRRC33. Furthermore, silencing H3K4me3-associated factors MLL and RBBP5 not only decreased the enrichment of H3K4me3 but also down-regulated expression of LRRC33, whereas the expression of LRRC33 was up-regulated after silencing H3K27me3-associated factors EZH2 and EED.

We sought to identify clinical, pharmacokinetic, and genetic risk factors for these MTX-related toxicities during childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy and provide data on safety of intrathecal and high-dose MTX rechallenge in patients with neurotoxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at four time points for 369 children with ALL treated in a contemporary study that included five courses of high-dose MTX and 13 to 25 doses of triple intrathecal therapy. Logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate clinical and pharmacokinetic factors, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify germline polymorphisms for their association with neurotoxicities. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (3.8%) developed MTX-related clinical neurotoxicity. Of 13 patients rechallenged with intrathecal and/or high-dose MTX, 12 did not experience recurrence of neurotoxicity. Leukoencephalopathy was found in 73 (20.6%) of 355 asymptomatic patients and in all symptomatic patients and persisted in 74% of asymptomatic and 58% of symptomatic patients at the end of therapy. A high 42-hour plasma MTX to leucovorin ratio (measure of MTX exposure) was associated with increased risk of leukoencephalopathy in multivariable analysis (P = .038). GWAS revealed polymorphisms in genes enriched for neurodevelopmental pathways with plausible mechanistic roles in neurotoxicity. CONCLUSION: MTX-related clinical neurotoxicity is transient, and most patients can receive subsequent MTX without recurrence of acute or subacute symptoms. All symptomatic patients and one in five asymptomatic patients develop leukoencephalopathy that can persist until the end of therapy.

NKT cells comprise well-characterized type I NKT cells, which can be detected by alpha-galactosylceramide-loaded CD1d tetramers, and less-studied type II NKT cells, which do not recognize alpha-galactosylceramide. Here we characterized type II NKT cells on a polyclonal level by using a Jalpha18-deficient IL-4 reporter mouse model. This model allows us to track type II NTK cells by the GFP(+)TCRbeta(+) phenotype in the thymus and liver. We found type II NKT cells, like type I NKT cells, exhibit an activated phenotype and are dependent on the transcriptional regulator promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) and the adaptor molecule signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein (SAP) for their development. Type II NKT cells are potently activated by beta-D-glucopyranosylceramide (beta-GlcCer) but not sulfatide or phospholipids in a CD1d-dependent manner, with the stimulatory capacity of beta-GlcCer influenced by acyl chain length. Compared with type I NKT cells, type II NKT cells produce lower levels of IFN-gamma but comparable amounts of IL-13 in response to polyclonal T-cell receptor stimulation, suggesting they may play different roles in regulating immune responses. Furthermore, type II NKT cells can be activated by CpG oligodeoxynucletides to produce IFN-gamma, but not IL-4 or IL-13. Importantly, CpG-activated type II NKT cells contribute to the antitumor effect of CpG in the B16 melanoma model.

Our findings support a model in which mutations in ""landscaping"" genes, involved in global chromatin changes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin looping, occur early in the evolution of AML, whereas mutations in ""proliferative"" genes occur late. Additionally, we analyze the persistence of preleukemic mutations in patients in remission and find CD34+ progenitor cells and various mature cells that harbor preleukemic mutations. These findings indicate that preleukemic HSCs can survive induction chemotherapy, identifying these cells as a reservoir for the reevolution of relapsed disease. Finally, through the study of several cases of relapsed AML, we demonstrate various evolutionary patterns for the generation of relapsed disease and show that some of these patterns are consistent with involvement of preleukemic HSCs.

Here we developed a dedicated approach, proteomic peptide-phage display (ProP-PD), to identify domain-SLiM interactions. Specifically, we generated phage libraries containing all human and viral C-terminal peptides using custom oligonucleotide microarrays. With these libraries we screened the nine PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains of human Densin-180, Erbin, Scribble, and Disks large homolog 1 for peptide ligands. We identified several known and putative interactions potentially relevant to cellular signaling pathways and confirmed interactions between full-length Scribble and the target proteins beta-PIX, plakophilin-4, and guanylate cyclase soluble subunit alpha-2 using colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The affinities of recombinant Scribble PDZ domains and the synthetic peptides representing the C termini of these proteins were in the 1- to 40-muM range. Furthermore, we identified several well-established host-virus protein-protein interactions, and confirmed that PDZ domains of Scribble interact with the C terminus of Tax-1 of human T-cell leukemia virus with micromolar affinity. Previously unknown putative viral protein ligands for the PDZ domains of Scribble and Erbin were also identified. Thus, we demonstrate that our ProP-PD libraries are useful tools for probing PDZ domain interactions.

In addition, this analysis showed that 10.3% of FR-CLL cases display mutations of the FAT1 gene, which encodes for a cadherin-like protein that negatively regulates Wnt signaling, consistent with a tumor suppressor role.

Addressing those limitations, all first primary cancer cases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program (1992-2005), linked to Medicare claims data were used. Cases were followed from cancer diagnosis until the earliest date of ALS diagnosis, a break in Medicare claims data, death, age 85 or December 31, 2005. A comparison group from a 5% random Medicare sample in the SEER areas who were cancer-free and censored as above, or until a cancer diagnosis were selected. ALS outcomes were derived from medical claims. The proportional hazards models to estimate ALS hazard ratios (HRs), using age as the time scale, adjusting for sex, race and physician visits, and stratifying the baseline hazard on birth year and SEER registry were used. A total of 303 ALS cases were ascertained in cancer patients (2,154,062 person-years) compared with 246 ALS cases (2,467,634 person-years) in the reference population. There was no overall relationship between cancer and ALS (HR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.81-1.22), nor by gender or race. Except for an elevated ALS risk in the first year after a leukemia diagnosis, the relationship between site-specific cancers and ALS was null after correcting for multiple comparisons.

Unexpectedly, stress induced by bone marrow transplantation of ZBP89(-/-) HSPC also resulted in a myeloid-to-B lymphoid lineage switch in bone marrow recipients. The erythroid and myeloid/B lymphoid lineage anomalies in ZBP89(-/-) HSPC are reproduced in vitro in the ZBP-89-silenced multipotent hematopoietic cell line FDCP-Mix A4, and are associated with the upregulation of PU.1 and downregulation of SCL/Tal1 and GATA-1 in ZBP89-deficient cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays show that ZBP-89 is a direct repressor of PU.1 and activator of SCL/Tal1 and GATA-1.

In the European cohort, 167 (31%) patients were HMR: 127 (23.6%) had one and 40 (7.4%) had two or more mutated genes. The presence of two or more mutations predicted the worst survival: median 2.6 years (hazard ratio (HR) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-5.7) vs. 7.0 years (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.6) for one mutation vs 12.3 years for no mutations. The results were validated in the Mayo cohort and prognostic significance in both cohorts was independent of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS; HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.6) and dynamic IPSS (DIPSS)-plus (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1), respectively. Two or more mutations were also associated with shortened leukemia-free survival (HR 6.2, 95% CI 3.5-10.7), also Mayo validated.

SUMMARY ANSWER: The highly expressed HOXA9, HOXA11 and HOXD10 genes also appear to be involved in endometrial receptivity. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Within the HOX family of homeobox transcription factor genes are the leading candidates for the regulation of embryonic implantation. A crucial role of HOXA10 in endometrial receptivity has been well established. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: To identify HOX candidate genes, we performed data mining on all 39 human HOX genes in the 'Human body index' gene expression database of normal human tissue. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of four highly expressed HOX genes in the human endometrium was determined. To further investigate the function of these Hox genes, we used a robust in vivo mouse model in which we blocked maternal Hox gene expression. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING AND METHODS: Analysis of a gene expression profile set in the public domain consisting of 504 samples representing 95 different normal human tissues, showed that in addition to HOXA10, also HOXA9, HOXA11, HOXB6 and HOXD10 mRNA showed increased expression in the human endometrium (16 samples). The temporal and spatial expression pattern of these four HOX genes throughout the menstrual cycle was determined in the endometrium from 27 female patients eligible for IVF-embryo transfer with a normal cycle by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry. The role of maternal Hoxa9, Hoxa11 and Hoxd10 was assessed in a mouse implantation model by expression knockdown using RNA interference. Forty mice were transfected with Hoxa9-, Hoxa11- or Hoxd10-specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs or a vector control by injection into the uterine horn at Day 2 after vaginal plug detection (Day 1) (160 mice in total). The effects were examined by qRT-PCR and western blot at Day 4 and litter sizes counted at Day 9 of pregnancy. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: HOXA10, HOXA9, HOXA11 and HOXD10 all showed increased expression during the mid-secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (P < 0.01). Knockdown of Hoxa9, Hoxa11 and Hoxd10 in the murine uterus resulted in significantly reduced average implantation rates (P < 0.01) and, with regard to four Hox target genes, also correlated with a significantly increased empty spiracles homolog 2 (Emx2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (Igfbp1), and decreased integrin beta3 (Itgb3) and leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), expression (P < 0.01). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Menstrual cycle stage was not confirmed by serum hormone analysis. We verified the absence of significant differences in stage-specific expression of the reference genes used in our study (ACTB/Actb and GAPDH/Gapdh) and therefore possible limitations of this approach were minimized. In addition, the translatability of our data from a mouse model to patients needs to be investigated further. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: We provide evidence that three other HOX genes in addition to HOXA10 are involved in endometrial receptivity, and that part of their function is asserted through several known HOX target genes, suggesting the presence of a central HOX signal transduction pathway.",,20140218,['NOTNLM'],"['HOXA11', 'HOXA9', 'HOXD10', 'embryonic implantation', 'endometrial receptivity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Thematic analysis of qualitative semistructured interviews. SETTING: One tertiary referral centre in Southern England. PARTICIPANTS: 21 parents and 9 general practitioners (GPs) of 18 children (<18-year-old) with a new diagnosis of acute leukaemia. RESULTS: The majority of children were first seen by GPs before the characteristic signs and symptoms of leukaemia had developed. In their absence, behavioural cues such as the child becoming apathetic or 'not themselves' often triggered parents to seek medical help. Most GPs were unclear about the nature and severity of the child's presentation: then, safety netting, thorough history-taking and examination, and reliance on contextual information about the parents or from prior hospital paediatrics experience were used to manage diagnostic uncertainty. The nature of the doctor-parent relationship helped and hindered the diagnostic pathway. GPs' prior perceptions of parents as being 'sensible' or 'worriers' influenced how gravely they treated parental concerns, with 'worriers' being taken less seriously. Some parents believed GPs failed to listen to their anxieties and discounted their expert knowledge of their child. Specific delay factors included lack of continuity of GP; some GPs' reluctance to take blood from children; and some parents feeling unable to voice effectively their concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of paediatric leukaemia in primary care differs from that described in many hospital studies, with greater diversity and intermittency of symptoms, and the frequent absence of 'red flags' of serious illness. A wide range of non-disease related factors potentially delay the diagnosis of paediatric leukaemia, including tensions in the doctor-patient relationship and the doctors' cognitive biases. The identification and attempted modification of these factors may minimise diagnostic delay more successfully than raising awareness of 'red flags' of disease.",,20140218,['NOTNLM'],['Qualitative Research'],PMC3931998,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20140219'],,,,,,,,,,

QT prolongation, torsades de pointes and sudden death have been implicated in the cardiotoxicity of As2O3. The present study was designed to assess whether the combination of As2O3 and tetrandrine could generate a more powerful anti-cancer effect. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed for detecting the proliferation of HepG2 and A549 cells treated with tetrandrine and As2O3. Fluorescent microscopy measurements and flow cytometry were carried out to evaluate the apoptosis in HepG2 cells. The cell cycle arrest of HepG2 cells was also determined by flow cytometry. The cell proliferation assay in HepG2 and A549 cells indicated that tetrandrine significantly enhanced the inhibit effect of As2O3. In addition, the following Isobolograms further demonstrated that combining As2O3 with tetrandrine generated synergism action. Tetrandrine also enhanced the apoptosis, necrosis and cell cycle arrest in As2O3-treated HepG2 cells. Our present study showed that tetrandrine can dramatically enhance the anti- cancer effect induced by As2O3. Combining As2O3 with tetrandrine would be a novel strategy to treat cancer in clinical practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erythrina alkaloids have been described in several species of Erythrina, which have biological and therapeutic properties well known that include anxiolytic and sedative effects. METHODS: In this work, in vitro metabolism of erythraline (1), the major spirocyclic alkaloid of Erythrina verna, was studied in the pig cecum model and by biomimetic phase I reactions. The biomimetic reactions were performed with Jacobsen catalyst to produce oxidative metabolites and one metabolite was isolated and evaluated against cancer cells, as HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), SF-295 (Glioblastoma) and OVCAR-8 (ovarian carcinoma). RESULTS: Erythraline exhibited no metabolization by the pig microbiota and a main putative metabolite was formed in a biomimetic model using Jacobsen catalyst. This metabolite was isolated and identified as 8-oxo-erythraline (2). Finally, erythraline and the putative metabolite were tested in MTT model and both compounds showed no important cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: The alkaloid erythraline was not metabolized by intestinal microbiota, but it was possible to identify its oxidative metabolite from biomimetic reactions. So these data are interesting and stimulate other studies involving this alkaloid, since it is present in phytomedicine products and there are not reported data about the metabolism of erythrina alkaloids.",,20140218,,,PMC3930555,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There has been a continuing effort to improve identification of patients at high risk of relapse, with the goal of early intervention to improve outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we examined the effect of MRD on the risk of hematologic relapse in 149 adult patients with ALL in morphologic remission undergoing allogeneic HSCT. MRD was assessed at the time of HSCT and after HSCT. RESULTS: Patients with pretransplant MRD had a trend for shorter progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years compared with patients without MRD, nearing statistical significance; 28% versus 47%, P = .08, on univariate analysis. This trend remained on multivariate analysis with better PFS in patients without MRD at the time of HSCT, hazard ratio (HR), 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.04); P = .07. Additionally, emergence of MRD after HSCT was a strong predictor for overt hematologic relapse (HR, 4; P < .001) with a median latency interval of 3.8 months.

The method described by Hartung, Knapp, Sidik and Jonkman (HKSJ) is known to perform better when trials of similar size are combined. However evidence in realistic situations, where one trial might be much larger than the other trials, is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the relative performance of the DL and HKSJ methods when studies of different sizes are combined and to develop a simple method to convert DL results to HKSJ results. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of the HKSJ versus DL approach in simulated meta-analyses of 2-20 trials with varying sample sizes and between-study heterogeneity, and allowing trials to have various sizes, e.g. 25% of the trials being 10-times larger than the smaller trials. We also compared the number of ""positive"" (statistically significant at p < 0.05) findings using empirical data of recent meta-analyses with > = 3 studies of interventions from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. RESULTS: The simulations showed that the HKSJ method consistently resulted in more adequate error rates than the DL method. When the significance level was 5%, the HKSJ error rates at most doubled, whereas for DL they could be over 30%. DL, and, far less so, HKSJ had more inflated error rates when the combined studies had unequal sizes and between-study heterogeneity. The empirical data from 689 meta-analyses showed that 25.1% of the significant findings for the DL method were non-significant with the HKSJ method. DL results can be easily converted into HKSJ results. CONCLUSIONS: Our simulations showed that the HKSJ method consistently results in more adequate error rates than the DL method, especially when the number of studies is small, and can easily be applied routinely in meta-analyses. Even with the HKSJ method, extra caution is needed when there are = <5 studies of very unequal sizes.",,20140218,,,PMC4015721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This ability has chiefly been linked to its role as a core component of dynamic structures termed PML Nuclear Bodies (PML-NBs). In response to a variety of stresses, key factors and their molecular modifiers are recruited to PML-NBs, where activating modifications are facilitated, leading to a cellular stress response. PML was also found to perform anti-tumourigenic functions through cytoplasmic activities. Surprisingly, important recent research defined growth promoting capabilities of PML, which significantly challenges the notion of a 'classic' tumour suppressor. Through metabolic reprogramming, PML can afford a selective advantage for tumor cells in certain settings. The multiple forms in which PML exists are the likely explanation of this functional diversity. This behavioral ambiguity however raises a significant challenge to the design of strategies to therapeutically target PML. In this review we discuss this change of paradigm in the PML field and its ramifications, particularly for tailoring cancer therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

The expression MEIS1 in HOX11(+) cell lines was significantly lower than that in HOX11(-) cell lines (0.392 +/- 0.226,0.378 +/- 0.317 vs 1.059 +/- 0.533, both P < 0.05) and the expression level of MEIS1 in HOX11(+) T-ALL patients (0.462 +/- 0.281) significantly lower than that in HOX11(-) T-ALL patients (0.916 +/- 0.437) (P < 0.01). The relationship between MEIS1 and HOX11 mRNA expression level had a negative correlation (rs = -0.416, P < 0.01) . The expression level of MEIS1 gene was negatively correlated with the methylation of CpG island in promoter region in T-ALL (rs = -0.383, P < 0.01) . CONCLUSIONS: The expression of MEIS1 becomes down-regulated or even lost by promoter methylation in T-ALL. HOX11 maybe a negative regulator of MEIS1 gene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MAb ZCH-2B8a (2B8a) was a novel antibody generated in our laboratory, which presented potential to be a therapeutic agent for hematologic malignancies. METHODS: We investigated the reactivity profile of 2B8a mAb, identified the targeting antigen by proteomic and genetic approaches and evaluated its potential to exert tumor cell killing. RESULTS: 2B8a antigen was strictly expressed on lymph tissues and hematopoietic cells (mainly leukocytes), and was highly expressed on B-lineage leukemia cell lines and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells from patients. 2B8a antibody was quickly internalized into the target cells once binding to the antigen, but was capable of killing tumor cells through complement dependent cytotoxicity. To identify the 2B8a antigen, the proteins of Raji cells were immunoprecipitated with 2B8a antibody and analyzed by mass spectrometry, which indicated that coronin-1a was a potential candidate. Then, coronin-1a gene was cloned from Raji cells, inserted into plasmid pcDNA3.1 (+), and transfected into CHO cells. The intracellular 2B8a antigen level was significantly increased in the coronin-1a transfectant cell line. CONCLUSION: 2B8a mAb is a novel antibody targeting coronin-1a, which has the potential to be a therapeutic agent for B-lineage malignancies.",,20140219,['NOTNLM'],"['Coronin-1a', 'internalization', 'leukemia', 'monoclonal antibody', 'targeting therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive power of hypogammaglobulinemia at Bonet stage A. METHODS: Using the database of the Israeli CLL Study Group, we analyzed the relationship between low serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM; the presence of paraproteinemia, as well as other well-recognized prognostic markers in CLL; and time to first treatment (TTT) and overall survival. A total of 1113 patients consecutively diagnosed during the last 25 yrs with Binet stage A CLL were evaluated, and baseline information on serum immunoglobulin levels was found in 857 of the cases. RESULTS: Overall survival times correlated with age >65 yr, male gender, the presence of lymphadenopathy, high serum beta 2-microglobulin (b2m), CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, but not with low levels of immunoglobulin or the presence of paraproteinemia. By univariate analysis, patients with low IgA levels had a shorter TTT; however, on multivariate analysis, the presence of lymphadenopathy (P 0.02), b2m (P 0.04), CD38 (P < 0.001), and ZAP-70 (P < 0.001) was the only laboratory parameters with prognostic significance.

Experimental evidence suggests involvement of cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the development of PM-associated pathological states; however, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In the current study, we analyzed short-term epigenetic response to PM10 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mum) exposure in mouse ascitic RAW264.7 macrophages (BALB/C Abelson murine leukemia virus-induced tumor). Ambient PM10 was collected using a high volume sampler in Little Rock, AR. Analysis revealed that PM10 was composed mainly of Al and Fe, and the water soluble organic fraction was dominated by aliphatic and carbohydrate fragments and minor quantities of aromatic components. Exposure to PM10 compromised the cellular epigenome at concentrations 10-200 microg/ml. Specifically, epigenetic alterations were evident as changes in the methylation and expression of repetitive element-associated DNA and associated DNA methylation machinery. These results suggest that epigenetic alterations, in concert with cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation, might contribute to the pathogenesis of PM-associated respiratory diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",20140217,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'air pollution', 'repetitive elements']",PMC4162398,"['UL1 TR000039/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1TR000039/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2TR000063/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R15 ES022781/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016460-11/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 BX002425/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'KL2 TR000063/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103429/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016460/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20GM103429-11/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS624221'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with hematologic diseases are the most risky candidate for S. maltophilia pneumonia or sepsis because of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia or immunodeficiency. Frequent exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and prolonged insertion of central venous catheter further enhance the risk of S. maltophilia infection. One of the most severe S. maltophilia infections is hemorrhagic pneumonia. This type of infection is mostly fatal because of pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage that leads to acute respiratory failure. Furthermore, S. maltophilia exhibits a high-level intrinsic resistance to conventional antibiotics such as beta-lactams and aminoglycosides and, more recently, the increasing acquired resistance to co-trimoxazole and quinolones. According to our experienced and previously reported cases, all of the patients with hemorrhagic pneumonia caused by S. maltophilia had a fatal course within a few days after the onset of the pneumonia. In this article, we perform a systematic review on a total 30 cases of hemorrhagic pneumonia induced by S. maltophilia from our institutions and the literature, and we describe its early diagnosis, prophylaxis, and recommended therapeutic strategy for the infection in the treatment of hematologic disease.",,20140218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PHF23 plant homeodomain (PHD) motif is known to bind to H3K4me3 residues, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the NP23 protein binds to chromatin at a specific subset of H3K4me3 sites, including at Hoxa, Hoxb, and Meis1. Treatment of NP23 cells with disulfiram, which inhibits the binding of PHD motifs to H3K4me3, rapidly and selectively killed NP23-expressing myeloblasts; cell death was preceded by decreased expression of Hoxa, Hoxb, and Meis1.

Sixty-three patients with SMM were analyzed who received at least two wb-MRIs for follow-up before progression into MM. Radiological progressive disease (MRI-PD) was defined as detection of new FL or increase in diameter of existing FL and a novel or progressive diffuse infiltration. Radiological stable disease (MRI-SD) was defined by no change compared with the prior MRI. Patients were followed-up every 3-6 months, including a serological and clinical evaluation. One Hundred and eighty-two wb-MRIs were analyzed. MRI-PD occurred in 31 patients (49%), and 25 (40%) patients developed MM. MRI-PD was highly significantly associated with progression into MM, regardless of findings at the initial MRI. In multivariate analysis, MRI-PD remained a risk factor, independent of relevant baseline parameters like serum monoclonal protein or 95% aberrant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Patients with MRI-SD had no higher risk of progression, even when FL were present at the initial MRI. Therefore, MRI is suitable for the follow-up of patients with SMM.",,20140218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sf3b1(+/-) mice had a significantly reduced number of hematopoietic stem cells (CD34(-)cKit(+)ScaI(+)Lin(-) cells or CD34(-)KSL cells) compared with Sf3b1(+/+) mice, but hematopoiesis was grossly normal in Sf3b1(+/-) mice. When transplanted competitively with Sf3b1(+/+) bone marrow cells, Sf3b1(+/-) stem cells showed compromised reconstitution capacity in lethally irradiated mice. There was no increase in the number of ring sideroblasts or evidence of myeloid dysplasia in Sf3b1(+/-) mice. These data suggest that SF3B1 plays an important role in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells, whereas SF3B1 haploinsufficiency itself is not associated with the myelodysplastic syndrome phenotype with ring sideroblasts.",,20140218,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this for Hoxa9, we compared the leukemogenic potential of the wild-type Hoxa9, which undergoes natural splicing, with a full-length Hoxa9 construct, which was engineered to prevent natural splicing (Hoxa9FLim). Inability to undergo splicing significantly reduced in vivo leukemogenicity compared to Hoxa9-wild-typed. Importantly, Hoxa9FLim could compensate for the reduced oncogenicity by collaborating with the natural splice variant Hoxa9T, as co-expression of Hoxa9T and Hoxa9FLim induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after a comparable latency time as wild-type Hoxa9. Hoxa9T on its own induced AML after a similar latency as Hoxa9FLim, despite its inability to bind DNA.

Although the occurrence of t(9;22) in healthy individuals has been previously demonstrated, the number of studies is limited and the results are inconsistent. The present study screened for the presence of bcrabl transcripts in the blood of a group of healthy individuals using a sensitivenested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) assay. Samples were collected from 189 healthy volunteers (145 adults and 44 children). RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified by two rounds of PCR, amplifying the two common variants of bcrabl transcripts, p190 and p210. While the bcrabl p190 transcript was not detected, the p210 transcript was detected in ~10% of samples. Notably, the incidence of p210 translocation was higher in males (12.2%) compared with females (7.7%) and males were 2.4 times more likely to have the translocation. A significant incidence was also observed in adults compared with children, where adults were 6 times more likely to have the translocation. The presence of bcrabl transcripts in the blood of a significant proportion of healthy individuals should be considered in longterm investigations to establish its exact association with the risk of developing leukemia. Furthermore, the current assays should be revised to consider the proportion of normal samples carrying the p210 transcripts when making a differential diagnosis.",,20140213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of SPARC in other subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is not fully understood, particularly in the del(5q) type with a complex karyotype, which has a high risk to transform into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the present study, we investigated the role of SPARC in the proliferation and apoptosis of SKM-1 cells, an acute myeloid leukemia cell line transformed from an MDS cell line. SKM-1 cells were infected with SPARC-RNAi-LV or NC-GFP-LV lentivirus. Apoptosis and cell cycle profiling were assessed by flow cytometry, and cell proliferation was evaluated by MTS assay. The mRNA and protein expression levels of SPARC, p53, caspase-3, caspase-9 and Fas were detected by RT-PCR, real-time PCR and western blot assay. The SPARC shRNA constructed by us led to a significant reduction in SPARC expression in SKM-1 cells. SPARC knockdown inhibited the proliferation of SKM-1 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1/G0 phase and apoptosis. SPARC knockdown elevated the expression of p53, caspase-9, caspase-3 and Fas at both the mRNA and protein levels. SPARC silencing inhibited the growth of AML transformed from MDS by activating p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These data indicate that SPARC acts as an oncogene in transformed MDS/AML and is a potential therapeutic target in MDS/AML.",,20140207,,,PMC3976133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism of action of this phytochemical remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of beta-elemene in the mouse melanoma cell line B16F10. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. beta-Elemene inhibited B16F10 melanoma cell metastasis, examined using scratch and Transwell migration/invasion assays. The mRNA and protein expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), the uPA receptor (uPAR), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 were assayed using real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, and western blotting methods. The results indicated that beta-elemene inhibited the viability of B16F10 melanoma cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. The migratory and invasive capacities of B16F10 cells were also inhibited by beta-elemene. The expression of uPA, uPAR, MMP-2, and MMP-9 was reduced by beta-elemene at both the mRNA and protein level. beta-Elemene inhibits the metastasis of B16F10 melanoma cells through downregulation of the expression of uPA, uPAR, MMP-2, and MMP-9.

We sought to determine the prevalence of obesity in pediatric ALL survivors and examine risk factors for obesity through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed from its inception through 2013. Studies met the inclusion criteria if they (1) included at least 10 survivors of pediatric ALL; (2) assessed the prevalence or indicators of obesity; and (3) compared obesity among ALL survivors to a reference population or external control group. Extracted data included patient and treatment characteristics, study design, population used for comparison, and prevalence of obesity. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Despite significant heterogeneity among the studies (I(2) = 96%), the mean BMI z score in 1742 pediatric ALL survivors was 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.60-1.06), which corresponds to the 80th BMI percentile, indicating a significantly higher BMI in pediatric ALL survivors than the reference population. Subgroup analyses found a high prevalence of obesity in ALL survivors regardless of survivors' receipt of cranial irradiation, gender, or age at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is prevalent in pediatric ALL survivors and is independent of patient- and treatment-related characteristics. Clinicians need to screen for obesity and its associated health conditions early in survivorship.",,20140217,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'obesity', 'pediatric', 'survivors']",PMC3934345,"['P30 DK046200/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025752/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000073/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30DK46200/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have reported our experience of treating AML without leukapheresis. METHODS: From November 1, 1995, to May 31, 2012, there were 74 children (</=18 years old) with de novo AML other than acute promyelocytic leukemia. Seventeen patients had an initial WBC count >/= 100 x 10(9)/L. Prompt chemotherapy was started within hours whereas leukapheresis was not performed. RESULTS: The median age of the 17 patients with hyperleukocytosis was 7.4 years (range: 0-16 years), and the median initial WBC count was 177 x 10(9)/L (range: 117-635 x 10(9)/L). The median time between admission and initiation of chemotherapy was 4.5 hours (range: 2-72 hours) in patients with hyperleukocytosis, whereas it was 13 hours (range: 2-120 hours) in those without hyperleukocytosis. Seven patients (7/17, 41%) had one or more early complications before or during the first 2 weeks of chemotherapy. Fifteen of the 16 patients who received prompt chemotherapy achieved complete remission (93.8%), comparable with those without hyperleukocytosis (98.2%; p = 0.33).

AIM: This study analyses the clinicopathologic features and diagnostic processes of ATL patients in Taiwan. METHODS: ATL patients diagnosed and treated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from 1998 through 2010 were retrospectively identified. The diagnosis of ATL was confirmed by in situ detection of human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) when necessary. Patients' data were reviewed and analysed. RESULTS: Fourteen ATL patients were identified, among whom six (42.9%) had an antecedent diagnosis of other malignant lymphomas before the ATL diagnosis, including two diagnosed with Hodgkin disease (HD), one with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, two with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and one with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Of the 14 patients, eight (57%) were subclassified as the acute type, three (21.4%) as the lymphoma type, and three (21.4%) as the chronic type ATL. Five of six (83.3%) patients with initial non-ATL misdiagnosis were diagnosed with non-acute type ATL. In particular, a patient with an antecedent diagnosis of HD presented with typical Reed-Sternberg (RS)-like cells harbouring Epstein-Barr virus genomes in affected lymph nodes. The patient progressed to acute type ATL 3 years after the initial diagnosis, and HTLV-1 genomes were identified in the previous RS-like cells. CONCLUSION: In non-endemic areas, such as Taiwan, ATL, particularly the non-acute type, may mimic other lymphomas and easily be misdiagnosed. HTLV-1 serology should be routinely screened in all malignant lymphoma patients. In situ detection of HTLV-1 is helpful in cases with diagnostic dilemmas.","['(c) 2014 The Authors; Internal Medicine Journal (c) 2014 Royal Australasian', 'College of Physicians.']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma', 'Hodgkin disease', 'Reed-Sternberg-like cell', 'human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1', 'in situ hybridisation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though, many techniques have been developed for genome-wide analysis of fusion genes, a more efficient method is desired. RESULTS: We introduced a new method of detecting the novel fusion gene by using GeneChip Exon Array that enables exon expression analysis on a whole-genome scale and TAIL-PCR. To screen genes with abnormal exon expression profiles, we developed computational program, and confirmed that the program was able to search the fusion partner gene using Exon Array data of T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines. It was reported that the T-ALL cell lines, ALL-SIL, BE13 and LOUCY, harbored the fusion gene NUP214-ABL1, NUP214-ABL1 and SET-NUP214, respectively. The program extracted the candidate genes with abnormal exon expression profiles: 1 gene in ALL-SIL, 1 gene in BE13, and 2 genes in LOUCY. The known fusion partner gene NUP214 was included in the genes in ALL-SIL and LOUCY. Thus, we applied the proposed program to the detection of fusion partner genes in other tumors. To discover novel fusion genes, we examined 24 breast cancer cell lines and 20 pancreatic cancer cell lines by using the program. As a result, 20 and 23 candidate genes were obtained for the breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines respectively, and seven genes were selected as the final candidate gene based on information of the EST data base, comparison with normal cell samples and visual inspection of Exon expression profile. Finding of fusion partners for the final candidate genes was tried by TAIL-PCR, and three novel fusion genes were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The usefulness of our detection method was confirmed. Using this method for more samples, it is thought that fusion genes can be identified.",,20140218,,,PMC3937068,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing studies are sparse for other lymphohaematopoietic cancer subtypes, such as myeloproliferative disease (MPD) and the related chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). We pooled data from three petroleum worker nested case-control studies to address this gap. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically examine the relationship between MPD and quantitative benzene exposure. METHODS: There were 28 cases and 122 matched controls for CML and 30 MPD cases with 124 matched controls. Two haematopathologists identified each case and provided a diagnosis certainty score. Blinded data-driven assessments estimated benzene exposure for each job held by study participants. Statistical analyses included conditional logistic regression and penalised smoothing splines. RESULTS: Benzene exposures were low, and mean average exposure intensity for CML cases was 0.3 ppm and for MPD cases 0.17 ppm. Categorical analyses showed no increased risk of CML or MPD with benzene exposure. There was no significantly increased risk identified for more highly exposed terminal workers. Some association was seen in spline analyses between increased risk of MPD and benzene exposure experienced in the 2-20 years before diagnosis and with peak exposures considered with cumulative exposure as a continuous variable. CONCLUSIONS: No convincing association was identified between MPD or CML and low exposure to benzene. The greater risk for exposures experienced in the 20 years before diagnosis needs investigating in more powerful studies with a wider range of exposure to benzene, and the biological plausibility further examined from a mechanistic viewpoint.",,20140214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient survived in her third complete remission (CR) for over 4 years. In her first CR, the patient was treated with multiple-agent chemotherapy and underwent maintenance therapy with imatinib and monthly vincristine and prednisolone (VP). At the first relapse, an examination of the bone marrow revealed a transformation into acute lymphoblastic leukemia and an F317L mutation in BCR-ABL1 gene, which responded preferentially to nilotinib over dasatinib. She achieved second CR, and nilotinib with VP therapy was selected for maintenance treatment. At second relapse, BCR-ABL1 mutational analysis revealed Y253H mutation instead of F317L mutation, resulting in resistance to nilotinib. The patient achieved third CR with dasatinib and VP therapy, and maintained CR with this treatment.

Retrospective cohort study was conducted in two French University Hospitals. Patients with type 1 CG were identified using laboratory databases. Inclusion criterion was the presence of persistent symptoms of CG. Among 227 screened patients, 36 were included. Skin or vasomotor symptoms were the most frequent features (75%). Nephropathy and neuropathy occurred in 30% and 47% of cases, respectively. The underlying B cell disease (BCD) was a nonmalignant monoclonal gammopathy (NMMG) in 13 (36%) and a hematologic malignancy (HM) in 23 (64%; Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) in 12, low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in 6, multiple myeloma (MM) in 4, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 1 patient. Severe manifestations affected half the patients and were more frequent with IgG (82 vs. 30% (P = 0.006)). At last follow-up, 64% of patients had suffered no hematologic manifestation. Potent chemotherapeutic regimens were mainly used in HM. For patients with NMMG, WM, or NHL, fludarabine or rituximab-based regimens appeared to yield better responses. Five-year survival rate was 82%. In multivariate analysis, mortality was significantly higher in older patients (HR: 1.17 per year [95% CI: 1.06-1.28], P = 0.001) and those with nephropathy (HR: 8.9 [95% CI: 1.9-43], P = 0.006). Kidney disease, infections, Richter's transformation, and second malignancies were important sources of morbi-mortality. Despite its limitations, this series provide novel information regarding type 1 CG. Further studies are needed to improve its management. To date, therapeutic strategy should be tailored according to patient's characteristics (age, comorbidities, underlying BCD), and therapeutic target.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disruption of vessel integrity is an important feature in many physiological and pathological processes. We previously reported that lymphoblastic leukemia-derived sequence 1 (LYL1) is required for the late stages of postnatal angiogenesis to limit the formation of new blood vessels, notably by regulating the activity of the small GTPase Rap1. In this study, we show that LYL1 is also required during the formation of the mature endothelial barrier in the lungs of adult mice. Specifically, LYL1 knockdown in human endothelial cells downregulated the expression of ARHGAP21 and ARHGAP24, which encode two Rho GTPase-activating proteins, and this was correlated with increased RhoA activity and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton into stress fibers. Importantly, in lungs of Lyl1-deficient mice, both vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and p120-catenin were poorly recruited to endothelial adherens junctions, indicative of defective cell-cell junctions. Consistent with this, higher Evans blue dye extravasation, edema, and leukocyte infiltration in the lung parenchyma of Lyl1-/- mice than in wild-type littermates confirmed that lung vascular permeability is constitutively elevated in Lyl1-/- adult mice. Our data show that LYL1 acts as a stabilizing signal for adherens junction formation by operating upstream of VE-cadherin and of the two GTPases Rap1 and RhoA. As increased vascular permeability is a key feature and a major mechanism of acute respiratory distress syndrome, molecules that regulate LYL1 activity could represent additional tools to modify the endothelial barrier permeability.",,20140214,['NOTNLM'],"['RhoA', 'bHLH', 'lymphoblastic leukemia-derived sequence 1', 'vascular endothelial-cadherin', 'vascular permeability']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification that the Src kinase Lyn and its substrate HS1 are over-expressed in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and involved in resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis, prompted us to investigate the role of cortactin, an HS1 homolog, in the pathogenesis and progression of this disorder. In this study, we observed that cortactin is over-expressed in leukemic cells of patients (1.10 +/- 0.12) with respect to normal B lymphocytes (0.19 +/- 0.06; P=0.0065). Fifty-three percent of our patients expressed the WT mRNA and p80/85 protein isoforms, usually lacking in normal B lymphocytes which express the SV1 variant and the p70/75 protein isoforms. Moreover, we found an association of the cortactin overexpression and negative prognostic factors, including ZAP-70 (P<0.01), CD38 (P<0.01) and somatic hypermutations in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (P<0.01). Our results show that patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia express high levels of cortactin with a particular overexpression of the WT isoform that is lacking in normal B cells, and a correlation to poor prognosis, suggesting that this protein could be relevant in the pathogenesis and aggressiveness of the disease.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],20140214,,,PMC4040911,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HNRNPA0, which encodes an RNA-binding protein shown to regulate transcript stability via binding to the AU-rich elements of mRNAs, is located within the commonly deleted segment of 5q31.2 in myeloid neoplasms with a del(5q), and is expressed at haploinsufficient levels in these patients. We show that HNRNPA0 is normally highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and exhibits dynamic changes in expression during the course of differentiation. To model HNRNPA0 haploinsufficiency, we used RNAi interference in primary murine cells and an experimental cell system, and found that reduced Hnrnpa0 expression leads to a shift from monocytic towards granulocytic differentiation. Microarray-based global expression profiling revealed that Hnrnpa0 knockdown disproportionally impacts AU-rich containing transcripts and alters expression of myeloid specification genes. In therapy-related myeloid neoplasms with a del(5q), AU-rich containing mRNAs are enriched in transcripts that encode proteins associated with increased growth and proliferation. Our findings implicate haploinsufficiency of HNRNPA0 as one of the key initiating mutations in the pathogenesis of myeloid neoplasms with a del(5q), and suggest that therapies that target AU-rich elements warrant consideration in efforts to develop new mechanism-based treatment strategies.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],20140214,,,PMC4040907,"['UL1 TR000430/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA040046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of sialylation regulation of cancer multidrug resistance (MDR) remains poorly understood. This study investigated sialylation in modification on MDR in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, the composition profiling of sialylated N-glycans differed in three pairs of AML cell lines. Real-time PCR showed the differential expressional profiles of 20 sialyltransferase (ST) genes in the both AML cell lines and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) of AML patients. The expression levels of ST3GAL5 and ST8SIA4 were detected, which were overexpressed in HL60 and HL60/adriamycin-resistant (ADR) cells. The altered levels of ST3GAL5 and ST8SIA4 were found in close association with the MDR phenotype changing of HL60 and HL60/ADR cells both in vitro and in vivo. Further data demonstrated that manipulation of these two genes' expression modulated the activity of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway and its downstream target thus regulated the proportionally mutative expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and MDR-related protein 1 (MRP1), both of which are known to be involved in MDR. Blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway by its specific inhibitor LY294002 or by Akt small interfering RNA resulted in the reduced chemosensitivity of HL60/ADR cells. Therefore, this study indicated that sialylation involved in the development of MDR of AML cells probably through ST3GAL5 or ST8SIA4 regulating the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling and the expression of P-gp and MRP1.",,20140217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The retrospective study conducted at the general medicine departments of Ege University Hospital in Izmir, Turkey, included 209 patients (115 females, 94 males) 65 years or older, who had been admitted to the hospital for a variety of reasons between April 1, 2011, and October 1, 2011. The following tools were used to collect data: a data collection form to identify the sociodemographic and medical characteristics of the patients, the Braden Risk Assessment Scale to assess the risk of PrUs, and a form to monitor PrUs, which included the site of the PrU, the category, and the PUSH (Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing) score, a tool for tracking changes in PrUs status applied at weekly intervals. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 73 (6.4) years. The prevalence of PrUs was 5.8% during the hospital stay. Pressure ulcers appeared most frequently in the ischeal tuberosity area (40%), and 45.2% of all PrUs observed were category II. The comorbidities of the patients who had PrUs were as follows: rheumatoid arthritis, 40% (n = 5); acute renal failure, 24% (n = 3); multiple myeloma, 8% (n = 1); chronic renal failure, 8% (n = 1); pneumonia, 8% (n = 1); and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 8% (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Pressure ulcers are a common healthcare complication in the older adult population, with potentially severe consequences. The most important intervention that healthcare professionals can make to reduce PrUs is to determine and address risk factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with splenectomy and interferon-alpha historically belonged to the first steps of therapeutic options, achieving partial responses/remissions (PR) in most cases with a median survival between 4 and 6 years in the 1980s. The introduction of the purine analogs (PA) pentostatin and cladribine made HCL a well-treatable disease: overall complete response rates (CRR) range from 76 to 98%, with a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 16 years a normal lifespan can be reached and HCL-related deaths are rare. However, insufficient response to PA with poorer prognosis and relapse rates of 30-40% after 5-10 years of follow-up may require alternative strategies. Minimal residual disease can be detected by additional examinations of bone marrow specimens after treatment with PA. The use of immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAB) like rituximab as a single agent or in combination with a PA or more recently clinical trials with recombinant immunotoxins (RIT) show promising results to restrict these problems.

The IDH1 mutations lead to a loss of its normal enzymatic activity and acquisition of neomorphic activity in production of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which finally cause alterations of multiple gene expression of tumorigenesis-associated alpha-KG-dependent enzymes. The aim of this study was to determine whether IDH1 p.R132 mutations are involved in the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 87 Han Chinese patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were analyzed by direct DNA sequencing for IDH1 p.R132 mutations. The expression levels of multiple alpha-KG-dependent enzymes and associated genes were quantified in HepG2 cells overexpressing IDH1 p.R132 mutants by Western blotting and real-time PCR. RESULTS: None of 87 Han Chinese patients with HCC harbored any IDH1 p.R132 mutations. The protein levels of HIF-1alpha and histone methylation marker (H3K4me3 and H3K79me2) were determined in HepG2 cells overexpressing IDH1 p.R132 mutants, but we discerned no difference. Measurement of mRNA expression levels of VEGF, GLUT1, and HOXA genes also showed no significant difference between cells overexpressing IDH1 wild-type and p.R132 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Our negative results, together with some previous reports of the absence of IDH1 p.R132 mutations in HCC tissues, suggests that IDH1 p.R132 mutations are not actively involved in the development of HCC.",,20140214,,,PMC3930585,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we suggested that myeloperoxidase (MPO) was the key enzyme because it promotes generation of powerful oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) which, reacting with DNA, causes leukemogenesis. In this study, using a whole-human-genome oligonucleotide microarray to clarify the relationships between myelotoxicity of benzene and MPO, we analyzed the genome-wide expression profiles of HL-60 human promyelocytic cell lines exposed to 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT) with or without MPO inhibition. The microarray analysis revealed that short (1 h) and longer (4 h) exposure to BT changed the expression in HL-60 cells of 1,213 or 1,214 genes associated with transcription, RNA metabolic processes, immune response, apoptosis, cell death, and biosynthetic processes (|Z-score|> 2.0), and that these changes were dramatically lessened by MPO-specific inhibition. The presence of functionally important genes and, specifically, genes related to apoptosis, carcinogenesis, regulation of transcription, immune responses, oxidative stress, and cell-cycle regulation were further validated by real-time RT-PCR. Gene expression profiles along with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation analysis suggest that BT-induced DNA halogenation by MPO is a primary reaction in the leukemogenesis associated with benzene.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

METHODS: SMOX, apoptosis, and DNA damage were measured in gastric epithelial cells from H. pylori-infected Egfr(wa5) mice (which have attenuated EGFR activity), Egfr wild-type mice, or in infected cells incubated with EGFR inhibitors or deficient in EGFR. A phosphoproteomic analysis was performed. Two independent tissue microarrays containing each stage of disease, from gastritis to carcinoma, and gastric biopsy specimens from Colombian and Honduran cohorts were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: SMOX expression and DNA damage were decreased, and apoptosis increased in H. pylori-infected Egfr(wa5) mice. H. pylori-infected cells with deletion or inhibition of EGFR had reduced levels of SMOX, DNA damage, and DNA damage(high) apoptosis(low) cells. Phosphoproteomic analysis showed increased EGFR and erythroblastic leukemia-associated viral oncogene B (ERBB)2 signaling. Immunoblot analysis showed the presence of a phosphorylated (p)EGFR-ERBB2 heterodimer and pERBB2; knockdown of ErbB2 facilitated apoptosis of DNA damage(high) apoptosis(low) cells. SMOX was increased in all stages of gastric disease, peaking in tissues with intestinal metaplasia, whereas pEGFR, pEGFR-ERBB2, and pERBB2 were increased predominantly in tissues showing gastritis or atrophic gastritis. Principal component analysis separated gastritis tissues from patients with cancer vs those without cancer. pEGFR, pEGFR-ERBB2, pERBB2, and SMOX were increased in gastric samples from patients whose disease progressed to intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia, compared with patients whose disease did not progress. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of gastric tissues from mice and patients, we identified a molecular signature (based on levels of pEGFR, pERBB2, and SMOX) for the initiation of gastric carcinogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2014 AGA Institute.

We previously demonstrated that HLA class II ligands can be divided into DM-resistant and DM-sensitive antigens. In contrast to presentation of DM-resistant antigens, presentation of DM-sensitive antigens is suppressed by HLA-DM but can be rescued by HLA-DO. We also showed that HLA-DO expression remains low in nonhematopoietic cells under inflammatory conditions, suggesting that DM-sensitive antigens may be ideal T cell targets with a low risk for graft-versus-host disease. Here, we demonstrated that B cell malignancies often express HLA-DO and that levels are in particular high in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, we showed that surface presentation of DM-sensitive antigens is regulated by HLA-DO, and that DM-sensitive antigens are relevant T cell targets for B cell malignancies and, especially, chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These data open the perspective to target HLA class II ligands with specific processing and presentation behavior for CD4+ T cell therapy of hematological malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The results showed that bovine GCs expressed SST2 receptor and further found that SSTR2 was possibly regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), as a significant increase in protein level of SSTR2 was observed in FSH-treated GCs. For further analysis, endogenous SSTR2 expression was disrupted using small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) and the efficacy of differential silencing of endogenous SSTR2 expression was measured both at transcriptional and translational levels. Transient blockage of SSTR2 evidenced its constitutive action on GCs, as it significantly increased level of cAMP (2.4-folds) and basal progesterone production ( approximately 2-fold, P<0.05) with significant increase (P<0.05) in mRNA levels of StAR and P450ssc without altering estradiol concentration and aromatase mRNA expression. Furthermore, silencing of SSTR2 reduced GCs apoptosis (52.5%, P<0.05) and increased cell proliferation, which was further corroborated by up-regulation in protein expressions of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), inhibition of caspase3 and mRNA level of bcl2-associated-X protein (Bax). These results provide evidence that SSTR2 subtype controls GCs apoptosis, proliferation and hormonal secretions through selective constitutive action, independently of somatostatin (SST). Given the local inhibitory actions of SSTR2 on the gonads, we further found that apoptosis in ssRNAi-2 transfected cells decreased (6.8% vs 1.9%, P<0.05) more strongly on FSH treatment. Apoptotic protein expressions and steroid hormone mRNA levels were correlated with a relative decrease in apoptosis and increase in progesterone production. Our results suggest that SSTR2 may play a crucial role as a local inhibitor of FSH action on GCs apoptosis and steroidogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

K562/DNR overexpressed major enzymes of NHEJ, DNA-PKcs and DNA ligase IV, and K562/DNR repaired DSB more rapidly than K562 after DNA damage by neocarzinostatin (MDR1-independent radiation-mimetic).

We have previously shown that CD56(+) CIK cells (CD3(+)CD56(+) and CD3(-)CD56(+)) are capable of killing precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cell lines. However, the lytic pathways used by CD56(+) PB and CB-CIK cells to kill B-ALL cell lines have not been studied. METHODS: CB and PB-CIK cells were differentiated. CD56(+) CB- and PB-CIK cells were compared for expression of different phenotypic markers and for the lytic pathways used to kill B-ALL cell lines. RESULTS: We found that cytotoxic granule proteins were expressed at higher levels in CD56(+) PB-CIK than in CD56(+) CB-CIK cells. However, CD56(+) CB-CIK cells expressed more tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) compared with CD56(+) PB-CIK cells. We observed that CD56(+) CB-CIK cells used both the NKG2D and TRAIL cytotoxic pathways and were more effective at killing REH cells than CD56(+) PB-CIK cells that used only the NKG2D pathway. In contrast, CD56(+) PB-CIK cells used both NKG2D and TRAIL pathways to kill NALM6 cells, whereas CD56(+) CB-CIK cells used only the NKG2D pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that both the source of CIK and the type of B-ALL cell line have an impact on the intensity of the cytolytic activity and on the pathway used. These findings may have clinical implications with respect to optimizing therapeutic efficacy, which may be dependent on the source of the CIK cells and on the target tumor cells.","['Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

Understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of ESCC becomes critical to develop more effective treatments. METHODS: Mcl-1 expression was measured by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blotting. Human Mcl-1 promoter activity was evaluated by reporter gene assay. The interactions between DNA and transcription factors were confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in vitro and by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in cells. RESULTS: Four human ESCC cell lines, TE-1, Eca109, KYSE150 and KYSE510, are revealed increased levels of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein compare with HaCaT, an immortal non-tumorigenic cell line. Results of reporter gene assays demonstrate that human Mcl-1 promoter activity is decreased by mutation of kappaB binding site, specific NF-kappaB inhibitor Bay11-7082 or dominant inhibitory molecule DNMIkappaBalpha in TE-1 and KYSE150 cell lines. Mcl-1 protein level is also attenuated by Bay11-7082 treatment or co-transfection of DNMIkappaBalpha in TE-1 and KYSE150 cells. EMSA results indicate that NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p65 bind to human Mcl-1-kappaB probe in vitro. ChIP assay further confirm p50 and p65 directly bind to human Mcl-1 promoter in intact cells, by which regulates Mcl-1 expression and contributes to the viability of TE-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provided evidence that one of the mechanisms of Mcl-1 expression in human ESCC is regulated by the activation of NF-kappaB signaling. The newly identified mechanism might provide a scientific basis for developing effective approaches to treatment human ESCC.",,20140217,,,PMC3930545,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many mRNAs have been shown to be differentially expressed in the rat uterus during embryo implantation. However, the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs), a key post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression, in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases are still unknown. Here, an miRNA microarray was used to examine differential expression of miRNAs in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases. Twenty-eight miRNAs were up-regulated and 29 miRNAs were down-regulated at least twofold during the receptive phase in rat uterus; these results were confirmed by Northern blotting. miR-29a was only highly expressed in rat uterus during the implantation period, and activation of delayed implantation and artificial decidualization enhanced the miR-29a level. Further investigation revealed that both the pro-apoptotic factor genes Bak1 and Bmf and the anti-apoptotic factor gene Bcl-w are targets of miR-29a. There was weak binding between miR-29a and the 3' UTR of the anti-apoptotic factor gene Mcl1. Over-expression of miR-29a inhibited the late apoptosis of endometrial stromal cells, which may be due to the stronger binding capacity between miR-29a and the 3' UTR of pro-apoptotic factors than that between miR-29a and the 3' UTR of anti-apoptotic factors. Collectively, miR-29a plays an important role during embryo implantation by regulating both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors. miR-29a may predominantly bind pro-apoptotic factors, leading to inhibition of cell apoptosis.",['(c) 2014 FEBS.'],20140307,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2 family', 'embryo implantation', 'miR-29a', 'miRNAs', 'rat uterus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development of this monoclonal antibody therapy began in the late 1980s. In 1994, rituximab received its first approval for the treatment of NHL by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Rituximab has since been approved for additional indications and has transformed medical practice. However, the social and political implications of these rapid successes are only beginning to become clear. In this commentary, key events in the rapid translation of rituximab from the bench to bedside are highlighted and placed into this historical framework. To accomplish this, the story of rituximab is divided into the following six topics, which we believe to be widely applicable to case studies of translation: (1) underlying disease, (2) key basic science, (3) key clinical studies in translation, (4) FDA approval process, (5) changes to medical practice, and (6) the social and political influences on translation.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",20131003,['NOTNLM'],"['hematology', 'hematopathology', 'immunotherapy', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'oncology']",PMC4264563,['UL1 TR000135/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS646495'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with advanced haematological malignancies who are not eligible for allogeneic transplantation received peripheral blood mononuclear cells from half-matched family donors. For that, a single unstimulated leukapheresis product was incubated with both the anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies conjugated to paramagnetic particles. The depletion procedure was performed on a fully automated CliniMACS device according to the manufacturer's instructions. On average, patients received 2.17 x 10(6)/kg (range 0.9-3.48) gammadelta T cells with <1% CD4- or CD8-positive cells remaining in the product. All patients received prior lymphopenia-inducing chemotherapy (fludarabine 20-25 mg/m(2) day -6 until day -2 and cyclophosphamide 30-60 mg/kg day -6 and -5) and were treated with 4 mg zoledronate on day 0 and 1.0 x 10(6) IU/m(2) IL-2 on day +1 until day +6 for the induction of gammadelta T cell proliferation in vivo. RESULTS: This resulted in a marked in vivo expansion of donor gammadelta T cells and, to a lower extent, natural killer cells and double-negative alphabeta T cells (mean 68-fold, eight-fold, and eight-fold, respectively). Proliferation peaked by around day +8 and donor cells persisted up to 28 days. Although refractory to all prior therapies, three out of four patients achieved a complete remission, which lasted for 8 months in a patient with plasma cell leukaemia. One patient died from an infection 6 weeks after treatment. CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that adoptive transfer and in vivo expansion of haploidentical gammadelta T lymphocytes is feasible and suggests a potential role of these cells in the treatment of haematological diseases.",,20140215,,,PMC3926263,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A mutational analysis of Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) revealed that the V617F mutation was present in granulocytes and in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), but not in the CD34+CD19+ population that mostly consists of Ph+ALL cells, indicating that this Ph+ALL clone did not originate from the ET clone carrying the JAK2-V617F mutation. The minor BCR-ABL1 fusion was detected not only in the CD34+CD19+ population but also in HSPCs and granulocytes, indicating that the Philadelphia chromosome was acquired in an early hematopoietic stage at least prior to the commitment to B cell development. Upon dasatinib treatment, the minor BCR-ABL1 transcript rapidly disappeared in HSPCs but persisted in the CD34+CD19+ population. A relapse of Ph+ALL occurred nine months later without the disappearance of the minor BCR-ABL1 transcript in the bone marrow cells during the treatment course, suggesting that a resistant Ph+ALL clone may have arisen or been selected in the committed B cells rather than in HSPCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study in vitro cytotoxicity of Curcumin was measured by MTT assay and apoptotic effects were assessed by annexin V/PI, DAPI staining, cell cycle analysis, measurement of caspase activity and PARP cleavage. Effects of Curcumin on intracellular redox balance were assessed using fluorescent probes like H2DCFDA, JC1 and an ApoGSH Glutathione Detection Kit respectively. RESULTS: Curcumin showed differential anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on different human leukemic cell lines in contrast to minimal effects on normal cells. Curcumin induced apoptosis was associated with the generation of intracellular ROS, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular GSH depletion, caspase activation. CONCLUSIONS: As Curcumin induces programmed cell death specifically in leukemic cells it holds a great promise as a future therapeutic agent in the treatment of leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most of the previous reports did not show the extent of concurrent methylation of multiple genes in the four leukemia types. Here, we analyzed six key genes (p14, p15, p16, p53, DAPK and TMS1) for DNA methylation using methylation specific PCR to analyze peripheral blood of 78 leukemia patients (24 CML, 25 CLL, 12 AML, and 17 ALL) and 24 healthy volunteers. In CML, methylation was detected for p15 (11%), p16 (9%), p53 (23%) and DAPK (23%), in CLL, p14 (25%), p15 (19%), p16 (12%), p53 (17%) and DAPK (36%), in AML, p14 (8%), p15 (45%), p53 (9%) and DAPK (17%) and in ALL, p15 (14%), p16 (8%), and p53 (8%). This study highlighted an essential role of DAPK methylation in chronic leukemia in contrast to p15 methylation in the acute cases, whereas TMS1 hypermethylation was absent in all cases. Furthermore, hypermethylation of multiple genes per patient was observed, with obvious selectiveness in the 9p21 chromosomal region genes (p14, p15 and p16). Interestingly, methylation of p15 increased the risk of methylation in p53, and vice versa, by five folds (p=0.03) indicating possible synergistic epigenetic disruption of different phases of the cell cycle or between the cell cycle and apoptosis. The investigation of multiple relationships between methylated genes might shed light on tumor specific inactivation of the cell cycle and apoptotic pathways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-proliferative effects have been studied in recent years against colon, breast, cervical and lung cancer cell lines, with promising results. We here extended study of anti-proliferative effects to a blood malignancy, leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two leukemic cell lines, MV4-11 (acute myeloid leukemia) and K562 (chronic myeloid leukemia), were studied. IC50 concentrations were determined and apoptosis and cell cycle regulation were studied by flow cytometric analysis. The expression of apoptosis and cell-cycle related regulatory proteins was assessed by Western blotting. RESULTS: P sacharosa inhibited growth of MV4-11 and K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The mode of cell death was via induction of intrinsic apoptotic pathways and cell cycle arrest. There was profound up-regulation of cytochrome c, caspases, p21 and p53 expression and repression of Akt and Bcl-2 expression in treated cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that P sacharosa induces leukemic cell death via apoptosis induction and changes in cell cycle checkpoint, thus deserves further study for anti-leukemic potential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are limited biomarkers available for prediction of the cause of malignant pleural effusion in clinical practice. Hence, we evaluated pleural levels of five tumor biomarkers (CEA, AFP, CA125, CA153 and CA199) in predicting the cause of malignant pleural effusion in a retrospective study. Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U tests were carried out to compare levels of tumor markers in pleural effusion among different forms of neoplasia - lung squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or small cell carcinoma, mesothelioma, breast cancer, lymphoma/leukemia and miscellaneous. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant differences in levels of pleural effusion CEA (P<0.01), AFP (P<0.01), CA153 (P<0.01) and CA199 (P<0.01), but not CA125 (P>0.05), among the seven groups. Receiver operator characteristic analysis showed that, compared with other four tumor markers, CA153 was the best biomarker in diagnosing malignant pleural effusions of lung adenocarcinoma (area under curve (AUC): 0.838 (95%confidence interval: 0.787, 0.888); cut-off value: 10.2U/ ml; sensitivity: 73.2% (64.4-80.8)%, specificity: 85.2% (77.8-90.8)%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (AUC: 0.716 (0.652, 0.780); cut-off value: 14.2U/ml; sensitivity: 57.6% (50.7-64.3)%, specificity: 91.2% (76.3-98.0)%), and small-cell lung cancer (AUC: 0.812 (0.740, 0.884); cut-off value: 9.7U/ml; sensitivity: 61.5% (55.0-67.8)%, specificity: 94.1% (71.2-99.0)%); CEA was the best biomarker in diagnosing MPEs of mesothelioma (AUC: 0.726 (0.593, 0.858); cut-off value: 1.43ng/ml; sensitivity: 83.7% (78.3-88.2)%, specificity: 61.1% (35.8-82.6)%) and lymphoma/leukemia (AUC: 0.923 (0.872, 0.974); cut-off value: 1.71ng/ml; sensitivity: 82.8% (77.4-87.3)%, specificity: 92.3% (63.9-98.7)%).

Herein, we investigated epigenetic regulation of hMSH2 and its influence on cell growth and overall survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. METHODS: hMSH2 promoter methylation status was assessed by COBRA and pyrosequencing in 60 ALL patients and 30 healthy volunteers. mRNA and protein expression levels of hMSH2, PCNA, CyclinD1, Bcl-2 and Bax were determined by real time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The influence of hMSH2 on cell proliferation and survival was assessed in transient and stable expression systems. RESULTS: mRNA and protein expression of hMSH2 and Bcl-2 was decreased, and that of PCNA, CyclinD1 and Bax was increased in ALL patients as compared to healthy volunteers (P<0.05). hMSH2 was inactivated in ALL patients through promoter hypermethylation. Furthermore, hMSH2 hypermethylation was found in relapsed ALL patients (85.7% of all cases). The median survival of patients with hMSH2 methylation was shorter than that of patients without hMSH2 methylation (log-rank test, P=0.0035). Over-expression of hMSH2 in cell lines resulted in a significant reduction in growth and induction of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that aberrant DNA methylation and epigenetic inactivation of hMSH2 play an important role in the development of ALL through altering cell growth and survival.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: To determine the prevalence of aberrant antigen expression in acute leukemia, assess clinical relevance and demonstrate immunophenotype-karyotype correlations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 73 (40 AML and 33 ALL) newly diagnosed acute leukemia cases presenting to KAMC, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, were included. Diagnosis was based on WHO criteria and FAB classification. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, conventional karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization for gene rearrangements were performed. RESULTS: Aberrant antigens were detected in 27/40 (67.5%) of AML and in 14/33 (42.4%) in ALL cases. There were statistically significant higher TLC in Ly+ AML than in Ly-AML (p=0.05) and significant higher blast count in ALL with aberrant antigens at presentation and day 14 (p=0.005, 0.046). There was no significant relation to clinical response, relapse free survival (RFS) or overall survival (p>0.05), but AML cases expressing >/=2 Ly antigens showed a lower median RFS than those expressing a single Ly antigen. In AML, CD 56 was expressed in 11/40. CD7 was expressed in 7/40, having a significant relation with an unfavorable cytogenetic pattern (p=0.046). CD4 was expressed in 5/40. CD19 was detected in 4/40 AML associated with M2 and t (8; 21). In ALL cases, CD33 was expressed in 7/33 and CD13 in 5/33. Regarding T Ag in B-ALL CD2 was expressed in 2 cases and CD56 in 3 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant antigen expression may be associated with adverse clinical data at presentation. AML cases expressing >/=2 Ly antigens may have shorter median RFS. No specific cytogenetic pattern is associated with aberrant antigen expression but individual antigens may be related to particular cytogenetic patterns.

The median age at diagnosis of AML was 50 yr, with a median transplant-to-AML interval of 3.8 yr and a rapid decline in incidence after 5 yr. 26% of patients were asymptomatic at the time of presentation, and 42% were pancytopenic. M0/M1/M2, M3, M4/M5, and M6/M7 subtypes comprised 17%, 25%, 39%, and 19% of all cases, respectively. 36% of patients had unfavorable cytogenetic risk disease. The median overall survival was only 3 months. We observed several transplant-specific features: (i) The transplant-to-AML interval follows two very different patterns between renal vs. liver transplant patients. (ii) All 4 cases of donor cell leukemia occurred after liver transplant. (iii) Unfavorable risk disease was marginally significantly more common among renal compared with liver transplant patients (P = 0.057). Our results suggest that PT-AML is a separate entity with distinct characteristics, which need to be investigated further in future research. Heavy post-transplant immunosuppression likely plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PT-AML.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2014 Feb 14.,['DQY03U61EJ (Polonium)'],"Polonium-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive element that decays by emitting an alpha particle. It is in the air we breathe and also a component of tobacco smoke. Polonium-210 is used as an anti-static device in printing presses and gained widespread notoriety in 2006 after the poisoning and subsequent death of a Russian citizen in London. More is known about the lethal effects of polonium-210 at high doses than about late effects from low doses. Cancer mortality was examined among 7,270 workers at the Mound nuclear facility near Dayton, OH where polonium-210 was used (1944-1972) in combination with beryllium as a source of neutrons for triggering nuclear weapons. Other exposures included external gamma radiation and to a lesser extent plutonium-238, tritium and neutrons. Vital status and cause of death was determined through 2009. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed for comparisons with the general population. Lifetime occupational doses from all places of employment were sought and incorporated into the analysis. Over 200,000 urine samples were analyzed to estimate radiation doses to body organs from polonium and other internally deposited radionuclides. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate dose-response relationships for specific organs and tissues. Vital status was determined for 98.7% of the workers of which 3,681 had died compared with 4,073.9 expected (SMR 0.90; 95% CI 0.88-0.93). The mean dose from external radiation was 26.1 mSv (maximum 939.1 mSv) and the mean lung dose from external and internal radiation combined was 100.1 mSv (maximum 17.5 Sv). Among the 4,977 radiation workers, all cancers taken together (SMR 0.86; 95% CI 0.79-0.93), lung cancer (SMR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74-0.98), and other types of cancer were not significantly elevated. Cox regression analysis revealed a significant positive dose-response trend for esophageal cancer [relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval at 100 mSv of 1.54 (1.15-2.07)] and a negative dose-response trend for liver cancer [RR (95% CI) at 100 mSv of 0.55 (0.23-1.32)]. For lung cancer the RR at 100 mSv was 1.00 (95% CI 0.97-1.04) and for all leukemias other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) it was 1.04 (95% CI 0.63-1.71). There was no evidence that heart disease was associated with exposures [RR at 100 mSv of 1.06 (0.95-1.18)]. Assuming a relative biological effectiveness factor of either 10 or 20 for polonium and plutonium alpha particle emissions had little effect on the dose-response analyses. Polonium was the largest contributor to lung dose, and a relative risk of 1.04 for lung cancer at 100 mSv could be excluded with 95% confidence. A dose related increase in cancer of the esophagus was consistent with a radiation etiology but based on small numbers. A dose-related decrease in liver cancer suggests the presence of other modifying factors of risk and adds caution to interpretations. The absence of a detectable increase in total cancer deaths and lung cancer in particular associated with occupational exposures to polonium (mean lung dose 159.8 mSv), and to plutonium to a lesser extent (mean lung dose 13.7 mSv), is noteworthy but based on small numbers. Larger combined studies of U.S. workers are needed to clarify radiation risks following prolonged exposures and radionuclide intakes.",,20140214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome these shortcomings of PBSC, we have used a risk-adapted GVHD prophylaxis for patients that received HLA-matched URD-SCT, which was adding low-dose rabbit antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin((R)) , 1.25 mg/kg for 2 d) to conditioning in the transplants with PBSC and not BM. METHODS: To determine whether this strategy is effective, we analyzed 115 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received HLA-matched URD-SCT with PBSC (n = 70) or BM (n = 45) using our risk-adapted GVHD prophylaxis strategy. RESULTS: The PBSC group showed faster neutrophil (11 d vs. 13 d; P < 0.01) and platelet (12 d vs. 18 d; P < 0.01) engraftment compared with the BM group. No difference was observed in the incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV at 100 d (54.3% vs. 64.4%; P = 0.38) and chronic GVHD at 4 yr (65.1% vs. 60.0%; P = 0.83). Other outcomes including the incidence of relapse (30.8% vs. 31.2%; P = 0.53), non-relapse mortality (13.5% vs. 6.9%; P = 0.24), disease-free survival (55.7% vs. 61.9%; P = 0.68), and overall survival (62.2% vs. 63.2%; P = 0.96) at 4 yr were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Our risk-adapted GVHD prophylaxis strategy resulted in similar transplant outcomes including comparable incidence of GVHD between the PBSC and BM groups in HLA-matched URD-SCT.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Leukemogenesis and leukemia cell chemoresistance seem to be supported by neighbouring stromal cells in the bone marrow, and we have therefore investigated the effects of these drugs on primary human endothelial cells and the osteoblastic Cal72 cell line. The results show that VPA and Ara-C have antiproliferative effects, and the antiproliferative/cytotoxic effect of Ara-C was seen at low concentrations corresponding to serum levels found during low-dose in vivo treatment. Furthermore, in functional assays of endothelial migration and tube formation VPA elicited an antiangiogenic effect, whereas ATRA elicited a proangiogenic effect. Finally, VPA and ATRA altered the endothelial cell release of angiogenic mediators; ATRA increased levels of CXCL8, PDGF-AA, and VEGF-D, while VPA decreased VEGF-D and PDGF-AA/BB levels and both drugs reduced MMP-2 levels. Several of these mediators can enhance AML cell proliferation and/or are involved in AML-induced bone marrow angiogenesis, and direct pharmacological effects on stromal cells may thus indirectly contribute to the overall antileukemic activity of this triple drug combination.",,20140108,,,PMC3910457,,,,,,,,,,,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3707-1788', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0725-7242']",,,,,

Here, we identify deregulated apoptotic components in AML stem/progenitor cells and investigate the individual and combinatorial effects of the novel inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein antagonist and second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetic birinapant and demethylating epigenetic modulators. METHODS: Protein expression was measured by reversed-phase protein array in AML patient (n = 511) and normal (n = 21) samples and by western blot in drug-treated cells. The antileukemic activity of birinapant and demethylating agents was assessed in vitro and in an in vivo AML mouse xenograft model (n = 10 mice per group). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Compared with bulk AML cells, CD34(+)38(-) AML stem/progenitors expressed increased cIAP1 and caspase-8 levels and decreased SMAC levels (one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test, P < .001). Birinapant induced death receptor-/caspase-8-mediated apoptosis in AML cells, including in AML stem/progenitor cells, but not in normal CD34(+) cells. Demethylating agents modulated extrinsic apoptosis pathway components and, when combined with birinapant, were highly synergistic in vitro (combination index < 1), and also more effective in vivo (P < .001, by Student t test, for the median survival of birinapant plus 5-azacytadine vs birinapant alone or vs controls). CONCLUSIONS: cIAP1, SMAC, and caspase-8 appear to play a role in AML stem cell survival, and synergistic targeting of these cells with birinapant and demethylating agents shows potential utility in leukemia therapy.",,,,,PMC3952202,"['P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the treated cells, proliferation was inhibited and the occurrence of cell apoptosis and cell death were detected. Erythroid differentiation assay was explored, and we found that Res could increase the expression of glycophorin A (GPA), HBA1, HBB, and gamma-globin genes and enforced the expression of GPA, CD71, and Band3 proteins. Res also induced K562 cell autophagy when the concentration of Res was increased up to 50 or 100 muM.

Despite high remission rates with chemotherapy standard-of-care treatment, the disease eventually relapses in a major proportion of patients. Activating Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations are found in approximately 30% of patients with AML. Targeting FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase has shown encouraging results in treating FLT3-mutated AML. Responses, however, are not sustained and acquired resistance has been a clinical challenge. Treatment options to overcome resistance are currently the focus of research. We report here the preclinical evaluation of AMG 925, a potent, selective, and bioavailable FLT3/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) dual kinase inhibitor. AMG 925 inhibited AML xenograft tumor growth by 96% to 99% without significant body weight loss. The antitumor activity of AMG 925 correlated with the inhibition of STAT5 and RB phosphorylation, the pharmacodynamic markers for inhibition of FLT3 and CDK4, respectively. In addition, AMG 925 was also found to inhibit FLT3 mutants (e.g., D835Y) that are resistant to the current FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., AC220 and sorafenib). CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that plays an essential central role in regulating cell proliferation in response to external growth signals. A critical role of the CDK4-RB pathway in cancer development has been well established. CDK4-specific inhibitors are being developed for treating RB-positive cancer. AMG 925, which combines inhibition of two kinases essential for proliferation and survival of FLT3-mutated AML cells, may improve and prolong clinical responses.",,20140213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We prospectively studied the incidence of infection-related fever in 38 children, aged 2-16 years, with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) over 121 chemotherapy treatment cycles. A prophylactic group (n = 18) was given either vancomycin/cefepime (400 mg/m(2), q12 h/50 mg/kg, q12 h) or piperacillin/tazobactam (110 mg/kg, q12 h). Control patients (n = 20) received no preventive antibiotics. RESULTS: The prophylactic group (59 treatment cycles) experienced fever less frequently than the control group (0.4 vs. 0.9 events; p < 0.001), had a longer interval between agranulocytosis and fever (6.4 vs. 3.8 days; p = 0.007), had a shorter duration of hospitalization (21.5 vs. 28.5 days; p < 0.001), and had a lower rate of lung infection (38.8 vs. 80.0%; p < 0.001). One patient taking vancomycin experienced a skin rash and 3 patients taking piperacillin/tazobactam had diarrhea; these side effects subsided after antibiotics were discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: In children with AML, prophylactic antibiotics during the period of chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis can effectively reduce the incidence of infectious fever and can shorten the average length of hospital stay, improving treatment success and quality of life.","['(c) 2014 S.

Oncogenic mutations in NOTCH1 are common in human T-cell leukemia and lymphomas. However, loss-of-function somatic mutations in NOTCH1 arising in solid tumors imply a tumor suppressor function, which highlights the need to understand Notch signaling more completely. Here, we describe the small GTPase RhoE/Rnd3 as a downstream mediator of Notch signaling in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) that arise in skin epithelia. RhoE is a transcriptional target of activated Notch1, which is attenuated broadly in SCC cells. RhoE depletion suppresses Notch1-mediated signaling in vitro, rendering primary keratinocytes resistant to Notch1-mediated differentiation and thereby favoring a proliferative cell fate. Mechanistic investigations indicated that RhoE controls a key step in Notch1 signaling by mediating nuclear translocation of the activated portion of Notch1 (N1IC) through interaction with importins. Our results define RhoE as a Notch1 target that is essential for recruitment of N1IC to the promoters of Notch1 target genes, establishing a regulatory feedback loop in Notch1 signaling. This molecular circuitry may inform distinct cell fate decisions to Notch1 in epithelial tissues, where carcinomas such as SCC arise.",['(c)2014 AACR'],20140213,,,PMC4031027,"['AR39190/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR064786/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA097216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR039190/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA140615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA127247,/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA080058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA016038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS565977'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML also has an important role in the regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we show the involvement of the helicase HAGE in the transcriptional repression of PML expression in ABCB5+ malignant melanoma-initiating cells (ABCB5+ MMICs), a population of cancer stem cells which are responsible for melanoma growth, progression and resistance to drug-based therapy. HAGE prevents PML gene expression by inhibiting the activation of the JAK-STAT (janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway in a mechanism which implicates the suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1). Knockdown of HAGE led to a significant decrease in SOCS1 protein expression, activation of the JAK-STAT signalling cascade and a consequent increase of PML expression. To confirm that the reduction in SOCS1 expression was dependent on the HAGE helicase activity, we showed that SOCS1, effectively silenced by small interfering RNA, could be rescued by re-introduction of HAGE into cells lacking HAGE. Furthermore, we provide a mechanism by which HAGE promotes SOCS1 mRNA unwinding and protein expression in vitro. Finally, using a stem cell proliferation assay and tumour xenotransplantation assay in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice, we show that HAGE promotes MMICs-dependent tumour initiation and tumour growth by preventing the anti-proliferative effects of interferon-alpha (IFNalpha). Our results suggest that the helicase HAGE has a key role in the resistance of ABCB5+ MMICs to IFNalpha treatment and that cancer therapies targeting HAGE may have broad implications for the treatment of malignant melanoma.",,20140213,,,PMC3944245,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that Noxa regulates the localization and stability of MCL-1, an anti-apoptotic member, which results in modulating ABT-737 sensitivity. Mutations in Noxa within the BH3 domain, the carboxyl terminus mitochondrial targeting domain, or of ubiquitinated lysines not only change the localization and stability of Noxa itself but also affect the mitochondrial localization and phosphorylation/ubiquitination status of MCL-1 and consequently modulate sensitivity to ABT-737. Results of studies utilizing these mutant proteins indicate that Noxa recruits MCL-1 from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Translocation of MCL-1 initiates its phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination, which triggers proteasome-mediated degradation.

In multivariate analysis, CD34+ absolute count and CD34+ percentage upon total leukocyte count at day 1 (defined as the first day in which leukocytes reached a value > 1 x 10(9)/L) were the only factors able to predict a total harvest >/= 2 x 10(6) CD34+/kg. In patients with day 1 CD34+ lower than 20/muL, the CD34+ percentage was a more reliable predictor of stem cell harvest in the following days than CD34+ absolute count. Upon definition of the best CD34+ cut-off value for identification of poor-mobilizing patients, an algorithm was set up to guide plerixafor administration. It was prospectively validated in 20 patients in 2013 with encouraging results in terms of low incidences of both mobilization failure and plerixafor use.

Forty-one patients (ages 17 to 75 years) with hematologic malignancy underwent HLA-haploidentical HCT after reduced-intensity conditioning containing busulfan, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin. Cell donors (ages 7 to 62 years) underwent growth factor-mobilized leukapheresis for 3 to 4 days. Cells collected on the first 2 to 3 days were used for HCT, whereas those collected on the last day were CD3-depleted and cultured into NK cells using human interleukins-15 and -21. These NK cells were then infused into patients twice at 2 and 3 weeks after HCT at an escalating doses of .2 x 10(8) cells/kg of body weight (3 patients), .5 x 10(8) cells/kg (3 patients), 1.0 x 10(8) cells/kg (8 patients), and >/= 1.0 x 10(8) cells/kg or available cells (27 patients). At all dose levels, no acute toxicity was observed after NK cell infusion. After HLA-haploidentical HCT and subsequent donor NK cell infusion, when referenced to 31 historical patients who had undergone HLA-haploidentical HCT after the same conditioning regimen but without high-dose NK cell infusion, there was no significant difference in the cumulative incidences of major HCT outcomes, including engraftment (absolute neutrophil count >/= 500/muL, 85% versus 87%), grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD, 17% versus 16%), moderate to severe chronic GVHD (15% versus 10%), and transplantation-related mortality (27% versus 19%). There was, however, a significant reduction in leukemia progression (74% to 46%), with post-transplantation NK cell infusion being an independent predictor for less leukemia progression (hazard ratio, .527). Our findings showed that, when given 2 to 3 weeks after HLA-haploidentical HCT, donor-derived NK cells were well tolerated at a median total dose of 2.0 x 10(8) cells/kg. In addition, they may decrease post-transplantation progression of acute leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Transplants were performed in the United States or Japan between 2000 and 2009; patients were aged 16 years or younger, had acute leukemia, were in complete remission, and received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. The median ages of the Japanese and Whites who received ATG were younger at 5 years compared with 8 years for Whites who did not receive ATG. In all groups most transplants were mismatched at 1 or 2 HLA loci. Multivariate analysis found no differences in risks of acute GVHD between the Japanese and Whites. However, chronic GVHD was higher in Whites who did not receive ATG compared with the Japanese (hazard ratio, 2.16; P < .001), and treatment-related mortality was higher in Whites who received ATG compared with the Japanese (relative risk, 1.81; P = .01).

Currently, the diagnosis of ANKL remains challenging. In the current study, we report the clinical, laboratory, immunophenotypic, and genetic findings from 29 cases of de novo ANKL in a single center and evaluate the relative contribution of these features to the diagnosis of ANKL. Clinical features, laboratory findings, morphologic, cytogenetic features, and Epstein-Barr virus status were important factors for diagnosing aggressive NK cell leukemia. On the other hand, ANKL displays a strikingly abnormal immunophenotype in contrast to nonneoplastic NK cells. The immunophenotype of ANKL cells may differ from reactive NK cells in 4 respects. First, the CD45/linear side scatter gating of flow cytometry allows the initial identification of neoplastic subpopulations for additional immunophenotypic analysis in half of ANKL cases. Second, unusual expression of surface antigens in ANKL cells was a prominent feature. Third, the clonality of ANKL cells could be identified using antibodies against CD158a/h, CD158b, or CD158e. Last, the positive rate of Ki-67 expression in ANKL cells was generally high. Based on these findings, we provide an objective marker based on clinical data for the definite diagnosis of ANKL.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Mosby, Inc.

However, to date no effective vaccine or drug against HTLV-1 infection has been developed. In efforts to define the role of antibodies in the control of HTLV-1 infection, we capitalized on the use of our previously defined anti-gp46 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone LAT-27) and high titers of human anti-HTLV-1 IgG purified from HAM/TSP patients (HAM-IgG). LAT-27 and HAM-IgG completely blocked syncytium formation and T cell immortalization mediated by HTLV-1 in vitro. The addition of these antibodies to cultures of CD8(+) T cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HAM/TSP patients at the initiation of culture not only decreased the numbers of Tax-expressing cells and the production of HTLV-1 p24 but also inhibited the spontaneous immortalization of T cells. Coculture of in vitro-HTLV-1-immortalized T cell lines with autologous PBMCs in the presence of LAT-27 or HAM-IgG, but not an F(ab')2 fragment of LAT-27 or nonneutralizing anti-gp46 mAbs, resulted in depletion of HTLV-1-infected cells. A 24-h (51)Cr release assay showed the presence of significant antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity in LAT-27 and HAM-IgG, but not F(ab')2 of LAT-27, resulting in the depletion of HTLV-1-infected T cells by autologous PBMCs. The depletion of natural killer (NK) cells from the effector PBMCs reduced this ADCC activity. Altogether, the present data demonstrate that the neutralizing and ADCC-inducing activities of anti-HTLV-1 antibodies are capable of reducing infection and eliminating HTLV-1-infected cells in the presence of autologous PBMCs.",,20140310,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recruitment ceased upon saturation, with 16 patients and 10 health professionals (hematologists n = 4, nurses n = 3, pharmacists n = 3). RESULTS: Twelve patients reported at least one instance of nonadherence. Reasons for unintentional nonadherence included forgetfulness related to variations of routine and doctor-patient communication issues. Reasons for intentional nonadherence included desires to reduce dose-dependent side effects and insufficient support. Patients who reported higher nonadherence rates felt complacent following periods of sustained disease control or had received conflicting advice regarding nonadherence. Health professionals had difficulty in accurately evaluating medication adherence due to a lack of reliable measures, utilizing patient self-report and manifestations of suboptimal disease control to guide assessments. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Adherence issues persist throughout the course of treatment. While high patient-reported nonadherence rates were recorded, health professionals were often unaware of the complex causes, compounded by an inadequacy of adherence assessment tools. Some patients reported nonadherence events because of insufficient education or lack of access to prompt medical guidance. These issues should be addressed to improve clinical practice.",,20140213,['NOTNLM'],['Imatinib'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, long-term imatinib treatment induces immunosuppression, which is mainly due to T cell dysfunction. Imatinib can reduce TCR-triggered T cell activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases such as Lck, ZAP70, LAT, and PLC gamma 1 early in the TCR signaling pathway. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the superantigen SEA, a potent T cell stimulator, can block the immunosuppressive effects of imatinib on T cells. Our data show that the exposure of primary human T cells and Jurkat cells to SEA for 24 h leads to the upregulation of the Lck and ZAP70 proteins in a dose-dependent manner. T cells treated with SEA prior to TCR binding had increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck, ZAP70, and PLC gamma 1. Pretreatment with SEA prevents the inhibitory effects of imatinib on TCR signaling, which leads to T cell proliferation and IL-2 production. It is conceivable that SEA antagonizes the imatinib-mediated inhibition of T cell activation and proliferation through the TCR signaling pathway.",,20140102,,,PMC3909973,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified a frequent chromosomal gain at 8q24 that harbors the focal-adhesion kinase (FAK) gene; the potential of this gene as a therapeutic target remains to be evaluated in OCCCs. We first examined the dependence of OCCCs on FAK and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. FAK was overexpressed in 20% of 67 OCCC samples, and this overexpression was correlated with its copy number gain. FAK copy number gains and mutations in PIK3CA accounted for about 40% of OCCC samples, suggesting that the FAK/PI3K/AKT axis is an attractive candidate for targeted therapeutics. We, therefore, treated ovarian cancer cell lines, including OCCC subtypes, with the FAK inhibitors PF-562,271 (PF271), and PF-573,228 (PF228). Ovarian cancer cells were more sensitive to PF271 than PF228. We then searched for single agents that exhibited a synergistic effect on cell death in combination with PF271. We found that co-treatment of PF271 with ABT-737, a BCL-2/BCL-XL antagonist, was profoundly effective at inducing apoptosis. RMGI and OVISE cells were more sensitive to ABT-737 than OVMANA and SKOV3 cells, which have PIK3CA mutations. Mechanistically, PF271 treatment resulted in the transient down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1 via the PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore, PF271/ABT-737 treatment led to the inhibition of the anti-apoptotic proteins MCL1 and BCL-XL/BCL-2. We suggest that pharmacological inhibition of BCL-XL and FAK/PYK2 can be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of OCCC.",,20140211,,,PMC3921183,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the nineties of the last century and up to the present time, there have been anecdotal reports of increase in cancer in Ninawa as in all provinces of Iraq, possibly as a result of exposure to depleted uranium used by American troops in the last two wars. This paper deals with cancer incidence in Ninawa, the most importance province in Iraq, where many of her sons were soldiers in the Iraqi army, and they have participated in the wars. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data was derived from the Directorate of Health in Ninawa. The data was divided into three sub periods: 1980-1990, 1991-2000, and 2001-2010. The analyses are performed using Poisson regressions. The response variable is the cancer incidence number. Cancer cases, age, sex, and years were considered as the explanatory variables. The logarithm of the population of Ninawa is used as an offset. The aim of this paper is to model the cancer incidence data and estimate the cancer incidence rate ratio (IRR) to illustrate the changes that have occurred of incidence cancer in Ninawa in these three periods. RESULTS: There is evidence of a reduction in the cancer IRR in Ninawa in the third period as well as in the second period. Our analyses found that breast cancer remained the first common cancer; while the lung, trachea, and bronchus the second in spite of decreasing as dramatically. Modest increases in incidence of prostate, penis, and other male genitals for the duration of the study period and stability in incidence of colon in the second and third periods. Modest increases in incidence of placenta and metastatic tumors, while the highest increase was in leukemia in the third period relates to the second period but not to the first period. The cancer IRR in men was decreased from more than 33% than those of females in the first period, more than 39% in the second period, and regressed to 9.56% in the third period. CONCLUSION: Our paper confirms the media reports that there are increases in the number of cancer cases, but when it analyzed statistically with population growth in the Ninawa province, there are decreases in incidence rates in most cancer types.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Ninawa', 'Poisson regression', 'incidence rate ratio']",PMC3908522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Utility values were obtained from two studies in which EQ-5D health questionnaire values were mapped from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer qlq-C30 survey, and SF-6D scores were mapped from the Short Form 12, elicited from 191 and 43 patients in two different trials. RESULTS: In the base case, azacitidine had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) of $86,182 (95% confidence limits: $69,920, $107,157) per quality-adjusted life year (qaly) gained relative to ccr. Comparing azacitidine with bsc, low-dose chemotherapy plus bsc, and standard-dose chemotherapy plus bsc, the icers were, respectively, $86,973, $84,829, and $2,152 per qaly gained. Results were most sensitive to the utility for azacitidine after 6 months of treatment and to overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged 9-month median overall survival with azacitidine relative to ccr fills a gap w hen treating patients with higher-risk mds and aml with 20%-30% blasts. The economic value of azacitidine is within the threshold of willingness-to-pay for third-party public payers for oncology treatments in Canada.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Azacitidine', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'economic evaluation', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",PMC3921046,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty (64.5%) of the 31 patients had mutations in RUNX1. A majority of patients with RUNX1 mutations (80.5%) also had acquired CSF3R mutations. In contrast to their high frequency in CN patients who developed leukemia or MDS, RUNX1 mutations were found in only 9 of 307 (2.9%) patients with de novo pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. A sequential analysis at stages prior to overt leukemia revealed RUNX1 mutations to be late events in leukemic transformation. Single-cell analyses in 2 patients showed that RUNX1 and CSF3R mutations were present in the same malignant clone. Functional studies demonstrated elevated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced proliferation with diminished myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic CD34(+) cells coexpressing mutated forms of RUNX1 and CSF3R. The high frequency of cooperating RUNX1 and CSF3R mutations in CN patients suggests a novel molecular pathway of leukemogenesis: mutations in the hematopoietic cytokine receptor (G-CSFR) in combination with the second mutations in the downstream hematopoietic transcription fator (RUNX1).

PROCEDURE: We performed a nation-wide prospective B-NHL03 study to assess the efficacy and safety of short-pulse intensive chemotherapy for children with B-NHL. They were stratified into four treatment groups according to disease stage, tumor resectability and bone marrow/CNS involvement: Group 1 with all resected stage I/II, Group 2 with non-resected stage I/II, Group 3 with stage III & CNS-negative stage IV, and Group 4 with CNS-positive stage IV & Burkitt leukemia. Treatment duration was 2 courses for Group 1, 4 courses for Group 2, and 6 courses for Groups 3 and 4, respectively. CNS irradiation was omitted in all patients. RESULTS: The follow-up time ranged from 0.8 to 88 months, with a median of being 45 months. For 321 patients analyzed in this study, overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) at 4 years was 92.7% and 87.4%, respectively. The 4-year EFS according to treatment group were 94% for Group 1 (n = 17), 98% for Group 2 (n = 103), 84% for Group 3 (n = 111), and 78% for Group 4 (n = 90).

In some patients with a history of CMML, the disease transforms to acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML). There are no specific treatment options for patients suffering from CMML except for supportive care and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in patients with advanced disease. New treatment strategies are urgently required, so we have investigated the use of immunotherapeutic directed cytolytic fusion proteins (CFPs), which are chimeric proteins comprising a selective domain and a toxic component (preferably of human origin to avoid immunogenicity). The human serine protease granzyme B is a prominent candidate for tumor immunotherapy because it is expressed in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Here, we report the use of CD64 as a novel target for specific CMML and AMML therapy, and correlate CD64 expression with typical surface markers representing these diseases. We demonstrate that CD64-specific human CFPs kill CMML and AMML cells ex vivo, and that the mutant granzyme B protein R201K is more cytotoxic than the wild-type enzyme in the presence of the granzyme B inhibitor PI9.

It is a master regulator of lymphocyte differentiation and functions as a tumor suppressor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Nevertheless, no previous reports described effects of Ikaros on the life cycle of any human lymphotropic virus. Here, we demonstrate that full-length Ikaros (IK-1) functions as a major factor in the maintenance of viral latency in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive Burkitt's lymphoma Sal and MutuI cell lines. Either silencing of Ikaros expression by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown or ectopic expression of a non-DNA-binding isoform induced lytic gene expression. These effects synergized with other lytic inducers of EBV, including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and the hypoxia mimic desferrioxamine. Data from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses indicated that Ikaros did not bind to either of the EBV immediate early genes BZLF1 and BRLF1. Rather, Ikaros affected the expression of Oct-2 and Bcl-6, other transcription factors that directly inhibit EBV reactivation and plasma cell differentiation, respectively. IK-1 also complexed with the EBV immediate early R protein in coimmunoprecipitation assays and partially colocalized with R within cells. The presence of R alleviated IK-1-mediated transcriptional repression, with IK-1 then cooperating with Z and R to enhance lytic gene expression. Thus, we conclude that Ikaros plays distinct roles at different stages of EBV's life cycle: it contributes to maintaining latency via indirect mechanisms, and it may also synergize with Z and R to enhance lytic replication through direct association with R and/or R-induced alterations in Ikaros' functional activities via cellular signaling pathways. IMPORTANCE: This is the first report showing that the cellular protein Ikaros, a known master regulator of hematopoiesis and critical tumor suppressor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also plays important roles in the life cycle of Epstein-Barr virus in B cells.",,20140212,,,PMC3993812,"['HL095120/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL095120/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA174462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI078985/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI07034/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA022443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, highly purified haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitor and mature cell fractions from the blood of AML patients were found to contain recurrent DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3A(mut)) at high allele frequency, but without coincident NPM1 mutations (NPM1c) present in AML blasts. DNMT3A(mut)-bearing HSCs showed a multilineage repopulation advantage over non-mutated HSCs in xenografts, establishing their identity as pre-leukaemic HSCs. Pre-leukaemic HSCs were found in remission samples, indicating that they survive chemotherapy. Therefore DNMT3A(mut) arises early in AML evolution, probably in HSCs, leading to a clonally expanded pool of pre-leukaemic HSCs from which AML evolves.

AIM: To evaluate the results of the Chilean protocol following the LPA99 regimen of the Spanish PETHEMA group, except for the replacement of Idarubicin by Daunorubicin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Induction consisted of Daunorubicin 45 mg/m(2) on days 2, 4, 6 and 8 plus ATRA 45 mg/m(2) daily until complete remission. Patients in complete remission (CR) received three monthly chemotherapy courses: Daunorubicin 45 mg/m(2)/d/4days i.v. and ATRA 45 mg/m(2)/d/15 days p.o. (course no. 1); Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m(2)/d/5 days i.v. and ATRA 45 mg/m(2)/d/15 days p.o. (course no. 2); Daunorubicin 60 mg/m(2)/d/ day 1 i.v. in the low risk group, and 1 and 2 in the intermediate-high risk groups and ATRA 45 mg/m(2)/d/15 days p.o. (course no. 3). Maintenance therapy consisted of mercaptopurine 90 mg/m(2)/d p.o., methotrexate 15 mg/m(2)/wk p.o. and, ATRA intermittently, 45 mg/m(2)/d p.o. for 15 days every three months. RESULTS: Between January 2000 and December 2005, 56 patients with newly diagnosed APL from 10 centers were enrolled. A total of 46 patients achieved CR (85%), 8 (15%) died of early complications, seven patients relapsed, with a 16% relapse risk at three years. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival and relapse-free survival were 64% and 84% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that this protocol has a good antileukemic effect but further reduction of early death and relapse, especially in the high risk group is needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Leucemia promielocitica aguda: Resultados del protocolo terapeutico LPA2000, Programa Nacional de Cancer del Adulto (PANDA), Ministerio de Salud, Chile.",,,,,,,,

In the context of radiotherapy, acetylation and deacetylation of histones by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks generated by ionizing irradiation, and are therefore attractive targets for radiosensitization. Small-molecule inhibitors of HATs (garcinol, anacardic acid and curcumin) and HDACs (vorinostat, sodium butyrate and valproic acid) have been shown to sensitize cancer cells to ionizing irradiation in preclinical models, and some of these molecules are being tested in clinical trials, either alone or in combination with radiotherapy. Meanwhile, recent large-scale genome analyses have identified frequent mutations in genes encoding chromatin-regulating proteins, especially in those encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, in various human cancers. These observations have driven researchers toward development of targeted therapies against cancers carrying these mutations. DOT1L inhibition in MLL-rearranged leukemia, EZH2 inhibition in EZH2-mutant or MLL-rearranged hematologic malignancies and SNF5-deficient tumors, BRD4 inhibition in various hematologic malignancies, and BRM inhibition in BRG1-deficient tumors have demonstrated promising anti-tumor effects in preclinical models, and these strategies are currently awaiting clinical application. Overall, the data collected so far suggest that targeting chromatin-regulating proteins is a promising strategy for tomorrow's cancer therapy, including radiotherapy and molecularly targeted chemotherapy.","['(c) The Author 2014.

In the human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4, nuclear AKT activity increases during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated differentiation. As nuclear AKT activity is associated with differentiation, we sought to identify the nuclear substrates of AKT that were phosphorylated after ATRA treatment. A proteomics-based search for nuclear substrates of AKT in ATRA-treated NB4 cells was undertaken by using 2D-electrophoresis/mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with an anti-AKT phospho-substrate antibody. Western blot analysis, an in vitro kinase assay, and/or site-directed mutagenesis were performed to further characterize the MS findings. MS analysis revealed prohibitin (PHB)-2, a multifunctional protein involved in cell cycle progression and the suppression of oxidative stress, to be a putative nuclear substrate of AKT. Follow-up studies confirmed that AKT phosphorylates PHB2 on Ser-91 and that forced expression of the PHB2(S91A) mutant results in a rapid loss of viability and apoptotic cell death. Activation of nuclear AKT during ATRA-mediated differentiation results in the phosphorylation of several proteins, including PHB2, which may serve to coordinate nuclear-mitochondrial events during differentiation.",,20140212,['NOTNLM'],"['SRp20/SRSF3', 'mass spectrometry', 'phosphorylation', 'proteomics', 'signal transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there are no guidelines for identification of high-risk groups, prophylaxis or management of thrombotic complications in paediatric cancer patients. We reviewed the available literature regarding the epidemiology, mechanisms, risk factors, prophylaxis and outcomes of thrombosis in children with cancer and identified areas that require further research. The reported incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children with cancer ranges between 2.1% and 16%, while the incidence of asymptomatic events is approximately 40%. Approximately 30% of VTE in this population is associated with central venous lines (CVL). The most common location of VTE is upper and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (43 to 50% of events, respectively), while 50% of events in ALL patients occur in the central nervous system. Key characteristics that increase the risk of thrombosis include the type of cancer, age of the patient, the presence of a CVL, presence of pulmonary/intra thoracic disease, as well as the type of chemotherapy. Outcomes for paediatric cancer patients with VTE include post-thrombotic syndrome, pulmonary embolism, recurrent thromboembolism, destruction of upper venous system and death.

The majority of such patients can now expect to live a normal life providing they continue to comply with TKI treatment. However, in a significant proportion of cases, TKI resistance develops over time, requiring a change of therapy. Over the past few years, multiple molecular mechanisms of resistance have been identified and some common themes have emerged. One is the development of resistance mutations in the drug target that prevent the drug from effectively inhibiting the respective TK domain. The second is activation of alternative molecules that maintain the signalling of key downstream pathways despite sustained inhibition of the original drug target.

More recently, it has been determined that WT1 is overexpressed in 90% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is mutated in approximately 10% of AML patients. WT1 plays a role in normal hematopoiesis and, in AML specifically, it has oncogenic function and plays an important role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. The ubiquity of WT1 in leukemia has lead to the development of vaccines aimed at employing the host immune system to mount a T-cell response to a known antigen. AREAS COVERED: In this evaluation, the authors discuss the role of WT1 in normal hematopoiesis as well as in the development of hematologic malignancies. Furthermore, the authors discuss the data supporting the development of WT1 vaccines, and the clinical trials supporting their use in patients with acute leukemia. EXPERT OPINION: Several small trials have been conducted which support the safety and efficacy of this therapy, although larger trials are certainly warranted. In the authors' opinion, the WT1 vaccination has potential in terms of its application as an adjuvant therapy for patients with AML who are at high risk of relapse or who have detectable minimal residual disease after initial standard therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exact mechanism of this resistance has yet not been completely elucidated, but a correlation between functional GC receptor expression levels and steroid-resistance in patients has been found. In recent years, several other mechanisms of action have been reported that could play an important role in the development of such drug resistances in leukemia.

METHODS: We compared the CRIF1 level in bone marrow (BM) samples from healthy and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and AML-complete remission (AML-CR) subjects. We also manipulated CRIF1 level in the Jurkat cells using lentivirus-mediated overexpression or siRNA-mediated depletion. Co-culture with the BM stromal cells (BMSCs) was used to induce leukemia cell cycle arrest and mimic the BM microenvironment. RESULTS: We found significant decreases of CRIF1 mRNA and protein in the AML group. CRIF1 overexpression increased the proportion of Jurkat cells arrested in G0/G1, while depletion of endogenous CRIF1 decreased cell cycle arrest. Depletion of CRIF1 reversed BMSCs induced cell cycle arrest in leukemia cells. Co-immunoprecipitation showed a specific binding of CDK2 to CRIF1 in Jurkat cells during cell cycle arrest. Co-localization of two proteins in both nucleus and cytoplasm was also observed with immunofluorescent staining.

Cytotoxic activity, the activation of phosphorylated (p)-STAT3 protein, caspase (CASP) 3 activity at protein level, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A, VEGFC, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, STAT3, matrix metalloproteinase-2, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1), CASP8 and CASP9 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were determined. Morphology and apoptosis were confirmed by DAPI staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. IL-6 rapidly induced the phosphorylation of STAT3 in a dose- and time-dependent manner with a peak expression at 3 h at a concentration of 25 ng/ml. In addition, AG490 (50 muM) and S3I-201 (300 muM) inhibited STAT3 activation. Western blotting results revealed that p-STAT3 protein expression decreased significantly with AG490 and S3I-201 treatment in LNCaP cells. AG490 and S3I-201 induced the downregulation of VEGFA, MCL-1 and STAT3 and the upregulation of CASP8 and CASP9 mRNA transcription levels. In addition, the inhibitors increased the level of CASP3 protein. Combinations of AG490- and S3I-201-TRAIL did not result in an increase in this effect. Parallel results were found by DAPI staining and TUNEL assay. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the possible clinical use of AG490 or S3I-201, together with the reduced use of chemotherapeutic agents with high cytotoxicity, for their ability to exert an apoptotic effect, targeting the JAK/STAT3 pathway.",,20140114,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK and STAT inhibitors', 'JAK/STAT pathway', 'angiogenesis', 'apoptosis', 'prostate cancer']",PMC3919920,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brd4(1-720) but not its N- or C-terminal fragments effectively stimulate MLV IN strand transfer activities in vitro. Mass spectrometry- and NMR-based approaches have enabled us to map key interacting interfaces between the C-terminal domain of BRD4 and the C-terminal tail of MLV IN. Additionally, the N-terminal fragment of Brd4 binds to both DNA and acetylated histone peptides, allowing it to bind tightly to MNs. Comparative analyses of the distributions of various histone marks along chromatin revealed significant positive correlations between H3- and H4-acetylated histones, BET protein-binding sites and MLV-integration sites.

PROCEDURE: PLK1 expression and association with biological features were evaluated in 65 consecutively diagnosed childhood ALL samples by quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, the effects of a specific PLK1 inhibitor, BI 2536, was tested against a panel of nine ALL cell lines at nanomolar concentrations (10, 50, 100 nM). RESULTS: The mRNA expression of PLK1 showed great variability in pediatric ALL, but no difference was evidenced compared to normal bone marrow. Additionally, no association was found between PLK1 mRNA expression with any clinical or biological features. Alternatively, high mRNA expression of PLK1 was present in ALL cell lines. In vitro treatment with BI 2536 strongly diminished growth, while presenting significant reduction in colony formation capacity and increased apoptosis rates. Moreover, strong G2/M arrest was detected suggesting important impaired proliferation after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PLK1 mRNA expression level is not associated with prognosis in childhood ALL; however, considering the great variability observed in the sample and the in vitro experiments presented herein, BI 2536 treatment might serve as a promising therapeutic to enhance the efficacy of conventional treatment modalities in some childhood ALL cases.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",20140212,['NOTNLM'],"['BI 2536', 'PLK1 expression', 'cell cycle', 'childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acadesine, a nucleoside analogue has shown antitumoral effects in different preclinical cancer models as well as in a recent phase I/II clinical trial conducted in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here we observed that acadesine exerted a selective antitumoral activity in the majority of MCL cell lines and primary MCL samples, independently of adverse cytogenetic factors. Moreover, acadesine was highly synergistic, both in vitro and in vivo, with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, commonly used in combination therapy for MCL. Gene expression profiling analysis in harvested tumors suggested that acadesine modulates immune response, actin cytoskeleton organization and metal binding, pointing out a substantial impact on metabolic processes by the nucleoside analog. Rituximab also induced changes on metal binding and immune responses.The combination of both drugs enhanced the gene signature corresponding to each single agent, showing an enrichment of genes involved in inflammation, metabolic stress, apoptosis and proliferation. These effects could be important as aberrant apoptotic and proinflammatory pathways play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MCL. In summary, our results suggest that acadesine exerts a cytotoxic effect in MCL in combination with rituximab, by decreasing the proliferative and survival signatures of the disease, thus supporting the clinical examination of this strategy in MCL patients.",,,,,PMC3996675,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein as DDR1 is a class of collagen-activated RTK, we attempt to understand the role of native and remodeled collagen IV in BM microenvironment and its functional significance in leukemic cells. Exposure to denatured collagen IV significantly increased the migration and adhesion of K562 cells, which also resulted in increased activation of DDR1 and AKT. Further, levels of MMP9 were increased in conditioned media (CM) of denatured collagen IV exposed cells. Mass spectrometric liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry QSTAR proteomic analysis revealed exclusive presence of Secretogranin 3 and InaD-like protein in the denatured collagen IV CM. Importantly, BM samples of AML patients exhibited increased levels of remodeled collagen IV compared to native as analyzed via anti-HUIV26 antibody. Taken together, for the first time, we demonstrate that remodeled collagen IV is a potent activator of DDR1 and AKT that also modulates both migration and adhesion of myeloid leukemia cells. Additionally, high levels of the HUIV26 cryptic collagen IV epitope are expressed in BM of AML patients. Further understanding of this phenomenon may lead to the development of therapeutic agents that directly modulate the BM microenvironment and attenuate leukemogenesis.",['(c) 2014 The Authors.

SETTING: We conducted a case-control study, including 231 102 patients registered in the Cancer Hospital Registries (CHR) in the period from 1998 to 2011. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 204 131 cancer cases relating to 30 topographies were compared with 26 971 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Smoking exposure was considered at the time of hospital registration. We calculated OR, unadjusted and adjusted for gender, age and alcohol consumption, with 95% CIs. RESULTS: After adjustment, the risk of developing cancer associated with smoking was very high (piriform sinus, bronchi and lung, larynx, hypopharynx, oropharynx and oral cavity), high (oesophagus and bladder), moderate (anus and anal canal stomach, nasal cavity, middle ear and paranasal sinuses, pancreas, nasopharynx, other parts of the biliary tract and kidney and low (liver, gall)). There was no association between smoking and cancers of the central nervous system and myeloid leukaemia. For thyroid cancer there was a decreased risk of developing the disease. The AF was higher than 50% for hypopharynx, larynx, bronchi and lung, oropharynx, oral cavity and oesophagus cancers. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a high risk of developing cancer of the hypopharynx, bronchi and lung, larynx, oropharynx and oral cavity, oesophagus and bladder cancer among smokers and establishes the AF attributable to smoking in the development of different types of cancer in Brazil.",,20140211,['NOTNLM'],"['EPIDEMIOLOGY', 'PUBLIC HEALTH']",PMC3927712,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20140212'],,,,,,,,,,

With the proposed hybrid screening approach, the SPECS database containing 204,580 molecules was screened. In total, 89 hits were obtained. Forty three of them were purchased and tested in bioassays. Finally, 5 lead compounds with novel scaffolds were identified to exhibit promising antitumor activities against human leukemia cell line MV4-11, K-562 and human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 and DU145. Their IC(50) values range from 4.40 to 37.96 muM. Three hits with 3 different scaffolds were selected from these five hits for binding mode analysis. It was demonstrated that the subtle differences in the interactions of the representatives with PIM-1 kinase contribute to the different inhibitory activities. It was also demonstrated that the suggested hybrid screening approach is an effective method to discover PIM-1 inhibitors possessing different scaffolds.

Following recent reports of KIR gene associations in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we present a more in-depth investigation of KIR genes and their cognate HLA ligands on childhood ALL risk. Genotyping of 16 KIR genes, along with HLA class I groups C1/C2 and Bw4 supertype ligands, was carried out in 212 childhood ALL cases and 231 healthy controls. Frequencies of KIR genes, KIR haplotypes, and combinations of KIR-HLA ligands were tested for disease association using logistic regression analyses. KIR A/A genotype frequency was significantly increased in cases (33.5%) compared with controls (24.2%) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.39).

Intercellular S1P concentration is regulated and determined by several enzymes including S1P lyase, S1P kinase and S1P phosphatase. Numerous studies showed the role of S1P in malignant behavior of cancer cells including breast, lung, colon, and leukemia cell lines. In the past decade, extensive research activities have focused on elucidating S1P signaling pathway, its receptors, enzymes involved in S1P metabolism, and its performance in cancer biology. In this review, we will explain the function of S1P in tumor progression that demonstrated in past research articles and we will express its importance as a target for designing futuristic anticancer drug.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical profile and risk factors for complications and outcomes of VZI in POP treated with acyclovir. METHODOLOGY: Medical records of all POP with a discharge diagnosis of VZI over a period of seven years (2005-2011) were reviewed. The demographic features, underlying malignancy, risk factors for VZI, complications, and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-six POP with VZI were identified. Leukemia was the most common underlying malignancy (n = 20, 58.8%), followed by lymphoma (n = 7, 20.6%) and solid organ tumors (n = 7, 20.6%). Most of the cases (41%) were observed in children under five. All patients were treated with acyclovir. Varicella-related complications developed in 10 (29%) patients. The most frequent complication was bloodstream infection (n = 3, 8.8%), followed by pneumonia (n = 2, 5.9%), skin infection (n = 2, 5.9%), hepatitis, renal failure, and encephalitis. Independent risk factors associated with complications were age < five years, weight for age < fifth percentile, delay in seeking care (> seven days after onset of symptoms) and severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/cm). One child died secondary to varicella encephalitis. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that young age, poor health-seeking behavior, severe neutropenia, and being underweight are the major risk factors for the development of varicella-related complications in POP in developing countries. These complications could be favorably modified through active immunization of immunocompetent children.",,20140213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: On the basis of disease biology, we compared the efficacy of the CDK9 inhibitor flavopiridol (FP) with a panel of anticancer agents in NMC cell lines and mouse xenografts. RESULTS: In vitro anthracyclines, topoisomerase inhibitors, and microtubule poisons were among the most cytotoxic drug classes for NMC cells, while efficacy of the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 varied considerably between lines carrying different BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4)-NUT (nuclear protein in testis) translocations. Efficacy of FP was comparable to vincristine and doxorubicin, drugs that have been previously used in NMC patients. All three compounds showed significantly better activity than etoposide and vorinostat, agents that have also been used in NMC patients. Statins and antimetabolites demonstrated intermediate single-agent efficacy. In vivo, vincristine significantly inhibited tumour growth in two different NMC xenografts. Flavopiridol in vivo was significantly effective in one of the two NMC xenograft lines, demonstrating the biological heterogeneity of this disease. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that FP may be of benefit to a subset of patients with NMC, and warrant a continued emphasis on microtubule inhibitors, anthracyclines, and topoisomerase inhibitors as effective drug classes in this disease.",,20140211,,,PMC3950881,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the United States and many other countries, it is standard practice that these patients remain hospitalized ""preemptively"" until blood count recovery, owing to the risk for overwhelming infections and bleeding during pancytopenia. This care policy requires hospitalization for an average of 3 to 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy. However, highly effective oral prophylactic antimicrobials are now available, and transfusion support of outpatients has become routine in recent years. As a result, the care of patients with hematologic malignancies treated with intensive modalities is increasingly shifting from inpatient to outpatient settings. Benefits of this shift could include the reduced need for medical resources (eg, transfusions or intravenous antimicrobial therapy), improved quality of life (QOL), decreased rates of nosocomial infections, and lower costs. Increasing evidence indicates that select AML patients undergoing intensive remission induction or salvage chemotherapy can be discharged early after completion of chemotherapy and followed closely in a well-equipped outpatient facility in a safe and costeffective manner. Further demonstration that the current approach of preemptive hospitalization is medically unjustified, economically more burdensome, and adversely affects health-related QOL would very likely change the management of these patients throughout this country and elsewhere, resulting in the establishment of a new standard practice that improves cancer care.",,,,,PMC4212516,"['P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007093/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA015704-35S6/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS634218'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efforts have been made to identify ultra-high-risk patients by combining all the identified variables into a unifying comprehensive model. In the second part of this series, we will discuss the significance of these factors in the context of currently available therapies for MM, distinguishing between treatments that only improve outcomes of high-risk patients when compared with previous therapies, versus those that overcome high-risk status, thereby reclassifying these patients as standard risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we demonstrate that, although CC-292 increased OC differentiation, it inhibited OC function via inhibition of c-Src, Pyk2 and cortactin, all involved in OC-sealing zone formation. As CC-292 did not show potent in vitro anti-MM activity, we next evaluated it in combination with the proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib. We first studied the effect of carfilzomib on OC. Carfilzomib did not have an impact on OC-sealing zone formation but significantly inhibited OC differentiation. CC-292 combined with carfilzomib inhibited both sealing zone formation and OC differentiation, resulting in more profound inhibition of OC function than carfilzomib alone. Moreover, the combination treatment in an in vivo MM mouse model inhibited tumor burden compared with CC-292 alone; it also increased bone volume compared with carfilzomib alone. These results suggest that CC-292 combined with carfilzomib augments the inhibitory effects against OC within the bone microenvironment and has promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of MM and related bone disease.",,20140212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, germinal center activation of MYC expression has been reported to cause progression to MM in an MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance)-prone mouse strain. Although previously detected in 16% of MM, we find MYC rearrangements in nearly 50% of MM, including smoldering MM, and they are heterogeneous in some cases. Rearrangements reposition MYC near a limited number of genes associated with conventional enhancers, but mostly with super-enhancers (e.g., IGH, IGL, IGK, NSMCE2, TXNDC5, FAM46C, FOXO3, IGJ, PRDM1). MYC rearrangements are associated with a significant increase of MYC expression that is monoallelic, but MM tumors lacking a rearrangement have biallelic MYC expression at significantly higher levels than in MGUS. We also have shown that germinal center activation of MYC does not cause MM in a mouse strain that rarely develops spontaneous MGUS. It appears that increased MYC expression at the MGUS/MM transition usually is biallelic, but sometimes can be monoallelic if there is an MYC rearrangement. Our data suggest that MYC rearrangements, regardless of when they occur during MM pathogenesis, provide one event that contributes to tumor autonomy.",,20140212,,,PMC4126852,"['R01 CA083724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133966/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA136671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ECOG CA21115T/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA133966/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS561296'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The G-CSF-mediated expansion of HSCs is reduced in mice lacking TLR2, TLR4 or the TLR signaling adaptor MyD88. Induction of HSC quiescence is abrogated in mice lacking MyD88 or in mice treated with antibiotics to suppress intestinal flora. Finally, loss of TLR4 or germ-free conditions mitigates the G-CSF-mediated HSC repopulating defect.

Previously, adolescents and young adults (AYAs) had good survival rates; yet in the last few decades, AYAs have shown inferior survival rates compared with children due to the increasingly reported AYA-specific malignancies with poor survival rates. This study evaluates the clinicoepidemiological aspects of adolescent cancer diagnosed in a Pediatric Oncology Unit over a 10-year period, the associated risk factors, and the survival rate. METHODS: Retrospective data analysis of patients aged 10 to 19 years diagnosed in the Pediatric Oncology Unit, Children's Hospital Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, during the period from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2010. RESULTS: There were 158 patients (20% of total number of patients diagnosed during the same period), 84 male (53.2%) and 74 female (46.8%). Hematological malignancies were the most common (91.8%), with acute lymphoblastic leukemia being the most prevalent malignancy (61.5%), and solid tumors represented 8.2% of the total number of patients. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 45.2% and 40.2%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year event-free survival rates for hematological malignancies were 39.9% and 37.3%, and for solid tumors it was 36.4%. Infection was the main cause of death (50%). CONCLUSIONS: Age-related survival gap exists for adolescent cancer patients compared with children.

We analyzed the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) using clinical characteristics including underlying disease, sepsis history, inserted situation, drug use, and laboratory data at the time of Broviac insertion or before CR-BSI. RESULTS: During the study period, data from a total of 15 lines were excluded because of missing blood culture data. In the remaining 189 Broviac lines, 52 lines developed CR-BSI. On univariate analysis, leukemia, infantile Crohn's disease, sepsis history before Broviac insertion, existence of a stoma opening, and immunosuppressant use before CR-BSI were risk factors for CR-BSI. On multivariate logistic regression analysis infantile Crohn's disease, sepsis history before Broviac insertion, and immunosuppressant use before CR-BSI were independently associated with CR-BSI (P = 0.015, P = 0.045, and P = 0.043, respectively).

This study aimed to identify genes and molecular processes downstream of MLL-AF9 (alias MLL-MLLT3) which could assist to develop new targeted therapies for such leukemia with unfavorable prognosis. METHODS: In the AML cell line THP1 which harbors this t(9;11) translocation, endogenous MLL-AF9 was silenced via siRNA while ensuring specificity of the knockdown and its efficiency on functional protein level. RESULTS: The differential gene expression profile was validated for leukemia-association by gene set enrichment analysis of published gene sets from patient studies and MLL-AF9 overexpression studies and revealed 425 differentially expressed genes. Gene ontology analysis was consistent with a more differentiated state of MLL-AF9 depleted cells, with involvement of a wide range of downstream transcriptional regulators and with defined functional processes such as ribosomal biogenesis, chaperone binding, calcium homeostasis and estrogen response. We prioritized 41 gene products as candidate targets including several novel and potentially druggable effectors of MLL-AF9 (AHR, ATP2B2, DRD5, HIPK2, PARP8, ROR2 and TAS1R3). Applying the antagonist SCH39166 against the dopamine receptor DRD5 resulted in reduced leukemic cell characteristics of THP1 cells. CONCLUSION: Besides potential new therapeutic targets, the described transcription profile shaped by MLL-AF9 provides an information source into the molecular processes altered in MLL aberrant leukemia.",,20140211,,,PMC3924703,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, the receptors that recognize MHC class I to mediate tolerance in the host were identified on NK cells. These class I-recognizing receptors contribute to the acquisition of function by a dynamic process known as NK cell education or licensing. In the past, NK cells were assumed to be short lived, but more recently NK cells have been shown to mediate immunologic memory to secondary exposures to cytomegalovirus infection. Because of their ability to lyse tumors with aberrant MHC class I expression and to produce cytokines and chemokines upon activation, NK cells may be primed by many stimuli, including viruses and inflammation, to contribute to a graft-versus-tumor effect.

GVHD is induced by donor T cells that also mediate potent anti-tumor responses. However, despite the largely shared effector mechanisms, extensive animal studies have demonstrated the potential of dissociating the GVT effect from GVHD. Also in many clinical cases, long-term remission was achieved following allo-HCT, without significant GVHD. A better mechanistic understanding of the immunopathophysiology of GVHD and GVT effects may potentially help to improve allo-HCT as well as maximize the benefit of GVT effects while minimizing GVHD.

The LICs subpopulation survives chemotherapy and is most probable the cause of minimal residual disease (MRD), which in turn is thought to cause relapse. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of the percentage of LICs in blasts at diagnosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: The percentage of LICs in the blast population was determined at diagnosis using a unique Flow-FISH analysis, which applies fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on flow cytometry sorted cells to distinguish LICs within the CD34+CD38- cell compartment. Fourty-five AML patients with FISH-detectable cytogenetic abnormalities treated with standardized treatment program were retrospectively included in the study. Correlations with overall survival (OS), events-free survival (EFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The percentage of LICs is highly variable in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, ranged from 0.01% to 52.8% (median, 2.1%). High LIC load (>/=1%) negatively affected overall survival (2-year OS: 72.57% vs. 16.75%; P = 0.0037) and events-free survival (2-year EFS: 67.23% vs. 16.33%; P = 0.0018), which was due to an increased cumulative incidence of relapse (2-year CIR: 56.7% vs. 18.0%; P = 0.021). By multivariate analysis, high LIC load retained prognostic significance for OS and EFS. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we established the Flow-FISH protocol as a useful method to distinguish normal and leukemic cells within the CD34+CD38- cell subpopulation.

We found that 39.7% (87 of 219) of these pairs, which were KIR mismatched, had better overall survival (OS) and reduced grade III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), especially in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Bx1 donor KIR genotype with haplotype B on a telomeric region was a risk factor for the OS and relapse-free survival (RFS). Donor centromeric (c) and telomeric (t) KIR haplotype analysis showed that donor KIR cB-tA/tB was associated with improved OS and RFS compared with cA-tA or cA-tB. Furthermore, donor KIR B haplotype of the centromeric motifs (Cen-B) was an independent beneficial factor in improving OS and RFS and in protecting from relapse after HSCT. In AML patients, the occurrence of aGVHD was significantly lower in HLA-C1 group compared with that in HLA-C2 group, although such effect was not observed in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia. Our results suggest that KIR could impact outcome and donor KIR haplotype with Cen-B confer significant survival benefits to HLA-identical sibling HSCT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum selenium levels were measured in 51 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as patients group and in 40 non-hospitalized healthy individuals as control group. RESULTS: Selenium was recognized by atomic absorption spectrometer. Decreased mean serum selenium concentrations were observed in the group with chronic lymphocytic leukemia as compared to normal ones (P = 0.005). Serum selenium concentrations were examined in stages 0 and I. They observed a significant difference between the mean serum concentrations of selenium in stage 0, I and II and that of stage IV and V patients with CLL (P = 0.01). The groups were compared and significant differences were observed i.e., low serum selenium levels in the stage III and IV CLL (P = 0.001). The second selenium test was designed in 21 out of 48 patients within 10 weeks from the beginning of chemotherapy. Serum selenium concentration was tested again in 21 patients, and significant differences have been observed between the time before the treatment and after it (P = 0.02).

More detailed identification of the molecular mechanisms associated with iAs exposure would help to establish better strategies for prevention and treatment. Although chronic iAs exposures have been previously studied there is little to no information regarding the early events of exposure to iAs. To better characterize the early mechanisms of iAs exposure we conducted gene expression studies using sublethal doses of iAs at two different time-points. The major transcripts differentially regulated at 2 hrs of iAs exposure included antioxidants, detoxificants and chaperones. Moreover, after 12 hrs of exposure many of the down-regulated genes were associated with DNA replication and S phase cell cycle progression. Interestingly, the most affected biological pathway by both 2 or 12 hrs of iAs exposure were the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway, represented by the highly up-regulated HMOX1 transcript, which is transcriptionally regulated by the transcription factor Nrf2. Additional Nrf2 targets included SQSTM1 and ABCB6, which were not previously associated with acute iAs exposure. Signalling pathways such as interferon, B cell receptor and AhR route were also responsive to acute iAs exposure. Since HMOX1 expression increased early (20 min) and was responsive to low iAs concentrations (0.1 microM), this gene could be a suitable early biomarker for iAs exposure. In addition, the novel Nrf2 targets SQSTM1 and ABCB6 could play an important and previously unrecognized role in cellular protection against iAs.",,20140207,,,PMC3917856,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have reported that neutrophil elastase (NE) cleaves bcr-1-derived PML-RARalpha in early myeloid cells, leaving only the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of PML attached to RARalpha. The resultant NLS-RARalpha fusion protein mainly localizes to, and functions within, the cell nucleus. It is speculated that NLS-RARalpha may act in different ways from the wild-type RARalpha, but its biological characteristics have not been reported. This study takes two approaches. Firstly, the NLS-RARalpha was silenced with pNLS-RARalpha-shRNA. The mRNA and protein expression of NLS-RARalpha were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Cell proliferation in vitro was assessed by MTT assay. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to detect the differentiation of cells. Secondly, the NLS-RARalpha was over-expressed by preparation of recombinant adenovirus HL-60/pAd-NLS-RARalpha. The assays of mRNA and protein expression of NLS-RARalpha, and cell proliferation, were as above. By contrast, cell differentiation was stimulated by all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (2.5micromol/L) at 24h after virus infection of pAd-NLS-RARalpha, and then detected by CD11b labeling two days later. The transcription and translation of C-MYC was detected in HL-60/pAd-NLS-RARalpha cells which treated by ATRA. Our results showed that compared to the control groups, the expression of NLS-RARalpha was significantly reduced in the HL-60/pNLS-RARalpha-shRNA cells, and increased dramatically in the HL-60/pAd-NLS-RARalpha cells. The proliferation was remarkably inhibited in the HL-60/pNLS-RARalpha-shRNA cells in a time-dependent manner, but markedly promoted in the HL-60/pAd-NLS-RARalpha cells. FCM outcome revealed the differentiation increased in HL-60/pNLS-RARalpha-shRNA cells, and decreased in the HL-60/pAd-NLS-RARalpha cells treated with 2.5micromol/L ATRA. The expression of C-MYC increased strikingly in HL-60/pAd-NLS-RARalpha cells treated with 2.5micromol/L ATRA. Down-regulation of NLS-RARalpha expression inhibited the proliferation and induced the differentiation of HL-60 cells. On the contrary, over-expression of NLS-RARalpha promoted proliferation and reduced the ATRA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells.",,20140116,['NOTNLM'],"['HL-60 cell', 'NLS-RARalpha', 'differentiation', 'over-expression', 'proliferation', 'shRNA']",PMC3917113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately, two-thirds of the patients are getting imatinib mesylate (IM) through the Glivec International Patient Assistance Program while the rest are on generic IM. In addition to comparison of hematological and molecular responses in the Glivec versus the genetic group, in this analysis, an attempt is also made to assess the socio-economic (SE) status of the patients and its effect on the response rates. Of the 213 patients studied, most (28.6%) are in the age group between 30 years and 40 years and the mean age of the patients in 39 years, a good decade younger that in the west. There is a suggestion that patients in lower SE class present with higher Sokal scores and with more disease burden. Possibly hematological responses are similar with both Glivec and generic IM. No comment can be made with regards to molecular response between the two groups as a significant number of patients in the Glivec arm (42%) do not have molecular assessment because of economic reasons. CML is a common and challenging disease in the developing world with patients presenting at an earlier age with more advanced disease.

This manuscript is a single center analysis CML in chronic phase (CP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did retrospective analysis of almost 1000 patients registered as chronic myeloid leukemia over a period of 6 years at Tata Memorial Hospital. RESULTS: We found striking difference in cytogenetic response among patients presenting in late chronic phase (CP) compared with the patients in early CP. The rate of complete cytogenetic response among patients in late CP was 60% while in early CP it was 80%, which was statistically significant (P = 0.0001). The overall survival was 86%, at a median follow-up of 51 months. Innovator glivec was taken by 671 patients among which complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was seen in 72% whereas generic veenat was taken by 237 patients and CCyR was seen in 75% of them. CONCLUSION: Availability of imatinib has dramatically changed the outlook for CML in India. The response was identical for those treated with innovator brand of imatinib as compared to the generic brand. Hence quality generics provide a cost effective solution, which is particularly relevant in the current global scenario.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Glivec', 'chronic phase', 'veenat']",PMC3902614,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have generated chicken surface IgM-related receptors in which the diversity region of the lamprey variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) has been fused to the C region of chicken surface IgM (Tmu). Expression of a VLR:Tmu receptor with specificity for PE supported normal development of B cells, whereas a VLR:Tmu receptor specific to hen egg lysozyme (a self-antigen with respect to chicken B cells) induced, in vivo, complete deletion of VLR(HEL)Tmu-expressing B cells. In ovo i.v. injection of PE resulted in deletion of VLR(PE)Tmu-expressing Beta cells in the embryo spleen, demonstrating that negative selection was independent of the bursal microenvironment. Although chickens transduced with a murine CD8alpha:chicken Igalpha fusion protein contained B cells expressing mCD8alpha:chIgalpha, cotransfection of the mCD8alpha:chIgalpha construct, together with thymus leukemia Ag (a natural ligand for mCD8alpha), resulted in reduced levels of mCD8alpha:chIgalpha-expressing B cells in inverse proportion to the levels of thymus leukemia Ag-expressing cells.

In addition, loss of Raptor impairs iNKT-cell proliferation and production of cytokines upon alpha-galactosylceramide stimulation in vitro and in vivo, and inhibits liver inflammation in an iNKT cell-mediated hepatitis model.

Deregulation of the transcription factor E2F1, normally repressed by CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha)-p42, occurs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), resulting in the perturbation of cell cycle and apoptosis, emphasizing its importance in the molecular pathogenesis of AML. Here we show that E2F family members directly regulate Trib2 in leukemic cells and identify a feedback regulatory loop for E2F1, C/EBPalpha, and Trib2 in AML cell proliferation and survival. Further analyses revealed that E2F1-mediated Trib2 expression was repressed by C/EBPalpha-p42, and in normal granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells, we detect C/EBPalpha bound to the Trib2 promoter. Pharmacological inhibition of the cell cycle or Trib2 knockdown resulted in a block in AML cell proliferation. Our work proposes a novel paradigm whereby E2F1 plays a key role in the regulation of Trib2 expression important for AML cell proliferation control. Importantly, we identify the contribution of dysregulated C/EBPalpha and E2F1 to elevated Trib2 expression and leukemic cell survival, which likely contributes to the initiation and maintenance of AML and may have significant implications for normal and malignant hematopoiesis.",,20140210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several adult ALL protocols are adapting pediatric regimens, but the optimal implementation of asparaginase is not well studied, considering its potential higher toxicity. We studied a pegaspargase dosing strategy based on its pharmacokinetic characteristics in adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2009, 51 adults age 18 to 57 years with newly diagnosed ALL were treated with a regimen adapted from a pediatric trial that included six doses of intravenous pegaspargase at 2,000 IU/m(2) per dose. Intervals between doses were longer than 4 weeks and rationally synchronized with other chemotherapy drugs to prevent overlapping toxicities. Pegaspargase was administered with steroids to reduce hypersensitivity. Asparaginase-related toxicities were monitored after 173 pegaspargase doses. RESULTS: The most common grade 3/4 asparaginase-related toxicities were lengthy hyperbilirubinemia and transaminitis, occasionally resulting in subsequent treatment delays. All toxicities resolved spontaneously. Forty-five percent of patients were able to receive all six doses of pegaspargase, and 61% received >/= three doses. In only 20% of patients, the drug was discontinued after pegaspargase-related serious toxicity. Ninety-six percent achieved complete remission, almost all within 4 weeks, and a low induction death rate was seen. Seven-year disease-free and overall survival were 58% and 51%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our dose and schedule of pegaspargase, based on its pharmacokinetics, and our detailed toxicity profile could be applied for safer adaptation of pediatric ALL protocols in adults.",,20140210,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00184041'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A worldwide multicenter analysis was performed using published and unpublished CLL series to evaluate the impact of CD49d as an overall (OS) and treatment-free survival (TFS) predictor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A training/validation strategy was chosen to find the optimal CD49d cutoff. The hazard ratio (HR) for death and treatment imposed by CD49d was estimated by pooled analysis of 2,972 CLLs; Cox analysis stratified by center and stage was used to adjust for confounding variables. The importance of CD49d over other flow cytometry-based prognosticators (eg, CD38, ZAP-70) was ranked by recursive partitioning. RESULTS: Patients with >/= 30% of neoplastic cells expressing CD49d were considered CD49d+. Decrease in OS at 5 and 10 years among CD49d+ patients was 7% and 23% (decrease in TFS, 26% and 25%, respectively). Pooled HR of CD49d for OS was 2.5 (2.3 for TFS) in univariate analysis. This HR remained significant and of similar magnitude (HR, 2.0) in a Cox model adjusted for clinical and biologic prognosticators. Hierarchic trees including all patients or restricted to those with early-stage disease or those age </= 65 years always selected CD49d as the most important flow cytometry-based biomarker, with negligible additional prognostic information added by CD38 or ZAP-70. Consistently, by bivariate analysis, CD49d reliably identified patient subsets with poorer outcome independent of CD38 and ZAP-70. CONCLUSION: In this analysis of approximately 3,000 patients, CD49d emerged as the strongest flow cytometry-based predictor of OS and TFS in CLL.",,20140210,,,PMC4876311,['P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2014 Mar 20;32(9):869-72.

Appreciating variation in promptness of presentation can help to better target awareness campaigns. We explored variation in patient intervals recorded in consultations with general practitioners among 10,297 English patients subsequently diagnosed with one of 18 cancers (bladder, brain, breast, colorectal, endometrial, leukaemia, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, multiple myeloma, oesophageal, oro-pharyngeal, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, renal, stomach, and unknown primary) using data from of the National Audit of Cancer Diagnosis in Primary Care (2009-2010). Proportions of patients with 'prompt'/'non-prompt' presentation (0-14 or 15+ days from symptom onset, respectively) were described and respective odds ratios were calculated by multivariable logistic regression. The overall median recorded patient interval was 10 days (IQR 0-38). Of all patients, 56% presented promptly. Prompt presentation was more frequent among older or housebound patients (p < 0.001). Prompt presentation was most frequent for bladder and renal cancer (74% and 70%, respectively); and least frequent for oro-pharyngeal and oesophageal cancer (34% and 39%, respectively, p <.001). Using lung cancer as reference, the adjusted odds ratios of non-prompt presentation were 2.26 (95% confidence interval 1.57-3.25) and 0.42 (0.34-0.52) for oro-pharyngeal and bladder cancer, respectively.

Major advances have been recently made to understand the molecular pathogenesis underlying CLL, but defects in apoptosis are considered to be the most important factors. Although neoplastic cells are resistant to apoptosis in vivo, they show decreased level of spontaneous in vitro apoptosis, with significant differences among CLL patients. This work compares the level of spontaneous CLL cell apoptosis with prognostic factors and clinical course of the disease. In vitro spontaneous apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes was analyzed using Annexin-V assay (confirmed by TUNEL method) in 135 treatment naive patients with CLL. Levels of apoptosis after 48 h culture in patients with stable disease were found to be significantly higher than in the group with progressive course of the disease (P = 0.015). Moreover, the level of spontaneous apoptosis after 24 and 48 h of incubation correlated inversely with the progression free survival (P = 0.026 and 0.009, respectively). These results suggest that in vitro spontaneous apoptosis of CLL cells may be a simple and cheap prognostic test which is relatively quick to use, and can predict the course of the disease and response to treatment.",['(c) 2014 Clinical Cytometry Society.'],20140211,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'spontaneous apoptosis', 'survival', 'treatment']",,,,,,,,,['Cytometry B Clin Cytom. 2016 Nov;90(6):484-485.

Polycomb proteins form chromatin-modifying complexes that transcriptionally silence genome regions in higher eukaryotes. The BCL6 corepressor (BCOR) complex comprises ring finger protein 1B (RNF2/RING1B), polycomb group ring finger 1 (PCGF1), and lysine-specific demethylase 2B (KDM2B) and is uniquely recruited to nonmethylated CpG islands, where it removes histone H3K36me2 and induces repressive histone H2A monoubiquitylation. Germline BCOR mutations have been detected in patients with oculofaciocardiodental and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes, which are inherited conditions. Recently, several variants of BCOR and BCOR-like 1 (BCORL1) chimeric fusion transcripts were reported in human cancers, including acute promyelocytic leukemia, bone sarcoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, massively parallel sequencing has identified inactivating somatic BCOR and BCORL1 mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, medulloblastoma, and retinoblastoma. More importantly, patients with AML and MDS with BCOR mutations exhibit poor prognosis. This perspective highlights the detection of BCOR mutations and fusion transcripts of BCOR and BCORL1 and discusses their importance for diagnosing cancer subtypes and estimating the treatment responses of patients. Furthermore, this perspective proposes the need for additional functional studies to clarify the oncogenic mechanism by which BCOR and BCORL1 are disrupted in cancers, and how this may lead to the development of novel therapeutics.",['Mol Cancer Res; 12(4); 479-84.

RESULTS: Using a custom analysis algorithm that we developed, our NGS assay identified between 2,215 and 48,222 unique TCRG rearrangements in a series of 48 samples. We established criteria for assigning clonality based on parameters derived from both the relative and absolute frequencies of reads. In a comparison with standard capillary electrophoresis, 19 of 19 polyclonal samples and 24 of 27 samples that appeared clonal were in agreement. The three discrepant samples demonstrated some of the pitfalls of amplicon length-based testing. Dilution studies with T-lymphoid cell lines demonstrated that a known clonal sequence could be routinely identified when present in as few as 0.1% of total cells demonstrating suitability in residual disease testing. A series of samples was also analyzed on a second NGS platform and yielded very similar results with respect to the frequency and sequence of the clonal rearrangement.

However, the efficacy of these drugs for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies particularly acute myeloid leukemia is not well established. The mechanism of action of asparaginases has thought to be related to a swift and sustained reduction in serum L-asparagine, which is required for rapid proliferation of metabolically demanding leukemic cells. However, asparagine depletion alone appears not to be sufficient for effective cytotoxic activity of asparaginase against leukemia cells, because glutamine can rescue asparagine-deprived cells by regeneration of asparagine via a transamidation chemical reaction. For this reason, glutamine reduction is also necessary for full anti-leukemic activity of asparaginase. Indeed, both Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi asparaginases possess glutaminase enzymatic activity, and their administrations have shown to reduce serum glutamine level by deamidating glutamine to glutamate and ammonia. Emerging data have provided evidence that several types of neoplastic cells require glutamine for the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. This fundamental role of glutamine and its metabolic pathways for growth and proliferation of individual malignant cells may identify a special group of patients whose solid or hematologic neoplasms may benefit significantly from interruption of glutamine metabolism. To this end, asparaginase products deserve a second look particularly in non-ALL malignant blood disorders. Here, we review mechanisms of anti-tumor activity of asparaginase focusing on importance of glutamine reduction, pharmacology of asparaginase products, in vitro activities as well as clinical experience of incorporating asparaginase in therapeutic regimens for non-ALL hematologic malignancies.",,20140211,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their promise for use in the cancer clinic is still incompletely fulfilled, suggesting that a better understanding of the molecular events initiated by these compounds is needed for therapeutic advances. While ERK1/2 has been intensely investigated and is known to transmit signals for cell survival, growth, and differentiation, the role of other MAPK pathways has been studied sporadically. Therefore, we utilized acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in culture (HL60 and U937), to determine if ERK5 has a role in 1,25D-induced terminal differentiation which is distinct from the previously shown involvement of ERK1/2. We previously found that inhibition of kinase activity of ERK5 by specific pharmacological inhibitors BIX02189 or XMD8-92 results in higher expression of general myeloid marker CD11b, but a lower expression of the monocytic marker CD14. In contrast, the inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway by PD98059 or U0126 reduced the expression of all differentiation markers studied. We report here for the first time that the differentiation changes induced by ERK5 inhibitors are accompanied by the inhibition of cell proliferation, and this occurs in the both G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Of note, inhibition of ERK5 auto-phosphorylation by XMD8-92 results in a particularly robust cell cycle arrest in G2 phase in AML cells. This study provides a link between the 1,25D-elevated ERK5 pathway and changes in the cell cycle phase transitions in AML cells. Thus, combinations of vitamin D derivatives and ERK5 inhibitors may be more successful in cancer clinics than 1,25D or analogs alone.

We also show that low-GATA2-expressing specimens (GATA2(low)) exhibit allele-specific expression (ASE) (skewing) in more than half of AML patients examined. We demonstrate that the hypermethylation of the silenced allele can be reversed by exposure to demethylating agents, which also restores biallelic expression of GATA2.

Induction chemotherapy consisted of idarubicin (IDA) plus fludarabine and cytarabine (ARAC) as a 24-hour CI. In response to induction, 31.6% of patients achieved complete remission (CR) and in 68.4% the treatment failed. We concluded that CI-FLAG1 carried a high risk of toxicity and reduced CI-FLAG doses were recommended. Therefore, we revised the protocol (CI-FLAG2) by reducing the dose of IDA and ARAC. In total, 38 and 68 patients were enrolled into CI-FLAG1 and CI-FLAG2, respectively. When comparing outcomes between CI-FLAG1 and CI-FLAG2, there were no differences in terms of the CR rate (p = 0.306) and the overall response rate (ORR; p = 0.206). The treatment failure patterns were different between CI-FLAG1 and CI-FLAG2. The median overall survival showed only a trend towards longer survival in CI-FLAG2 (p = 0.074). Among intermediate-risk patients, there were high response rates favoring CI-FLAG2 in terms of the CR rate (p = 0.108), the ORR (p = 0.031), and overall survival (p = 0.033). This represented a relatively improved response rate compared to our previous study. There was decreased aplasia with dose reductions at the expense of increased resistance. A reduced dose of CI-FLAG might be most beneficial for intermediate-risk groups.","['(c) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.']",20140207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, donor KIR B haplotype of the centromeric motifs (Cen-B) was an independent beneficial factor in improving OS and RFS and in protecting from relapse after HSCT. In AML patients, the occurrence of aGVHD was significantly lower in HLA-C1 group compared to that in HLA-C2 group, while such effect was not observed in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia.

We investigated the role of HOXC6, identified by proximal provirus integration in a large animal hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy study, for a potential involvement in hematopoietic stem cell activity and hematopoietic cell fate decision. HOXC6 was overexpressed in the murine bone marrow transplantation model and tested in a competitive repopulation assay in comparison to the known hematopoietic stem cell expansion factor, HOXB4. We have identified HOXC6 as a factor that enhances competitive repopulation capacity in vivo and colony formation in vitro. Ectopic HOXC6 expression also induced strong myeloid differentiation and expansion of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors/common myeloid progenitors (GMPs/CMPs) in vivo, resulting in myeloid malignancies with low penetrance (3 of 17 mice), likely in collaboration with Meis1 because of a provirus integration mapped to the 3' region in the malignant clone. We characterized the molecular basis of HOXC6-induced myeloid differentiation and malignant cell transformation with complementary DNA microarray analysis. Overexpression of HOXC6 induced a gene expression signature similar to several acute myeloid leukemia subtypes when compared with normal GMPs/CMPs.

Recently, somatic activating STAT3 gene mutations were shown to be specific for LGL leukemia with a prevalence of up to 70%. Analogous mutations in the STAT5b gene were seen in a smaller proportion of patients. These gain-of-function mutations are located in the SH2 domain of STAT3 and affect the phosphotyrosine-SH2 interaction required for dimerization of STAT3. The mutations increase the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5b and enhance the transcriptional activity of the mutated proteins.

The strong antineoplastic activity of vincristine has been limited by its pharmacological characteristics. AREAS COVERED: This paper reviews the role of vincristine in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. This review summarizes its efficacy and toxicity, and focuses on the pharmacokinetic features of vincristine that affect clinical outcomes. EXPERT OPINION: As a single agent, vincristine is associated with brief and incomplete responses, but in combination with other agents, vincristine has dramatically improved the outcomes of lymphoid malignancies such as ALL. Vincristine is a key drug of hyper-fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone, an intensive chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of ALL, and of cyclophosphamid, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone, which has been used extensively in the treatment of patients with aggressive or indolent lymphomas and Richter syndrome. The strong antileukemic activity of vincristine has been limited by its variable and unpredictable pharmacological characteristics, narrow therapeutic index and neurotoxicity profile. These characteristics prompted the development of liposomal vincristine, which has optimized its clinical application. Liposomal vincristine has promising antileukemic activity, and it is approved by the FDA as a single agent for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL.",,20140210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study the effect of small-molecule BH3-mimetic, ABT-737, on the sensitivity of HL60 and U937 AML cell lines was investigated. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of DNR and ABT-737, alone or in combination were assessed using MTT assay and combination index analysis. The effects of treatments on the cell proliferation was determined by trypan blue assay. ELISA cell death assay was used for measurement of apoptosis. RESULTS: IC50 values of DNR and ABT-737 were 2.52 and 0.59 microM for HL-60 cells line and 1.31 and 0.80 microM for U937 cell line at 24 h, respectively. Surprisingly, combination treatment significantly lowered the IC50 values in a synergic manner in both cell lines. Moreover, treatment with a mixture of two agents had more growth inhibition effect relative to the monotherapy. RESULTS of apoptosis assay showed that the cytotoxic effects are related to the enhancement of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that ABT-737 synergistically enhances the cytotoxic effect of DNR in AML cell lines and therefore may be useful to overcome chemoresistance of leukemia patients.",,20131224,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-737', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Combination', 'Daunorubicin']",PMC3915819,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The commercial electroporation systems have been widely adopted in research and clinics with protocols usually compromising appropriate transfection efficiency and cell viability. By introducing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), we demonstrated greatly enhanced performance of electroporation from two aspects: the highly conductive, naked AuNPs help reduce the potential drop consumed by the electroporation solution so that the majority of the applied voltage of an electric pulse is truly imposed on cells with enhanced field strength; AuNPs with targeting ligands (e.g., transferrin-AuNPs or Tf-AuNPs) are bound to the cell membrane, working as virtual microelectrodes to create pores on cells with limited opening area while from many different sites. The addition of AuNPs during electroporation therefore benefits not only quicker recovery and better survival of cells but also more efficient uptake of the subjected probes. Such enhancement was successfully confirmed on a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (i.e., K562 cells) in both a commercial batch electroporation system and a homemade flow system with pWizGFP plasmid DNA probes. The efficiency was found to be dependent on the size, concentration, and mixing ratio of free AuNPs/Tf-AuNPs. An equivalent mixture of free AuNPs and Tf-AuNPs exhibited the best enhancement with the transfection efficiency increase of two to threefold at a minimum sacrifice of the cell viability.",,,,,,['R15 CA156146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this unit, we describe protocols for the isolation and characterization of HSPCs from UCB and their serum-free expansion on decellularized matrices.

METHODS: K562/A02 cells were treated with GCSsiRNA, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, a NF-kappa B specific inhibitor) and U0126 (a MEK1/2 inhibitor), respectively. The expression of GCS and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) mRNA were analyzed with qRT-PCR. Various proteins of different groups were measured by Western blotting. RESULTS: After transfected with GCSsiRNA for 48 h, GCS mRNA were reduced by 62% (51%-73%) and MDR1 mRNA was reduced by 52% (43%-61%) in the K562/A02 cells. Compared with the negative control, relative expression of NF-kappa B p65 in nuclear and P-ERK1/2 were both down-regulated, and P-gp was also inhibited significantly at 72 h after transfected with GCSsiRNA (P< 0.05). In addition, the expression of P-gp was decreased at 24 h with 80 mu mol/L PDTC and 48 h with 20 mu mol/L PDTC. P-ERK1/2 was inhibited significantly when the cells were treated with 20 mu mol/L U0126 for 48 h. The expression of NF-kappa B p65 in nuclear and P-gp were also down-regulated. CONCLUSION: NF-kappa B can modulate the effect of GCS on P-gp in K562/A02 cells. P-ERK1/2 can activate NF-kappa B in above signal transduction pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects and expression of in vitro GALV.fus were observed using an inverted microscope. Enhanced green fluorescence protein expression served as the contro1 for GALV.fus. Recombinant HSV-I virus was produced. Fusogenic recombinant virus infection led to cell fusions in A549 in a dose-dependent manner. Nonfusogenic viruses only produced conventional cytotoxic effects. Recombinant HSV-I with the CMVP initiated cell fusions in HFL-1 GNHu5 cells with arrested cell cycles or as quiescence. HSV-I regulated by UL38p caused cell fusion only in growing cells. Protein expression of GALV.fus was confirmed by Western Blot in infected A549 and HFL-1 GNHu5.

It is important to optimize the multi-stage treatment sequence in this process to maximally prolong patients' survival. Comparing disease-free survival for each treatment stage over penalizes disease recurrences but under penalizes treatment-related mortalities. Moreover, treatment regimes used in practice are dynamic; that is, the choice of next treatment depends on a patient's responses to previous therapies. In this article, using accelerated failure time models, we develop a method to optimize such dynamic treatment regimes. This method utilizes all the longitudinal data collected during the multi-stage process of disease recurrences and treatments, and identifies the optimal dynamic treatment regime for each individual patient by maximizing his or her expected overall survival.

Their diversity and similarities with previously characterized natural killer (NK) cells and lymphoid tissue inducers (LTi) have prompted a provisional classification of all innate lymphocytes into groups 1, 2 and 3 solely on the basis of cytokine properties, but their developmental pathways and lineage relationships remain elusive. Here we identify and characterize a novel subset of lymphoid precursors in mouse fetal liver and adult bone marrow that transiently express high amounts of PLZF, a transcription factor previously associated with NK T cell development, by using lineage tracing and transfer studies. PLZF(high) cells were committed ILC progenitors with multiple ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 potential at the clonal level. They excluded classical LTi and NK cells, but included a peculiar subset of NK1.1(+)DX5(-) 'NK-like' cells residing in the liver. Deletion of PLZF markedly altered the development of several ILC subsets, but not LTi or NK cells. PLZF(high) precursors also expressed high amounts of ID2 and GATA3, as well as TOX, a known regulator of PLZF-independent NK and LTi lineages. These findings establish novel lineage relationships between ILC, NK and LTi cells, and identify the common precursor to ILCs, termed ILCP.

Moreover, loss-of-function point mutations in SETD2 were recurrent (6.2%) in 241 patients with acute leukemia and were associated with multiple major chromosomal aberrations. We observed a global loss of H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) in leukemic blasts with mutations in SETD2. In the presence of a genetic lesion, downregulation of SETD2 contributed to both initiation and progression during leukemia development by promoting the self-renewal potential of leukemia stem cells.

The aim of this study was to assess the fibrinolytic potential of the blood of patients with MPNs. The study involved 112 patients with MPNs diagnosed at the Hematology Clinic Dr J. Biziel University Hospital No. 2 in Bydgoszcz, Poland. The study group included 63 patients with essential thrombocythemia, 29 with polycythemia vera, 11 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and nine with primary myelofibrosis. The control group consisted of 25 healthy volunteers who were age and sex-matched. The following parameters were determined: concentration of tissue plasminogen activator antigen (t-PA:Ag), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 antigen concentration (PAI-1:Ag), D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio. The study showed significantly increased t-PA:Ag, PAI-1:Ag and D-dimer levels in patients with MPNs. Moreover, we found increased concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and fibrinogen, as well as elevated platelet counts. Detailed analysis revealed that t-PA:Ag concentration was elevated in patients with essential thrombocythemia, CML and polycythemia vera. Concentration of PAI-1:Ag was increased in patients with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera; D-dimer was significantly higher in essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, CML and primary myelofibrosis patients. Increased concentrations of t-PA:Ag and D-dimer indicate secondary activation of the fibrinolytic system in patients with MPNs. Elevated levels of PAI-1 in MPN patients may result from its increased production by elevated number of activated platelets and vascular endothelial damage. PAI-1 by having an inhibitory effect on fibrinolysis manifests its procoagulant activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After Perls staining, ring sideroblasts are defined as erythroblasts in which there are 5 or more siderotic granules covering at least a third of the nuclear circumference. The iron deposited in perinuclear mitochondria of ring sideroblasts is present in the form of mitochondrial ferritin. The molecular basis of MDS with ring sideroblasts has remained unknown until recently. In 2011, whole exome sequencing studies revealed somatic mutations of SF3B1, a gene encoding a core component of RNA splicing machinery, in myelodysplasia with ring sideroblasts. The close relationship between SF3B1 mutation and ring sideroblasts is consistent with a causal relationship, and makes SF3B1 the first gene to be associated with a specific morphological feature in MDS. RARS is mainly characterized by isolated anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis, and its clinical course is generally benign, although there is a tendency to worsening of anemia in most patients over time. By contrast, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) is characterized by pancytopenia and dysplasia in two or more myeloid cell lineages. More importantly, patients with RCMD-RS have a higher risk of developing bone marrow failure or progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS-T) associated with marked thrombocytosis is a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with both SF3B1 and JAK2 or MPL mutations. RARS-T may develop from an SF3B1 mutated RARS through the acquisition of a JAK2 or MPL mutations in a subclone of hematopoietic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2014.

Recently, the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has helped identify somatic gene mutations in 75-80% of MDS, that cluster mainly in four functional groups, i.e. cytokine signaling (RAS genes), DNA methylation, (TET2, IDH1/2, DNMT3a genes) histone modifications (ASXL1 and EZH2 genes), and spliceosome (SF3B1 and SRSF2 genes) along with mutations of RUNX1 and TP 53 genes. Most of those mutations, except SF3B1 and TET2 mutations, are associated with an overall poorer prognosis, while some gene mutations (mainly TET2 mutation), may be associated to better response to hypomethylating agents. The frequent mutations of epigenetic modulators in MDS appear to largely contribute to the importance of epigenetic deregulation (in particular gene hypermethylation and histone deacetylation) in MDS progression, and may account at least partially for the efficacy of hypomethylating agents in the treatment of MDS.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Etiologic factors for t-MNs remain elusive, but ongoing research has characterized risk factors which vary between patient subgroups and exposures. Agents that damage DNA directly, interfere with DNA repair, and suppress the immune system's ability to detect malignant cells increase the risk of t-MNs.

Epub 2014 Feb 4.,,"AIM: An increased risk for diabetes mellitus (DM) adds significantly to the burden of late complications in childhood cancer survivors. Complications of DM may be prevented by using appropriate screening. It is, therefore, important to better characterise the reported increased risk for DM in a large population-based setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From the national cancer registries of the five Nordic countries, a cohort of 32,903 1-year survivors of cancer diagnosed before the age of 20 between start of cancer registration in the 1940s and 1950s through 2008 was identified; 212,393 comparison subjects of the same age, gender and country were selected from national population registers. Study subjects were linked to the national hospital registers. Absolute excess risks (AERs) and standardised hospitalisation rate ratios (SHRRs) were calculated. RESULTS: DM was diagnosed in 496 childhood cancer survivors, yielding an overall SHRR of 1.6 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-1.8) and an AER of 43 per 100,000 person-years, increasing from approximately 20 extra cases of DM in ages 0-19 to more than 100 extra cases per 100,000 person-years in ages > or =50. The relative risks for DM were significantly increased after Wilms' tumour (SHRR, 2.9), leukaemia (2.0), CNS neoplasms (1.8), germ-cell neoplasms (1.7), malignant bone tumours (1.7) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (1.6). The risk for DM type 2 was slightly higher than that for type 1. CONCLUSION: Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for DM, with absolute risks increasing throughout life. These findings underscore the need for preventive interventions and prolonged follow-up of childhood cancer survivors.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The transcription factor PAX5, which is pivotal for B-cell commitment and maintenance, is affected by rearrangements, which lead to the expression of in-frame fusion genes in about 2.5% of the cases. RESULTS: Using conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular methods, an additional case with a der(9)t(7;9)(q11.23;p13) resulting in the expression of a PAX5-ELN fusion gene was identified. Furthermore, a general review of leukemia harboring a t(7;9)(q11.2;p13) or der(9)t(7;9)(q11.2;p13), which occurs more often in children than in adults and shows a remarkably high male preponderance, is given. These cytogenetically highly similar translocations lead to the expression of one of three different in frame PAX5-fusions, namely with AUTS2 (7q11.22), ELN (7q11.23), or POM121 (7q11.23), which constitute the only currently known cluster of PAX5 partner genes. CONCLUSION: Our report underlines the recurrent involvement of PAX5 in different fusion genes resulting either from t(7;9)(q11.2;p13) or der(9)t(7;9)(q11.2;p13), which cannot be distinguished cytogenetically and whose discrimination requires molecular analysis.",,20140207,,,PMC3937052,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, we address the interplay of the interleukin-7 receptor and the pre-B-cell receptor (preBCR) in shaping the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of early B cells. Each receptor addresses a unique set of signaling components but they also share signaling pathways, most prominently the MAPK/Erk and phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathways. The latter pathway regulates transcription factors of the FoxO family that play a central role in the proliferation to differentiation switch of pre-B cells. Interestingly, these two alternative cellular programs (proliferation and differentiation) are both controlled by the preBCR.

However, the growth and energy metabolism of leukemia cells under hypoxia have not been well understood. Although it has been known that reactive oxygen species (ROS) is generated under hypoxic conditions, normal and leukemia stem cells were characterized by relatively low levels of ROS. Roles of ROS on leukemia cells under hypoxia also have not been well understood. METHODS: Four Leukemia cell lines were cultured under normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2), where NB4 and THP-1 were most extensively studied. To evaluate energy metabolism, we estimated whole cell number or apoptotic cells with or without a glycolysis inhibitor or an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibitor. Glucose consumption and lactate production were also measured. To evaluate oxidative stress in hypoxic condition, the ROS level and GSH (reduced glutathione) / GSSG (oxidized glutathione) ratio was measured. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 (COX4) were examined by western blotting or RT-PCR. RESULTS: NB4, which grows well under normoxia depending on glycolysis, demonstrated prominent apoptosis and growth suppression after 48 hours culture under hypoxia. NB4 cells cultured under hypoxia showed significantly increased ROS. Culture with a ROS scavenger resulted in decrease of apoptotic cell death of NB4 under hypoxia. NB4 cells cultured for longer period (7 days) under hypoxia did not come to extinction, but grew slowly by upregulating GSH synthesis to protect from ROS generated in hypoxic condition. By contrast, THP-1, which largely depends on OXPHOS in mitochondria under normoxia, demonstrated more growth under hypoxia by changing metabolism from OXPHOS to glycolysis through upregulating PDK1. Moreover, THP-1 avoided ROS generation by substituting COX 4 subunit (from COX 4-1 to COX 4-2) through upregulation of LON, a mitochondrial protease under hypoxia.

Asparagine is an amino acid that is synthesized by normal cells. However, some cancer cells lack asparagine synthetase (ASNS), the key enzyme for asparagine synthesis. Asparaginase (ASNase) contributes to eradication of acute leukemia by decreasing asparagine levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. However, leukemic cells may become ASNase-resistant by upregulating ASNS. High expression of ASNS has also been associated with biologic aggressiveness of other cancers, including gliomas. Here, the impact of enzymatic depletion of asparagine on proliferation of brain tumor cells was determined. ASNase was used as monotherapy or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Viability assays for ASNase-treated cells demonstrated significant growth reduction in multiple cell lines. This effect was reversed by glutamine in a dose-dependent manner--as expected, because glutamine is the main amino group donor for asparagine synthesis. ASNase treatment also reduced sphere formation by medulloblastoma and primary glioblastoma cells. ASNase-resistant glioblastoma cells exhibited elevated levels of ASNS mRNA. ASNase cotreatment significantly enhanced gemcitabine or etoposide cytotoxicity against glioblastoma cells. Xenograft tumors in vivo showed no significant response to ASNase monotherapy and little response to temozolomide alone. However, combinatorial therapy with ASNase and temozolomide resulted in significant growth suppression for an extended duration of time. Taken together, these findings indicate that amino acid depletion warrants further investigation as adjunctive therapy for brain tumors.

In a murine T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) model, we previously showed that expression of oncogenic Kras induced a premalignant state accompanied with an arrest in T-cell differentiation and acquisition of somatic Notch1 mutations. These findings prompted us to investigate whether the expression of oncogenic KRAS directly affects DNA damage repair. Applying divergent, but complementary, genetic approaches, we demonstrate that the expression of KRAS mutants is associated with increased expression of DNA ligase 3alpha, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), and X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1), all essential components of the error-prone, alternative nonhomologous end-joining (alt-NHEJ) pathway. Functional studies revealed delayed repair kinetics, increased misrepair of DNA double-strand breaks, and the preferential use of microhomologous DNA sequences for end joining. Similar effects were observed in primary murine T-ALL blasts. We further show that KRAS-mutated cells, but not KRAS wild-type cells, rely on the alt-NHEJ repair pathway on genotoxic stress. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of DNA ligase 3alpha abolished resistance to apoptotic cell death in KRAS-mutated cells. Our data indicate that targeting components of the alt-NHEJ pathway sensitizes KRAS-mutated leukemic cells to standard chemotherapeutics and represents a promising approach for inducing synthetic lethal vulnerability in cells harboring otherwise nondruggable KRAS mutations.",,20140206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Same results were only found in China studies. No significant associations were found for moderate drinkers in overall analysis or in subgroup analyses. There was some evidence of publication bias. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests a significant inverse association of high tea consumption and leukemia risk. Results should be interpreted cautiously given the potential publication bias.",,20140207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to explore its role in the proliferation of HL60 cells and the correlation with some of its predicted target genes: the cyclindependent kinase 4 (CDK4), the oncogene MYB and the silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1). We first analyzed the expression of miR34a, CDK4, MYB and SIRT1 in peripheral blood samples from acute leukemia (AL) patients and healthy controls, and conducted a correlation analysis. HL60 cells were then transfected with miR34a and control 'scramble miRNA, and quantitative RTPCR and western blotting were used to analyze the effects of the interfering sequence in HL60 cells. The expression of miR34a was significantly reduced in AL patients compared to healthy controls (P<0.01), and negatively correlated with the expression of CDK4 and MYB. Subgroup analysis revealed that the expression of MYB was significantly lower in AL children <3 years old compared to those >3 years. Following the transfection of HL60 cells with miR34a, the mRNA level of CDK4, MYB and SIRT1 decreased by 53.2, 43.3 and 33.5%, respectively, compared to the control, similarly to the respective changes in protein levels. This study showed that the expression of miR34a negatively correlates with the expression of CDK4 and MYB in pediatric patients with acute leukemia. miRNA34a downregulates the expression of the CDK4, MYB and SIRT1 genes in vitro; it may thus represent a novel therapeutic target for acute leukemia.",,20140203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the case of a 78-year-old woman with multiple subcutaneous lung and liver nodules, including mediastinal and peritoneal lymph node swelling, who had been receiving methotrexate (MTX) for 10 years for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). She was initially diagnosed with ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma. After one course of an anthracycline-containing regimen, pathologic cells were identified as CD68 (Kp-1)-positive with myeloid-lineage tumor cells and abnormal karyotypes with 8q21 and 21q22. Subsequent treatment was changed to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) induction chemotherapy. Although the lesions were partially reduced in size following treatment for lymphoma, complete response (CR) was obtained only after AML chemotherapy. The patient remained in CR over 3 years after the last chemotherapy. This case may indicate an association between long-term MTX use and MS. An early diagnosis and adequate therapy may be important for improving survival outcomes in MS. This report demonstrates that CD68 staining is important for the differential diagnosis of MS and lymphoma. Careful follow-up is necessary for this patient, who may be the first case of MS after methotrexate use for RA.",,20140207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Case-control study using 53,515 children from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours 1962-2008, matched controls, and calculated distances of mother's address at child's birth to powerlines at 132, 275, and 400 kV in England, Wales and Scotland. RESULTS: Our previous finding of an excess risk for leukaemia at distances out to 600 m declines over time. Relative risk and 95% confidence interval for leukaemia, 0-199 m compared with>1000 m, all voltages: 1960s 4.50 (0.97-20.83), 2000s 0.71 (0.49-1.03), aggregate over whole period 1.12 (0.90-1.38). Increased risk, albeit less strong, may also be present for 132-kV lines. Increased risk does not extend beyond 600 m for lines of any voltage.

RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 5.4 years, there were 2156 incident cancer cases.

Many of these fusion genes create in-frame fusion transcripts that result in the production of fusion proteins, and some of which aid tumorigenesis. These fusion proteins are often associated with disease phenotype and clinical outcome, and act as markers for minimal residual disease and indicators of therapeutic targets. Here, we identified the 28S ribosomal DNA (RN28S1) gene as a novel fusion partner of the B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 11B gene (BCL11B), the immunoglobulin kappa variable 3-20 gene (IGKV3-20) and the component of oligomeric Golgi complex 1 gene (COG1) in hematologic malignancies. The RN28S1-BCL11B fusion transcript was identified in a case with mixed-lineage (T/myeloid) acute leukemia having t(6;14)(q25;q32) by cDNA bubble PCR using BCL11B primers; however, the gene fused to BCL11B on 14q32 was not on 6q25. IGKV3-20-RN28S1 and COG1-RN28S1 fusion transcripts were identified in the Burkitt lymphoma cell line HBL-5, and the multiple myeloma cell line KMS-18. RN28S1 would not translate, and the breakpoints in partner genes of RN28S1 were within the coding exons, suggesting that disruption of fusion partners by fusion to RN28S1 is the possible mechanism of tumorigenesis. Although further analysis is needed to elucidate the mechanism(s) through which these RN28S1-related fusions play roles in tumorigenesis, our findings provide important insights into the role of rDNA function in human genomic architecture and tumorigenesis.",,20140205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preclinical results support that JAK2 inhibitors could show efficacy in treating chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. JAK2 has also been postulated to play a role in BCR-ABL signal transduction. Therefore, inhibitors of JAK2 kinases are turning into therapeutic strategies for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In this study, the effects of two novel JAK2 inhibitors, NVP-BSK805 and NVP-BVB808, have been investigated in cell lines expressing either BCR-ABL or mutant JAK2. Possible synergies between NVP-BSK805/NVP-BVB808 and the kinase inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib were assessed. Proliferation and apoptosis tests with both substances showed response in the following cell lines: CHRF-288-11, SET-2 and UKE-1. All BCR-ABL-positive cell lines showed some reduction in proliferation, but with half-maximal growth-inhibitory values >1 microM. Combination of the JAK2 inhibitors with imatinib and nilotinib showed no significant additive or synergistic effects, although all BCR-ABL-positive cell lines responded well to both CML therapeutic agents. Interestingly, it seemed that the combination of imatinib with NVP-BSK805 had a protective effect on the cells. Combination treatment with nilotinib did not show this effect.","['(c) 2014 S.

We hypothesize that ERG overexpression is associated with primary drug resistance thereby influencing the outcome in leukemia. We previously reported a cell-line based model of ERG overexpression which induced a potentially chemo-resistant spindle shape cell type. Herein, we report a specific transcriptional gene signature for the observed spindle shaped morphology. Genes significantly over-expressed after ERG induction strongly resembled adhesive mesenchymal-like genes that included integrins (ITGA10, ITGB5, ITGB3, ITGA2B), CD44, and CD24. Interestingly, the mesenchymal-like signature was accompanied by the repression of DNA chromatin remodeling and DNA repair genes, such as CHEK1, EZH2, SUZ12, and DNMT3a. The ERG-induced mesenchymal-like signature positively correlated with TMPRSS2-ERG prostate tissues and invasive breast cancer mRNA expression datasets reflecting a general ERG-driven pattern of malignancy. Furthermore, inhibitors modulating ERG druggable pathways WNT, PKC, and AKT, and chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine revealed ERG-induced drug resistance. In particular, PKC412 treatment enhanced proliferative rates and promoted spindle shape formation in ERG-induced cells. Nilotinib and dasatinib were effective at abolishing ERG-induced cells. Moreover, ERG overexpression also led to an increase in double strand breaks. This report provides mechanistic clues into ERG-driven drug resistance in the poor prognostic group of high ERG expressers, provides insight to improved drug targeted therapies, and provides novel markers for a mesenchymal-like state in acute leukemia.",,,,,PMC3964212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Validation was performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), whereas functional experiments were carried out ex vivo. For the first time at the molecular level, we definitely recognized the cellular derivation of BPDCN that proved to originate from the myeloid lineage and in particular, from resting pDCs. Furthermore, thanks to an integrated bioinformatic approach we discovered aberrant activation of the NF-kB pathway and suggested it as a novel therapeutic target. We tested the efficacy of anti-NF-kB-treatment on the BPDCN cell line CAL-1, and successfully demonstrated by GEP and IHC the molecular shutoff of the NF-kB pathway.

The current concept is that plasmablasts home to the BM and further differentiate into long-lived PCs (LLPCs). These LLPCs survive for months in contact with a complex niche comprising stromal cells (SCs) and hematopoietic cells, both producing recruitment and survival factors. Using a multi-step culture system, we show here the possibility to differentiate human memory B cells into LLPCs surviving for at least 4 months in vitro and producing immunoglobulins continuously. A remarkable feature is that IL-6 is mandatory to generate LLPCs in vitro together with either APRIL or soluble factors produced by SCs, unrelated to APRIL/BAFF, SDF-1, or IGF-1. These LLPCs are out of the cell cycle, express highly PC transcription factors and surface markers. This model shows a remarkable robustness of human LLPCs, which can survive and produce highly immunoglobulins for months in vitro without the contact with niche cells, providing the presence of a minimal cocktail of growth factors and nutrients. This model should be useful to understand further normal PC biology and its deregulation in premalignant or malignant PC disorders.",,20140207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML cells frequently overexpress the myeloid antigens CD33 and CD123, for which specific CARs can be generated. However, CD33 is also expressed on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and its targeting could potentially impair normal hematopoiesis. In contrast, CD123 is widely expressed by AML, while low expression is detected on HSPCs, making it a much more attractive target. In this study we describe the in vivo efficacy and safety of using cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells genetically modified to express anti-CD33 or anti-CD123 CAR to target AML. We show that both these modified T cells are very efficient in reducing leukemia burden in vivo, but only the anti-CD123 CAR has limited killing on normal HSPCs, thus making it a very attractive immunotherapeutic tool for AML treatment.",,20140207,,,,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that deletion of the main transcription factor involved in heat shock gene regulation, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), affects M-CSF-driven differentiation of mouse bone marrow cells. HSF1 transiently accumulates in the nucleus of human monocytes undergoing macrophage differentiation, including M-CSF-treated peripheral blood monocytes and phorbol ester-treated THP1 cells. We demonstrate that HSF1 has a dual effect on SPI1/PU.1, a transcription factor essential for macrophage differentiation and whose deregulation can lead to the development of leukemias and lymphomas. Firstly, HSF1 regulates SPI1/PU.1 gene expression through its binding to a heat shock element within the intron 2 of this gene. Furthermore, downregulation or inhibition of HSF1 impaired both SPI1/PU.1-targeted gene transcription and macrophage differentiation. Secondly, HSF1 induces the expression of HSP70 that interacts with SPI1/PU.1 to protect the transcription factor from proteasomal degradation. Taken together, HSF1 appears as a fine-tuning regulator of SPI1/PU.1 expression at the transcriptional and post-translational levels during macrophage differentiation of monocytes.",,20140207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These proteins also display functional plasticity, which adds versatility to the control of innate immunity. Here we demonstrate that an inhibitory catfish leukocyte immune-type receptor (IpLITR) also displays stimulatory capabilities in a representative myeloid cell model. Previously, the receptor IpLITR 1.1b was shown to inhibit natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Here we expressed IpLITR 1.1b in rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells and monitored intracellular signaling and functional responses. Although IpLITR 1.1b did not stimulate cytokine secretion, activation of this receptor unexpectedly induced phagocytosis as well as extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2- and protein kinase B (Akt)-dependent signal transduction. This novel IpLITR 1.1b-mediated response was independent of an association with the FcRgamma chain and was likely due to phosphotyrosine-dependent adaptors associating with prototypical signaling motifs within the distal region of its cytoplasmic tail. Furthermore, compared to a stimulatory IpLITR, IpLITR 1.1b displayed temporal differences in the induction of intracellular signaling, and IpLITR 1.1b-mediated phagocytosis had reduced sensitivity to EDTA and cytochalasin D. Overall, this is the first demonstration of functional plasticity for teleost LITRs, a process likely important for the fine-tuning of conserved innate defenses.","['(c) 2014 S.

To improve the understanding of current attitudes of the thoracic community toward VATS lobectomy, the Collaborative Research Group conducted the Cross-sectional Survey on Lobectomy Approach (X-SOLA) study. We surveyed a large cohort of lobectomy-performing thoracic surgeons to examine their adoption of VATS lobectomy and their opinions of this technique vs conventional open thoracotomy. METHODS: Participants included thoracic surgeons identified through an international index search from the Web of Science and the cardiothoracic surgery network. A confidential questionnaire was e-mailed in June 2012. Nonresponders were given two reminder e-mails at monthly intervals. RESULTS: The questionnaire, completed by 838 thoracic surgeons within a 3-month period, identified 416 surgeons who only performed lobectomy through open thoracotomy and 422 surgeons who performed VATS or robotic VATS. Of those who performed VATS, 95% agreed with the definition of ""true"" VATS lobectomy according to the Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial. Ninety-two percent of surgeons who did not perform VATS lobectomy responded that they were willing to learn this technique, but were hindered by limited resources, exposure, and mentoring. Both groups agreed there was a need for VATS lobectomy training in thoracic residency programs and in standardized workshops. CONCLUSIONS: X-SOLA represents the largest cross-sectional report within the thoracic community to date, demonstrating the penetration of VATS lobectomy for NSCLC internationally. From our study, we were able to identify a number of obstacles to broaden the adoption of this minimally invasive technique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,['Chest. 2014 Aug;146(2):246-8. PMID: 25091750'],,,,,,,,,

The E2A-PBX1 chimeric transcription factor contains the N-terminal transactivation domain of E2A (TCF3) fused to the C-terminal DNA-binding homeodomain of PBX1. While there is no doubt of its oncogenic potential, the mechanisms of E2A-PBX1-mediated pre-B cell transformation and the nature of direct E2A-PBX1 target genes and pathways remain largely unknown. Herein we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-chip) to identify direct targets of E2A-PBX1, and we used gene expression arrays of siRNA E2A-PBX1-silenced cells to evaluate changes in expression induced by the fusion protein. Combined ChIP-chip and expression data analysis gave rise to direct and functional targets of E2A-PBX1. Further we observe that the set of ChIP-chip identified E2A-PBX1 targets show a collective down-regulation trend in the E2A-PBX1 silenced samples compared to controls suggesting an activating role of this fusion transcription factor. Our data suggest that the expression of the E2A-PBX1 fusion gene interferes with key regulatory pathways and functions of hematopoietic biology. Among these are members of the WNT and apoptosis/cell cycle control pathways, and thus may comprise an essential driving force for the propagation and maintenance of the leukemic phenotype.

However, the requisite analytic performance for a clinical assay to routinely detect BRAF V600E mutations in HCL has not been clearly defined. In this study, we sought to determine the level of analytic sensitivity needed for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and frozen samples and to compare the performance of 2 allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Twenty-nine cases of classic HCL, including 22 FFPE bone marrow aspirates and 7 frozen specimens from blood or bone marrow were evaluated using a laboratory-developed allele-specific PCR assay and a commercially available allele-specific quantitative PCR assay-myT BRAF Ultra. Also included were 6 HCL variant and 40 non-HCL B-cell lymphomas. Two cases of classic HCL, 1 showing CD5 expression, were truly BRAF V600E-negative based on negative results by PCR and sequencing despite high-level leukemic involvement. Among the remaining 27 specimens, V600E mutations were detected in 88.9% (17/20 FFPE; 7/7 frozen) and 81.5% (15/20 FFPE; 7/7 frozen), for the laboratory-developed and commercial assays, respectively. No mutations were detected among the 46 non-HCL lymphomas. Both assays showed an analytic sensitivity of 0.3% involvement in frozen specimens and 5% in FFPE tissue. On the basis of these results, an assay with high analytic sensitivity is required for the clinical detection of V600E mutations in HCL specimens. Two allele-specific PCR assays performed well in both frozen and FFPE bone marrow aspirates, although detection in FFPE tissue required 5% or more involvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was conducted using cultured human leukemia U937 cells to elucidate the possible mechanisms by which momilactone B exerts its anticancer activity, which to date has remained poorly understood. Momilactone B treatment of U937 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth and induced apoptotic cell death as detected by chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and Annexin V-FITC staining. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that momilactone B resulted in G1 arrest in cell cycle progression, which was associated with the dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and enhanced binding of pRB with the E2F transcription factor family proteins. Treatment with momilactone B also increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 in a p53-independent manner, without any noticeable changes in G1 cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), except a slight decrease in cyclin E. Moreover, in vitro kinase assay indicated that momilactone B significantly decreased Cdk4- and Cdk6-associated kinase activities through a notably increased binding of p21 to Cdk4 and Cdk6. Our results demonstrated that momilactone B caused G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in U937 cells through the induction of p21 expression, inhibition of Cdk/cyclin-associated kinase activities, and reduced phosphorylation of pRB, which may be related to anticancer activity.",,20140131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on expression signatures, it has been suggested that these cells use the same molecular pathways for these processes. However, it is not clear whether leukemic stem cells also respond to factors known to enhance the self-renewal activity of hematopoietic stem cells. The transcription factor homeobox B4 (HOXB4) is known to induce expansion of mouse hematopoietic stem cells. The recombinant TAT-HOXB4 protein also expands human CD34+ cells. In this study we investigated whether overexpression of HOXB4 could increase leukemic initiating cell numbers, an issue that is crucial to its clinical usage. A transgenic mouse model for E2A-PBX1 induced pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia was used in combination with HOXB4 transgenic mice to test oncogenic interactions between HOXB4 and E2A-PBX1. The frequency of leukemic initiating cells retrovirally overexpressing HOXB4 was measured by transplantation at limiting dilution and evaluation of leukemia development in recipient mice. Moreover, human B cell lines were evaluated for their colony forming cell potential upon exposure to TAT-HOXB4 protein. Our data with the mouse models show that HOXB4 neither accelerates the generation of E2A-PBX1 B cell leukemia nor expands the number of leukemia initiating cells. Additionally, the growth or colony forming cell proportions of human B cell lines was not changed by HOXB4, suggesting that human B leukemic initiating cells are not affected by HOXB4.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are administered in an outpatient setting for an indefinite period which may negatively impact adherence. Non-adherence to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is associated with disease progression. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the need for adherence-enhancing interventions, this study was designed to determine the proportion of chronic myeloid leukemia patients non-adherent to their tyrosine kinase inhibitor regimen. The secondary objective was to identify the influence of patient characteristics on tyrosine kinase inhibitor adherence. METHODS: Cross-sectional retrospective chart and dispensing record reviews were performed to identify patients receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor from 1 June 2010 to 31 January 2012. Adherence was evaluated using the medication possession ratio. RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were included. Thirty-eight (31%) patients were non-adherent to their tyrosine kinase inhibitor regimen. Patients not receiving concurrent medications were more likely to be non-adherent (odds ratio (OR) 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-5.13, p=0.04). The median medication possession ratio was 0.95 (IQR=0.83-1.07). Median medication possession ratio was lower in patients receiving imatinib compared to dasatinib or nilotinib (0.95 vs. 1.00, p=0.01) and in those less than 50 years old compared to those greater than 50 years old (0.92 vs. 0.97, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Optimal tyrosine kinase inhibitor adherence in chronic myeloid leukemia patients poses a significant obstacle in achieving best possible outcomes while reducing healthcare costs. In this study, one in three chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor were non-adherent to their regimen.

Elevated CXCR4 significantly increased the in vitro survival and proliferation in response to CXCL12. CXCR4 stimulation resulted in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)-1/2, Akt, S6K, STAT3, and STAT5 prosurvival signaling pathways. In accordance, we found that in vitro treatment with CXCR4 antagonist BKT140 directly inhibited the cell growth and induced cell death of CML cells. Combination of BKT140 with suboptimal concentrations of imatinib significantly increased the anti-CML effect. BKT140 induced apoptotic cell death, decreasing the levels of HSP70 and HSP90 chaperones and antiapoptotic proteins BCL-2 and BCL-XL, subsequently promoting the release of mitochondrial factors cytochrome c and SMAC/Diablo. Bone marrow (BM) stromal cells (BMSC) markedly increased the proliferation of CML cells and protected them from imatinib-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, BMSCs elevated proto-oncogene BCL6 expression in the CML cells in response to imatinib treatment, suggesting the possible role of BCL6 in stroma-mediated TKI resistance. BKT140 reversed the protective effect of the stroma, effectively promoted apoptosis, and decreased BCL6 levels in CML cells cocultured with BMSCs. BKT140 administration in vivo effectively reduced the growth of subcutaneous K562-produced xenografts. Moreover, the combination of BKT140 with low-dose imatinib markedly inhibited tumor growth, achieving 95% suppression. Taken together, our data indicate the importance of CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in CML growth and CML-BM stroma interaction. CXCR4 inhibition with BKT140 antagonist efficiently cooperated with imatinib in vitro and in vivo. These results provide the rational basis for CXCR4-targeted therapy in combination with TKI to override drug resistance and suppress residual disease.",,20140206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeted therapy via inhibition of deregulated signaling pathways appears to be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of ALL. Herein, we evaluated the influence of a novel arylindolylmaleimide (PDA-66), a potential GSK3beta inhibitor, on several ALL cell lines. METHODS: ALL cell lines (SEM, RS4;11, Jurkat and MOLT4) were exposed to different concentrations of PDA-66. Subsequently, proliferation, metabolic activity, apoptosis and necrosis, cell cycle distribution and protein expression of Wnt and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were analyzed at different time points. RESULTS: PDA-66 inhibited the proliferation of ALL cells significantly by reduction of metabolic activity. The 72 h IC50 values ranged between 0.41 to 1.28 muM PDA-66. Additionally, caspase activated induction of apoptosis could be detected in the analyzed cell lines. PDA-66 influenced the cell cycle distribution of ALL cell lines differently. While RS4;11 and MOLT4 cells were found to be arrested in G2 phase, SEM cells showed an increased cell cycle in G0/1 phase. CONCLUSION: PDA-66 displays significant antileukemic activity in ALL cells and classifies as candidate for further evaluation as a potential drug in targeted therapy of ALL.",,20140206,,,PMC3922486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical manifestations of MF include splenomegaly, consequent to extramedullary hematopoiesis, cytopenias, and an array of potentially debilitating abdominal and constitutional symptoms. Dysregulated Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling underlies secondary disease-associated effects in MF, such as myeloproliferation, bone marrow fibrosis, constitutional symptoms, and cachexia. Common fatal complications of MF include transformation to acute leukemia, thrombohemorrhagic events, organ failure, and infections. Potential complications from hepatosplenomegaly include portal hypertension and variceal bleeding, whereas extramedullary hematopoiesis outside the spleen and liver - depending on the affected organ - may result in intracranial hypertension, spinal cord compression, pulmonary hypertension, pleural effusions, lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, and/or exacerbation of abdominal symptoms. Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only potentially curative therapy, it is suitable for few patients. The JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is effective in improving splenomegaly, MF-related symptoms, and quality-of-life measures. Emerging evidence that ruxolitinib may be associated with a survival benefit in intermediate- or high-risk MF suggests the possibility of a disease-modifying effect. Consequently, ruxolitinib could provide a treatment backbone to which other (conventional and novel) therapies may be added for the prevention and effective management of specific MF-associated complications.",,20140129,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK inhibitor', 'extramedullary hematopoiesis', 'myelofibrosis', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'ruxolitinib']",PMC3912063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the strong promoter/enhancer elements in the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vectors and the vector-specific integration site preferences played an important role in these adverse clinical events. MLV integration is known to prefer regions in or near transcription start sites (TSS). Recently, BET family proteins were shown to be the major cellular proteins responsible for targeting MLV integration. Although MLV integration sites are significantly enriched at TSS, only a small fraction of the MLV integration sites (<15%) occur in this region. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we created a high-resolution genome-wide integration map of more than one million integration sites from CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a clinically relevant MLV-based vector. The integration sites form approximately 60,000 tight clusters. These clusters comprise approximately 1.9% of the genome. The vast majority (87%) of the integration sites are located within histone H3K4me1 islands, a hallmark of enhancers. The majority of these clusters also have H3K27ac histone modifications, which mark active enhancers. The enhancers of some oncogenes, including LMO2, are highly preferred targets for integration without in vivo selection. IMPORTANCE: We show that active enhancer regions are the major targets for MLV integration; this means that MLV preferentially integrates in regions that are favorable for viral gene expression in a variety of cell types. The results provide insights for MLV integration target site selection and also explain the high risk of insertional mutagenesis that is associated with gene therapy trials using MLV vectors.",,20140205,,,PMC3993722,"['HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 AI000644/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKI) have revolutionized how CML is treated. Although the majority of patients respond to these kinase inhibitors, a subset becomes resistant to these therapeutics. Synribo (omacetaxine mepesuccinate) was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Philadelphia-positive CML either in the chronic or the accelerated phase whose disease failed two prior TKIs. With omacetaxine 1.25 mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 days during induction and for 7 days during maintenance, a major cytogenetic response occurred in 20% of patients in the chronic phase and major hematologic response in 27% of patients in the accelerated phase. Laboratory investigations unraveled the mechanism of action and effectiveness of this agent. Bcr-Abl protein is intrinsically programmed to turn over with a short half-life that makes it susceptible to protein translation inhibitors. Omacetaxine (homoharringtonine) inhibits total protein biosynthesis by binding to A-site cleft of ribosomes. As a corollary to this action, there is a diminution of short-lived proteins, such as Bcr-Abl, followed by cell death.

Clinical information on TP53 mutations is limited to lesions represented in >20% leukemic cells. Here, we tested the clinical impact and prediction of chemorefractoriness of very small TP53 mutated subclones. The TP53 gene underwent ultra-deep-next generation sequencing (NGS) in 309 newly diagnosed CLL. A robust bioinformatic algorithm was established for the highly sensitive detection of few TP53 mutated cells (down to 3 out of approximately 1000 wild-type cells). Minor subclones were validated by independent approaches. Ultra-deep-NGS identified small TP53 mutated subclones in 28/309 (9%) untreated CLL that, due to their very low abundance (median allele frequency: 2.1%), were missed by Sanger sequencing. Patients harboring small TP53 mutated subclones showed the same clinical phenotype and poor survival (hazard ratio = 2.01; P = .0250) as those of patients carrying clonal TP53 lesions. By longitudinal analysis, small TP53 mutated subclones identified before treatment became the predominant population at the time of CLL relapse and anticipated the development of chemorefractoriness.

Recipient mice of Fanca(-/-) or Fancd2(-/-) BM chimeras exhibited severe acute GVHD after allogeneic BM transplantation (BMT). T cells from Fanca(-/-) or Fancd2(-/-) mice induced higher GVHD lethality than those from wild-type (WT) littermates. FA Tregs possessed lower proliferative suppression potential compared with WT Tregs, as demonstrated by in vitro proliferation assay and BMT. Analysis of CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs indicated that loss of Fanca or Fancd2 dysregulated Foxp3 target gene expression. Additionally, CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs of Fanca(-/-) or Fancd2(-/-) mice were less efficient in suppressing the production of GVHD-associated inflammatory cytokines. Consistently, aberrant NF-kappaB activity was observed in infiltrated T cells from FA GVHD mice. Conditional deletion of p65 in FA Tregs decreased GVHD mortality.

As a counter-screen for general toxicity of shRNAs, we used normal mouse bone marrow cells. One of the best candidate drug targets identified in these screens was Jmjd1c. Depletion of Jmjd1c impairs growth and colony formation of mouse MLL-AF9 cells in vitro as well as establishment of leukemia after transplantation. Depletion of JMJD1C impairs expansion and colony formation of human leukemic cell lines, with the strongest effect observed in the MLL-rearranged ALL cell line SEM.

Consistently, stimulation of CLL cells with the chemokine CXCL12 induced RhoA but not Rac1 activation, whereas chemokine-induced CLL cell motility was Rac1-independent. Coculture of CLL cells with activated T cells induced their activation and subsequent proliferation. Here, Tiam1 expression was induced in the malignant cells in line with increased Ki-67 and c-Myc expression. Rac1 or Tiam1 knockdown using siRNA or treatment with the Tiam1/Rac inhibitor NSC-23766 attenuated c-Myc transcription. Furthermore, treatment of CLL cells with NSC-23766 reduced their proliferation. Rac inhibition also antagonized the chemoresistance of activated CLL cells toward fludarabine. Collectively, our data suggest a dynamic regulation of Rac1 function in the CLL microenvironment.

To date, no data are available on the impact of TKIs on minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of induction therapy among patients who have a poor early response to 2 weeks of induction therapy that does not include TKIs. METHODS: The authors analyzed the early response to TKIs during remission induction in children with Ph-positive ALL who were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. MRD was measured on days 15 and 42 of induction. TKIs were incorporated into induction therapy on day 22 in the post-TKI era. RESULTS: TKIs produced a marked drop in MRD levels: at the end of remission induction, 9 of 11 patients who received imatinib or dasatinib and conventional induction chemotherapy achieved MRD-negative status compared with only 2 of 16 patients who received chemotherapy alone (P < .001). The 5-year event-free survival rate (+/- standard deviation) was 68.6% +/- 19.2% for the 11 patients who received TKIs versus 31.6% +/- 9.9% for the 19 patients who did not (P = .022); notably, 2 of the former group underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation versus 15 of the latter group (P = .002). MRD levels and outcomes did not differ significantly among 498 patients with standard-risk/high-risk, Ph-negative ALL who were treated in the pre-TKI or post-TKI eras.

In this study, the mRNA and protein of Smad3, Smad7, and COX-2 were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively, in mesangial cells stimulated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and treated with ATRA at various concentrations and times. The protein level of PGE2 and TXA2 was also measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The localization of Smad3 and Smand7 was observed by confocal microscope. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay, while apoptosis was determined using Hoechest staining. The expression of Smad3, Smad7, and COX-2 mRNA and protein was increased by exogenous TGF-beta, but inhibited by pretreatment of ATRA, in dose and time-dependent manners. In addition, the expression of Smad3 and Smad7 was significantly reduced not only by staurosporine, an inhibitor of threonine/serine protein kinases as well as smad, but also by NS-398, an inhibitor of COX-2. PGE2 and TXA2 were raised by TGF-beta, but also decreased by ATRA, staurosporine, and NS-398. Moreover, ATRA reversed the translocation of Smad3 and Smad7 induced by TGF-beta. Compared with the control, TGF-beta also significantly enhanced proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of mesangial cells. ATRA dose-dependently inhibited TGF-beta-induced cell proliferation, but had no significant effect on apoptosis in rat mesangial cells. Therefore, ATRA repressed COX-2, PGE2, and TXA2 via the TGF-beta/Smad-signaling pathway and inhibited mesangial-cell proliferation, which might subsequently prevent renal fibrosis.",,20140205,['NOTNLM'],"['All-trans retinoic acid', 'Smad', 'cyclooxygenase-2', 'mesangial cell', 'transforming growth factor-beta']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their practical application could be limited because of possible violation of model assumption or lack of ready interpretation for the regression coefficients in some cases. As an alternative, in this paper, the proportional likelihood ratio model introduced by Luo and Tsai is extended to flexibly model the relationship between survival outcome and covariates. This model has a natural connection with many important semiparametric models such as generalized linear model and density ratio model and is closely related to biased sampling problems. Compared with the semiparametric transformation model, the proportional likelihood ratio model is appealing and practical in many ways because of its model flexibility and quite direct clinical interpretation. We present two likelihood approaches for the estimation and inference on the target regression parameters under independent and dependent censoring assumptions. Based on a conditional likelihood approach using uncensored failure times, a numerically simple estimation procedure is developed by maximizing a pairwise pseudo-likelihood. We also develop a full likelihood approach, and the most efficient maximum likelihood estimator is obtained by a profile likelihood. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite-sample properties of the proposed estimators and compare the efficiency of the two likelihood approaches. An application to survival data for bone marrow transplantation patients of acute leukemia is provided to illustrate the proposed method and other approaches for handling non-proportionality. The relative merits of these methods are discussed in concluding remarks.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",20140206,['NOTNLM'],"['conditional likelihood', 'pairwise pseudo-likelihood', 'profile likelihood', 'proportional likelihood ratio model', 'right-censored data']",PMC4527348,['P30 CA142543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS561739'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not well understood why persisting CML cells survive under TKI therapy without developing clonal evolution and frank TKI resistance. BCR-ABL expression level may be critically involved. Whereas higher BCR-ABL expression has been described as a pre-requisite for malignant CML stem cell transformation and CML progression to blast crisis, recent evidence suggests that during persistence TKI select for CML precursors with low BCR-ABL expression.

Four common polymorphic alleles are associated with impaired activity of the enzyme. These are TPMT*2 (238G>C), TPMT*3B (c.460G>A), TPMT*3A (c.460G>A and c.719A>G) and TPMT*3C (c.719A>G). The aim of the present study was to determine the frequency of TPMT polymorphisms and their association with the occurrence of adverse events, during 6-mercaptopurine therapy in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemic (ALL) patients in Gaza Strip. METHODS: A total of 56 DNA samples from all pediatric ALL patients admitted to the pediatric hematology departments of Gaza strip hospitals were analyzed. Genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes was isolated and the TPMT*2, TPMT*3B TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C allelic polymorphism was determined by PCR-RFLP and allele specific PCR technique. RESULTS: No TPMT*2, *3B or *3C alleles were detected. Only one, out of 56 patients, was found heterozygous for the TPMT*3A allele. Thus, the frequency of TPMT*3A allele was calculated to be 0.89%. Fourteen patients of ALL were suffering from myelotoxicity during 6-MP therapy. From our results, no significant association could be established between clinical and laboratory data and/or the presence of the mutation in TPMT gene. CONCLUSION: TPMT*3A was the only deficiency allele detected in our population with an allelic frequency of 0.89%. Other polymorphic alleles in TPMT gene, or factors other than TPMT polymorphisms may be responsible for the development of myelosuppression in cases that don't carry the investigated TPMT alleles (*2, *3A, *3B and *3C).

However, population level survival has been lower, especially in older patients. Here, we examine survival of patients with CML in Germany and compare it to survival of patients in the United States (US). METHODS: Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database in the US and 11 cancer registries in Germany. Patients 15-69 years old diagnosed with CML were included in the analysis. Period analysis for 2002-2006 was used to provide the most up-to-date possible estimates of five-year relative survival. RESULTS: Five-year relative survival was 68.7% overall in Germany and 72.7% in the US. Survival was higher in the US for all age groups except for ages 15-39 years, but the difference was only statistically significant for ages 50-59 years (at 67.5% vs 77.7% in Germany and the US, respectively). Survival decreased with age, ranging from 83.1% and 81.9%, respectively, in Germany and the US for patients 15-39 years old to 54.2% and 54.5%, respectively, in patients 65-69 years old. Survival increased between 2002 and 2006 by 12.0% points in Germany and 17.1% points in the US. CONCLUSIONS: Five-year survival estimates were higher in the US than in Germany overall, but the difference was only significant for ages 50-59 years. Survival did not equal that seen in clinical trials for either country, but strong improvement in survival was seen between 2002 and 2006.",,20130916,,,PMC3848850,,,,,,['GEKID Cancer Survival Working Group'],,,,,,,"['Geiss K', 'Eberle MM', 'Luttmann S', 'Stabenow R', 'Hentschel S', 'Nennecke A', 'Kieschke J', 'Sirri E', 'Holleczek B', 'Emrich K', 'Kajuter H', 'Mattauch V', 'Katalinic A', 'Barnes B', 'Kraywinkel K', 'Brenner H', 'Gondos A', 'Jansen L']","['Geiss, Karla', 'Eberle, Martin Meyer Andrea', 'Luttmann, Sabine', 'Stabenow, Roland', 'Hentschel, Stefan', 'Nennecke, Alice', 'Kieschke, Joachim', 'Sirri, Eunice', 'Holleczek, Bernd', 'Emrich, Katharina', 'Kajuter, Hiltraud', 'Mattauch, Volkmar', 'Katalinic, Alexander', 'Barnes, Benjamin', 'Kraywinkel, Klaus', 'Brenner, Hermann', 'Gondos, Adam', 'Jansen, Lina']",,,

We have previously reported the unique expression of another SLRP, fibromodulin (FMOD) in the leukemic cells of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). OPTC is located in the same region as FMOD on chromosome 1 (1q32.1). Cluster up-regulation of genes may be observed in malignancies and the aim of the present study was to analyze the expression of OPTC in CLL cells. METHODS: The expression of OPTC was tested by RT-PCR and realtime qPCR in PBMC from CLL patients, other hematological malignancies and healthy controls. The presence of OPTC protein, and its subcellular localization, was investigated using fractionation methods where the obtained lysate fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Deglycosylation experiments were performed to investigate the glycosylation status of the CLL OPTC. RESULTS: OPTC was expressed at the gene level in all patients with CLL (n = 90) and in 2/8 patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) but not in blood mononuclear cells of healthy control donors (n = 20) or in tumor samples from nine other types of hematological malignancies. OPTC was detected by Western blot in all CLL samples analyzed (n = 30) but not in normal leukocytes (n = 10). Further analysis revealed a CLL-unique unglycosylated 37 kDa core protein that was found to be located preferentially in the cell nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the CLL cells. CONCLUSIONS: A 37 kDa unglycosylated OPTC protein was detected in ER and in the nucleus of CLL cells and not in healthy control donors. The function of this OPTC core protein remains unclear but its CLL-specific expression and subcellular localization warrants further investigations in the pathobiology of CLL.",,20130828,,,PMC3766095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are limited data comparing allergic reactions between IV and IM PEG recipients, especially in a large cohort of patients. We reviewed the charts of pediatric ALL patients diagnosed from 2006 to 2011 who received PEG at our institution and compared the incidence, time to onset of symptoms, reaction grade, and hospitalization rate for patients who had allergic reactions to PEG. Of 318 evaluable patients, 159 received IV and 159 received IM PEG. Thirty-one (19.5%) IV patients had an allergic reaction, compared to 17 (10.7%) IM patients (P = .028). Time to onset of symptoms was </= 30 minutes for 26 of 27 evaluable IV patients (96.3%) versus only two of 11 evaluable IM patients (18.2%; P < .001). Four of 31 IV patients (12.9%) and six of 17 IM patients (35.5%) required hospitalization (P = .134). There is increased incidence of allergy in patients who received IV PEG compared to IM. Grade of reaction was similar between IV and IM, but allergic reactions to IV PEG had a more rapid onset.

Sixty-two ALL survivors aged 6-18 years and treated in the period 1997-2007 and 60 healthy age and sex matched controls were subjected to neurocognitive testing using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Benton visual retention (BVRT) and Trail Making test (TMT), followed by diffusion weighed and diffusion tensor MRI for calculation of fraction anisotropy (FA). Survivors underwent revision of protocol and type of CNS therapy. Three different protocols were used: modified BFM 83, BFM 90, and CCG. Survivors treated with modified CCG protocol showed a significant decrease in all cognitive tests compared to control (p<.05); BFM 90 group had a significant lower IQ and longer TMT compared to both control and BFM 83 group and no significant difference was found in results of cognitive tests between BFM 83 and control group. Frontal FA was lower in CCG treated group compared to control, BFM 90 and BFM 83 groups (p<.05); meanwhile it was significantly lower in BFM 90 and BFM 83 groups compared to control group.

A recent phase 3 trial demonstrated a trend toward improved overall survival (OS) with decitabine, a hypomethylating agent, compared with treatment choice of either cytarabine or supportive care (7.7 months, 95% CI: 6.2-9.2 vs 5.0 months, 95% CI: 4.3-6.3, respectively) in older adults with newly diagnosed AML. The current analyses investigated prognostic factors for outcomes in this trial and examined OS and responses in prespecified subgroups. METHODS: A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate effects of demographic and baseline characteristics, including age, sex, cytogenetic risk, AML type, ECOG Performance Status, geographic region, bone marrow blasts, platelets, and white blood cells on OS, based on mature data. Similar analyses were conducted with a logistic regression model to predict response rates. Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed for OS and response rates, also using mature data. RESULTS: Patient characteristics that appeared to negatively influence OS included more advanced age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.560 for >/=75 vs <70 years; p = 0.0010), poorer performance status at baseline (HR 0.771 for 0 or 1 vs 2; p = 0.0321), poor cytogenetics (HR 0.699 for intermediate vs poor; p = 0.0010), higher bone marrow blast counts (HR 1.355 for >50% vs </=50%; p = 0.0045), low baseline platelet counts (HR 0.775 for each additional 100 x 109/L; p = 0.0015), and high white blood cell counts (HR 1.256 for each additional 25 x 109/L; p = 0.0151). Regarding geographic regions, patients from Western Europe had the longest median OS. Response rates favored decitabine for all subgroups investigated, including patients >/=75 years (odds ratio 5.94, p = 0.0006). CONCLUSION: Response to decitabine in AML is associated with known prognostic factors related to both patient demographics and disease characteristics.

Case-control studies have been performed to elucidate the role of T3801C in cancer, although the results are conflicting and heterogeneous. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between cancer susceptibility and T3801C (55,963 cases and 76,631 controls from 268 studies) polymorphism in different inheritance models.We used odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals to assess the strength of the association. Overall, significantly increased cancer risk was observed in any genetic model (dominant model: odds ratio [OR]=1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.09-1.19; recessive model: OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.12-1.34; CC vs. TT: OR=1.31, 95% CI=1.19-1.45; TC vs. TT: OR=1.12, 95% CI=1.07-1.18; additive model: OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.09-1.19) when all eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. In further stratified and sensitivity analyses, the elevated risk remained for subgroups of cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, hepatocellular cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer. In addition, significantly decreased colorectal cancer risk was also observed. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that the participation of CYP1A1 T3801C is a genetic susceptibility for some cancer types.Moreover, our work also points out the importance of new studies for T3801C association in some cancer types, such as gallbladder cancer, Asians of acute myeloid leukemia, and thyroid cancer, where at least some of the covariates responsible for heterogeneity could be controlled, to obtain a more conclusive understanding about the function of the CYP1A1 T3801C polymorphism in cancer development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify novel splicing variants from exome sequencing data, we developed a bioinformatics splice-site prediction procedure to analyze next-generation sequencing (NGS) data (SpliceFinder). SpliceFinder integrates two functional annotation tools for NGS, ANNOVAR and MutationTaster and two canonical splice site prediction programs for single mutation analysis, SSPNN and NetGene2. By SpliceFinder, we identified somatic mutations affecting RNA splicing in a colon cancer sample, in eight atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), and eight CML patients. A novel homozygous splicing mutation was found in APC (NM_000038.4:c.1312+5G>A) and six heterozygous in GNAQ (NM_002072.2:c.735+1C>T), ABCC 3 (NM_003786.3:c.1783-1G>A), KLHDC 1 (NM_172193.1:c.568-2A>G), HOOK 1 (NM_015888.4:c.1662-1G>A), SMAD 9 (NM_001127217.2:c.1004-1C>T), and DNAH 9 (NM_001372.3:c.10242+5G>A). Integrating whole-exome and RNA sequencing in aCML and CML, we assessed the phenotypic effect of mutations on mRNA splicing for GNAQ, ABCC 3, HOOK 1. In ABCC 3 and HOOK 1, RNA-Seq showed the presence of aberrant transcripts with activation of a cryptic splice site or intron retention, validated by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the case of HOOK 1. In GNAQ, RNA-Seq showed 22% of wild-type transcript and 78% of mRNA skipping exon 5, resulting in a 4-6 frameshift fusion confirmed by RT-PCR.

Epub 2013 Dec 4.,,"Increased numbers of tumor-infiltrating macrophages correlate with poor disease outcome in patients affected by several types of cancer, including breast and prostate carcinomas. The colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling pathway drives the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to the neoplastic microenvironment and promotes the differentiation of TAMs toward a pro-tumorigenic phenotype. Twelve clinical trials are currently evaluating agents that target the CSF1/CSF1R signaling pathway as a treatment against multiple malignancies, including breast carcinoma, leukemia, and glioblastoma. The blockade of CSF1R signaling has been shown to greatly decrease the number of macrophages in a tissue-specific manner. However, additional mechanistic insights are needed in order to understand how macrophages are depleted and the global effects of CSF1R inhibition on other tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Using BLZ945, a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of CSF1R, we show that CSF1R inhibition attenuates the turnover rate of TAMs while increasing the number of CD8(+) T cells that infiltrate cervical and breast carcinomas. Specifically, we find that BLZ945 decreased the growth of malignant cells in the mouse mammary tumor virus-driven polyomavirus middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) model of mammary carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we show that BLZ945 prevents tumor progression in the keratin 14-expressing human papillomavirus type 16 (K14-HPV-16) transgenic model of cervical carcinogenesis. Our results demonstrate that TAMs undergo a constant turnover in a CSF1R-dependent manner, and suggest that continuous inhibition of the CSF1R pathway may be essential to maintain efficacious macrophage depletion as an anticancer therapy.",,20131204,['NOTNLM'],"['*CSF1R', '*M-CSF', '*breast cancer', '*cervical cancer', '*transgenic mouse models', '*tumor immune evasion', '*tumor immunology', '*tumor-associated macrophages']",PMC3902121,"['R01 CA155331/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA130980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC010412/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA163123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA057621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conditional Meis1 knockout in adult hematopoietic cells resulted in a significant reduction in the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Suppression of hematopoiesis by Meis1 deletion appears to be caused by impaired self-renewal activity and reduced cellular quiescence of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in a cell autonomous manner, resulting in stem cell exhaustion and defective long-term hematopoiesis. Meis1 deficiency down-regulated a subset of Pbx1-dependent hematopoietic stem cell signature genes, suggesting a functional link between them in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. These results show the importance of Meis1 in adult hematopoiesis.",,20140203,,,PMC3911998,,,,['GEO/GSE38336'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this regard, Ctcf binding on non-methylated DNA and its interaction with the Cohesin complex results in differential regulation of the H19/Igf2 locus. Similarly, a role for CTCF has been established in normal hematopoietic development; however its involvement in leukemia remains elusive. Here, we show that Ctcf binds to the imprinting control region of H19/Igf2 in AML blasts. We also demonstrate that Smarca5, which also associates with the Cohesin complex, facilitates Ctcf binding to its target sites on DNA. Furthermore, Smarca5 supports Ctcf functionally and is needed for enhancer-blocking effect at ICR. We next asked whether CTCF and SMARCA5 control the expression of key hematopoiesis regulators. In normally differentiating myeloid cells both CTCF and SMARCA5 together with members of the Cohesin complex are recruited to the SPI1 gene, a key hematopoiesis regulator and leukemia suppressor. Due to DNA methylation, CTCF binding to the SPI1 gene is blocked in AML blasts. Upon AZA-mediated DNA demethylation of human AML blasts, CTCF and SMARCA5 are recruited to the -14.4 Enhancer of SPI1 gene and block its expression. Our data provide new insight into complex SPI1 gene regulation now involving additional key epigenetic factors, CTCF and SMARCA5 that control PU.1 expression at the -14.4 Enhancer.",,20140203,,,PMC3911986,,,,,['PLoS One. 2014;9(3):e92635'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we showed that these patients have increased amount of NK-cells and a distinct blood cytokine profile. We now aimed to study the function of NK- and T-cells in order to understand the role of the immune system in maintaining the treatment response after IFN-alpha discontinuation. The study included 13 patients: 5 patients were still treated with IFN-alpha monotherapy (IFN-ON, median treatment time 163 months) and 8 had stopped the treatment successfully (IFN-OFF, median time without therapy 42 months). Detailed immunophenotype and cytokine production of NK- and T-cells was analyzed with flow cytometry. In addition, the cytotoxicity of NK-cells was studied using K562 as target cells and both the degranulation and direct killing was measured. Compared to healthy controls, IFN-OFF patients had increased proportion of CD4(+) effector memory (CCR7(-)CD45RA(-); median 23% vs. healthy 16%, p = 0.009) and CD8(+) central memory T-cells (CCR7(+)CD45RA(-); median 26% vs. healthy 14%, p = 0.004). Further, upon stimulation the IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha cytokine secretion by CD4(+) T-cells was significantly enhanced in IFN-OFF patients (median 13.7% vs. healthy 7.8%, p = 0.01), and CD4+ effector and central memory cells were the main cytokine producers. No similar increase was observed in IFN-ON group (6.5%). In addition, the proportion of NK-cells was significantly increased in IFN-OFF patients (median IFN-OFF 24%, healthy 13%, p = 0.04), but their direct killing of K562 cells was impaired. The cytotoxicity of NK-cells was also diminished in IFN-ON patients. To conclude, in addition to elevated NK-cell count, IFN-OFF patients have increased amount of memory T-cells, which are able to induce strong cytokine response upon stimulation. This activity may contribute to the maintenance of prolonged remission after successful IFN-alpha discontinuation.",,20140131,,,PMC3909235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work was to characterize this phenomenon and to identify the mechanisms of SC formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue factor inhibitor (VIIai) prevented SC in only 2 out of 23 patient plasma samples. Specific inhibitors of factors IXa and XIa were efficient in all 8 cases that we tested. Also, only factors IXa and XIa added to normal donors' plasma induced SC formations from isolated centers, in a pattern similar to that in patients' plasma. In contrast, factors VIIa, Va, tissue factor induced uniform plasma clotting. SC disappeared after high-speed centrifugation. However, phospholipid supplementation of centrifuged plasma returned them at least partially in 5 out of 22 patients' plasmas, indicating some other role of microparticles than providing phospholipid surface. Circulating procoagulant microparticles isolated from plasma directly activated factor XII in buffer and in diluted plasma. Flow cytometry revealed an increase in procoagulant microparticles in patients' plasmas with SC. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that combination of circulating active factors (specifically, factors IXa and XIa) with circulating procoagulant and contact-pathway-activating microparticles is the predominant mechanism causing spontaneous clotting in patient plasma.",,20140131,,,PMC3909194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that addition of a specific low dose of IL-12 to an ex vivo NK cell differentiation system from cord blood CD34(+) stem cells will result in significantly increased proportions of cells with expression of CD62L as well as KIRs and CD16 which are preferentially expressed on mature CD56(dim) peripheral blood NK cells. In addition, the cells displayed decreased expression of receptors such as CCR6 and CXCR3, which are typically expressed to a lower extent by CD56(dim) than CD56(bright) peripheral blood NK cells. The increased number of CD62L and KIR positive cells prevailed in a population of CD33(+)NKG2A(+) NK cells, supporting that maturation occurs via this subtype. Among a series of transcription factors tested we found Gata3 and TOX to be significantly downregulated, whereas ID3 was upregulated in the IL-12-modulated ex vivo NK cells, implicating these factors in the observed changes. Importantly, the cells differentiated in the presence of IL-12 showed enhanced cytokine production and cytolytic activity against MHC class I negative and positive targets.

Typical Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) is a rare B-cell tumor, and unique in expressing multiple surface immunoglobulin (sIg) isotypes on individual tumor cells (mult-HCL), to raise questions as to their functional relevance. Typical mult-HCL also displays a mutated BRAF V(600)E lesion. Since wild type BRAF is a primary conduit for transducing normal BCR signals, as revealed by deletion modelling studies, it is as yet not apparent if mutated BRAF alters BCR signal transduction in mult-HCL. To address these questions, we examined BCR signalling in mult-HCL cases uniformly displaying mutated BRAF and IGHV genes. Two apparent functional sets were delineated by IgD co-expression. In sIgD(+ve) mult-HCL, IgD mediated persistent Ca(2+) flux, also evident via >1 sIgH isotype, linked to increased ERK activation and BCR endocytosis. In sIgD(-ve) mult-HCL however, BCR-mediated signals and downstream effects were restricted to a single sIgH isotype, with sIgM notably dysfunctional and remaining immobilised on the cell surface. These observations reveal discordance between expression and function of individual isotypes in mult-HCL. In dual sIgL expressing cases, only a single sIgL was fully functional. We examined effects of anti-BCR stimuli on mult-HCL survival ex-vivo. Significantly, all functional non-IgD isotypes increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation but triggered apoptosis of tumor cells, in both subsets. IgD stimuli, in marked contrast retained tumor viability. Despite mutant BRAF, BCR signals augment ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but isotype dictates functional downstream outcomes. In mult-HCL, sIgD retains a potential to transduce BCR signals for tumor survival in-vivo. The BCR in mult-HCL emerges as subject to complex regulation, with apparent conflicting signalling by individual isotypes when co-expressed with sIgD. This suggests the possibility that mutant BRAF by-passes BCR constraints in mult-HCL.",,20140130,,,PMC3907534,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression of CXCR7 in leukemic cells, as well as its participation in CXCL12 response. Interesting, we clearly demonstrated that CXCR7 is highly expressed in acute lymphoid leukemic cells compared with myeloid or normal hematopoietic cells and that CXCR7 contributed to T-acute lymphoid leukemic cell migration induced by CXCL12. Moreover, we showed that the cellular location of CXCR7 varied among T-lymphoid cells and this finding may be related to their migration capacity. Finally, we hypothesized that CXCR7 potentiates CXCR4 response and may contribute to the maintenance of leukemia by initiating cell recruitment to bone marrow niches that were once occupied by normal hematopoietic stem cells.",,20140131,,,PMC3908922,,,,,['PLoS One. 2014;9(3):e91365'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we reported that the combination of CpG and IL-21 (CpG/IL-21) can induce granzyme B (GrB)-dependent apoptosis in B-CLL cells. Here, we demonstrate that treatment of B-CLL cells with CpG and IL-21 results in the development of antigen-presenting cell (APC)-like cells with cytotoxic features. These properties eventually give rise to B-CLL cell apoptosis, independently of their cytogenetic phenotype, whereas normal B-cell survival is not negatively affected by CpG/IL-21. APC- and CTL-typical molecules found to be up-regulated in CpG/IL-21-stimulated B-CLL cells include GrB, perforin, T-bet, monokine-induced by IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), as well as molecules important for cell adhesion, antigen cross-presentation and costimulation. Also induced are molecules involved in GrB induction, trafficking and processing, whereas the GrB inhibitor Serpin B9 [formerly proteinase inhibitor-9 (PI-9)] is down-modulated by CpG/IL-21. In conclusion, CpG/IL-21-stimulated B-CLL cells acquire features that are reminiscent of killer dendritic cells, and which result in enhanced immunogenicity, cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Our results provide novel insights into the aberrant immune state of B-CLL cells and may establish a basis for the development of an innovative cellular vaccination approach in B-CLL.","['(c) The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2014.

The cellular toxicity of CENUs is primarily due to induction of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), which has been characterized as l-(3-deoxycytidyl), 2-(l-deoxyguanosinyl)ethane (dG-dC). However, the formation of dG-dC crosslinks can be prevented by O(6) -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), which removes the O(6) -chloroethyl group from O(6) -chloroethylguanine (O(6) -ClEt-Gua), and ultimately its increased expression can result in drug resistance. Differing levels of AGT expression can lead to varying amounts of dG-dC crosslinking, which influences the sensitivity of cells to CENUs. METHODS: In this work, a sensitive method for the quantitation of dG-dC crosslinks in cellular DNA has been established using high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS). RESULTS: The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of the method were determined to be 2 fmol and 8 fmol on-column, respectively, and the recovery ranged from 96% to 105% with the relative standard deviation (RSD) below 5%. Using this method, the levels of dG-dC crosslink induced by 1-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea hydrochloride (ACNU) were determined in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts cells (high level of expression of AGT) and L1210 leukemia cells (low level of expression of AGT). The time-course profile indicated that the levels of dG-dC crosslink uniformly increased in the early incubation period and reached the maximum at 12 h. Subsequently, the amount of dG-dC crosslinking decreased to very low levels presumably owing to the repair of O(6) -ClEt-Gua by AGT. The crosslinking levels in L1210 cells were significantly higher than those in NIH/3T3 cells at each time point. This provides strong evidence that high express of AGT in CENU-resistant cells inhibits the formation of dG-dC crosslinks. CONCLUSIONS: This work will contribute to the further understanding of the drug resistance of CENUs, and will provide a means to evaluate the anticancer activity of new bifunctional anticancer agents.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this multi-site study, we examined the relative influence of neurocognitive functioning, steroid randomization (prednisone vs. dexamethasone), and demographic characteristics on QOL in first-remission survivors of childhood ALL. METHODS: Participants included 263 ALL survivors (ages 7-17 years at the time of evaluation; mean age at diagnosis 3.9 years) who were treated on similar legacy Children's Cancer Group chemotherapy protocols and did not receive cranial radiation. Children completed detailed neuropsychological performance tests. The Pediatric QOL Inventory was completed by children and their parents. Participants were a mean of 9 years from diagnosis at the time of assessment (with a range of 4 to 13 years). RESULTS: Children and their parents reported lower mean child psychosocial QOL than healthy population norms (p < 0.05), but were not in the impaired range. Physical QOL was similar to population norms. Though neurocognitive difficulties were predominantly mild for the sample as a whole, neurocognitive deficits, specifically problems in verbal cognitive abilities and visual-motor integration skills, were significantly associated with poor physical (p < 0.01) and Psychosocial QOL (p < 0.01). QOL was not associated with previous steroid randomization. CONCLUSIONS: ALL survivors with neurocognitive deficits are at risk for poor QOL, with broad implications for their physical, social, and school functioning.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",20140204,['NOTNLM'],"['cognitive function', 'neuropsychology', 'oncology', 'pediatric cancer', 'quality of life']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The strict regulation of the fine balance between self-renewal and differentiation is essential for normal hematopoiesis and suppression of leukemia development. HSCs and progenitor cells are commonly assumed to reside within the hypoxic BM microenvironment, however, there is no direct evidence supporting this notion. Nevertheless, HSCs and progenitors do exhibit a hypoxic profile and strongly express Hif-1alpha. Although hypoxia signaling pathways are thought to play important roles in adult HSC maintenance and leukemogenesis, the precise function of Hif-dependent signaling in HSCs remains to be uncovered. Here we discuss recent gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies that shed light on the complex roles of hypoxia-signaling pathways in HSCs and their niches in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.

METHODS: The strategy for this screening relied on human blood or bone marrow cultures under hypoxia; under these conditions, leukemia cells deplete oxygen faster than normal cells, causing a hemoglobin oxygenation shift. Several advantages were observed: 1) partial recapitulation of the leukemia microenvironment, 2) use of native hemoglobin oxygenation as a real-time sensor/reporter, 3) cost-effectiveness, 4) species specificity, and 5) a format that enables high-throughput screening. RESULTS: For a proof of concept, a chemical library (size, approximately 20,000 compounds) was screened against human leukemia cells. Seventy compounds were identified (""hit"" rate, 0.35%; Z-factor = 0.71) that had activity, and 20 compounds were examined to identify 18 true-positive compounds (90%). Finally, the results demonstrated that carbonohydraxonic diamide group-containing compounds are potent antileukemia agents that induce cell death in leukemia cells and in patient-derived samples. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that this unique functional assay can identify novel drug candidates and can help with the development of future applications in personalized drug selection for patients with leukemia.",['(c) 2013 American Cancer Society.'],20131025,['NOTNLM'],"['blood', 'bone marrow', 'chemical library', 'drug screening', 'hypoxia', 'leukemia targeting', 'tumor microenvironment']",PMC4457455,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS667036'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) are the major niches for generating immune responses or tolerance. MSCs home to a wide range of organs, but rarely to SLOs after intravenous infusion. Thus, we hypothesized that targeted migration of MSCs into SLOs may significantly improve their immunomodulatory effect. Here, chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) gene, encoding a receptor that specifically guides migration of immune cells into SLOs, was engineered into a murine MSC line C3H10T1/2 by retrovirus transfection system (MSCs/CCR7). We found that infusion of MSCs/CCR7 potently prolonged the survival of GvHD mouse model. The infused MSCs/CCR7 migrate to SLOs, relocate in proximity with T lymphocytes, therefore, potently inhibited their proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity. Natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the early control of leukemia relapse. Although MSCs/CCR7 inhibited NK cell activity in vitro coculture, they did not impact on the proportion and cytotoxic capacities of NK cells in the peripheral blood of GvHD mice. In an EL4 leukemia cell loaded GvHD model, MSCs/CCR7 infusion preserved the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that CCR7 guides migration of MSCs to SLOs and thus highly intensify their in vivo immunomodulatory effect while preserving the GvL activity. This exciting therapeutic strategy may improve the clinical efficacy of MSC based therapy for immune diseases.",['(c) 2014 AlphaMed Press.'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Graft-versus-host disease', 'Graft-versus-leukemia effect', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Secondary lymphoid organs', 'Targeted migration']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies and others identified gene mutation (RAS) and DNA methylation (FHIT) to be associated with the most common cytogenetic subgroup of childhood ALL, high hyperdiploidy (having five more chromosomes). We screened DNA methylation profiles, using a genome-wide high-dimension platform of 166 childhood ALLs and 6 normal pre-B cell samples and observed a strong association of DNA methylation status at the PTPRG locus in human samples with levels of PTPRG gene expression as well as with RAS gene mutation status. In the 293 cell line, we found that PTPRG expression induces dephosphorylation of ERK, a downstream RAS target that may be critical for mutant RAS-induced cell growth. In addition, PTPRG expression is upregulated by RAS activation under DNA hypomethylating conditions. An element within the PTPRG promoter is bound by the RAS-responsive transcription factor RREB1, also under hypomethylating conditions. In conclusion, we provide evidence that DNA methylation of the PTPRG gene is a complementary event in oncogenesis induced by RAS mutations. Evidence for additional roles for PTPR family member genes is also suggested.

Among these, bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) proteins recognize lysine-acetylated histones, thereby regulating gene expression. Newly described small molecules that inhibit BET proteins BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 reduce proliferation of NUT (nuclear protein in testis)-midline carcinoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. These findings prompted us to determine whether BET proteins may be therapeutic targets in the most common primary adult brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM). We performed NanoString analysis of GBM tumor samples and controls to identify novel therapeutic targets. Several cell proliferation assays of GBM cell lines and stem cells were used to analyze the efficacy of the drug I-BET151 relative to temozolomide (TMZ) or cell cycle inhibitors. Lastly, we performed xenograft experiments to determine the efficacy of I-BET151 in vivo. We demonstrate that BRD2 and BRD4 RNA are significantly overexpressed in GBM, suggesting that BET protein inhibition may be an effective means of reducing GBM cell proliferation. Disruption of BRD4 expression in glioblastoma cells reduced cell cycle progression. Similarly, treatment with the BET protein inhibitor I-BET151 reduced GBM cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. I-BET151 treatment enriched cells at the G1/S cell cycle transition. Importantly, I-BET151 is as potent at inhibiting GBM cell proliferation as TMZ, the current chemotherapy treatment administered to GBM patients. Since I-BET151 inhibits GBM cell proliferation by arresting cell cycle progression, we propose that BET protein inhibition may be a viable therapeutic option for GBM patients suffering from TMZ resistant tumors.",,20140219,['NOTNLM'],"['bromodomain', 'epigenetics', 'glioblastoma', 'histone acetylation mimics', 'histones', 'stem cells', 'temozolomide']",PMC4121371,"['P50 CA108961/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA176830/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS067289/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA108961/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The optimal starting dose of pomalidomide is 4 mg given on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle, whereas dexamethasone is administered at a dose of 40 mg weekly (reduced to 20 mg for patients aged >75 years). The treatment should continue until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose-modification schemes have been established for patients who develop neutropenia, thrombocytopaenia and other grade 3-4 adverse events during pomalidomide therapy. Guidance on the prevention and management of infections and venous thromboembolism is provided, based on the available clinical evidence and the experience of panel members.

Acute leukemia has poor prognosis, mainly due to relapse. Standard FLT3-ITD diagnostic techniques are based on genomic polymerase chain reaction and have recently incorporated GeneScan (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to identify variations of the FLT3 gene. As this is an average-based assay utilized in a heterogeneous leukemic cell population, we hypothesized that cells of acute leukemia, considered FLT3-ITD-negative by standard methods, could possess a fraction of FLT3-ITD-positive cells. The present study employed single cell mutation analysis to evaluate the FLT3-ITD status in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 3) patients. A total of 541 single leukemic cells and 36 mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were analyzed. Seven patients, considered FLT3-ITD-negative according to bulk DNA analysis, appeared to possess a small fraction of FLT3-ITD-positive cells based on single cell analysis. Moreover, this approach revealed the heterogeneity of the tumor as evident by different FLT3-ITD mutations present in the same patient. The presence of a minor clone carrying FLT3-ITD in almost all patients tested provides evidence that this lesion is a common late event in leukemogenesis. Additionally, 3 relapsed patients demonstrated loss of heterozygosity of the normal allele, affecting 25%-100% of the cells found to be FLT3-ITD-positive.

Identifying breast cancer-specific signatures for metastasis and learning more about the nature of the genes involved in the metastatic process would 1) improve our understanding of the mechanisms of cancer progression and 2) reveal new therapeutic targets. Previous studies showed that the transcriptional regulator megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (Mkl1) induces tenascin-C expression in normal and transformed mammary epithelial cells. Tenascin-C is known to be expressed in metastatic niches, is highly induced in cancer stroma and promotes breast cancer metastasis to the lung. METHODS: Using HC11 mammary epithelial cells overexpressing different Mkl1 constructs, we devised a subtractive transcript profiling screen to identify the mechanism by which Mkl1 induces a gene set co-regulated with tenascin-C. We performed computational analysis of the Mkl1 target genes and used cell biological experiments to confirm the effect of these gene products on cell behavior. To analyze whether this gene set is prognostic of accelerated cancer progression in human patients, we used the bioinformatics tool GOBO that allowed us to investigate a large breast tumor data set linked to patient data. RESULTS: We discovered a breast cancer-specific set of genes including tenascin-C, which is regulated by Mkl1 in a SAP domain-dependent, serum response factor-independent manner and is strongly implicated in cell proliferation, cell motility and cancer. Downregulation of this set of transcripts by overexpression of Mkl1 lacking the SAP domain inhibited cell growth and cell migration. Many of these genes are direct Mkl1 targets since their promoter-reporter constructs were induced by Mkl1 in a SAP domain-dependent manner. Transcripts, most strongly reduced in the absence of the SAP domain were mechanoresponsive. Finally, expression of this gene set is associated with high-proliferative poor-outcome classes in human breast cancer and a strongly reduced survival rate for patients independent of tumor grade. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights a crucial role for the transcriptional regulator Mkl1 and its SAP domain during breast cancer progression. We identified a novel gene set that correlates with bad prognosis and thus may help in deciding the rigor of therapy.",,20140205,,,PMC3933235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Clinical characteristics of a case with secondary acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were summarized and 10 cases of secondary leukemia after treatment for HLH from literature were analyzed. RESULT: The child was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus associated HLH and received HLH-2004 protocol. The cumulative dose of etoposide (VP16) was 3520 mg/m(2). The patient was diagnosed with APL after 28 months of HLH.He achieved complete remission after induction chemotherapy of all-trans-retinoic acid and darubicin. Consolidated chemotherapy was continued. There were 10 reports of etoposide-related leukemia after treatment for HLH in the literature.Review of 11 cases treated with VP16, of which cumulative doses were 900-20 500 mg/m(2). The interval period between HLH and secondary leukemia was 24 months. The types of secondary leukemia included 1 case with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 case with myelodysplastic syndrome and 9 cases of acute myeloid leukemia. The abnormalities of chromosome included 3 patients with 11q23, 3 APL patients with t (15, 17).Seven patients survived and 4 died. CONCLUSION: The latency period of etoposide-related leukemia is short. Acute myeloid leukemia and balanced chromosomal abnormality are common in etoposide-related leukemia. The risk factors for development of secondary leukemia are related to cumulative drug doses of etoposide, treatment schedules and co-administration of other antineoplastic agents.It is appropriate to keep suitable range of the cumulative dose of etoposide in HLH therapy in order to reduce the risk of therapy related leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent antitumor drug that activates the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but unfortunately it also activates the Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-small ka, CyrillicB) pathway leading to the promotion of tumor cell survival. MG132 is a drug that inhibits I kappa B degradation by the proteasome-avoiding activation of NF-small ka, CyrillicB. In this work, we studied the sensitizing effect of the MG132 proteasome inhibitor on the antitumor activity of DOX. METHODS: U937 human leukemia cells were treated with MG132, DOX, or both drugs. We evaluated proliferation, viability, apoptosis, caspase-3, -8, and -9 activity and cleavage, cytochrome c release, mitochondrial membrane potential, the Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL antiapoptotic proteins, senescence, p65 phosphorylation, and pro- and antiapoptotic genes. RESULTS: The greatest apoptosis percentage in U937 cells was obtained with a combination of MG132 + DOX. Likewise, employing both drugs, we observed a decrease in tumor cell proliferation and important caspase-3 activation, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential loss. Therefore, MG132 decreases senescence, p65 phosphorylation, and the DOX-induced Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein. The MG132 + DOX treatment induced upregulation of proapoptotic genes BAX, DIABLO, NOXA, DR4, and FAS. It also induced downregulation of the antiapoptotic genes BCL-XL and SURVIVIN. CONCLUSION: MG132 sensitizes U937 leukemia cells to DOX-induced apoptosis, increasing its anti-leukemic effectiveness.",,20140204,,,PMC3927225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accumulation of genetic mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities within cells of the partially differentiated myeloid lineage, particularly as a result of exposure to benzene or cytotoxic anticancer drugs, can give rise to malignancies like acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.

Beyond their critical physiological functions, these enzymes are the targets for some of the most widely prescribed anticancer drugs (topoisomerase II poisons) in clinical use. Topoisomerase II poisons kill cells by increasing levels of covalent enzyme-cleaved DNA complexes that are normal reaction intermediates. Drugs such as etoposide, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone are frontline therapies for a variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Unfortunately, their use also is associated with the development of specific leukemias. Regimens that include etoposide or doxorubicin are linked to the occurrence of acute myeloid leukemias that feature rearrangements at chromosomal band 11q23. Similar rearrangements are seen in infant leukemias and are associated with gestational diets that are high in naturally occurring topoisomerase II-active compounds. Finally, regimens that include mitoxantrone and epirubicin are linked to acute promyelocytic leukemias that feature t(15;17) rearrangements.

Because transcription factor inhibition is complex but is an attractive area for anticancer and antiparasitic drug development, we have evaluated the DNA interactions of additional derivatives of DB1255 to gain an improved understanding of the biophysical chemistry of complex function and inhibition. DNase I footprinting, biosensor surface plasmon resonance, and circular dichroism experiments show that DB1255 has an unusual and strong monomer binding mode in minor groove sites that contain a single GC base pair flanked by AT base pairs, for example, 5'-ATGAT-3'. Closely related derivatives, such as compounds with the thiophene replaced with furan or selenophane, bind very weakly to GC-containing sequences and do not have biological activity. DB1255 is selective for the ATGAT site; however, a similar sequence, 5'-ATGAC-3', binds DB1255 more weakly and does not produce a footprint. Molecular docking studies show that the two thiophene sulfur atoms form strong, bifurcated hydrogen bond-type interactions with the G-N-H sequence that extends into the minor groove while the amidines form hydrogen bonds to the flanking AT base pairs. The central dithiophene unit of DB1255 thus forms an excellent, but unexpected, single-GC base pair recognition module in a monomer minor groove complex.",,20140213,,,PMC3985535,"['R01 AI064200/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI064200/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these diseases is aplastic anemia, which manifests as the cessation of normal blood cell production; the leukemias, in contrast, feature the production of excessive hematologic cancer cells. Both diseases are associated with exposure to either industrial chemicals or cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Studies of hematopoietic bone marrow cells in culture have shown that the generation of circulating blood cells requires the interaction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with supporting marrow stromal cells; yet, isolation of HSCs from bone destroys the unique morphology of the marrow stroma in which the HSCs reside. Imaging techniques and related studies have made it possible to examine specific niches where HSCs may either initiate differentiation toward mature blood cells or reside in a dormant state awaiting a signal to begin differentiation. HSCs and related cells may be highly vulnerable to the mutagenic or toxic effects of drugs or other chemicals early in these processes. Additional studies are required to determine the mechanisms by which drug or chemical exposure may affect these cells and lead to either depression of bone marrow function or to leukemia.",['(c) 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.'],20140203,['NOTNLM'],"['benzene', 'bone marrow niche', 'leukemia', 'stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their identification more than 15 years ago, our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for their self-renewal activity and their chemoresistance remains poor. The slow progress in this area is partly due to the difficulty of studying these cells ex vivo. Indeed, current studies are reliant on xenotransplantation assays in immunodeficient mice. In this paper, we report that by modeling key elements of the bone marrow niche using different stromal feeder layers and hypoxic culture conditions, we can maintain LICs over at least 3 weeks and support their self-renewal properties demonstrated through primary and secondary successful xenograft. We provide a proof of principle that this niche-like culture system can be used to study LIC chemoresistance following in vitro cytarabine treatment similarly to the xenograft chemotherapy model. We found that although LICs are believed to be more chemoresistant than non-LICs, functionally defined LICs are not enriched after cytarabine treatment, and heterogeneity in their resistance to treatment can be seen between patients and even within the same patient. We present a culture system that can be used as an in vitro surrogate for xenotransplantation and that has the potential to dramatically increase the throughput of the investigation of LICs. This would further provide the means by which to identify and target the functionality of the different signaling pathways involved in the maintenance and resistance of LICs to improve acute myeloid leukemia treatments.",,20140203,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Leukemia initiating cells', 'Leukemic long-term culture initiating cell', 'Xenograft']",PMC3973718,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that the microRNAs (miRNAs) clustered on chromosome 14q32 are overexpressed only in APL. Here, using high-throughput bisulfite sequencing, we identified an APL-associated hypermethylation at the upstream differentially methylated region (DMR), which also included the site motifs for the enhancer blocking protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Comparing the profiles of diagnostic/remission paired patient samples, we show that hypermethylation was acquired in APL in a monoallelic manner. The cytosine guanine dinucleotide status of the DMR correlated with expression of the miRNAs following a characteristic position-dependent pattern. Moreover, a signature of hypermethylation was also detected in leukemic cells from an established transgenic PML-RARA APL mouse model at the orthologous region on chromosome 12, including the CTCF binding site located upstream from the mouse miRNA cluster. These results, together with the demonstration that the region does not show DNA methylation changes during myeloid differentiation, provide evidence that 14q32 hypermethylation is implicated in the pathogenesis of APL. We propose a model in which loss of imprinting at the 14q32 domain leads to overexpression of the miRNAs in APL.",,20140203,,,,"['MR/J006742/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'C6277/A6789/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, 420 patients were analyzed for mutations in the TP53 gene. The patient cohort was subdivided based on type of 5q loss: Patients with interstitial deletions and patients with 5q loss due to unbalanced rearrangements or monosomy 5. Loss of the long arm of chromosome 5 due to an unbalanced rearrangement occurred more often in AML (286/627; 45.6%) than MDS (188/573; 32.8%; P < 0.001). In both entities, patients with 5q loss due to unbalanced translocations showed complex karyotypes more frequently (MDS: 179/188; 95.2% vs. 124/385; 32.2%; P < 0.001; AML: 274/286; 95.8% vs. 256/341; 75.1%; P < 0.001).

In MDS, complex karyotype was an independent adverse prognostic factor (HR = 5.34; P = 0.032), whereas in AML presence of TP53 mutations was the strongest adverse prognostic factor (HR = 2.21; P = 0.026). In conclusion, in AML and MDS, loss of the long arm of chromosome 5 due to unbalanced translocations is associated with complex karyotype and in MDS, moreover, with clonal evolution, mutations in the TP53 gene and adverse prognosis.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",20140203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We analyzed 113 patients with IgG4-RD in whom malignancy was not diagnosed at the time of IgG4-RD onset and the follow-up period was longer than six months. A total of 95 patients had AIP. The mean follow-up period was 73 months. The incidence of the observed malignancies was compared with the expected incidence in an age- and sex-matched general Japanese population based on the Vital Statistics of Japan. RESULTS: There were 15 malignancies (lung cancer in five patients, pancreatic cancer in two patients, gastric cancer in two patients, bile duct cancer in one patient, renal cancer in one patient, breast cancer in one patient, tongue cancer in one patient, malignant melanoma in one patient and acute myeloid leukemia in one patient) in 14 patients during the follow-up period. The calculated standardized incidence rate of the total malignancies was not significant, that is, 1.04 (95% CI 0.57-1.75). CONCLUSION: The incidence of total malignancies in IgG4-RD patients is similar to that observed in the general population. At present, it is reasonable to conclude that IgG4-RD is not associated with an increased incidence of total malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as 3-BrPA is an alkylating agent, its cytotoxic action may be induced by other molecular mechanisms. The results presented here reveal that 3-BrPA-induced apoptosis is caspase independent. Further, 3-BrPA induces the generation of reactive oxygen species in MDA-MB-231 cells, leading to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that caspase-independent apoptosis may be induced by the generation of reactive oxygen species. In this study, we also demonstrated that 3-BrPA induces apoptosis through the downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The results of Mcl-1 knockdown indicate that Mcl-1 plays an important role in 3-BrPA-induced apoptosis. Further, the upregulation of Mcl-1 expression in 3-BrPA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells significantly increases cell viability. In addition, 3-BrPA treatment resulted in the downregulation of p-Akt, suggesting that 3-BrPA may downregulate Mcl-1 through the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt pathway. These findings indicate that 3-BrPA induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells by downregulating Mcl-1 through the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether or not the prognostic impact of MK and CK remains relevant for patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is still unclear. We retrospectively analyzed the status of MK and CK, as well as other clinical laboratory features, in 148 allo-HCT AML patients at our institution and correlated with their event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) after transplantation. MK and CK were identified in 14 (9%) and 19 (13%) cases, respectively. On univariate analysis, only age (>/=60 years) and WBC count (>/=15 x 10(9)/L) were significant adverse predictors for EFS (P < .001 and P = .017, respectively) and OS (P = .002 and P = .021, respectively). MK, CK, and other relevant parameters analyzed did not affect the clinical outcome. Multivariable analysis confirmed that both older age and high WBC count were independent prognostic factors for a shorter OS (P = .001 and P = .003, respectively) and a shorter EFS (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). Our results indicate that neither MK nor CK are high-risk factors in AML patients undergoing allo-HCT.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Eight days after the initiation of hydroxyurea, the patient started complaining of chills, fever, and vomiting.

However, there have been only a limited number of reports demonstrating drug allergy to have a role in hepatic dysfunction accompanied by fever and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Recently, aberrant regulation of gene expression by histone methylation modifiers has emerged as an important mechanism for tumorigenesis. However, it remains largely unknown how histone methyltransferases and demethylases coregulate transcriptional profiles for cancer cell characteristics. Here, we show that in breast cancer cells, the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase UTX (also known as KDM6A) positively regulates gene expression programs associated with cell proliferation and invasion. The majority of UTX-controlled genes, including a cohort of oncogenes and prometastatic genes, are coregulated by the H3K4 methyltransferase mixed lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4, also called ALR, KMT2D, and MLL2). UTX interacted with a C-terminal region of MLL4. UTX knockdown resulted in significant decreases in the proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Such defective cellular characteristics of UTX-depleted cells were phenocopied by MLL4 knockdown cells. UTX-catalyzed demethylation of trimethylated H3K27 and MLL4-mediated trimethylation at H3K4 occurred interdependently at cotarget genes of UTX and MLL4. Clinically, high levels of UTX or MLL4 were associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Taken together, these findings uncover that coordinated regulation of gene expression programs by a histone methyltransferase and a histone demethylase is coupled to the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells.",['(c)2014 AACR.'],20140203,,,PMC3962500,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA157919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM095659/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS559572'],,,['Cancer Res. 2017 May 1;77(9):2553.

This hematologic malignancy is a unique model of oncogenesis where a single molecular hit, causing cell proliferation and survival, was identified. The chromosomal abnormality first highlighted by P. Nowell and D. Hungerford in 1960, and characterized as the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), the Philadelphia chromosome, discovered in leukemic cells, by J. Rowley in 1973. At the end of the 20th century, the contribution of molecular biology techniques was crucial by the discovery of the BCR-ABL1 hybrid oncogene derived from the t(9;22), responsible for the translation of an aberrant protein tyrosine kinase. This BCR-ABL1 kinase deregulates signaling pathways that control normal cell cycle and survival in primitive hematopoietic cells and is thus responsible for malignant cell accumulation observed in CML. It was then only necessary to develop a targeted treatment adapted to this molecular hit.

Although the anti-cancer properties of Chan Su have been investigated, no information exists regarding whether Chan Su has genotoxic effects in cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to examine the cyto-/genotoxic effect of Chan Su in human breast carcinoma (MCF-7 cells), human lung carcinoma (A-549 cells), human T cell leukemia (Jurkat T cells), and normal human lymphocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effects on the viability of MCF-7, A-549, Jurkat T cells, and normal lymphocytes were evaluated by Trypan blue exclusion assays. The DNA content in the sub-G1 region was detected by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. The genotoxicity of Chan Su was assessed by single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN assay). RESULTS: Chan Su significantly inhibited the viability of MCF-7, A-549, and Jurkat T cells dose dependently, but had no effect on normal human lymphocytes. Apoptotic death of the cancer cells was evident after treatment. Chan Su also induced genotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by the comet and cytokinesis-block micronucleus assays. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Chan Su can induce apoptotic death of, and exert genotoxic effects on, MCF-7, A-549, and Jurkat T cells.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, we provided structural models of the complexes between the MDM2-inhibiting p53TAD peptide and Mcl-1, Bcl-w, and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) Bcl-2 using NMR chemical shift perturbation data. The binding mode of the MDM2-inhibiting p53TAD peptide is highly conserved among the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins despite their distinct specificities for pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. We also identified the binding of a phage-display-derived MDM2-inhibiting peptide 12-1 to anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL protein by using NMR spectroscopy. The structural model of the Bcl-XL/12-1 peptide complex revealed that the conserved residues Phe4, Trp8, and Leu11 in the MDM2-inhibiting peptide fit into a hydrophobic cleft of Bcl-XL in a manner similar to that of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) peptides.

STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Sheffield, UK, from 2008 to 2009. METHODOLOGY: The approach employed was to create a chimera (human alphagammagamma) using the extracellular (EC) domain of the human high affinity IgE receptor. The alpha subunit (huFc&RIalpha) of IgE receptor was spliced onto the rodent gamma TM and cytoplasmic domain (CD). This was transfected into the Rat Basophilic Leukemia cell line in order to assess the possibility of selectively activating cells transfected with this single pass construct for antigen induced mediator release. RESULTS: The RBLs cell lines transfected with the huFc&RIalpha/gamma/gamma cDNA constructs were assessed for the cell surface expression of the huFc&RIalpha subunit and the response to the antigenic stimulus by looking for degranulation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilisation. The results obtained showed the absence of huFc&RIalpha subunit expression on the surface of transfected cells as seen by flowcytometric studies, beta-hexosaminidase assays and intracellular calcium mobilisation studies. CONCLUSION: In the present study the grounds for non-expression of huFc&RIalpha/gamma/gamma cDNA remains elusive but may be due to the fact that the human-rodent chimeric receptors are assembled differently than the endogenous rodent receptors as seen in study in which COS 7 cells were transfected with human/rat chimeric complexes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HL-60 cells was infected with Ad-NLS-RARalpha and control virus Ad-KZ. The efficiency of infection was detected by FCM. The mRNA and protein levels of NLS-RARalpha were assessed by Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. MTT assay were applied to determine proliferation of HL-60 cells. Cell surface differentiation antigen CD11b of infected HL-60 cell induced by ATRA was examined by FCM. The mRNA and protein levels of C-MYC of infected HL-60 cell induced by ATRA were determined by Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot assay. RESULTS: The efficiency of infection of Ad-NLS-RARalpha and Ad-KZ on HL-60 cell was 70%-80%. The mRNA and protein levels of NLS-RARalpha gene of HL-60 cells which infected with Ad-NLS-RARalpha were both obviously higher than that of the cells which infected with Ad-KZ and non-infected (P < 0.05). The proliferation ability of HL-60 cell infected with Ad-NLS-RARalpha was significantly increased (P < 0.05). The level of CD11b of HL-60 cell infected with Ad-NLS-RARalpha and induced by ATRA was clearly decreased than control groups (P < 0.05). The mRNA and protein levels of C-MYC gene of HL-60 cells infected with Ad-NLS-RARalpha and induced by ATRA were both obviously higher than that of the cells which infected with Ad-KZ and non-infected (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The recombined adenovirus Ad-NLS-RARalpha can increase the proliferation ability of HL-60 cell, and inhibit the differentiation of HL-60 cell through reduce the expression level of C-MYC gene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism, however, is not yet clearly known. Previously, it was reported that Mcl-1 is degraded through the ubiquitination-mediated pathway and the PEST domain is the motif responsible for promoting this degradation. We found evidence that this may not be true. We generated several Mcl-1 deletion mutants and examined their effects on protein stability. Deletion of the PEST domain did not prevent the degradation of Mcl-1 during apoptosis. The BH1 domain, but not the PEST, BH3 or BH2 domain, exhibited a short half-life. A peptide named ""F3"" (VTLISFG) in the C-terminus of the BH1 domain appears to be critical for the rapid turnover of Mcl-1. Deletion of F3 from GFP-Mcl-1-DeltaPEST retarded the degradation of this mutant. F3 appeared to be the minimum functional sequence of the degradation motif, since deletion of a single residue was sufficient to abrogate its short half-life. Fusion of F3 with p32 resulted in the degradation of p32 during UV-induced apoptosis, while wild type p32 was not affected.

There are approximately 3000 new adult cases diagnosed every year in the United States with a 5-year overall survival ranging from 22% to 50%. Most adult patients with ALL who achieve a complete response will ultimately relapse and for this subset of patients the only hope of curative therapy is successful re-induction to achieve a complete response followed by allogeneic transplant. Conventional vincristine has been used in all phases of ALL therapy but its efficacy is limited by cumulative toxicity, typically neuropathic in nature. Historically, the dose of conventional vincristine has been capped at 2 mg to avoid severe neurotoxicity. Liposomal vincristine [as vincristine sulfate liposomal injection (VSLI)] constitutes encapsulating vincristine in a sphingomyelin/cholesterol envelope. This process is thought to enhance drug delivery to the target tissues, decrease neurotoxicity by reducing the percentage of free drug in the plasma and therefore results in increased efficacy with acceptable toxicity. Results from recent trials using VSLI in the setting of relapsed/refractory Ph-negative ALL have been encouraging. VSLI as salvage monotherapy has been successful in inducing complete responses in a minority of adults with relapsed/refractory ALL so that they can be bridged to stem-cell transplantation.

It results from decay accelerating factor (CD55), and protectin (CD59), becoming attached to RBC and other cell surfaces. Absence of these protective proteins leaves such cells vulnerable to self attack at the C3 convertase and membrane attack complex (MAC) stages of complement activation. We have previously reported that aurin tricarboxylic acid (ATA) is an orally effective agent that selectively blocks complement activation at the C3 convertase stage as well as MAC formation at the C9 insertion stage. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a CH50 assay method and western blot analysis to investigate the vulnerability to complement attack of PNH RBCs compared with normal RBCs. Zymosan was used as the activator of normal serum and PNH serum. ATA was added to the sera to determine the concentration necessary to protect the RBCs from lysis by the zymosan-activated sera. RESULTS: We found that erythrocytes from PNH patients on long term treatment with eculizumab were twice as vulnerable as normal erythrocytes to lysis induced by complement activated serum. Western blot data showed the presence of both C3 and C5 convertases on the PNH patient erythrocyte membranes. These data indicate persistent vulnerability of PNH erythrocytes to complement attack due to deficiencies in CD55 and CD59. ATA, when added to serum in vitro, protected PNH erythrocytes from complement attack, restoring their resistance to that of normal erythrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ATA, by protecting PNH erythrocytes from their decay accelerating factor (CD55) and protectin (CD59) deficiencies, may be an effective oral treatment in this disorder.",,20140129,,,PMC3906152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trabecular bone volume declined more rapidly in female mice than in male littermates because of enhanced bone resorption. Although bone formation was not different between sexes, female mice exhibited a higher number of osteoblasts than male littermates, suggesting that osteoblasts from female mice may have a reduced ability to form bone. To determine the impact of sex on osteoblastogenesis, we investigated the potential for osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells from C57BL/6, Friend leukemia virus-B (FVB), C3H/HeJ and BALB/c mice of both sexes. Bone marrow stromal cells from female FVB, C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice exhibited lower Alpl and Osteocalcin expression and alkaline phosphatase activity, and formed fewer mineralized nodules than cells from male littermates. Proliferative capacity was greater in cells from male than female C57BL/6, but not FVB, mice. Sorting of bone marrow stromal cells from mice expressing an alpha-Smooth muscle actin-green fluorescent protein transgene, revealed a higher yield of mesenchymal stem cells in cultures from male mice than in those from female littermates. Sex had a modest impact on osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. To determine the influence of sex and genetic factors on osteoblast function, calvarial osteoblasts were harvested from C57BL/6, FVB, C3H/HeJ and BALB/c mice. Alpl expression and activity were lower in osteoblasts from C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ, but not FVB or BALB/c, female mice than in cells from littermates. Sex had no effect on osteoclastogenesis of bone marrow cultures of C57BL/6 mice, but osteoblasts from female mice exhibited higher Rankl and lower Opg expression than cells from male littermates. In conclusion, osteoblastogenesis is sexually dimorphic and influenced by genetic factors.",,20140128,,,PMC3904935,"['R01 DK045227/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR063049/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 HL100569/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AR021707/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL100569/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AR021707/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR021707/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR055607/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR055607/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR063049/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK045227/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to model differential signaling behavior between B cells from CLL and healthy individuals to pinpoint modes of dysregulation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed an experimental methodology combining immunophenotyping, multiplexed phosphospecific flow cytometry, and multifactorial statistical modeling. Utilizing patterns of signaling network covariance, we modeled BCR signaling in 67 CLL patients using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Results from multidimensional modeling were validated using an independent test cohort of 38 patients. RESULTS: We identified a dynamic and variable imbalance between proximal (pSYK, pBTK) and distal (pPLCgamma2, pBLNK, ppERK) phosphoresponses. PLSR identified the relationship between upstream tyrosine kinase SYK and its target, PLCgamma2, as maximally predictive and sufficient to distinguish CLL from healthy samples, pointing to this juncture in the signaling pathway as a hallmark of CLL B cells. Specific BCR pathway signaling signatures that correlate with the disease and its degree of aggressiveness were identified. Heterogeneity in the PLSR response variable within the B cell population is both a characteristic mark of healthy samples and predictive of disease aggressiveness. CONCLUSION: Single-cell multidimensional analysis of BCR signaling permitted focused analysis of the variability and heterogeneity of signaling behavior from patient-to-patient, and from cell-to-cell. Disruption of the pSYK/pPLCgamma2 relationship is uncovered as a robust hallmark of CLL B cell signaling behavior.

Single-cell analysis revealed that DN2 cells contained heterogeneous gammadelta T cell precursors with or without an ability to develop IL-17 producers. Inactivation of B cell leukemia/lymphoma 11b, a zinc finger transcription factor responsible for transition from early to late stages of DN2 cells, completely abrogated the development of IL-17-producing gammadelta T cells, although a unique subset of IFN-gamma-producing gammadelta T cells expressing a high level of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger was able to develop.

We found that ex vivo-isolated gammadelta thymocytes produced negligible IFN-gamma and lacked cytolytic activity against leukemia cells.

The limitations of current treatments motivated the design of a heterobivalent inhibitor (HBI) of IgE-mediated allergic responses that selectively inhibits allergen-IgE interactions, thereby preventing IgE clustering and mast cell degranulation. The HBI was designed to simultaneously target the allergen binding site and the adjacent conserved nucleotide binding site (NBS) found on the Fab of IgE Abs. The bivalent targeting was accomplished by linking a hapten to an NBS ligand with an ethylene glycol linker. The hapten moiety of HBI enables selective targeting of a specific IgE, whereas the NBS ligand enhances avidity for the IgE. Simultaneous bivalent binding to both sites provided HBI with 120-fold enhancement in avidity for the target IgE compared with the monovalent hapten. The increased avidity for IgE made HBI a potent inhibitor of mast cell degranulation in the rat basophilic leukemia mast cell model, in the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis mouse model of allergy, and in mice sensitized to the model allergen. In addition, HBI did not have any observable systemic toxic effects even at elevated doses.

Epub 2014 Feb 2.,,"PURPOSE: Survivors of childhood cancer are at an increased risk of developing subsequent neoplasms. In long-term survivors of childhood malignancies treated with and without cranial radiation therapy (CRT), undergoing unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, we estimated detection of intracranial neoplasms. METHODS: To investigate neurocognitive outcomes, 219 survivors of childhood cancer underwent unenhanced screening MRI of the brain. Of the survivors, 164 had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (125 received CRT) and 55 for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (none received CRT). MRI examinations were reviewed and systematically coded by a single neuroradiologist. Demographic and treatment characteristics were compared for survivors with and without subsequent neoplasms. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 219 survivors (8.7 %) had a total of 31 subsequent intracranial neoplasms identified by neuroimaging at a median time of 25 years (range 12-46 years) from diagnosis. All neoplasms occurred after CRT, except for a single vestibular schwannoma within the cervical radiation field in a HL survivor. The prevalence of subsequent neoplasms after CRT exposure was 14.4 % (18 of 125). By noncontrast MRI, intracranial neoplasms were most suggestive of meningiomas. Most patients presented with no specific, localizing neurological complaints. In addition to the schwannoma, six tumors were resected based on results of MRI screening, all of which were meningiomas on histologic review. CONCLUSION: Unenhanced brain MRI of long-term survivors of childhood cancer detected a substantial number of intracranial neoplasms. Screening for early detection of intracranial neoplasms among aging survivors of childhood cancer who received CRT should be evaluated.

SUMMARY ANSWER: In rats, an excess of HMGB1 in UF during the receptive phase is detrimental to pregnancy. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The identification of constituents of the human uterine secretome has been a subject of renewed interest, due to the advent of high throughput proteomic technologies. Proteomic-based investigations of human UF have revealed the presence of several proteins such as mucins, host defense proteins S100, heat shock protein 27 and haptoglobin, etc. The present study reports on the presence of HMGB1, a nuclear protein, in human UF. Activated macrophages/monocytes, natural killer cells, mature dendritic cells, pituicytes and erythroleukemic cells are also known to secrete HMGB1. Existing data suggest that extracellular HMGB1 plays a role in inflammation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The human part of this study was cross-sectional in design. UF and endometrial tissues were collected from regularly cycling women in the early secretory (i.e. pre-receptive phase, Day 2 post-ovulation, n = 7) or secretory phase (i.e. receptive phase, Day 6 post-ovulation, n = 7) of their menstrual cycles. Samples were also collected from cycling rats in the proestrous (n = 8) or metestrous (n = 8) phase of their estrous cycles. Uteri were also collected from HMGB1-treated pregnant (n = 7) and untreated pseudo-pregnant (n = 7) rats and from pregnant rats at Day 3-5 post-coitum (p.c.) (n = 18, 3 each for six-time points). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In each group of human samples, four samples were used for isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analysis and three samples were used for immunoblotting experiments to determine the abundance of HMGB1 in pre-receptive and receptive phase UF samples. HMGB1 levels in rat UF and endometrial tissue samples were estimated by ELISA and immunohistochemical studies, respectively. The expression of inflammation-associated molecules, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGEs), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in HMGB1-treated and pseudo-pregnant rats. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: HMGB1 was identified as one of the differentially abundant proteins in the list generated by 8-plex iTRAQ analysis of receptive and pre-receptive phase UF samples. In both humans and rats, secreted and cellular levels of HMGB1 showed a similar pattern, i.e. significantly (P < 0.05) lower abundance in the receptive phase compared with that in the pre-receptive phase. A significant (P < 0.05) decline was also observed in the endometrial expression of HMGB1 on the day of implantation in pregnant rats. Exogenous administration of recombinant HMGB1, on Day 3 p.c., led to pregnancy failure, whereas administration of recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor or saline had no effect on pregnant rats. Further investigations revealed morphological changes in the endometrium, an increase in the expression of luminal epithelial NFkappaB and significantly (P < 0.05) higher expression levels of endometrial RAGE, TNF-alpha and IL-6 in HMGB1-treated rats, compared with untreated pseudo-pregnant rats. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The mechanisms, contributing to a decline in the cellular and extracellular levels of HMGB1 during the receptive phase, remain to be ascertained. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: An excess of HMGB1 in the UF may be associated with infertility in women.",,20140130,['NOTNLM'],"['HMGB1', 'endometrium', 'implantation', 'proteomics', 'uterine fluid']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent investigations have identified PML as a regulator of metabolic pathways in stem cell compartments, including the hematopoietic system, and have provided researchers with new strategies for controlling stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Studies of PML in leukemia-initiating cells demonstrate that PML is also an essential component of their maintenance, which has drawn tremendous attention to PML from scientists in various stem cell fields. Here, we review research into PML and its associated pathways, including recent studies of PML as it relates to stem cell biology, as well as our finding that PML regulates fatty acid oxidation, which is essential to the maintenance of normal hematopoietic stem cells.

However, the expression patterns and regulatory roles of lncRNAs in hematopoietic malignancies have not been reported. Here, we carried out a genome-wide lncRNA expression study in MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MLL-r ALL) and established lncRNA/messenger RNA coexpression networks to gain insight into the biological roles of these dysregulated lncRNAs. We detected a number of lncRNAs that were differentially expressed in MLL-r ALL samples compared with MLL-r wild-type and identified unique lncRNA expression patterns between MLL-r subtypes with different translocations as well as between infant MLL-r ALL with other MLL-r ALL patients, suggesting that they might be served as novel biomarkers for the disease. Importantly, several lncRNAs that correspond with membrane protein genes, including a lysosome-associated membrane protein, were identified. No such link between the membrane proteins and MLL-r leukemia has been reported previously. Impressively, the functional analysis showed that several lncRNAs corresponded to the expression of MLL-fusion protein target genes, including HOXA9, MEIS1, etc., while some other associated with histone-related functions or membrane proteins. Further experiments characterize the effect of some lncRNAs on MLL-r leukemia apoptosis and proliferation as the function of the coexpressed HOXA gene cluster. Finally, a set of lncRNAs epigenetically regulated by H3K79 methylation were also discovered. These findings may provide novel insights into the mechanisms of lncRNAs involved in the initiation of MLL-r leukemia. This is the first study linking lncRNAs to leukemogenesis.","['(c) The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press.

The B-cell receptor of B-cell clones from multiclonal cases showed a slightly higher degree of HCDR3 homology than B-cell clones from mono clonal cases, in association with unique hematologic (e.g. lower B-lymphocyte counts) and cytogenetic (e.g. lower frequency of cytogenetically altered clones) features usually related to earlier stages of the disease. Moreover, a subgroup of coexisting B-cell clones from individual multiclonal cases which were found to be phylogenetically related showed unique molecular and cytogenetic features: they more frequently shared IGHV3 gene usage, shorter HCDR3 sequences with a greater proportion of IGHV mutations and del(13q14.3), than other unrelated B-cell clones.

We explored the possibility that leukemic suppression of innate immunity might contribute to treatment failure. Natural killer cell phenotype and function was measured in 32 consecutive acute myeloid leukemia patients at presentation, including 12 achieving complete remission. Compared to 15 healthy age-matched controls, natural killer cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients were abnormal at presentation, with downregulation of the activating receptor NKp46 (P=0.007) and upregulation of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A (P=0.04). Natural killer cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients had impaired effector function against autologous blasts and K562 targets, with significantly reduced CD107a degranulation, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma production. Failure to achieve remission was associated with NKG2A overexpression and reduced TNF-alpha production. These phenotypic and functional abnormalities were partially restored in the 12 patients achieving remission. In vitro co-incubation of acute myeloid leukemia blasts with natural killer cells from healthy donors induced significant impairment in natural killer cell TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma production (P=0.02 and P=0.01, respectively) against K562 targets and a trend to reduced CD107a degranulation (P=0.07). Under transwell conditions, the inhibitory effect of AML blasts on NK cytotoxicity and effector function was still present, and this inhibitory effect was primarily mediated by IL-10. These results suggest that acute myeloid leukemia blasts induce long-lasting changes in natural killer cells, impairing their effector function and reducing the competence of the innate immune system, favoring leukemia survival.",,20140131,,,PMC4008119,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier data indicated a stepwise improvement in outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with each phase of the accreditation process for the quality management system ""JACIE"". We therefore tested the hypothesis that working towards and achieving ""JACIE"" accreditation would accelerate improvement in outcome over calendar time. Overall mortality of the entire cohort of 107,904 patients who had a transplant (41,623 allogeneic, 39%; 66,281 autologous, 61%) between 1999 and 2006 decreased over the 14-year observation period by a factor of 0.63 per 10 years (hazard ratio: 0.63; 0.58-0.69). Considering ""JACIE""-accredited centers as those with programs having achieved accreditation by November 2012, at the latest, this improvement was significantly faster in ""JACIE""-accredited centers than in non-accredited centers (approximately 5.3% per year for 49,459 patients versus approximately 3.5% per year for 58,445 patients, respectively; hazard ratio: 0.83; 0.71-0.97). As a result, relapse-free survival (hazard ratio 0.85; 0.75-0.95) and overall survival (hazard ratio 0.86; 0.76-0.98) were significantly higher at 72 months for those patients transplanted in the 162 ""JACIE""-accredited centers. No significant effects were observed after autologous transplants (hazard ratio 1.06; 0.99-1.13). Hence, working towards implementation of a quality management system triggers a dynamic process associated with a steeper reduction in mortality over the years and a significantly improved survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

The aim of this study was to determine more precise estimations for the relationship between the NQO1 C609T polymorphism and the risk of ALL. METHODS: Electronic searches for all publications were conducted on association between this variant and ALL in several databases updated in May 2013. The quality of studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association. Seventeen studies were identified, including 2,264 ALL patients and 3,798 controls. RESULTS: Overall, significantly elevated ALL risk was associated with NQO1 C609T variant genotypes when all of the studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (TT vs. CC: OR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.18-1.79; dominant model: OR 1.45, 95 % CI 1.19-1.77). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were found for non-Asians (T/T vs. C/C: OR 1.74, 95 % CI 1.29-2.36; dominant model: T/T + C/T vs. C/C: OR 1.7, 95 % CI 1.27-2.29). When stratified by adult or children studies, statistically significantly elevated risks were found among adult studies (codominant model: C/T vs. C/C: OR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.02-1.87; dominant model: T/T + C/T vs. C/C: OR 1.52, 95 % CI 1.18-1.97) and children studies (recessive model: T/T vs. C/T + C/C: OR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.05-1.7).

METHODS: 32D cells harboring WT or mutant Abl kinases (nucleotide binding P-loop mutants Q252H, Y253F, and imatinib contact residue mutant T315I), as well as K562/G01 cells (with whole Bcr-Abl gene amplication) were tested. Kinase activity was measured using Kinase-Glo Luminescent Kinase Assay Platform in recombinant WT and mutant (Q252H, Y253F, and T315I) Abl kinases. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined using MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The phosphorylation levels of Bcr-Abl initiated signaling proteins were analyzed using Western blotting. Colony forming units (CFU) growth and long term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) were used to test the effects of C817 on human leukemia progenitor/stem cells. RESULTS: C817 potently inhibited both WT and mutant (Q252H, Y253F, and T315I) Abl kinase activities in a non-ATP competitive manner with the values of IC(5)(0) at low nanomole levels. In consistent with above results, C817 suppressed the growth of both imatinib-sensitive and resistant CML cells, including wild-type K562, K562/G01, 32D-T315I, 32D-Q252H, and 32D-Y253F cells with the values of IC(5)(0) at low micromole levels. C817 (0.5 or 1 mumol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl and downstream proteins STAT-5 and CrkL in imatinib-resistant K562/G01 cells.

USP11 deubiquitinates and stabilizes PML, thereby counteracting the functions of PML ubiquitin ligases RNF4 and the KLHL20-Cul3 (Cullin 3)-Roc1 complex. We find that USP11 is transcriptionally repressed through a Notch/Hey1-dependent mechanism, leading to PML destabilization. In human glioma, Hey1 upregulation correlates with USP11 and PML downregulation and with high-grade malignancy. The Notch/Hey1-induced downregulation of USP11 and PML not only confers multiple malignant characteristics of aggressive glioma, including proliferation, invasiveness and tumour growth in an orthotopic mouse model, but also potentiates self-renewal, tumour-forming capacity and therapeutic resistance of patient-derived glioma-initiating cells.

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of childhood cancer and resources for patient care in a cross-section of African hospitals. METHODS: Between 2011 and 2013, 49 health professionals involved in the care of children with cancer, from 38 hospitals in 29 African countries, were asked to respond to a questionnaire about the types and number of childhood cancers seen in their facilities; types and numbers of health care professionals; diagnostic, therapeutic, and palliative capabilities; survival statistics and compliance with treatment; support from parent groups; opportunities for ongoing medical training; and perceived challenges to care delivery. RESULTS: New diagnoses annually ranged from 10 to 350, with nephroblastoma, leukemia, retinoblastoma, and Burkitt lymphoma being the most common in most centers. Care was provided often by nonpediatric oncologists. Radiotherapy was available in 21/38 hospitals, palliation in 27/38, and tumor registries in 21/38 centers. CONCLUSIONS: Capabilities for care of children with cancer varied widely. Recommendations for improving care are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a nano HpaII-tiny-fragment-enrichment-by-ligation-mediated-PCR (nanoHELP) assay to compare genome-wide cytosine methylation profiles between highly purified human long-term HSC, short-term HSC, common myeloid progenitors, and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors. We observed that the most striking epigenetic changes occurred during the commitment of short-term HSC to common myeloid progenitors and these alterations were predominantly characterized by loss of methylation. We developed a metric of the HSC commitment-associated methylation pattern that proved to be highly prognostic of overall survival in 3 independent large AML patient cohorts, regardless of patient treatment and epigenetic mutations. Application of the epigenetic signature metric for AML prognosis was superior to evaluation of commitment-based gene expression signatures.

Furthermore, we evaluated the prognostic impacts of each sole mutation and the combinations of mutations and/or cytogenetics, and demonstrated that AML patients could be clearly stratified into five risk groups for overall survival by including the mutation status of DNMT3A, MLL-PTD and TP53 genes in the risk classification system of the European LeukemiaNet.

Further, real-time imaging revealed that loss of Lis1 caused defects in spindle positioning and inheritance of cell fate determinants, triggering accelerated differentiation. Finally, deletion of Lis1 blocked the propagation of myeloid leukemia and led to a marked improvement in survival, suggesting that Lis1 is also required for oncogenic growth.

Here, we report studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying APO866-induced cell death with emphasis on autophagy. Treatment of leukemia and lymphoma cells with APO866 induced both autophagy, as evidenced by an increase in autophagosome formation and in SQSTM1/p62 degradation, but also increased caspase activation as revealed by CASP3/caspase 3 cleavage. As an underlying mechanism, APO866-mediated autophagy was found to deplete CAT/catalase, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, thus promoting ROS production and cell death. Inhibition of autophagy by ATG5 or ATG7 silencing prevented CAT degradation, ROS production, caspase activation, and APO866-induced cell death. Finally, supplementation with exogenous CAT also abolished APO866 cytotoxic activity. Altogether, our results indicated that autophagy is essential for APO866 cytotoxic activity on cells from hematological malignancies and also indicate an autophagy-dependent CAT degradation, a novel mechanism for APO866-mediated cell killing.

This work presents an innovative and facile strategy to conduct such monitoring using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), thereby relating the shifts in its frequency and motional resistance to morphological changes upon cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions. By activating ECs with TNF-alpha and then characterizing their binding with HL-60 and KG-1 leukemia cells, we are able to induce the mechanical changes in ECs especially in the region of cell-substrate contact which resulted in dynamically coupled mass and viscoelastic changes representing the extent of both activation and binding. The activated ECs suffered a decrease of cellular contact area, leading to positive frequency shift and decreased motional resistance. The binding of leukemia cells onto pre-activated ECs exerted a mechanical force to regain the cell surface contact which resulted in the obvious QCM responses opposite to that of activation, and proportional to the number of cells added, in spite of the fact that these added cells are extremely outside the extinction boundary of the shear wave generated by QCM. Different cell lines demonstrate different attachment behavior, which was detected by the QCM. Despite these variations are quite subtle, yet the sensitivity of the technique for dynamic changes at the interface makes them detectable. Moreover, the reproducibility of the generated data determined at each step by deviation measurements (<10%) in response plot was very high despite the high possible heterogeneity in cell populations. The results are explained on the basis of simple theoretical and physical models, although, the development of a more quantitative and precise model is underway in our laboratory.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We have performed cell surface biotinylation of five human myeloid leukemia cell lines and normal human granulocytes, which was used for mass spectrometric analysis and allowed the identification and label-free, relative quantification of 320 membrane proteins. Several proteins exhibited a pronounced difference in expression between leukemia cell lines and granulocytes. We focused our attention on CD166/ALCAM, as this protein was strongly up-regulated on all AML cell lines and AML blasts of some patients. A human monoclonal antibody specific to CD166 (named H8) was generated using phage display technology. H8 specifically recognized AML cells in FACS analysis while demonstrating tumor targeting properties in vivo. After in vitro screening of five potent cytotoxic agents, a duocarmycin derivative was used for the preparation of an antibody-drug conjugate, which was able to kill AML cells in vitro with an IC50 of 8nM. The presented atlas of surface proteins in myeloid leukemia provides an experimental basis for the choice of target antigens, which may be used for the development of anti-AML therapeutic antibodies. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The ability to discriminate between malignant and healthy, essential cells represents an important requirement for the development of armed antibodies for the therapy of hematological malignancies. Our proteomic study is, to our knowledge, the first large scale comparison of the accessible cell surface proteome of leukemia cells and normal blood cells, facilitating the choice of a suitable target for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). An antibody drug conjugate was generated recognizing the CD166 antigen which was found to be strongly up-regulated in all AML cell lines and AML blasts of some patients. This antibody drug conjugate SIP(H8)-Duo might be further characterized in therapy experiments and might lead to a new targeted treatment option for AML.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

More than 50% of the heme synthesized in the liver is used for synthesis of P450 enzymes, which metabolize exogenous and endogenous compounds that include natural products, hormones, drugs, and carcinogens. Feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor 1a (FLVCR1a) is plasma membrane heme exporter that is ubiquitously expressed and controls intracellular heme content in hematopoietic lineages. We investigated the role of Flvcr1a in liver function in mice. METHODS: We created mice with conditional disruption of Mfsd7b, which encodes Flvcr1a, in hepatocytes (Flvcr1a(fl/fl);alb-cre mice). Mice were analyzed under basal conditions, after phenylhydrazine-induced hemolysis, and after induction of cytochromes P450 synthesis. Livers were collected and analyzed by histologic, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblot analyses. Hepatic P450 enzymatic activities were measured. RESULTS: Flvcr1a(fl/fl);alb-cre mice accumulated heme and iron in liver despite up-regulation of heme oxygenase 1, ferroportin, and ferritins. Hepatic heme export activity of Flvcr1a was closely associated with heme biosynthesis, which is required to sustain cytochrome induction. Upon cytochromes P450 stimulation, Flvcr1a(fl/fl);alb-cre mice had reduced cytochrome activity, associated with accumulation of heme in hepatocytes. The expansion of the cytosolic heme pool in these mice was likely responsible for the early inhibition of heme synthesis and increased degradation of heme, which reduced expression and activity of cytochromes P450. CONCLUSIONS: In livers of mice, Flvcr1a maintains a free heme pool that regulates heme synthesis and degradation as well as cytochromes P450 expression and activity. These findings have important implications for drug metabolism.",['Copyright (c) 2014 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Since the introduction of imatinib, newer agents have been developed and their role as first line treatment was examined. The use of genomics and proteomics as a means to tailor treatment of CML patients is underway. Meanwhile, clinical parameters as disease phase and response to treatment are used to guide a personalized approach. In this review, we will discuss the various aspects of personalized medicine in CML, including the use of the different scoring systems to guide treatment, disease phase as a means to choose the proper approach and the value of early response evaluation in decision-making.

Here we investigate whether Hes1 is involved in the development of other myeloid neoplasms. Notably, Hes1 expression was elevated in only a few cases of 65 samples with different types of myeloid neoplasms. Interestingly, elevated expression of Hes1 was found in two of five samples of Fip1-like1 platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFA)-positive myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia. Whereas FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha alone induced acute T-cell leukemia or myeloproliferative neoplasms in mouse bone marrow transplantation models, mice transplanted with bone marrow cells expressing both Hes1 and FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha developed acute leukemia characterized by an expansion of myeloid blasts and leukemic cells without eosinophilic granules. FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha conferred cytokine-independent growth to Hes1-transduced common myeloid progenitors, interleukin-3-dependent cells. Imatinib inhibited the growth of common myeloid progenitors expressing Hes1 with FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha, but not with imatinib-resistant FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha mutants harboring T674I or D842V. In contrast, ponatinib efficiently eradicated leukemic cells expressing Hes1 and the imatinib-resistant FLP1L1-PDGFRAlpha mutant in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we have established mouse models of FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive leukemia in myeloid blast crisis, which will help elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease and develop a new treatment for it.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

RESULTS: Ten published case-control studies including a total of 1494 cases and 2259 controls were identified. Overall, significant risk effects of Lys751Gln genotype was found under the dominant model (OR=1.16; 95% CI=1.01-1.34; P=0.032). When stratified by clinical types, the variant genotype was associated with the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) risk under the heterozygote comparison (OR=1.20; 95% CI=1.00-1.43; P=0.048), the homozygote comparison (OR=1.35; 95% CI=1.05-1.74; P=0.019) and the dominant model (OR=1.23; 95% CI=1.04-1.45; P=0.015), respectively.

(226)Th can be obtained via the (230)U alpha decay. This study focuses on the (230)U production using the (232)Th(d,4n)(230)Pa(beta-)(230)U reaction. METHODS: Experimental cross sections for deuteron-induced reactions on (232)Th were measured from 30 down to 19 MeV using the stacked-foil technique with beams provided by the ARRONAX cyclotron. After irradiation, all foils (targets as well as monitors) were measured using a high-purity germanium detector. RESULTS: Our new (230)Pa cross-section values, as well as those of (232)Pa and (233)Pa contaminants created during the irradiation, were compared with previous measurements and with results given by the TALYS code. Experimentally, same trends were observed with slight differences in orders of magnitude mainly due to the nuclear data change. Improvements are ongoing about the TALYS code to better reproduce the data for deuteron-induced reactions on (232)Th. CONCLUSIONS: Using our cross-section data points from the (232)Th(d,4n)(230)Pa reaction, we have calculated the thick-target yield of (230)U, in Bq/muA.h. This value allows now to a full comparison between the different production routes, showing that the proton routes must be preferred.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A total of 28 cases of anti-KANNO in the Japanese literature were reviewed. To distinguish KANNO from other antibodies against high-frequency antigens, including anti-JMH, anti-Ch/Rg, and anti-Jr(a), we conducted serologic studies with proteolytic enzyme and chemical treatments, complement sensitization against red cells, and serum neutralization techniques. Reactivity of anti-KANNO against red cells lacking high-frequency antigens and antisera to high-frequency antigens against KANNO cells were tested. Among the 28 patients, 26 were female, of whom 25 had a history of pregnancy. Red cells from patient KANNO were reactive with antisera against antigens of high frequency. Anti-KANNO reacted weakly with all cells known to lack high-frequency antigens. It reacted with 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide, so it can be distinguished from anti-JMH. Differences among anti-KANNO, anti-Ch/Rg, and anti-Jr(a) emerged with enzyme-treated cells, complement-sensitized cells, and the addition of normal serum. As yet, there are no reports of hemolytic transfusion reaction or hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn attributable to anti-KANNO. It appears that anti-KANNO is a newly characterized antibody more likely stimulated by pregnancy than by transfusion and with little or no clinical significance. Further surveillance and investigation of anti-KANNO, its antigen biochemistry, and its genetics are warranted.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.'],20131216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) originate from different lineages through distinct oncogenic events such as MLL fusions and Notch signaling, respectively. We found that Zfx, a transcription factor that controls hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, controls the initiation and maintenance of AML caused by MLL-AF9 fusion and of T-ALL caused by Notch1 activation. In both leukemia types, Zfx prevents differentiation and activates gene sets characteristic of immature cells of the respective lineages. In addition, endogenous Zfx contributes to gene induction and transformation by Myc overexpression in myeloid progenitors. Key Zfx target genes include the mitochondrial enzymes Ptpmt1 and Idh2, whose overexpression partially rescues the propagation of Zfx-deficient AML. These results show that distinct leukemia types maintain their undifferentiated phenotype and self-renewal by exploiting a common stem-cell-related genetic regulator.",['Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors.

Here, we show that select microenvironments can underlie resistance to antibody-based therapy. Using a humanized model of treatment refractory B cell leukemia, we find that infiltration of leukemia cells into the bone marrow rewires the tumor microenvironment to inhibit engulfment of antibody-targeted tumor cells. Resistance to macrophage-mediated killing can be overcome by combination regimens involving therapeutic antibodies and chemotherapy. Specifically, the nitrogen mustard cyclophosphamide induces an acute secretory activating phenotype (ASAP), releasing CCL4, IL8, VEGF, and TNFalpha from treated tumor cells. These factors induce macrophage infiltration and phagocytic activity in the bone marrow. Thus, the acute induction of stress-related cytokines can effectively target cancer cells for removal by the innate immune system. This synergistic chemoimmunotherapeutic regimen represents a potent strategy for using conventional anticancer agents to alter the tumor microenvironment and promote the efficacy of targeted therapeutics.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The case reported here is a forensic medical description of an atypical chronic subdural hematoma. A woman aged of 40-year-old died following a coma. The autopsy and histological analyses revealed the hemorrhagic disintegration of a lymphoid nodule, a metastasis from generalized lymphoma. The combination of chronic symptomatic SDH and a tumor of the dura mater have been described, but are very rare. The possibility of trauma, even minimal, has never been excluded in these cases. In fact, the clinical picture of these patients suggested a significant movement of the brain within the cranial cavity due to the physiological decrease in brain volume. In the reported case, this particular process was excluded since the spontaneous hemorrhagic effusion produced by the meningeal lymphoid nodule was the cause of the chronic SDH. This pathophysiological explanation was possible because the entire brain and meninges were removed for histological analysis. Trauma, even minimal trauma, is not always involved in the formation of a chronic SDH.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

The remodeled films were quantitatively assessed using three different techniques during this extended cultivation to provide more comprehensive insight into the impact of co-cultures on surface remodeling. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with three dimensional surface reconstructions was used to quantitatively determine various surface morphological features and measures of roughness indicative of remodeling by the cells. Additionally, reconstructed surfaces were converted to depth images for Fourier analysis to quantify the potential fractal organization of biomineralization. The long-term remodeled films were also imaged using confocal reflectance microscopy and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to further quantify morphological changes.

There were few studies on the effects of UA on differentiation, and this is the first time to elucidate the potential effect and molecular mechanism of UA on inducing differentiation in the human leukemia cell line U937. METHODS: Wright-Giemsa staining, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay and flow cytometric analysis were utilized to demonstrate the differentiation of U937 cells induced by UA. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assay were used to investigate the possible mechanism. RESULTS: It was found that UA could induce the differentiation of U937cells and Akt-activity was significantly increased during differentiation. Additionally, LY294002, a PI3K-Akt inhibitor, could block the differentiation of U937 cells induced by UA. CONCLUSION: UA could induce the differentiation of U937 cells by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, and it could be a potential candidate as a differentiation-inducing agent for the therapy of leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2014 China Pharmaceutical University.

In some cases, the evolutionary history and population frequency of the subclonal lineages of tumor cells present in the sample can be reconstructed from these SNV frequency measurements. But automated methods to do this reconstruction are not available and the conditions under which reconstruction is possible have not been described. RESULTS: We describe the conditions under which the evolutionary history can be uniquely reconstructed from SNV frequencies from single or multiple samples from the tumor population and we introduce a new statistical model, PhyloSub, that infers the phylogeny and genotype of the major subclonal lineages represented in the population of cancer cells. It uses a Bayesian nonparametric prior over trees that groups SNVs into major subclonal lineages and automatically estimates the number of lineages and their ancestry. We sample from the joint posterior distribution over trees to identify evolutionary histories and cell population frequencies that have the highest probability of generating the observed SNV frequency data. When multiple phylogenies are consistent with a given set of SNV frequencies, PhyloSub represents the uncertainty in the tumor phylogeny using a ""partial order plot"". Experiments on a simulated dataset and two real datasets comprising tumor samples from acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients demonstrate that PhyloSub can infer both linear (or chain) and branching lineages and its inferences are in good agreement with ground truth, where it is available. CONCLUSIONS: PhyloSub can be applied to frequencies of any ""binary"" somatic mutation, including SNVs as well as small insertions and deletions.

METHODS: Performance was evaluated with respect to the limit of detection (LoD), linearity, precision, and comparison on the VIIA7 Real-Time PCR system. Multiplex RQ-PCR was performed by the one-step and one-well reaction without the hands-on time. RESULTS: Our assay showed a LoD of 1.5 pg with linearity in the range of more than 4 logs of dilution. Intraassay, interassay, and total percent CVs at the concentration of 150 ng were 12.8%, 22.6%, and 28.0%, respectively. The assay correlated well with Asuragen's BCR/ABL1 Quant kit over a 6 log concentration range (r=0.9967).

However, qPCR-based applications are limited by the availability of a genetic defect associated with each tumor model under investigation. Here, we describe an off-the-shelf qPCR-based approach to detect a broad array of commonly used preclinical murine tumor models. In particular, we report that the mRNA coding for the envelope glycoprotein 70 (gp70) encoded by the endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is universally expressed in 22 murine cancer cell lines of disparate histological origin but is silent in 20 out of 22 normal mouse tissues. Further, we detected the presence of as few as 100 tumor cells in whole lung extracts using qPCR specific for gp70, supporting the notion that this detection approach has a higher sensitivity as compared with traditional tissue histology methods.

For illustrative purposes, the mechanism of action of lenalidomide can be subdivided into a cancer cell-intrinsic, a stromal, and an immunological component. Indeed, lenalidomide not only exerts direct cell cycle-arresting and pro-apoptotic effects on malignant cells, but also interferes with their physical and functional interaction with the tumor microenvironment and mediates a robust, pleiotropic immunostimulatory activity. In particular, lenalidomide has been shown to stimulate the cytotoxic functions of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, to limit the immunosuppressive impact of regulatory T cells, and to modulate the secretion of a wide range of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon gamma as well as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-12. Throughout the last decade, the antineoplastic and immunostimulatory potential of lenalidomide has been investigated in patients affected by a wide variety of hematological and solid malignancies.

Epub 2014 Jan 30.,,"BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of obesity has been increasingly recognized in survivors of pediatric ALL. However, longitudinal patterns of weight change during and after treatment, and associated factors, are less well elucidated. PROCEDURE: In a retrospective cohort of 83 pediatric patients with ALL diagnosed between 1985 and 2010, we examined body mass index (BMI) status at several key time points: diagnosis; end of induction; end of consolidation; every 6 months during maintenance; and yearly for up to 5 years post-treatment. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 21% were overweight (BMI = 85-94.9th percentile) or obese (BMI >/= 95th percentile). At the end of treatment and 5 years post-treatment, approximately 40% were overweight or obese. The mean BMI z-score was 0.2 (58th percentile) at diagnosis and increased significantly during induction (Delta = 0.5, P < 0.0001). It increased again during the first 6 months of maintenance (Delta = 0.2, P < 0.01) and did not significantly change over the remainder of maintenance (BMI z-score at the end of treatment = 0.8, 79th percentile) and 5 years post-treatment (BMI z-score = 0.7, 76th percentile). High BMI z-score at diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of being overweight/obese at treatment completion (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6-5.1). Weight gain during treatment was associated with being overweight/obese 5 years post-treatment (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.1-12.5). CONCLUSION: Children with ALL are at risk of becoming overweight/obese early in treatment. Increases in weight are maintained throughout treatment and beyond. Lifestyle interventions are needed targeting weight control early during treatment, particularly for patients overweight/obese at diagnosis and those who experience substantial weight gain during treatment.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",20140130,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood cancer', 'obesity', 'survivors']",PMC4435552,"['P30 DK046200/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025752/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000073/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30DK46200/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS688227'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the pleomorphic and anaplastic large cell types of typical ATL lymphoma, we identified lymph nodes with an unusual Hodgkin's disease-like histology (Hodgkin-like ATLL) in HTLV-I-positive patients, with Hodgkin-like ATLL showing prodromal clinical features. We also reported HTLV-I-associated lymphadenitis, characterized by non-neoplastic HTLV-I-associated lymph node lesions. It has become clear that the biological and clinical behavior of malignant lymphoma is not only determined by the properties of the lymphoma cells themselves, but also largely by the interaction of these cells with their nonmalignant microenvironment.

In many tumors up or down-regulation of different miRNAs has been reported. Human miR-17-92 gene cluster is located on 13q31.3, rooming several miRNAs including miR-17-5p, miR-17-3p, miR-18, miR-19a, miR-20a and miR-92a. Amplification or overexpression of this cluster has been reported in acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and several other cancer types. Here, we performed inhibition of miR-92a in an acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line (HL-60) using locked nucleic acid (LNA) antagomir. In different time points after LNA-anti-miR92a transfection, MTT assay and annexin/propidium iodide staining were performed. These assessments indicate that miR-92a inhibition can extensively decrease the viability of these cells which is mainly due to induction of apoptosis.

Here we show, by using MALDI TOF analysis, far-western analysis and colocalization and co-transfection studies, that STAT3 and MCL-1 are interacting partners during embryo implantation. We show in vitro that the interaction between the two endogenous proteins is strongly regulated by estrogen and progesterone. Implantation, pregnancy and embryogenesis are distinct from any other process in the body, with extensive, but controlled, proliferation, cell migration, apoptosis, cell invasion and differentiation. Cellular plasticity is vital during the early stages of development for morphogenesis and organ homeostasis, effecting the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and, the reverse process, mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). STAT3 functionally associates with MCL-1 in the mammalian breast cancer cell line MCF7 that overexpresses STAT3 and MCL-1, which leads to an increased rate of apoptosis and decreased cellular invasion, disrupting the EMT. Association of MCL-1 with STAT3 modulates the normal, anti-apoptotic, activity of MCL-1, resulting in pro-apoptotic effects. Studying the impact of the association of STAT3 with MCL-1 on MET could lead to an enhanced understanding of pregnancy and infertility, and also metastatic tumors.",,20140130,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Epithelial mesenchymal transition', 'Invasion', 'MET', 'STAT3-MCL-1 interaction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several reports have demonstrated that triptolide inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and reduces the growth of several types of tumors in vivo. To address the potential of triptolide as a novel therapeutic agent for patients with multiple myeloma, we investigated the effects of triptolide on the induction of apoptosis in human multiple myeloma cells in vitro. Triptolide rapidly induces apoptotic cell death in various myeloma cell lines. Triptolide-induced apoptosis in myeloma cells is associated with the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (psim), the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria into the cytosol, and the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Furthermore, triptolide induces a rapid decline in the levels of Mcl-1 protein that correlates with caspase activation and induction of apoptosis. Inhibition of Mcl-1 synthesis by triptolide occurs at the level of mRNA transcription and is associated with an inhibition of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II CTD. These results indicate that Mcl-1 is an important target for triptolide-induced apoptosis in myeloma cells that occurs via inhibition of Mcl-1 mRNA transcription coupled with rapid protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.",,20140127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High pHi is required for cell proliferation and differentiation. Our previous study has proven that the pHi of mesenchymal stem cells is higher than that of normal differentiated cells and similar to tumor cells. NHE1 is highly expressed in both mesenchymal stem cells and tumor cells. Targeted inhibition of NHE1 could induce differentiation of K562 leukemia cells. In the present paper we explored whether inhibition of NHE1 could induce differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. METHODS: MSCs were obtained from human umbilical cord and both the surface phenotype and functional characteristics were analyzed. Selective NHE1 inhibitor cariporide was used to treat human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs). The pHi and the differentiation of hUC-MSCs were compared upon cariporide treatment. The putative signaling pathway involved was also explored. RESULTS: The pHi of hUC-MSCs was decreased upon cariporide treatment. Cariporide up-regulated the osteogenic differentiation of hUC-MSCs while the adipogenic differentiation was not affected. For osteogenic differentiation, beta-catenin expression was up-regulated upon cariporide treatment. CONCLUSION: Decreased pHi induced by cariporide differentially contributes to hUC-MSCs differentiation.",,20140124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We matched whole chromosome analysis with cytogenomic microarray data to build a detailed description of these rearrangements. METHODOLOGY: We used a combination of single nucleotide polymorphism array and multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization approaches, and compared our array data with publicly available data for different sublines of HEL. B allele frequencies revealed the fate of each homologue for most chromosomes. RESULTS: At least two instances of the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle appear to have facilitated amplification of oncogenes and deletion of tumour suppressor genes. Because our study included centromere identification, we found that some abnormal chromosomes had centromeres that did not match the identity of the rest of the chromosome. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights the variety of complementary methods required to understand remodelling of the genome in cancer and uncover some of the mechanisms involved. We present evidence of centromere capture as a means of preserving broken chromosome segments. Testing for another highly repetitive DNA region, the nucleolus organizer region, helped identify the steps involved in chromosome 9 copy number aberrations. Increased use of techniques for identifying centromeres and other repetitive DNA regions will add to our understanding of genome remodelling and evolution. The pattern of chromosome 20 aberration in HEL supports an association of 20q11.21 amplification with erythroleukaemia (acute myeloid leukaemia subtype M6) in the context of 20q12 deletion.

SUMMARY: Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (Synribo, Teva Pharmaceuticals) is a potent plant alkaloid isolated from Cephalotaxus (Chinese yew tree) species. It has a mechanism of action distinct from that of the standard first-line therapy for CML, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and has demonstrated efficacy in adult patients with chronic- or accelerated-phase CML who develop intolerance to two or more TKIs or experience multiple TKI treatment failures. Two open-label Phase II trials (combined n = 108) demonstrated that omacetaxine produced a major cytogenetic response in 18.4% of patients with chronic-phase CML and a major hematologic response in 14.3% of patients with accelerated-phase CML (median duration of reponse, 12.5 and 4.7 months, respectively). Symptom improvement or improved overall survival in omacetaxine-treated patients has not been demonstrated. In clinical trials to date, the most common grade 1-4 adverse reactions included thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and asthenia. The drug is administered subcutaneously on an intermittent schedule (14 days on, 14 days off during induction; 7 days on, 21 days off during maintenance). Research to better delineate omacetaxine's optimal role in the management of CML and other hematologic malignancies (e.g., acute myelogenic leukemia) is ongoing.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of EGCG on anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI)/beta2GPI-induced tissue factor (TF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression in the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Human THP-1 cells cultured in vitro were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 500 ng/ml) or with the anti-beta2GPI (10 microg/ml)/beta2GPI (100 microg/ml) complex following pre-treatment with or without EGCG (0-50 microg/ml). The expression levels of TF, TNF-alpha and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were measured, and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway was determined by western blot analysis. The results revealed that the anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI complex activated the THP-1 cells, resulting in the enhanced expression of the coagulation cytokine, TF, as well as that of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha; these levels were almost comparable to those induced by LPS. Pre-treatment with EGCG decreased the TF and TNF-alpha levels in the THP-1 cells treated with the anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI complex in a dose-dependent manner and counteracted the upregulation of TLR4 expression (mRNA and protein) which was induced by the anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI complex or LPS. Furthermore, EGCG suppressed the phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and JNK and blocked the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway induced by the anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI complex or LPS. In conclusion, our results indicate that EGCG decreases the anti-beta2GPI/beta2GPI-induced TF and TNF-alpha expression in THP-1 cells possibly through the inhibition of the intracellular signal transduction pathway of TLRs-MAPKs-NF-kappaB axis and may serve as a preventive and therapeutic agent for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).",,20140127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nicotine, a main component of tobacco, has been shown to have therapeutic effects in AD. The aim of the present study was to assess the neuroprotective effects of nicotine against toxicity induced by beta-amyloid (Abeta) in relation to cell apoptosis, and to elucidate the role of the activation of the Erk1/2-p38-JNK pathway and the modulation of anti-apoptotic proteins in the nicotine-induced neuroprotective effects. We performed in vitro and in vivo experiments using SH-SY5Y cells and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. The effects of nicotine on cell apoptosis were determined by flow cytmetry and microscopic observation. The effects of nicotine on the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins were also determined by western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that nicotine protected the SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta25-35-induced toxicity by inhibiting apoptosis and upregulating the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. As shown by our in vivo experiments, nicotine effectively ameliorated the impairment in spatial working memory induced by Abeta25-35; this was confirmed by a Morris water maze navigation test and further supported by the upregulation of Bcl-2 in the hippocampus of Abeta25-35-injected mice treated with nicotine. The phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38 and JNK increased following treatment with nicotine in the SH-SY5Y cells, whereas caspase-3 activation was inhibited by treatment with nicotine prior to exposure to Abeta25-35. Of note, these effects of nicotine against Abeta25-35-induced damage were abolished by inhibitors of Erk1/2, p38 and JNK phosphorylation. These fi ndings suggest that nicotine prevents Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity through the inhibition of neuronal apoptosis, and may thus prove to be a potential preventive or therapeutic agent for AD.",,20140124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following incubation with BCR-ABL1-positive MVs, mononuclear cells derived from normal transplants exhibited a leukemia-like malignant phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. Horizontal transfer of BCR-ABL1 mRNA from MVs into the recipient cells was critical to the transformation. Relative genomic instability was observed and considered the main mechanism in the recipient cells. MVs contributed to genomic instability by two distinct pathways: via consequent overexpression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase and reactive oxygen species, which mediated DNA breakage and recombination; and via upregulation of methyltransferases and global DNA hypermethylation. We demonstrated that BCR-ABL1-positive MVs could initiate malignant transformation of normal hematopoietic transplants through genomic instability, which might serve as a convenient and operable model for investigating leukemogenesis, especially for DCL.

The integrity of the PDFGRA locus was demonstrated using several different approaches, including massive parallel sequencing and Sanger sequencing. PDGF-AA was found to be expressed and secreted by PTCL/NOS cells and to be necessary and sufficient for PDGFRA phosphorylation ex vivo by sustaining an autocrine stimulation. We documented consistently high PDGF-A expression in primary biopsies and patients' plasma and tracked PDGFRA signaling in primary tumors, achieving evidence of its activation. Indeed, we found that STAT1 and STAT5 are implicated in PDGFRA signaling transduction.

Although a majority of MPN patients carry heterozygous JAK2V617F mutation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 9p (9pLOH) involving the JAK2 locus has been observed in approximately 30% of MPN patients. JAK2V617F homozygosity via 9pLOH has been associated with more severe MPN phenotype. However, the contribution of 9pLOH in the pathogenesis of MPNs remains unclear. To investigate the roles of wild-type JAK2 (JAK2 WT) and JAK2V617F alleles in the development of MPNs, we have used conditional Jak2 knock-out and Jak2V617F knock-in mice and generated heterozygous, hemizygous and homozygous Jak2V617F mice. Whereas heterozygous Jak2V617F expression results in a polycythemia vera-like MPN in mice, loss of Jak2 WT allele in hemizygous or homozygous Jak2V617F mice results in markedly increased white blood cells, neutrophils, reticulocytes and platelets in the peripheral blood, and significantly larger spleen size compared with heterozygous Jak2V617F mice. Hemizygous or homozygous Jak2V617F mice also exhibit accelerated myelofibrosis compared with mice expressing heterozygous Jak2V617F. Together, these results suggest that loss of Jak2 WT allele increases the severity of the MPN. Thus, the Jak2 WT allele functions as a negative regulator of MPN induced by Jak2V617F.",,20140131,,,PMC4117831,['R01 HL095685/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS560853'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To describe such phylogenetic trees in a series of patients with MM, we perform whole-exome sequencing and single-cell genetic analysis. Our results demonstrate that at presentation myeloma is composed of two to six different major clones, which are related by linear and branching phylogenies. Remarkably, the earliest myeloma-initiating clones, some of which only had the initiating t(11;14), were still present at low frequencies at the time of diagnosis. For the first time in myeloma, we demonstrate parallel evolution whereby two independent clones activate the RAS/MAPK pathway through RAS mutations and give rise subsequently to distinct subclonal lineages. We also report the co-occurrence of RAS and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) p.K123R mutations in 4% of myeloma patients. Lastly, we describe the fluctuations of myeloma subclonal architecture in a patient analyzed at presentation and relapse and in NOD/SCID-IL2Rgamma(null) xenografts, revealing clonal extinction and the emergence of new clones that acquire additional mutations. This study confirms that myeloma subclones exhibit different survival properties during treatment or mouse engraftment.

Cancer-associated RAS mutations occur frequently in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting a functional role for Ras in leukemogenesis. METHODS: We successfully established a mouse model of human leukemia by transplanting bone marrow cells co-transfected with the K-ras (G12D) mutation and AML1/ETO fusion protein. RESULTS: Mice transplanted with AML/ETO+KRAS co-transduced cells had the highest mortality rate than mice transplanted with AML/ETO- or KRAS-transduced cells (115d vs. 150d). Upon reaching a terminal disease stage, EGFP-positive cells dominated their spleen, lymph nodes, peripheral blood and central nervous system tissue. Immunophenotyping, cytologic analyses revealed that AML/ETO+KRAS leukemias predominantly contained immature myeloid precursors (EGFP(+)/c-Kit(+)/Mac-1(-)/Gr-1(-)). Histologic analyses revealed that massive leukemic infiltrations were closely packed in dense sheets that effaced the normal architecture of spleen and thymus in mice transplanted with AML1/ETO + KRAS co-transduced cells. K-ras mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in bone marrow cells of the K-ras group and AML1/ETO + Kras group. The phosphorylation of MEK/ERK was significantly enhanced in the AML1/ETO + Kras group. The similar results of the AML1/ETO + Nras group were consistent with those reported previously. CONCLUSION: Co-transduction of Kras(G12D) and AML1/ETO induces acute monoblastic leukemia. Since expression of mutant K-ras alone was insufficient to induce leukemia, this model may be useful for investigating the multi-step leukemogenesis model of human leukemia.",,20140117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Oct 26.,,"BACKGROUND AIMS: Naturally occurring regulatory T cells (Treg) are emerging as a promising approach for prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), which remains an obstacle to the successful outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, Treg only constitute 1-5% of total nucleated cells in cord blood (CB) (<3 x 10(6) cells), and therefore novel methods of Treg expansion to generate clinically relevant numbers are needed. METHODS: Several methodologies are currently being used for ex vivo Treg expansion. We report a new approach to expand Treg from CB and demonstrate their efficacy in vitro by blunting allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions and in vivo by preventing GvHD through the use of a xenogenic GvHD mouse model. RESULTS: With the use of magnetic cell sorting, naturally occurring Treg were isolated from CB by the positive selection of CD25(+) cells. These were expanded to clinically relevant numbers by use of CD3/28 co-expressing Dynabeads and interleukin (IL)-2. Ex vivo-expanded Treg were CD4(+)25(+) FOXP3(+)127(lo) and expressed a polyclonal T-cell receptor, Vbeta repertoire. When compared with conventional T-lymphocytes (CD4(+)25(-) cells), Treg consistently showed demethylation of the FOXP3 TSDR promoter region and suppression of allogeneic proliferation responses in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: In our NOD-SCID IL-2Rgamma(null) xenogeneic model of GvHD, prophylactic injection of third-party, CB-derived, ex vivo-expanded Treg led to the prevention of GvHD that translated into improved GvHD score, decreased circulating inflammatory cytokines and significantly superior overall survival. This model of xenogenic GvHD can be used to study the mechanism of action of CB Treg as well as other therapeutic interventions.","['Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

The nuclear periphery, containing Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs), plays an important role in the spatial organization of chromatin and in transcriptional regulation. The role of Nuclear Pore Proteins (Nups) in transcription and their involvement in leukemia and viral integration has renewed interest in understanding their mechanism of action. Nups bind to both repressed and active genes, often in a regulated fashion. Nups can associate with chromatin both at the NPC and inside the nucleoplasm. These interactions are guided by evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that involve promoter DNA elements and trans-acting factors. These interactions can also lead to interchromosomal clustering of co-regulated genes. Nups affect gene expression by promoting stronger transcription, by limiting the spread of repressed chromatin or by altering chromatin structure. Nups can promote epigenetic regulation by establishing boundary elements and poising recently repressed genes for faster reactivation.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing either a vaccine to prevent the disease or another novel drug to specifically target and eradicate the CML cell will require the identification of CML-associated cell-surface markers and molecules that can bind specifically to the cell surface. In an attempt to discover peptides that bind specifically to cells in the early chronic phase of the disease, we used phage-display technology to identify heptapeptides that bind specifically to the surface of BCR/ABL-expressing fibroblasts. METHODS: An in vitro system using NIH3T3 stably transfected with pGD210 (BCR/ABL) was used as a model for the chronic phase of the disease. The cells were panned using a linear heptapeptide phage library (Ph.D 7.0) in a negative/positive panning strategy with NIH3T3 containing only the plasmid vector as the wild type control. RESULTS: We identified four novel peptides that were enriched through this technique. These peptides contained either multiple proline residues or serine/threonine-proline pairs and showed a confirmed binding preference for BCR/ABL+ fibroblasts. The peptide Y-R-A-P-W-P-P also showed a binding affinity for granulocytes from untreated CML patients. CONCLUSION: We have identified several novel peptides that can be used in future studies to identify specific CML cell-surface antigens or provide a novel drug-delivery mechanism.",['Copyright (c) 2014.

Immunoglobulin (Ig)H/T-cell receptor MRD 30 d before transplant could be obtained in 122 of the 133 cases of high-risk paediatric ALL enrolled.

Multivariate analysis identified sex match and MRD as being significantly associated with 5-year survival. MRD >/=10(-3) compromised the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (43.6 vs. 16.7%). Complete remission status and stem cell source did not modify the relationship between MRD and prognosis. Thus, pre-transplant MRD is still a major predictor of outcome for ALL.

Recently, it has emerged that LRRK2 plays important roles in the immune system. LRRK2 is induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in monocytes, but the signaling pathway is not known. Here, we show that IFN-gamma-mediated induction of LRRK2 was suppressed by pharmacological inhibition and RNA interference of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5). This was confirmed by LRRK2 immunostaining, which also revealed that the morphological responses to IFN-gamma were suppressed by ERK5 inhibitor treatment. Both human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated the ERK5-LRRK2 pathway after differentiation into macrophages. Thus, LRRK2 is induced via a novel, ERK5-dependent IFN-gamma signal transduction pathway, pointing to new functions of ERK5 and LRRK2 in human macrophages. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a major risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the role of LRRK2 in the affected neurons remains enigmatic. Recently, LRRK2 has been reported to be strongly expressed in the immune system.

AIM: To understand the underlying mechanism of this hypopigmentation effect, and to explore the possibility of using imatinib in the treatment of pigmentation disorders. METHODS: We examined the effects of imatinib on the proliferation, apoptosis, melanin content and melanogenic activity of human primary epidermal melanocytes. The responsible molecular events were also investigated in a mechanism study. RESULTS: We found that imatinib led to a dramatic decrease in total melanin content in cultured melanocytes, by affecting melanocyte number and/or melanogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition of melanogenesis was due to suppressed expression of tyrosinase and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MiTF). Furthermore, stem cell factor (SCF)-stimulated c-Kit activation and melanocyte proliferation were completely abrogated by imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of c-Kit signalling by imatinib has inhibitory effects on melanocyte survival, proliferation and melanogenesis, which explains the clinical hypopigmentation seen in patients with CML.

It is characterized by a Bcr-Abl (breakpoint cluster region-Abelson leukemia virus) tyrosine kinase fusion protein produced from the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib was the first targeted therapy licensed for patients with chronic-phase CML. In recent years, many other TKIs have been approved for the treatment of patients with CML. For this reason, the choice of the best strategy treatment has become increasingly complex. AREAS COVERED: Bosutinib , a dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, has shown potent activity against CML and it has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of chronic, accelerated or blast-phase Ph+ CML. This review was conducted to describe the preclinical and clinical activity of bosutinib and the safety and tolerability of the drug in the treatment of CML. Included studies were identified through a search of electronic databases in July 2013 and relevant conference proceedings. EXPERT OPINION: Imatinib continues to represent the treatment of choice for CML. However, some patients develop resistance or intolerance to imatinib or to other second-generation TKIs. Bosutinib shows a good therapeutic activity with a benign safety profile, no cardiovascular toxicity, and offers an important therapeutic addition to the armamentarium that physicians can use against resistant CML.",,20140130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of imatinib mesylate in treating chronic myeloid leukemia patients and to identify factors related to therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: This retrospective study was based on information obtained from patients' records in the Hematology Service of Hospital Universitario Walter Cantidio of the Universidade Federal do Ceara (HUWC / UFC). All patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia that took imatinib mesylate for a minimum of 12 months in the period from January 2001 to January 2011 were included. From a population of 160 patients, 100 were eligible for analysis. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 100 patients who were mostly male (51%) with ages ranging between 21 and 40 years (42%), from the countryside (59%), in the chronic phase (95%), with high-risk prognostic factors (40%); the prognosis of high risk was not associated with complete hematologic response or complete cytogenetic response, but correlated to complete molecular response or major molecular response. Reticulin condensation was associated with complete hematologic response and complete cytogenetic response. It was found that 53% of patients had greater than 90% adherence to treatment. The high adherence was correlated to attaining complete cytogenetic response in less than 12 months. Moreover,20% of patients had good response. CONCLUSION: Significant changes are indispensable in the monitoring of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.

Retroviral replication requires the nucleocytoplasmic transport of both spliced and unspliced RNA transcripts, and RNA export mechanisms of gammaretroviruses are poorly characterized. Here, we report the involvement of the nuclear export receptor NXF1/TAP in the nuclear export of gammaretroviral RNA transcripts. We identified a conserved cis-acting element in the pol gene of gammaretroviruses, including murine leukemia virus (MLV) and xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMRV), named the CAE (cytoplasmic accumulation element). The CAE enhanced the cytoplasmic accumulation of viral RNA transcripts and the expression of viral proteins without significantly affecting the stability, splicing, or translation efficiency of the transcripts. Insertion of the CAE sequence also facilitated Rev-independent HIV Gag expression. We found that the CAE sequence interacted with NXF1, whereas disruption of NXF1 ablated CAE function. Thus, the CAE sequence mediates the cytoplasmic accumulation of gammaretroviral transcripts in an NXF1-dependent manner. Disruption of NXF1 expression impaired cytoplasmic accumulations of both spliced and unspliced RNA transcripts of XMRV and MLV, resulting in their nuclear retention or degradation. Thus, our results demonstrate that gammaretroviruses use NXF1 for the cytoplasmic accumulation of both spliced and nonspliced viral RNA transcripts. IMPORTANCE: Murine leukemia virus (MLV) has been studied as one of the classic models of retrovirology. Although unspliced host messenger RNAs are rarely exported from the nucleus, MLV actively exports unspliced viral RNAs to the cytoplasm. Despite extensive studies, how MLV achieves this difficult task has remained a mystery. Here, we have studied the RNA export mechanism of MLV and found that (i) the genome contains a sequence which supports the efficient nuclear export of viral RNAs, (ii) the cellular factor NXF1 is involved in the nuclear export of both spliced and unspliced viral RNAs, and, finally, (iii) depletion of NXF1 results in nuclear retention or degradation of viral RNAs. Our study provides a novel insight into MLV nuclear export.",,20140129,,,PMC3993726,['R21 AI093186/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients who received 4 or more cycles of BEACOPP(escalated) had an increased risk to develop t-AML/MDS when compared with patients treated with less than 4 cycles of BEACOPP(escalated) or no BEACOPP chemotherapy (1.7% vs 0.7% vs 0.3%, P < .0001). The median overall survival (OS) for all t-AML/MDS patients was 7.2 months. However, t-AML/MDS patients proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation had a significantly better outcome with a median OS not reached after a median follow-up of 41 months (P < .001).",,20140129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous trials have showed conflicting results concerning the efficacy and toxicity of adding GO to induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to resolve this controversial issue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Summary data from five randomized phase III trials compared adding GO to induction chemotherapy with induction chemotherapy alone for newly diagnosed AML were meta-analyzed. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS), and pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for complete remission (CR) rate, incidences of resistance disease, relapse and toxicity were calculated. RESULTS: Data of 3596 patients (1798 GO and 1798 controls) from five randomized phase III trials were analyzed. Compared with induction chemotherapy alone, adding GO significantly prolonged OS (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86-1.00, P=0.05) and RFS (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.95, P=0.003), decreased the incidences of resistant disease (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.93, P=0.01) and relapse (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.90, P=0.002), but had no effect on CR rate (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91-1.46, P=0.24). Sensitivity analysis yielded similar results. Subgroup analysis identified that cytogenetics might be an influencing factor for the effect of adding GO. In addition, the risks of grade 3-4 nausea/vomiting, diarrhea and liver aspartate transaminase (AST) elevation were increased in GO arm. CONCLUSIONS: Adding GO to induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML can significantly prolong OS and RFS, decrease incidences of resistant disease and relapse, but may increase risks of grade 3-4 nausea/vomiting, diarrhea and liver AST elevation.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'gemtuzumab ozogamicin', 'induction chemotherapy', 'meta-analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects on bone mineral metabolism were observed during early imatinib treatment, in the form of hypophosphatemia with increased urinary phosphorus excretion. This finding led to detailed investigations of off-target effects responsible for changes in bone cell maturation, activity, and impact on bone mass. Subsequently, another BCR-Abl inhibitor (dasatinib), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors (sorafenib and sunitinib) as well as rearranged during transfection (RET) inhibitors (vandetanib and cabozantinib) were developed. Inhibition of bone resorption appears to be a class effect and is likely contributed by TKI effects on the hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells.

Cell viability study and flow cytometric analysis confirmed the potent cytotoxic effects of ZnS NPs on cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Successful uptakes of ZnS NPs by leukemic cells were confirmed by phase contrast fluorescence microscopy. pH-dependent dissolution of ZnS NPs was done using atomic absorption microscopy to understand the cell-specific internalization of Zn(+) . This internalization of NPs facilitated the generation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion which caused severe DNA damage as observed in the comet assay and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in leukemic cells. Surprisingly ZnS NPs had no toxic effects on normal lymphocytes at doses up to 50 microg ml(-1) . Pre-treatment with ROS and TNF-alpha inhibitor confirmed that these nanoparticles were able to kill leukemic cells by generating an excess amount of ROS and thereby initiated TNF-alpha mediated apoptosis pathway.

The main cause of treatment failures may be insufficient eradication of a subpopulation of leukemic stem-like cells (LSC), which are thought to be responsible for relapse by giving rise to more differentiated leukemic progenitors (LP). To address the need for therapeutic targets in LSCs, we compared microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns in highly enriched healthy CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), CD34(+)CD38(-) LSCs, and CD34(+)CD38(+) LPs, all derived from the same patients' bone marrow (BM) specimens. In this manner, we identified multiple differentially expressed miRNAs, in particular miR-126, which was highly expressed in HSCs and increased in LSCs compared with LPs, consistent with a stem-like cell function. High miR-126 expression in AML was associated with poor survival, higher chance of relapse, and expression of genes present in LSC/HSC signatures. Notably, attenuating miR-126 expression in AML cells reduced in vitro cell growth by inducing apoptosis, but did not affect the survival of normal BM in which it instead enhanced expansion of HSCs. Furthermore, targeting miR-126 in LSCs and LPs reduced their clonogenic capacity and eliminated leukemic cells, again in the absence of similar inhibitory effects on normal BM cells.

The study found a tendency for cases of leukaemia to live closer to the nearest nuclear power station than their matched controls, producing an odds ratio that was raised to a statistically significant extent for residence within 5 km of a nuclear power station. The findings of the study received much publicity, but a detailed radiological risk assessment demonstrated that the radiation doses received by young children from discharges of radioactive material from the nuclear reactors were much lower than those received from natural background radiation and far too small to be responsible for the statistical association reported in the KiKK Study. This has led to speculation that conventional radiological risk assessments have grossly underestimated the risk of leukaemia in young children posed by exposure to man-made radionuclides, and particular attention has been drawn to the possible role of tritium and carbon-14 discharges in this supposedly severe underestimation of risk. Both (3)H and (14)C are generated naturally in the upper atmosphere, and substantial increases in these radionuclides in the environment occurred as a result of their production by atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons during the late 1950s and early 1960s. If the leukaemogenic effect of these radionuclides has been seriously underestimated to the degree necessary to explain the KiKK Study findings, then a pronounced increase in the worldwide incidence of leukaemia among young children should have followed the notably elevated exposure to (3)H and (14)C from nuclear weapons testing fallout. To investigate this hypothesis, the time series of incidence rates of leukaemia among young children <5 years of age at diagnosis has been examined from ten cancer registries from three continents and both hemispheres, which include registration data from the early 1960s or before. No evidence of a markedly increased risk of leukaemia in young children following the peak of above-ground nuclear weapons testing, or that incidence rates are related to level of exposure to fallout, is apparent from these registration rates, providing strong grounds for discounting the idea that the risk of leukaemia in young children from (3)H or (14)C (or any other radionuclide present in both nuclear weapons testing fallout and discharges from nuclear installations) has been grossly underestimated and that such exposure can account for the findings of the KiKK Study.",,20140130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
