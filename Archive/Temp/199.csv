Its application to the allogeneic setting seemed inevitable. For obvious ethical reasons, allogeneic donors are mobilized with cytokines only, mainly granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Results from preliminary studies suggest that in comparison to standard bone marrow transplants, outcomes such as engraftment, host-versus-graft reaction, graft-versus-host disease, graft-versus-leukemia and immunological reconstitution may be different. Surprisingly, G-CSF, previously recognized as a late acting lineage-specific factor for neutrophil production, not only disrupts homeostasis between stem cells and their microenvironment, but also induces significant quantitative and qualitative changes in the accessory cell compartment, affecting lymphocytes, monocytes, natural killer, dendritic, and stromal cells. Furthermore, mobilization of huge numbers of non-professional antigen presenting cells (CD34+ stem cells) amplifies the tolerizing potential of PB stem cell grafts. Thus, G-CSF mobilization provides PB transplants with different immunobiologic properties in comparison to standard bone marrow grafts. Whether these immunobiologic differences will lead to better transplant outcomes remains to be shown through much awaited results of large randomized clinical trials.","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Together with previous reports, available data indicate that amplification of 11q23/MLL is a recurrent genetic change in myeloid malignancy. It affects mainly elderly patients and is often associated with dysplastic bone marrow changes or with complex karyotypic aberrations, suggestive of genotoxic exposure. It is associated with a poor prognosis. In addition, FISH analysis of nine cases with additional 11q probes showed that the overrepresented chromosomal region is generally not restricted to MLL, and Southern blot analysis indicated that amplification does not involve a rearranged copy of this gene.

For the interpretation of these studies, we need information about the Vbeta repertoire usage in healthy individuals. METHODS: We analyzed blood T-lymphocyte (sub)populations of 36 healthy controls (age range: from neonates to 86 years) with a carefully selected most complete panel of 22 Vbeta monoclonal antibodies, which together recognized 70-75% of all blood TCRalphabeta(+) T lymphocytes. Subsequently, we developed a six-tube test kit with selected Vbeta antibody combinations for easy and rapid detection of single (""clonal"") Vbeta domain usage in large T-cell expansions. RESULTS: The mean values of the Vbeta repertoire usage were stable during aging in blood TCRalphabeta(+) T lymphocytes as well as in the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subsets, although the standard deviations increased in the elderly. The increased standard deviations were caused by the occurrence of oligoclonal T-cell expansions in the elderly, mainly consisting of CD8(+) T lymphocytes. The 15 detected T-cell expansions did not reach 40% of total TCRalphabeta(+) T lymphocytes and represented less than 0.4 x 10(9) cells per liter in our study. Vbeta usage of the CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets was comparable for most tested Vbeta domains, but significant differences (P < 0.01) between the two subsets were found for Vbeta2, Vbeta5.1, Vbeta6.7, Vbeta9.1, and Vbeta22 (higher in CD4(+)), as well as for Vbeta1, Vbeta7.1, Vbeta14, and Vbeta23 (higher in CD8(+)). Finally, single Vbeta domain expression in large T-cell expansions can indeed be detected by the six-tube test kit. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study can now be used as reference values in studies on distortions of the Vbeta repertoire in disease states.

It is usually more common among patients with chromosomal abnormalities. Transient myeloproliferative disease (TMD) is an hyperleukocytosis entity that occurs almost exclusively in Down syndrome patients and remits spontaneously. Spontaneous remission of congenital leukemia has been reported and related to the presence of an extra chromosome 21. PROCEDURE: A pair of non-Down syndrome newborn twins presented with a clinical picture of skin rash and hyperleukocytosis. Twin B had full-blown cANLL with bone marrow, peripheral blood, skin, CSF, and placental invasion. Twin A presented transient peripheral blood and skin involvement by the same type of blast cells. No cytotoxic therapy was given. With 2 years follow-up, they continue to do well. RESULTS: Histologic and immunophenotypical analysis of placentas, cord blood, skin, CSF, bone marrows, and peripheral blood revealed a consistent picture of intrautero cANLL in twin B, with transplacental invasion of twin A. Normal and blast cells were found to be karyotypically normal. Spontaneous remission occurred. CONCLUSIONS: cANLL with karyotypically normal blasts can develop a self-limited clinical course, which has resemblances to TMD.","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.

We evaluated changes in body mass index (BMI) in a cohort of ALL survivors, all of whom have been followed until completion of linear growth. PROCEDURE: BMI (weight/height(2)) was used as an index of adiposity and was calculated at diagnosis, at the end of treatment, and at attainment of final height in a cohort of 126 (59 males) survivors of ALL. BMI was adjusted for age and sex by computing a BMI standard deviation score (SDS) or z score. The spectrum of therapies used included intrathecal chemotherapy given alone (n = 38) or combined with cranial irradiation (CRT; 18 Gy, n = 35; 24 Gy, n = 53) and exposure to prednisone at a low dose (<3.5 gm, n = 49), medium dose (3.5-9.4 gm, n = 46), or high dose (>9.4 gm, n = 30). RESULTS: Overall, mean +/- SEM BMI-SDS increased significantly between diagnosis (-0.18 +/- 0.08) and the end of therapy (0.41 +/- 0.09, P < 0.01), with no significant change thereafter. For patients without CRT, mean BMI-SDS remained unchanged, whereas, for those so treated, mean BMI-SDS increased significantly between diagnosis and the completion of therapy (P < 0.001). The change in mean BMI-SDS was greater in the 24 Gy group vs. the 18 Gy CRT sample (P < 0.005). In a multivariate logistic regression model, CRT was an independent predictor of being overweight (BMI >/=85 percentile) at attainment of final height [odds ratio = 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.0-23. 1)]. The percentage of subjects who were overweight at attainment of final height was 10.5%, 40%, and 38% for subjects treated with no CRT, 18 Gy CRT, or 24 Gy CRT, respectively (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL given CRT develop increases in their BMI-SDS early on and during treatment and remain at significant risk for becoming overweight as young adults, a development that may increase their already heightened risk for various adverse health outcomes.","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA. sklarc@mskcc.org']",['VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)'],,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these techniques are time-consuming, prone to background staining, and rarely suitable for detecting two antigens present at the same site, since one label tends to obscure the other. This paper reports the use of immmunofluorescence for double labelling of pairs of molecular markers in routinely processed tissue. The primary antibodies are either monoclonal reagents of differing isotype/subclass, or antibodies from different species, and labelling is visualized on a conventional fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera. Images can be captured and adjusted using personal computer hardware and software. This approach could be used for a wide range of tissue markers and only minimal tissue autofluorescence was observed. The procedure is more rapid than enzyme-based techniques and avoids the problems of interpreting two antigens present at the same site. Its establishment involves relatively minor expenditure and it may represent the optimal technical approach to the co-localization of pairs of antigens in routinely processed tissue samples.","['Leukaemia Research Fund Immunodiagnostics Unit, The Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK. david.mason@cellsci.ox.ac.uk']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,"['Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An experimental and theoretical framework for predicting and controlling the outcome of stem cell stimulation by exogenous cytokines would thus be useful. An emerging theme from recent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-expansion studies is that a net gain in HSC numbers requires the maintenance of critical signaling ligand(s) above a threshold level. These ligand-receptor complex thresholds can be maintained, for example, by high concentrations of soluble cytokines or by cytokine presentation on cell surfaces. According to such a model, when the relevant ligand-receptor interaction falls below this threshold level, the probability of a differentiation response is increased; otherwise, self-renewal is favored. Taking advantage of the ability of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to maintain embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotentiality at high concentrations, we are testing this model by investigating critical parameters in the control of ES cell responses. We have developed quantitative assays of ES cell differentiation by measuring cell-surface alkaline phosphatase activity, cell-surface stage specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-1 expression, and the ability of ES cells to form embryoid bodies. Examination of ES cell responses over a range of LIF concentrations shows that LIF supplementation has little effect on ES cell-growth rate but significantly alters the probability of a cell undergoing a self-renewal vs. a differentiation division. In vitro culture parameters such as inoculum cell density, medium exchange, as well as cell-intrinsic processes such as autocrine secretion are shown to affect this decision. In addition to yielding new information on stem cell regulation by exogenous factors, these studies provide important clues about culture of these cells and should stimulate further investigations into the mechanistic basis of stem cell differentiation control.","['Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering; Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']","['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",,"['Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Treatment of HL-60 cells with either PMA or bryostatin 1, which acutely activates protein kinase C (PKC), decreased the levels of myc mRNA and Myc protein. The inhibition of Myc synthesis accounted for the drop in Myc protein, because PMA treatment had no effect on Myc turnover. Treatment with PMA or bryostatin 1 increased nuclear protein binding to MIE1, a c-myc intron 1 element that defines an RFX1-binding X box. RFX1 antiserum supershifted MIE1-protein complexes. Increased MIE1 binding was independent of protein synthesis and abolished by a selective PKC inhibitor, which also prevented the effect of PMA on myc mRNA and protein levels and Myc synthesis. PMA treatment increased RFX1 in the nuclear fraction and decreased it in the cytosol without affecting total RFX1. Transfection of HL-60 cells with myc reporter gene constructs showed that the RFX1-binding X box was required for the down-regulation of reporter gene expression by PMA. These findings suggest that nuclear translocation and binding of RFX1 to the X box cause the down-regulation of myc expression, which follows acute PKC activation in undifferentiated HL-60 cells.","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, USA.']","['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RFX1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'MBK3OO5K8T (bisindolylmaleimide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,['GM60383/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that T-cell infiltrates within a liver biopsy during clinical GVHD would show a restricted T-cell response because the T cells would be responding to a limited number of antigens. We studied the peripheral T-cell repertoire and the liver-infiltrating T-cell repertoire of a patient who developed skin GVHD and subsequent liver GVHD after a matched sibling bone marrow transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia. Spectratype analysis of peripheral blood at the time of liver GVHD revealed that the patient had reconstituted a complex peripheral T-cell repertoire as evidenced by the presence of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length heterogeneity in most of the T-cell families. The repertoire complexity was skewed in variable gene beta (VB) 5.3, VB4, VB7, VB8, and VB15. Spectratype analysis on the liver biopsy sample revealed a limited infiltrate with an oligoclonal expansion in VBs 4, 7, and 8. We evaluated the T-cell infiltrate in more detail by sequencing the relevant expansions noted by spectratype and developing probes for the predominant CDR3 sequences. These clonotype probes were hybridized to peripheral blood and liver samples from the patient, a T-cell line developed from the patient's peripheral blood at the time of the initial skin GVHD, the donor's blood and marrow, and control samples.

The hEpoR cDNA was efficiently transduced into ES cells, forming hEpoR that stably expressed ES (ES-hEpoR) cells. Expression of hEpoR cDNA was confirmed in ES-hEpoR cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis. Colony assays demonstrated that definitive erythroid and primitive erythroid colonies were significantly increased from ES-hEpoR cells, when compared with mock virus-transduced ES (ES-Neo) cells, during the time course of differentiation induced by withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor, in either the presence or the absence of Epo. Multipotential colony-forming units (CFU-Mix) were also increased in ES-hEpoR cells at different stages of differentiation, but no changes were detected for CFU-granulocyte-macrophage colonies (CFU-GM). Time course studies by Northern blot analysis demonstrated elevated levels of expression of beta-H1 and beta-Major globin genes in embryoid bodies derived from ES-hEpoR cells stimulated with Epo, when compared with similar expression from ES-Neo cells. Expression of the GATA-1 gene was enhanced in ES-hEpoR cells, when compared with ES-Neo cells, beginning immediately after initiation of the cultures until 8 days of differentiation. These data indicate that primitive and definitive erythropoiesis in differentiating embryoid bodies can be enhanced by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of an hEpoR gene.","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, The Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine and the Walther Cancer Institute, Indianapolis 46202-5254, USA.']","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,"['R01 DK 53674/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), remissions following DLI are invariably associated with conversion to complete donor hematopoiesis, suggesting that the target antigens of this response are expressed on both normal and CML-derived hematopoietic stem cells. In the present study, we examined hematopoietic chimerism and the complexity of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in 4 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who received infusions of donor CD4+ lymphocytes. Three of 4 patients had a clinical response that began 1 to 2 months after DLI. All 3 responding patients developed lymphocytosis at the initiation of response that was due to a 2- to 4.5-fold increase in the number of CD3+ T cells. In 1 patient, this was due primarily to increases in CD3+ and CD8+ cells; in 2 patients, to increased numbers of CD3+ and CD8+ and CD3+ and CD4+ T cells. In all responding patients, conversion to complete donor hematopoiesis occurred in the first 2 months after DLI. The single nonresponding patient remained it 100% recipient hematopoiesis. The TCR repertoire complexity was examined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3) derived from 24 Vbeta gene subfamilies. In 2 patients, the initiation of myeloma response and conversion to complete donor hematopoiesis was associated with normalization of TCR complexity. Complete donor chimerism and normal TCR complexity remained stable in all patients and did not change with subsequent relapse or development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, conversion to full donor chimerism was temporally associated with the antimyeloma effect of DLI but not with the development of GVHD. Nevertheless, the maintenance of stable donor hematopoiesis did not prevent disease relapse and was not associated with prolonged remission. The selective relapse of myeloma cells without concomitant return of mixed hematopoietic chimerism suggests that myeloma tumor cells in some patients develop resistance to immune destruction.","[""Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,"['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2 additional patients who were found to have active pulmonary Tb at the time of transplantation, alloSCT was delayed until the infections were treated.

Xenogenized tumor cells by their coupling to proteins, and use of chemicals like DTIC (5-[3,3-dimethyl- 1-triazeno]-imidazole-4-carboxamide), TZC (8-carbamoyl-3-methyl-imidazo[5, 1-d]- 1,2,3,5-tetrazin-4 [3H]-one 8-carbamoyl-3-[2-chloroethyl] imidazole [5,1 -d]- 1,2,3,5-tetrazin-4[3H]-one) and antiemetic drugs, were tested in experimental models of murine leukemia.

The therapeutic efficacy of rIL-12 against hematological tumors and the transfer of IL-12 genes into hematopoietic progenitor cells to deliver IL-12 to the bone marrow (BM) to treat residual leukemia has not been studied adequately. We have investigated the retroviral-mediated transduction of hematopoietic progenitor cells with IL-12 genes and the in vivo anti-leukemic activity of transduced cells against the murine myeloid leukemia cell line 32Dp210. We were able to efficiently transduce the IL-3-dependent 32Dc13 myeloid progenitor cell line and primary hematopoietic progenitor cells using an MFG-based polycistronic retroviral vector containing the cDNAs of p35 and p40 murine IL-12 genes. 32Dc13 myeloid progenitor cells expressing IL-12 genes (32DIL-12 cells) have stably secreted biologically active murine IL-12 for >9 months. Mice transplanted with 32DIL-12 cells transiently express the transgene in the BM and spleen, which is associated with a rapid elevation of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the circulation and with secretion of IFN-gamma by spleen cells in vitro. In addition, spleen and BM cells of mice injected with 32DIL-12 cells readily acquire the capacity to lyse natural killer cell-sensitive YAC-1 target cells and 32Dp210 myeloid leukemia cells. Furthermore, whereas mice challenged with leukemia cells suffered 100% mortality within 14 days, approximately 40% of mice coinjected with 32Dp210 leukemia cells and 32DIL-12 progenitor cells exhibited long-term, leukemia-free survival (>60 days). This study demonstrates that IL-12 can be stably expressed in hematopoietic cells; in addition, when transplanted, transduced cells induce IFN-gamma production and activation of natural killer cells, both of which may be involved in inhibiting the progression of leukemia in vivo.","['Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan 48202, USA.']","['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In those cases we found up to 3.51% AC133+ cells as well as slightly higher values (3.94%) for CD34 antigens. Additionally we quantified 128 bone marrow (BM) samples for AC133+ and CD34+ cells. In 10 BM samples, derived from patients without any neoplasia, the CD34+ cells were about 0.03% and 1.49%, whereas AC133 values were up to 0.64%. Bone marrow aspirates from 53 children with acute leukemias at time of diagnosis (ALL: n = 41/AML: n = 12) have been immunophenotyped and leukemic blast cells have been proved for AC133- and CD34 antigen expression. 32/41 (78%) of lymphoblastic leukemic cells showed to be positive for CD34 antigen and 24/41 (58%) demonstrated AC133 antigens. Interestingly there were 2 ALL-patients with pathological blast cells positive for AC133 but lacking of any CD34 antigens. 42% (5/12) of investigated AML patients showed CD34+ phenotype, on the other hand there were only 25% (3/12) with AC133+ phenotype. Similar values were found in relapsed patients (n = 18). In BM samples from patients during complete remission (n = 47) we could detect percentages up to 5.55% for CD34 and up to 1.25% for AC133 positive stem-/progenitor cells. Such quite high data may be explained by occasionally application of rhG-CSF therapy. Our results till now lead to the conclusion, that it seems to be useful, to recruit quantification of CD34+ HPSC by additionally detecting AC133 antigens. This new stem cell marker (AC133) may be of great value in case of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) because it could be an alternative to the usual CD34+ MACS selection system.","['Zentrum fur Kinderheilkunde und Jugendmedizin, J.-W.-Goethe-Universitat, Abt.

To investigate whether the rapid deactivation of SAPK results from dephosphorylation by dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs), we studied regulation of the DSP hVH5 and its murine orthologue M3/6 in K562 human leukemia cells. PMA treatment rapidly induced hVH5 transcripts in these cells, and induced expression of M3/6 completely inhibited PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of SAPK, suggesting a feedback loop to control SAPK activity. Using both stable cell lines and transient transfection we demonstrate that activation of SAPK rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of M3/6. This phosphorylation did not regulate the half-life of total cellular M3/6. hVH5 and M3/6 shares with all sequenced mammalian DSPs an amino acid motif, XILPXLXL, located approximately 80 amino acids from the active site. The hVH5-M3/6 sequence, RILPHLYL, shares significant homology with the SAPK binding site of the c-Jun protein, called the delta domain. This motif was found to be important for DSP function, because deletion of RILPHLYL inhibits SAPK-mediated phosphorylation of M3/6, and deletion of this sequence or mutation of the LYL portion blocks the ability of this phosphatase to dephosphorylate SAPK.","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado 80262, USA.']","['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 10)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,['CA42533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether familial aggregation of HTLV-I infection (as determined by specific seropositive status) could be explained in part by genetic factors, we conducted a large genetic epidemiological survey in an HTLV-I-endemic population of African origin from French Guiana. All of the families in 2 villages were included, representing 83 pedigrees with 1638 subjects, of whom 165 (10.1%) were HTLV-I seropositive. The results of segregation analysis are consistent with the presence of a dominant major gene predisposing to HTLV-I infection, in addition to the expected familial correlations (mother-offspring, spouse-spouse) due to the virus transmission routes. Under this genetic model, approximately 1. 5% of the population is predicted to be highly predisposed to HTLV-I infection, and almost all seropositive children <10 years of age are genetic cases, whereas most HTLV-I seropositive adults are sporadic cases.","['INSERM U436, ""Modelisation Mathematique et Statistique en Biologie et Medecine,"" CHU Pitie Salpetriere, Unite d\'Epidemiologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,20000721,,,,,,,,,

The cytogenetic analyses were successful in 152 cases (84%). The failure rate was higher for the ALL investigated before 1987 (30% vs. 4%, p < 0.0001), and also the incidence of cytogenetically normal cases was higher during 1977-86 (43% vs. 25%, p < 0.05). Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in 103 (68%) ALL. Structural rearrangements were detected, by chromosome banding alone, in 76 cases (50%). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to identify cases with t(12;21), 11q23 rearrangements, and 9p deletions, using probes for ETV6/CBFA2, MLL, and CDKN2A/B, in 72 cases from which cells in fixative and/or unstained metaphase preparations were available. In total, the most common structural rearrangements were del(9p) (17%), t(12;21) (15%), del(6q) (8%), and MLL rearrangements (4%). Six (32%) of nineteen cytogenetically normal ALL analyzed by FISH harbored cryptic abnormalities; three displayed t(12;21) and four had del(9p), one of which also carried a t(12;21). Five (45%) of the t(12;21)-positive ALL showed +der(21)t(12;21) or ider(21)(q10)t(12;21), resulting in the formation of double fusion genes. Among the more rare aberrations, eight structural rearrangements were identified as novel recurrent ALL-associated abnormalities, and nine cases harbored rearrangements previously not reported. Sixteen cases displayed karyotypically unrelated clones at different investigations. Seven ALL (5%) showed simple chromosomal changes, unrelated to the aberrations detected at diagnosis, during morphologic and clinical remission, and in all but one instance the patients remained in remission, with the abnormal clone disappearing in subsequent investigations. This indicates that the emergence of novel clonal chromosomal aberrations during remission in childhood ALL is rather common and does not by necessity predict a forthcoming relapse.","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.

The genetic basis and molecular pathogenesis of drug resistance in CLL remain poorly understood. Here, we have investigated the association between chromosomal aberrations and cellular resistance of CLL cells against seven drugs, gamma and ultraviolet irradiation. Samples were obtained from 35 patients having a classical form of B-CLL. Chromosomal aberrations were first analyzed by traditional karyotyping improved by using optimized mitogen combinations. DNA sequence copy number changes throughout the genome were next screened by comparative genomic hybridization. Finally, fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to detect trisomy 12 and loss of Rb and deletions at chromosome 11. The cellular sensitivity in vitro was assessed by the reduction of macromolecular protein synthesis measured as incorporation of radioactive L-leucine as an endpoint. The overall analysis disclosed a statistically highly significant difference in cellular drug resistance between patients having at least three aberrations compared with patients with fewer or no aberrations. This strongly indicates that complex rather than simple molecular mechanisms are responsible for the drug and irradiation resistance in CLL. According to published results, complex aberrations are constantly associated with poor prognosis in CLL. We demonstrated here that complex chromosomal aberrations were associated with cellular irradiation and drug resistance, which, on the other hand, may be responsible for the poor clinical outcome in CLL.","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Tampere University Hospital and University of Tampere Medical School, Finland.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of mutations are missense mutations, which generally lead to accumulation of nuclear p53 protein. However, the prognostic significance of the accumulation remains unknown in AML. In this study, we compared the prognostic value of p53 mutations versus accumulation of the product. p53 mutations were found in 9 (4.5%) of 200 patients with de novo AML. The p53 mutation detectable (mutation+) group had a worse prognosis (p = 0.0009) than the mutation not detectable (mutation-) group. Multivariate analysis showed that the p53 mutation was an independent factor (p = 0.005) for short overall survival as well as 60 yr or older (p = 0.001) and unfavorable karyotypes (p = 0.001). In 79 of the 200 patients, the expression of p53 was studied by immunocytochemistry (ICC) using anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-7). All samples carrying missense mutations (N = 6) were positive for ICC in over 15% of nuclei of each sample, chosen as the optimized cutoff value of p53 accumulation. Accumulation was thus found in 14 of the 79 patients. However, there was no prognostic difference according to the accumulation, because the mutation-/accumulation+ group (N = 8) tended to have a good prognosis. These findings indicate that molecular detection of p53 mutations yields better prognostic information than ICC. In a subset of AML, p53 protein might be accumulated without mutation presumably due to upstream signals of p53.","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital.']","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', '9YVR68W306 (enocitabine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lawrence treated the first patient on the basis of work done in the laboratory animals that found localization of the radioisotope in the spleen, liver, bone and in leukemic cells sufficient to indicate a therapeutic potential. After World War II when 32P became widely available, it was used extensively to treat the chronic leukemias and polycythemia vera. Its use in the treatment of essential thrombocythemia began later in 1950. Today it is not widely used in the treatment of the chronic leukemia, if at all, its use in polycythemia vera appears to have decreased substantially and replaced by hydroxyurea, and its use in the management of essential thrombocythemia is not widespread. In each instance it has been replaced by a drug developed for use in cancer chemotherapy, and in some instances by interferon. It probably has wider use in polycythemia vera in the rest of Western Europe than in the UK, and there are cogent reasons to suggest that it may be the best tool for the treatment of polycythemia vera.

We here report our experience treating six MM patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency, with autologous stem cell transplantation. One of these patients required chronic hemodialysis since the diagnosis of MM was made. Peripheral blood stem cell collection was performed with either cyclophosphamide 5.5-7 g/m2 + G-CSF, 5 microg/kg/day (patients 1-3, 5 and 6) or G-CSF, 15 microg/kg/day alone (patient No. 4). Four patients (Nos 1-4) received autotransplant as front-line therapy, while the last two patients were treated in relapse, which occurred following prior autologous stem cell transplantation in support of melphalan, 200 mg/m2 (No. 5) or maintainance therapy with alpha-interferon (No. 6). High-dose chemotherapy administered as preparation to transplant included busulfan 12 mg/kg + melphalan 80 mg/m2 (patients 1-3 and 6) or melphalan 80 mg/m2 alone (patients 4 and 5) in order to reduce mucosal damage. Following transplant, prompt and sustained recovery of hematopoiesis was documented in all the patients; 500 PMN/microI and 20000 platelets/microI were reached after a median of 13 and 14 days, respectively. None of the patients suffered from WHO grade 3-4 infectious complications. Transplant-related toxicity included grade 3-4 oral mucositis (patients 1, 4 and 5) and veno-occlusive disease (patient No. 3). Renal function either improved or remained stable throughout the transplant period. All the patients but one responded to therapy, three of them are progression free after 2, 15 and 26 months; two relapsed after 16 and 4 months and one died from cholangiocarcinoma 7 months after transplant, while still in remission. Although our experience is limited so far, these results appear promising and support the investigational use of myeloablative therapy in MM patients with chronic renal failure.","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Seragnoli University of Bologna, Italy.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'VAD protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we provide the detailed characterization of a newly established PEL cell line, termed CRO-AP/6. The cell line was obtained from the pleural effusion of a HIV-positive patient with PEL. Its derivation from the tumor clone was established by immunogenotypic analysis. Detailed phenotypic investigations defined that CRO-AP/6 reflects pre-terminally differentiated B cells expressing the CD138/syndecan-1 antigen. Karyotypic studies of CRO-AP/6 identified several chromosomal abnormalities, whereas genotypic studies ruled out the involvement of molecular lesions associated with other types of B cell lymphoma. Both CRO-AP/6 and the parental tumor sample harbored infection by HHV-8. Conversely, EBV infection was present in the parental tumor sample although not in CROAP/6, indicating that CRO-AP/6 originated from the selection of an EBV-negative tumor subclone. The pattern of viral (HHV-8 v-cyclin) and cellular (p27Kip1) regulators of cell cycle expressed by CRO-AP/6, together with the results of growth fraction analysis, point to abrogation of the physiological inverse relationship between proliferation and p27Kip1 expression. Also, both CRO-AP/6 and the parental tumor sample display biallelic inactivation of the DNA repair enzyme gene O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) by promoter methylation. Overall, the CRO-AP/6 cell line may help understand cell cycle control of PEL cells, may clarify the relative contribution of HHV-8 and EBV to the disease growth and development and may facilitate the identification of recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities highlighting putative novel cancer related loci relevant to PEL.","['Divisions of Pathology, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Aviano, Italy.']","['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IW32 cells had no detectable levels of p53 mRNA and protein expression. By transfecting a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 cDNA, tsp53val135, into the cells, we have established several clones stably expressing the mutant p53 allele. At permissive temperature, these p53 transfectants were arrested in G1 phase and underwent apoptosis. Moreover, differentiation along the erythroid pathway was observed as evidenced by increased benzidine staining and mRNA expression of beta-globin and the erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS-E). Treatment of cells with protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate blocked the p53-induced differentiation, but not that of cell death or growth arrest.

SHP-1 has been shown to negatively control signal transduction from many cytokine receptors by direct docking to either the receptor itself, or to members of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases which are themselves part of the receptor complex. Motheaten and viable motheaten mice, which are deficient in SHP-1, have increased myelopoiesis and show an accumulation of morphologically and phenotypically immature granulocytes, suggesting a role for SHP-1 in granulocytic differentiation. Here, we report that SHP-1 protein levels are up-regulated during the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mediated granulocytic differentiation of myeloid 32D cells. Enforced expression of SHP-1 in these cells leads to decreased proliferation and enhanced differentiation, while introduction of a catalytically inactive mutant produces increased proliferation and results in a delay of differentiation. In vitro binding revealed that the SH2 domains of SHP-1 are unable to associate directly with tyrosine-phosphorylated G-CSF receptor (G-CSF-R). Furthermore, over-expression of SHP-1 in Ba/F3 cells expressing a G-CSF-R mutant lacking all cytoplasmic tyrosines also inhibited proliferation. Together, these data suggest that SHP-1 directly modulates G-CSF-mediated responses in hematopoietic cells via a mechanism that does not require docking to the activated G-CSF-R.","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,"['CA79891/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM58893/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonselective protease inhibitors are cytotoxic to leukemia and cancer cell lines and we found that this cytotoxicity is correlated with their potency as inhibitors of the proteasome but not as inhibitors of calpain and cathepsin. Highly selective inhibitors of the proteasome were more cytotoxic and fast-acting than less selective inhibitors (PS341>>ALLN>>ALLM). Induction of wt p53 correlated with inhibition of the proteasome and antiproliferative effect in MCF7, a breast cancer cell line, which was resistant to apoptosis caused by proteasome inhibitors. In contrast, inhibitors of the proteasome induced apoptosis in four leukemia cell lines lacking wt p53. The order of sensitivity of leukemia cells was: Jurkat>HL60> or =U937>>K562. The highly selective proteasome inhibitor PS-341 induced cell death with an IC50 as low as 5 nM in apoptosis-prone leukemia cells. Cell death was preceded by p21WAF1/CIP1 accumulation, an alternative marker of proteasome inhibition, and by cleavage of PARP and Rb proteins and nuclear fragmentation. Inhibition of caspases abrogated PARP cleavage and nuclear fragmentation and delayed, but did not completely prevent cell death caused by PS-341. Reintroduction of wt p53 into p53-null PC3 prostate carcinoma cells did not increase their sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors. Likewise, comparison of parental and p21-deficient cells demonstrated that p21WAF1/CIP1 was dispensable for proteasome inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity.

A multivariate analysis using flow cytometry and a CD45 gating on lymphocytes and blast cells was performed. DNR and IDA induced a Fas enhancement on both leukemic and normal cells. In blast cells the DEVDases were activated and the caspase 3 was cleaved in relation to phosphatidyl serine exposure, showing a caspase-dependent pathway in anthracycline-induced apoptosis. Apoptotic percentages were always higher for blast cells than for lymphocytes, confirming that anthracycline toxicity mainly affected tumor cells. Moreover, drug-induced apoptosis was not related to spontaneous apoptosis, suggesting that variations in response intensities were due to individual variations of sensitivity rather than to programmed life span time. The apoptotic response of P-glycoprotein-expressing blast cells was not significant, giving biological argument for the poor prognosis of multidrug resistance leukemia. Finally, Fas induction and anthracycline-induced apoptosis on blast cells were significantly higher when a complete remission was achieved, thus shedding light on potential new prognostic factors in acute leukemia.","[""Laboratorie d'Hematologie, Hopital du Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.""]","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (DEVDase)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have suggested that c-myc may be vital for regulation of hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity. In this study, we investigated the changes of telomerase activity and telomerase-related genes induced by herbimycin A in K562 human chronic myelogeous leukemic cells. Telomerase activity showed a biphasic pattern in herbimycin A-treated K562 cells. Initially, the telomerase activity decreased along with the decline of cells in S and G2/M phases, but it recovered slightly at the end of treatment. Expression of mRNA for the telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) was decreased before the decline of telomerase activity, and increased slightly before the reactivation of telomerase activity. During herbimycin A treatment, both c-myc and cyclin D1 mRNA showed transient downregulation before the increase of G1 cells. Herbimycin A treatment caused the downregulation of both telomerase activity and hTERT mRNA in cyclin D1-transfected K562 cells, while telomerase activity was partially restored in c-Myc-transfected cells. In contrast, hTERT-transfected K562 cells maintained a high level of telomerase activity during herbimycin A treatment. Neither the template RNA component of telomerase (hTERC) nor telomerase-associated protein (TEP-1) were altered in any of the transfected K562 cells. These results indicate that telomerase activity is mainly regulated by hTERT, and that c-Myc protein is one of the positive regulators of hTERT in leukemic cells but is not enough to counteract the downregulation of telomerase activity by herbimycin A completely.","['Department of Pediatrics, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']","['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (telomerase RNA)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2015 Nov;29(11):2274.

The expression of variant forms of CD44, particularly forms containing exon v6, have been associated with poor prognosis in a number of hematological malignancies. The expression of CD44 variants on normal bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PBMC) and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors was compared with those expressed on blasts from 30 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Normal BM, PBMC and CD34+ progenitor cells were negative for all variants tested by flow cytometry. In contrast exon v3 was expressed on 13%, v4 on 67%, v5 on 19%, v6 on 7% and v7 on 65% of AML cases. RT-PCR and Southern blotting revealed the expression of exons v3, v6, v8, v9 and v10 in normal bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the expression of exons v3, v6, v8 and v10 in CD34+ progenitors. A more complex pattern of variant exon expression was observed in leukemic samples in comparison to normal hematopoietic cells. Sixty-two percent of AML cases expressed exon v3 and 70% exon v6. Exons v4 and v5 were not detected while exons v7, v8, v9 and v10 were detected in 21, 83, 71 and 92% of cases, respectively. In summary, our data demonstrate a striking increase in the complexity of CD44 variant expression in cells from patients with AML, along with surface expression of some variant CD44 proteins. Further analysis will be directed at how these alter the interaction of leukemic blasts with the bone marrow microenvironment and their diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential.","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney at Westmead Hospital, Australia.']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 11q23 translocations, the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene on chromosome 11, band q23, is usually disrupted. The human homologue of the rat NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan molecule, as detected by the monoclonal antibody (moab) 7.1, was shown to be expressed on leukemic cells with MLL rearrangements of children with acute leukemia. We further investigated the reactivity of the moab 7.1 on 533 cell samples of adults (n = 215) and children (n = 318) with acute leukemias (271 AML, 217 B-lineage ALL, 37 T-lineage ALL, eight CD7+ CD56+ myeloid/natural killer cell precursor acute leukemias) by flow cytometry. In AML, 38 samples were positive for moab 7.1 ('20%-cut-off-level'). These moab 7.1-positive AML cases revealed a myelomonocytic-differentiated immunophenotype with coexpression of the NK cell marker CD56 in 33 of 38 cases. Two of eight cell samples of the recently described CD7+ CD56+ myeloid/natural killer cell precursor acute leukemia entity reacted with moab 7.1. In ALL, 35 samples mostly of the pro-B-ALL subtype (33 pro-B-ALL, one common-ALL, one pre-B-ALL) were positive for moab 7.1. 58 (81%) of 72 samples with MLL rearrangements were positive for moab 7.1 including 28/31 with a t(4;11), 16/17 with a t(9;11), 3/5 with a t(11;19), and 2/6 with a del(11)(q23). All moab 7.1-positive ALL (n = 34) and childhood AML (n = 17) cases revealed MLL rearrangements as detected by Southern blot analysis and RT-PCR. However, 11 adults with AML, and one adult with moab 7.1-positive CD7+ CD56+ myeloid/natural killer cell precursor acute leukemia were negative for MLL rearrangements as proved by Southern blot analysis. We conclude that moab 7.1 is a sensitive but not entirely specific marker for the identification of 11q23-associated AML and ALL by flow cytometry in children and adults.","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Robert-Rossle Clinic, Charite, Humboldt-University Berlin, Germany.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Mllt1 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of its potential clinical relevance, the t(12;21) translocation usually goes undetected with conventional cytogenetic procedures. In the present study we utilized an objective flow cytometric approach (multiparametric quantitative analysis) for the phenotypic characterization of this type of ALL. We studied a total of 74 precursor B-ALL children, including 21 t(12;21)+ and 53 t(12;21)- cases.

Moreover, as regards CD34 expression, we observed a more heterogeneous antigen expression within individual patients with higher coefficients of variation (median of 202 vs 88, P = 0.0001). A multi-variate analysis disclosed that with the immunophenotypic approach used identification of t(12;21)+ cases can be achieved with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100%.

It has been hypothesized that the therapeutic response, as measured by a change in tumor burden during therapy, might serve as a new surrogate marker of survival. Here we describe the development of a murine SCID xenograft model of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and the use of a sensitive, quantitative PCR assay for the measurement of tumor levels to investigate the relationships between tumor burden quantification, therapeutic response and survival. Animals engrafted with the CCRF-CEM (CEM) human T-ALL cell line develop leukemia that closely resembles the human disease. Quantitative PCR detects the expanding tumor mass in the peripheral blood of the animals several weeks before death. In response to induction therapy with chemotherapeutic agents, both the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) in peripheral blood at the end of therapy and the rate of tumor reduction in peripheral blood during therapy strongly correlated with animal survival. Thus, these surrogate markers, which can be measured during the early stages of therapy, may help improve patient survival through dynamic risk stratification.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75390-9072, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,['CA74965/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The vast majority of TALL (96%) displayed clonal TCRG gene rearrangements, with biallelic recombination in 91% of patients. A small immature subgroup of CD3- T-ALL (n = 5) had both TCRG genes in germline configuration, three of them having also germline TCRD genes. In five patients (4%) combined SB and PCR results indicated oligoclonality. In five rearrangements detected by SB, the Vgamma gene segment could not be identified suggesting illegitimate recombination. Altogether, 83% of TCRG gene rearrangements involved either the most upstream Vgamma2 gene (including four cases with interstitial deletion of 170 bp in Vgamma2) and/or the most downstream Jgamma2.3 segment, which can be perceived as 'end-stage' recombinations. Comparative analysis of the TCRG gene configuration in the major immunophenotypic subgroups indicated that TCRgammadelta+ T-ALL display a less mature immunogenotype as compared to TCRalphabeta+ and most CD3- cases. This was reflected by a significantly increased usage of the more downstream Vgamma genes and the upstream Jgamma1 segments. Comparison between adult and pediatric T-ALL patients did not show any obvious differences in TCRG gene configuration. The high frequency, easy detectability, rare oligoclonality, and frequent 'end-stage' recombinations make TCRG gene rearrangements principal targets for PCR-based detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in T-ALL. We propose a simple heteroduplex PCR strategy, applying five primer combinations, which results in the detection of approximately 95% of all clonal TCRG gene rearrangements in T-ALL. This approach enables identification of at least one TCRG target for MRD monitoring in 95% of patients, and even two targets in 84% of T-ALL.","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,['Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1301-3.

Data from 560 children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia who entered the Pediatric Oncology Group Study 8821 from June 1988 to March 1993 were analyzed by univariate and recursive partitioning methods. Children with Down syndrome or acute promyelocytic leukemia were excluded from the study. Factors examined included age, number of leukocytes, sex, FAB morphologic subtype, cytogenetic findings, and extramedullary disease at the time of diagnosis. The overall event-free survival (EFS) rate at 4 years was 32.7% (s.e. = 2.2%).

Recursive partitioning analysis defined three groups of patients with widely varied prognoses: female patients with t(8;21), inv(16), or a normal karyotype (n = 89) had the best prognosis (4-year EFS = 55.1%, s.e. = 5.7%); male patients with t(8;21), inv(16) or normal chromosomes (n = 106) had an intermediate prognosis (4-year EFS = 38.1%, s.e. = 5.3%); patients with chromosome abnormalities other than t(8;21) and inv(16) (n = 233) had the worst prognosis (4-year EFS = 27.0%, s.e. = 3.2%). One hundred and thirty-two patients (24%) could not be grouped because of missing cytogenetic data, mainly due to inadequate marrow samples. The results suggest that pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia can be categorized into three potential risk groups for prognosis and that differences in sex and chromosomal abnormalities are associated with differences in estimates of EFS.

A variety of genes are now recognised as positive or negative regulators of this process. Expression of inducible heat shock proteins (hsp) is known to correlate with increased resistance to apoptosis induced by a range of diverse cytotoxic agents and has been implicated in chemotherapeutic resistance of tumours and carcinogenesis. Intensive research on apoptosis over the past number of years has provided significant insights into the mechanisms and molecular events that occur during this process. The modulatory effects of hsps on apoptosis are well documented, however, the mechanisms of hsp-mediated protection against apoptosis remain to be fully defined, although several hypotheses have been proposed. Elucidation of these mechanisms should reveal novel targets for manipulating the sensitivity of leukaemic cells to therapy. This review aims to explain the currently understood process of apoptosis and the effects of hsps on this process.

We found that Mcl-1 localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm and that expression levels decreased as PMN were aged in culture. Reducing available Mcl-1 through the use of antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated that Mcl-1 is necessary to delay apoptosis during normal PMN aging and hypoxia but is not required for suppression of apoptosis by laminin adhesion.

To understand the impact of this property on IL-1beta production, we examined the intracellular stability of pIL-1beta in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human monocytes. Precursor IL-1beta was degraded with a relatively short half-life of 2.5 h in the promonocytic cell line, THP-1, and in primary monocytes. MG132 (carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal) stabilized pIL-1beta levels in THP-1 cells, suggesting that degradation was proteasome-mediated, but this inhibitor was toxic for primary monocytes, causing release of pIL-1beta as well as the cytoplasmic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into supernatants. In contrast, clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone, a specific inhibitor of the proteasome, caused a dose-dependent stabilization of intracellular pIL-1beta, and this led to a corresponding increase in mIL-1beta and pIL-1beta but not LDH release into culture supernatants. Therefore, by regulating intracellular levels of precursor IL-1beta, the proteasome plays an important and previously unrecognized role in controlling the amount of biologically active IL-1beta that is exported by activated monocytes.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wake Forest University Medical Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157, USA.']","['0 (Acrylates)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PD 150606)', '155975-72-7 (clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'L5W337AOUR (aloxistatin)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,,['CA-09422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Resolution of such inflammatory responses is dependent on neutrophil apoptosis. Delays in this apoptotic response are associated with persistent inflammation and subsequent tissue damage. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of AP on neutrophil apoptosis and to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved. Neutrophils and serum were isolated from control (n=10) and from patients with AP (mild, n=35, and severe, n=5). Neutrophil apoptosis was assessed by propidium iodide DNA staining using flow cytometry. Caspase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and Mcl-1 protein expression were assessed by SDS-PAGE western blotting. Serum interleukin (IL)-1beta and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) levels were measured by ELISA. Neutrophils isolated from patients with AP show a significant delay in spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. Serum factors contributed to this delay with increases in IL-1beta and GM-CSF. Isolated neutrophils were resistant to Fas antibody-induced apoptosis. Caspases represent a central mechanism for spontaneous and Fas antibody-induced neutrophil apoptosis. Procaspase 3 expression was decreased in mild and severe cases, but this effect was independent of serum factors. Increases in GST expression may also contribute to the antiapoptotic effect. Altered caspase expression may represent an additional factor contributing to delayed neutrophil apoptosis.

Analyses by age indicated significantly higher all-cause mortality rates among persons retiring before age 65.

In this paper, the chemical stability and the most favorable storage conditions of RA in hard gelatin capsules containing alpha-lactose monohydrate, used in clinical experimentation, are reported. A secondary goal of this work was to show the usefulness of a robust regression technique, repeated median with replicates (RMWR) in a solid-state shelf life prediction by accelerated studies. The capsules were stored at room temperature and in the freezer. Their residual RA content was assayed for more than 3 years. RA chemical degradation was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) stability-indicating methods previously validated and able to detect various potential degradation products. Possible physical modifications were checked by dissolution tests and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the content of the capsules. The shelf life was also predicted by an accelerated isothermal method to confirm room temperature results, and the activation energy estimated through this study was 12.5 +/- 1.1 kcal/mol (95% confidence interval). In the conditions of climatic zone II, the shelf life for the capsules stored at room temperature in light-resistant containers was equal to 678 days, while the capsules stored in the freezer retained the initial content of drug after 1289 days. From the results gathered in this study, the usefulness of RMWR for shelf life prediction in the presence of outliers is evident.","['Dipartimento di Chimica e Tecnologia Farmaceutica e Alimentare, Universita degli Studi di Genova, Italy.

Sixteen children 4 years or older at the time of BMP were eligible. The first 2 BMPs after complete remission was obtained were studied. BMPs were performed under ketamine anesthesia (1.0-1.5 mg/kg i.v.), as usual. Patients were randomized to receive 1 h before the first BMP blinded, either diazepam or placebo orally and before the second BMP the other way round. Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored, and patients were observed for signs of anxiety, pain, and other side effects. The patients were interviewed after each BMP and asked for their preference 1 week after the second BMP. Ketamine anesthesia appeared as safe and effective after diazepam premedication as after placebo premedication. From the interviews and questionnaires, it was clear that half of the children preferred diazepam premedication because of less awful dreaming and more gradual falling asleep and waking up.

DESIGN AND METHODS: In total, 26 prepubertal children with ALL were studied. We report these data at the time of the clinical diagnosis (n=26) and at 6 (n=21), 12 (n=21), 18 (n=21), 24 (n=20), 30 (n=16) and 36 months (n=16) after beginning treatment. RESULTS: Serum GHBP levels decreased during the first 18 months and returned to normal when therapy was withdrawn. Height SDS increased at 24 months after diagnosis. Weight and the upper arm circumference had increased 6 months after chemotherapy withdrawal, whereas tricipital and subscapular skinfolds had increased both at 6 months after diagnosis and 6 months after therapy had stopped. Therefore, the tendency to become overweight is both an early and a late side-effect of anti-leukemia therapy. A significant positive correlation was found between serum leptin levels and every nutritional anthropometric parameter, with body mass index having the best relationship. However, serum GHBP levels were only correlated with BMI at the end of the study. No correlation was found between leptin and GHBP. CONCLUSIONS: In children with ALL, linear growth is compromised during the acute phase of their illness and therapy; this is probably secondary to a state of partial and transient GH insensitivity. These patients tend to become obese after therapy withdrawal, with leptin being an excellent nutritional marker.","['Universidad Autonoma, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Hospital Universitario Nino Jesus, E-28009 Madrid, Spain.']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Leptin)', 'W06KFL3RDT (somatotropin-binding protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated whether they also influence the expression of chromogranins and neuropeptide Y, components co-stored with the neurotransmitters within large dense-core vesicles. IMR-32 and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were treated for up to six days with various neurotrophic growth and differentiation factors. For chromogranins A and B, no significant changes at the mRNA level were observed and for chromogranin A this was confirmed at the protein level. The expression of secretogranin II/pro-secretoneurin mRNA, however, was considerably enhanced in both cell lines after basic fibroblast growth factor treatment. In IMR-32 cells we determined a fast and continuous induction, whereas the up-regulation in SH-SY5Y cells was more delayed. A transient elevation of secretogranin II/pro-secretoneurin mRNA levels was seen in SH-SY5Y cells in response to epidermal growth factor. In these cells we also measured the amounts of secretogranin II/pro-secretoneurin protein which were increased by both growth factors. In addition to the above described changes in secretogranin II/pro-secretoneurin biosynthesis we extended and confirmed data available on neuropeptide Y. We found a qualitatively similar pattern of biosynthesis regulation as for secretogranin II/pro-secretoneurin, indicating that the ultimately increased expression of the two proteins may be characteristic of the phenotypic differentiation after growth factor treatment. Moreover, this finding of a concomitant regulation further emphasizes the concept of secretogranin II/pro-secretoneurin being a neuropeptide precursor from which the functional peptide secretoneurin is proteolytically liberated.","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Innsbruck, Peter-Mayr-Strasse 1a, A-6020, Innsbruck, Austria.']","['0 (Chromogranin A)', '0 (Chromogranins)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Secretogranin II)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '149146-12-3 (secretoneurin)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the ability of the RNase H activity of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase to cleave a long RNA/DNA hybrid containing the PPT, it appears that cleavages that could generate the plus-strand primer can occur by an internal cleavage mechanism without any positioning by an RNA 5'-end, and such cleavages may serve to minimize cleavage events within the PPT itself. If the PPT were to be cleaved inappropriately just upstream of the normal plus-strand origin site, the resulting 3'-ends would not be extended by reverse transcriptase. Extension of the PPT primer by at least 2 nucleotides is sufficient for recognition and correct cleavage by RNase H at the RNA-DNA junction to remove the primer. Specific removal of the PPT primer after polymerase extension deviates from the general observation that primer removal occurs by cleavage one nucleotide away from the RNA-DNA junction and suggests that the same PPT specificity determinants responsible for generation of the PPT primer also direct PPT primer removal. Once the PPT primer has been extended and removed from the nascent plus-strand DNA, reinitiation at the resulting plus-strand primer terminus does not occur, providing a mechanism to prevent the repeated initiation of plus strands.","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7242, USA.']","['0 (Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,,['R37 CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This structure is disrupted in a variety of human disorders including acute promyelocytic leukemia and viral infections, suggesting that alterations in the nuclear body may have an important role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In this study, we identified a cDNA encoding a leukocyte-specific nuclear body component designated Sp110. The N-terminal portion of Sp110 was homologous to two previously characterized components of the nuclear body (Sp100 and Sp140). The C-terminal region of Sp110 was homologous to the transcription intermediary factor 1 (TIF1) family of proteins. High levels of Sp110 mRNA were detected in human peripheral blood leukocytes and spleen but not in other tissues. The levels of Sp110 mRNA and protein in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 increased following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and Sp110 localized to PML-Sp100 nuclear bodies in ATRA-treated NB4 cells. Because of the structural similarities between Sp110 and TIF1 proteins, the effect of Sp110 on gene transcription was examined. An Sp110 DNA-binding domain fusion protein activated transcription of a reporter gene in transfected mammalian cells. In addition, Sp110 produced a marked increase in ATRA-mediated expression of a reporter gene containing a retinoic acid response element. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that Sp110 is a member of the Sp100/Sp140 family of nuclear body components and that Sp110 may function as a nuclear hormone receptor transcriptional coactivator. The predominant expression of Sp110 in leukocytes and the enhanced expression of Sp110 in NB4 cells treated with ATRA raise the possibility that Sp110 has a role in inducing differentiation of myeloid cells.","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. bloch@helix.mgh.harvard.edu']","['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Sp110 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,"['AR-01866/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-051179/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL55377/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC86089,,,,,,,,,,,

TEL is biallelically disrupted in acute leukemia, and loss of heterozygosity at the TEL locus has been observed in various cancers. Here we show that expression of TEL in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells inhibits cell growth in soft agar and in normal cultures. Unexpectedly, cells expressing both Ras and TEL grew as aggregates. To begin to explain the morphology of Ras-plus TEL-expressing cells, we demonstrated that the endogenous matrix metalloproteinase stromelysin-1 was repressed by TEL. TEL bound sequences in the stromelysin-1 promoter and repressed the promoter in transient-expression assays, suggesting that it is a direct target for TEL-mediated regulation. Mutants of TEL that removed a binding site for the mSin3A corepressor but retained the ETS domain failed to repress stromelysin-1. When BB-94, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, was added to the culture medium of Ras-expressing cells, it caused a cell aggregation phenotype similar to that caused by TEL expression. In addition, TEL inhibited the invasiveness of Ras-transformed cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that TEL acts as a tumor suppressor, in part, by transcriptional repression of stromelysin-1.","['Departments of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.24.17 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 3)']",,,,"['T32 DK007186/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0146843/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA68465/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK020593/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK20593/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA064140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC86060,,,,,,,,,,,

The early observation that E2a-Pbx1 incorporates transcriptional activation domains from E2a and a DNA-binding homeodomain from Pbx1 inspired a model in which E2a-Pbx1 promotes leukemogenic transformation of lymphoid progenitor cells through transcriptional induction of target genes defined by the Pbx1 portion of the molecule. However, the subsequent demonstration that the only known DNA-binding module on the molecule, the Pbx1 homeodomain, is dispensable for the induction of lymphoblastic lymphoma in transgenic mice called into question the contribution made by the Pbx1 portion. In this study, we have used a domain swap approach coupled with a fibroblast-based focus formation assay to evaluate further the requirement for PBX1-encoded peptide elements in growth deregulation by E2a-Pbx1. No impairment of focus formation was observed when the entire Pbx1 portion was replaced with DNA-binding/dimerization domains derived from yeast transcription factor GAL4 or GCN4. Furthermore, replacement of Pbx1 with tandem FKBP domains that mediate homodimerization in the presence of a synthetic ligand led to striking growth deregulation exclusively in the presence of the dimerizing agent. N-terminal elements encoded by E2A, including the AD1 transcriptional activation domain, were required for dimerization-induced focus formation. We conclude that transcriptional target genes defined by heterologous C-terminal DNA-binding modules are not required in growth deregulation by E2a fusion proteins. We speculate that interactions between N-terminal E2a elements and undefined proteins that could function as components of a transcriptional coactivator complex may be more important.","[""Richardson Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada.""]","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,PMC86056,,,,,,,,,,,

The NBS1 gene product, p95 (NBS1 or nibrin) forms a complex with Rad50 and Mre11. Cells deficient in the formation of this complex are defective in DNA double-strand break repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, and telomere length maintenance. How the NBS1 complex is involved in telomere length maintenance remains unclear. Here we show that the C-terminal region of NBS1 interacts directly with a telomere repeat binding factor, TRF1, by both yeast two-hybrid and in vivo DNA-coimmunoprecipitation assays. NBS1 and Mre11 colocalize with TRF1 at promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies in immortalized telomerase-negative cell lines, but rarely in telomerase-positive cell lines. The translocation of NBS1 to PML bodies occurs specifically during late S to G(2) phases of the cell cycle and coincides with active DNA synthesis in these NBS1-containing PML bodies.

Depolarization of monocytes adherent to VCAM-1 by I(ir) blockade or exposure to high [K(+)] abolished the enhancement of the peak [Ca(2+)](i) response. In monocytes bound to glass, hyperpolarization of the membrane potential with valinomycin, a K(+) ionophore, to the level of hyperpolarization seen in cells adherent to VCAM-1 produced similar changes in peak [Ca(2+)](i).

CA-4 was found to be active against murine melanoma and a variety of other human solid tumors. For the first time, we report the effect of CA-4 against a panel of malignant human B-lymphoid cell lines [early pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Reh), diffuse large cell lymphoma (WSU-DLCL2), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (WSU-CLL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WSU-WM)]. Our results indicate, using the prodrug form of CA-4, a concentration-dependent growth inhibition in all tested cell lines, although WSU-DLCL2 was more sensitive. Exposure to 4 nM CA-4 for 96 h induced 77% growth inhibition in Reh, 86% in WSU-CLL and 92% in WSU-WM. When used against the WSU-DLCL2 cell line, this same concentration of CA-4 was completely toxic. Morphological examination showed CA-4 induced the formation of giant, multinucleated cells, a phenomenon commonly found in mitotic catastrophe. Only minimal numbers of cells showing characteristics of apoptosis were detected. In WSU-DLCL2 cells, CA-4 (3 nM) induced the highest apoptosis (5%) after 48 h, while the percentage of dead cells was approximately 47%.

It shows antitumoral, aspermatogenic, antiembryonic, immunosuppressive and antiviral properties. The cytotoxic effects appear to be specific for tumor cells as non-malignant cells seem to be unaffected in vitro. Unfortunately, the in vivo application of BS-RNase so far was successful only when it was administered intratumorally. Therefore, the objective of the present investigation was to improve the properties of BS-RNase by attachment to nanoparticles made of polylactic acid (PLA-NP) using an adsorption method. This preparation was tested in vitro against leukemia (MOLT-4) and lymphoma (H9) cell lines sensitive and resistant to cytarabine. No difference between the nanoparticle preparation and pure BS-RNase was found in these tests. To examine the in vivo effects, the preparations were tested for their aspermatogenic and antiembryonal efficacy compared to the pure BS-RNase as a rapid test for antitumoral activity. The aspermatogenic and antiembryonal effects were enhanced by the nanoparticle preparation. Consequently, BS-RNase loaded adsorptively to PLA-NP holds promise for the in vivo use as an antitumoral agent. Further research will investigate the efficacy of this preparations in an in vivo tumor model.","['Institut fur Medizinische Virologie, Klinikum der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt, Germany.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Polyesters)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '459TN2L5F5 (poly(lactide))', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.27.- (ribonuclease SPL)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of them appeared to be negative against all other cell lines. No compounds, including reference carboplatin, showed any cytotoxicity against the cells of the T47D human breast cancer cell line or B16F-10 mouse melanoma cell line.

In contrast, its dihydroxy-9,10anthraquinone precursor, quinizarin, was inactive. The antitumor activity of AQ was compared to that of daunorubicin (DAU), which is structurally different from AQ but also contains a quinone moiety. AQ is equipotent to DAU against L1210 tumor cell proliferation (IC50: 25 nM at day 2 and 9 nM at day 4) and viability (IC50: 100 nM at day 2 and 25 nM at day 4), suggesting that its cytostatic and cytotoxic activities are a combination of drug concentration and duration of drug exposure. Since AQ does not increase but rather decreases the mitotic index of L1210 cells at 24 h, it is not an antitubulin drug but might arrest early stages of cell cycle progression. Like DAU, a 1.5-3 h pretreatment with AQ is sufficient to inhibit the rates of DNA, RNA and protein syntheses (IC50: 2 microM) determined over 30-60 min periods of pulse-labeling in L1210 cells in vitro. In contrast to DAU, which is inactive, a 15 min pretreatment with AQ has the advantage of also inhibiting the cellular transport of both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (IC50: 2.5 microM) over a 30 s period in vitro. Hence, AQ may prevent the incorporation [3H]thymidine into DNA because it rapidly blocks the uptake of these nucleosides by the tumor cells. After 24 h, AQ induces as much DNA cleavage as camptothecin and DAU, two anticancer drugs producing DNA strand breaks and known to, respectively, inhibit topoisomerase I and II activities. However, the concentration-dependent induction of DNA cleavage by AQ, which peaks at 1.6-4 microM and disappears at 10-25 microM, resembles that of DAU. The mechanism by which AQ induces DNA cleavage is inhibited by actinomycin D, cycloheximide and aurintricarboxylic acid, suggesting that AQ activates endonucleases and triggers apoptosis. The abilities of AQ to block nucleoside transport, inhibit DNA synthesis and induce DNA fragmentation are irreversible upon drug removal, suggesting that this compound may rapidly interact with various molecular targets in cell membranes and nuclei to disrupt the functions of nucleoside transporters and nucleic acids, and trigger long-lasting antitumor effects which persist after cessation of drug treatment. Because of its potency and dual effects on nucleoside transport and DNA cleavage, the use of bifunctional AQ with antileukemic activity in the nM range in vitro might provide a considerable advantage in polychemotherapy to potentiate the action of antimetabolites and sensitize multidrug-resistant tumor cells.","['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, 66506-4901, USA.']","['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '635-12-1 (1,4-anthraquinone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,['1R01CA86842-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient had an antecedent diagnosis of classical nodal mantle cell lymphoma, without prior morphologic blood or bone marrow involvement.

Leukemic peripheral blood cells in these six cases were small to medium in size with fine or granular nuclear chromatin and small or inconspicuous nucleoli. The pattern of marrow involvement was interstitial or diffuse, with cells showing immature nuclear features resembling acute leukemia or blastic lymphoma. All tumors demonstrated a consistent immunophenotype of B-cell lineage, surface immunoglobulin positivity, and CD5 antigen expression. The progenitor cell-associated markers CD34 and TdT were not expressed, and CD23 antigen was either negative (three of four cases) or only weakly present (one of four cases). The presence of a karyotypic t(11;14)(q13;q32) was documented in one tumor, whereas two other cases had BCL-1 gene rearrangements by either polymerase chain reaction or Southern blot analysis. Cyclin D1 mRNA overexpression was noted in three of four cases tested. This patient group was characterized by very poor overall survival (median, 3 months; range, 0.5 to 6 months).

However, our recent experimental animal studies of the major metabolite of MTX, 7-OH-MTX, indicate that this concept may have some limitations. Animals with levels of 7-OH-MTX of 1 mM, which is below the levels routinely found in patients on HD-MTX, demonstrate intolerable toxicity and some animals die within 8 h. Electron microscopy indicates that endothelial cell and platelet functions are perturbed. Since animal data are lacking, and interspecies differences not known, we wanted to investigate the maximum tolerated doses of MTX and 7-OH-MTX in a rat model of short-term effects. The maximum tolerated dose was chosen instead of LD(50) for reasons of animal welfare. METHODS: We infused MTX and 7-OH-MTX into anaesthetized male Wistar rats and monitored the animals for 8 h. The drugs were given as a bolus plus continuous infusion. The dose-finding ranges were 1.8 11.3 g/kg MTX and 0.1-1.2 g/kg 7-OH-MTX. RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose was between 3 and 5 g/kg for MTX and lower than 0.1 g/kg for 7-OH-MTX. The mean serum concentrations of MTX and 7-OH-MTX in animals that did not survive the 8-h period were 21.9 and 1.6 mM, respectively. The animals that received the highest MTX or 7-OH-MTX doses and concentrations died after sudden reductions in heart rate and blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a lower maximum tolerated dose of 7-OH-MTX than of MTX in rats after 8 h. The 7-OH-MTX concentrations were in the therapeutic range after HD-MTX. If the rat/human interspecies differences are not large, our data may indicate that HD-MTX regimens should not be further dose intensified, due not so much to the effects of MTX as to those of 7-OH-MTX.","['Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Medical Biology, University of Tromso, Norway.']","['X019Z9S1DL (7-hydroxymethotrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated the antitumor activity of MS-247 against murine tumor cell lines and its effects on DNA molecules in both cell-free and cellular systems. METHODS: The in vitro cytotoxic activity of MS-247 was evaluated against four murine tumor cell lines, P388, L1210, Colon26 and B16, and its in vivo antitumor activity was also tested in comparison with Adriamycin (ADM), cisplatin (CDDP) and paclitaxel. The ability of MS-247 to associate with the DNA minor groove was assessed by measuring quenching of Hoechst 33342 fluorescence. DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) were detected by an alkaline elution assay for cellular DNA and a band-shift assay using the plasmid pBR322. The effects of MS-247 on macromolecule synthesis (DNA, RNA and proteins) were examined by measuring incorporation of the radiolabeled precursors. RESULTS: MS-247 exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity with IC(50) values ranging 11 to 500 nM, and MS-247 given i.v. showed strong in vivo antitumor activity against i.p.-implanted L1210 leukemia cells and s.c.-implanted Colon26 carcinoma cells, and moderate activity against i.p.-implanted P388 leukemia cells but no apparent activity against s.c.-implanted B16 melanoma cells. MS-247 reversibly displaced Hoechst 33342 bound to DNA within a few minutes, and irreversibly formed ICL within 1-6 h in both the cell-free system and the cellular system. These results suggest that an association of MS-247 with the DNA minor groove occurred more quickly than ICL formation. The inhibition of DNA synthesis was more prominent than the inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis in L1210 cells exposed to MS-247, and a 6-h incubation with MS-247, which formed apparent ICL in the cellular system, strongly inhibited DNA synthesis. This result suggests that impairment of DNA replication preceded the inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis and that ICL formation greatly contributed to the inhibition of macromolecule synthesis. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that MS-247 exerts its cytotoxic effect through impairment of DNA function by getting into the minor groove of DNA and subsequently forming ICL. MS-247 has potent antitumor activity with a different spectrum from the activity of clinically proven antitumor agents such as paclitaxel, ADM and CDDP against several murine tumor cell lines. This result suggests that MS-247 may be useful for the treatment of human cancers.","['Institute of Biological Science, Mitsui Pharmaceuticals Inc., Chiba, Japan.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (MS 247)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Material for a cell block was also collected from some of these lesions. METHODS: The setting was a large general hospital in rural New Zealand. The FNAs were performed by a pathologist, or a radiologist for image guided localisations. Material for immunoflow cytometry was collected into RPMI and, when required, material for a cell block was collected into formalin. RESULTS: Of the 73 samples collected by FNA nine were inadequate. Light chain restriction could be demonstrated in most FNA samples from B cell lymphomas (28 of 30 adequate samples). The exceptions were two cases of T cell rich B cell lymphoma. Artefactual light chain restriction was seen occasionally in T cell lymphomas, presumably as a result of autoantibodies binding to the cell surfaces. It was possible to subtype most (18 of 30 adequate samples) B cell lymphomas as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), follicle centre cell lymphoma (FCCL), or mantle cell lymphoma. The CD4 to CD8 ratio was not usually restricted in T cell lymphomas and coexpression of CD4 and CD8 was not usually found. Loss of pan-T cell antigens was seen in some T cell lymphomas. Four of the six T cell lymphomas and three of the four non-lymphoid malignacies were diagnosed with the aid of cell block immunohistochemistry. Only one of the four cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma showed Reed-Sternberg cells in the FNA smears. CONCLUSIONS: It is not always possible to characterise lymphomas as fully with FNA and immunoflow cytometry as is possible with biopsy histology and a full battery of modern investigations. Nevertheless, in the setting of a large rural general hospital immunoflow cytometry on FNA samples is a highly effective method of diagnosing and typing B cell lymphomas. Immunoflow cytometry is of little use for T cell lymphomas or Hodgkin's lymphomas. We advocate the use of cell block immunohistochemistry in preference to immunoflow cytometry for cases in which the cytological appearance of the specimen is overtly malignant but the differential diagnosis includes non-lymphoid malignancy.","['Department of Pathology, Waikato Hospital, Hamilton, New Zealand. mayallf@hwl.co.nz']",,,,,,PMC1731207,,,,,,,,,,,

Using confocal laser scanning microscopy and fluorescent organelle probes, we examined the subcellular localization of merocyanine 540 (MC540) in the murine myeloid leukemia M1 and WEHI 3B (JCS) cells. Two patterns of localization were observed: in JCS cells, MC540 was found to localize on the plasma membrane and mitochondria; and in M1 leukemia cells, MC540 was found to localize on lysosomes. The relationship between subcellular localization of MC540 and PDT-induced apoptosis was investigated. Apoptotic cell death, as judged by the formation of apoptotic nuclei, was observed 4 h after irradiation in both leukemia cell lines. Typical ladders of apoptotic DNA fragments were also detected by DNA gel electrophoresis in PDT-treated JCS and M1 cells. At the irradiation dose of 46 kJ/m2 (LD90 for JCS and LD86 for M1 cells), the percentage of apoptotic JCS and M1 cells was 78 and 38%, respectively. This study provided substantial evidence that MC540 localized differentially in the mitochondria, and the subsequent photodamage of the organelle played an important role in PDT-mediated apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells.","[""Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following prolonged culture, embryo development in each group was compared. RESULTS: In embryo development from about the 2- to 4-cell to 9- to 16-cell stage, there were nonsignificant differences between each group. There was lower morula formation rate in group 1 (6.9%) than those in other groups (23.2%, 19.7%, 23.1%). The lower blastocyst formation in group 1 and 3 (0%, 0%) than those in group 2 and 4 (11.0%, 12.8%) were noted. CONCLUSIONS: LIF is beneficial for preimplantation embryos.

One-third had clear-cut evidence of familial background. 74 families were of Ashkenazi origin; the age range of breast cancer was 30-35, of ovarian cancer 40-45. In 80% of families other cancers were also noted in first degree family members, including lung, colon, and prostate cancer and leukemia. Genetic testing revealed that 45% of affected and 25% of unaffected women were carriers of a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2: 67/90 185delAG (BRCA1), 12/90 6174delT (BRCA2), and 4/90 of 5382insC (BRCA1).

However, influx of [(3)H]MTX by this system is 3-4-fold higher at pH 6 than at pH 7.5, the optimum for RFC-1-mediated folate compound transport. This acid pH dependency reflects an alteration of influx V(max) rather than of influx K(m) in these cells at different pH. Acid pH-dependent folate compound transport interacts effectively with MTX, 5lLCHO-folateH(4), 5lLCH(3)-folateH(4) and folic acid as permeants (influx Ki = 2.7-5.3 microM). The relative inhibition of influx of [(3)H]MTX by the organic anions, probenecid, and PO(4) was different than for RFC-1 mediated influx. The folate requirements for growth in culture of FR3T3 cells and cytotoxicity of MTX compared to L1210 cells reflects the interactions of these folate compounds with acid pH-dependent folate transport. 5lLCHO-folateH(4) and PO(4) act as exchange anions for this system but their transpositioning has variable effects on transport. 5lLCHO-folateH(4) inhibits influx (decelerative equilibrium exchange) but stimulates efflux of [(3)H]MTX (accelerative equilibrium exchange) while PO(4) inhibits efflux. In FR3T3 cells transfected with cmyc and Hras, influx V(max) for [(3)H]MTX is downregulated 4-fold and 9-fold, respectively. At the same time, RFC-1 expression, which is detectable in FR3T3 cells at the level of its mRNA and RFC-1 mediated folate compound transport, is increased 3-5-fold in these transfectants. The increase in RFC-1 expression in FR3T3Hras cells appears to result from a higher rate of transcription of the gene in these cells as determined by a luciferase reporter gene assay of RFC-1 promoter activity. This downregulation of the acid pH dependent system and concomitant upregulation of the RFC-1 mediated system markedly altered pH dependency for influx of [(3)H]MTX in these transfectants compared to that seen in untransfected cells. We conclude that the major route for internalization at a physiological pH of folate compounds in FR3T3 cells is by an acid pH-dependent carrier-mediated system independent of RFC-1 expression and is downregulated by oncogene expression.","['Program of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56517/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We used this difference to select, in fresh bone marrow samples, alpha 1-positive cells.

No colonies were detected in the alpha 1-negative fraction even after 2 weeks of culture. Phenotypic studies of stromal cells derived from alpha1-positive cells and grown in long-term marrow culture indicated that these cells were similar to stromal cells from primary cultures. We also observed early upregulation of alpha 4 and alpha 2 integrin subunits in cultures derived from alpha1-positive cells with maximal expression by day 10 (26 and 51%, respectively) preceding a gradual decline to low to nil values at day 30 (4.5 and 12%).

Epidemiological evidence suggests that the increased incidence of a variety of human cancers, such as lymphoma, leukemia and liver and breast cancers, might be attributed to exposure to these agents. The ability of CHCs to disrupt estrogen homeostasis is hypothesized to be responsible for their biological effects. The present study examined the effect of CHCs on the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 mRNAs and the consequent 2- and 4-hydroxylation of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were administered a single dose of the LD(50) of 2,3,7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (25 microg/kg), 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (375 mg/kg) and dieldrin (DED) (38 mg/kg) by gavage. Seventy-two hours after treatment, increased expression of CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 was observed in the liver, kidney and mammary tissue. Since CYP1A and CYP1B1 are the major enzymes catalyzing 2- and 4-hydroxylation of E(2), respectively, the effect of these CHCs on the metabolism of E(2) was investigated in rat tissues. Formation of 2- and 4-catechol estrogens was increased in a tissue-specific manner in response to treatment. TCDD was the most potent inducer for CYP1 enzyme mRNA and for the 2- and 4-hydroxylation of E(2). 2,4-D and DED induced similar responses, but less than that of TCDD. These results suggest that induction of CYP1 family enzymes and consequent increases in estrogen metabolism by CHCs in target tissues may be factors contributing to the biological effects associated with exposure to these agents.","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer, 986805 University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-6805, USA.']","['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Estrogens, Catechol)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '2577AQ9262 (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'AYU2L67YUU (2-hydroxyestradiol)', 'C3ZO03450E (4-hydroxyestradiol)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1B1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cyp1b1 protein, rat)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1)', 'I0246D2ZS0 (Dieldrin)']",,,,"['CA36727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA49210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its carcinogenicity is most likely dependent upon its conversion to phenol and hydroquinone, the latter being oxidized to the highly toxic 1,4-benzoquinone in the bone marrow. Exposure of human lymphocytes and cell lines to hydroquinone has previously been shown to cause various forms of genetic damage, including aneusomy and the loss and gain of chromosomes. However, the target cells for leukemogenesis are the pluripotent stem cells or early progenitor cells which carry the CD34 antigen (CD34(+) cells). In this study, human cord blood, which is particularly rich in CD34(+) cells, was exposed to hydroquinone for 72 h in a medium that favored CD34(+) cell survival and growth. CD34(+) and CD34(-) cells were then isolated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was employed to determine the level of aneusomy of chromosomes 7 and 8 in both cell types. CD34(+) cells were generally more susceptible to aneusomy induction by hydroquinone than CD34(-) cells. Increased trisomy and monosomy of chromosomes 7 and 8 were observed in CD34(+) cells (P(trend) < 0.001), whereas in CD34(-) cells only an increased level of monosomy 7 was detected (P(trend) = 0.002). Particularly striking effects of hydroquinone were observed in CD34(+) cells on monosomy 7 and trisomy 8, two common clonal aberrations found in myeloid leukemias, suggesting that these aneusomies produced by hydroquinone in CD34(+) cells play a role in benzene-induced leukemogenesis.","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, 140 Warren Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720-7360, USA. martynts@uclink4.berkeley.edu']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",,,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, in HL60 cells, CD44 ligation with A3D8 mAb fully abrogates the DNR-triggered generation of ceramide, a lipid second messenger involved in the DNR apoptotic signaling pathway. Moreover, results show that the A3D8 mAb and Bcl-2 additively inhibit DNR-induced apoptosis in HL60 cells overexpressing Bcl-2.

One of the factors was purified as a homologue of the nm23 genes. The nm23 genes were overexpressed in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, and a higher level of nm23 gene expression was correlated with a poor prognosis in AML. The present study determined the plasma levels of nm23-H1 protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and assessed the association between this level and the clinical outcome in 102 patients with AML. The plasma concentration of nm23-H1 was higher in patients with AML than in normal controls (P =.0001). Plasma nm23-H1 levels were correlated with the product of the intracellular nm23 messenger RNA (mRNA) level and the white blood cell count, but not with the mRNA level alone. Therefore, nm23-H1 plasma levels probably depend on the total mass of leukemic cells overexpressing the nm23-H1 gene. Overall survival was lower in patients with higher plasma nm23-H1 levels than in those with lower levels. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model showed that elevated plasma nm23-H1 levels significantly contributed to the prognosis of AML patients. Furthermore, the plasma nm23-H1 levels were investigated in 70 patients with other hematologic neoplasms, including 6 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 13 with chronic myelogenous leukemia, and 12 with myelodysplastic syndrome.

A few CML cell lines and primary progenitors are, however, resistant to this compound. We investigated the mechanism of this resistance in clones of the murine BaF/3 cells transfected with BCR-ABL and in 4 human cell lines from which sensitive (s) and resistant (r) clones were generated by various methods. Although the resistant cells were able to survive in the presence of STI571, their proliferation was approximately 30% lower than that of their sensitive counterparts in the absence of the compound. The concentration of STI571 needed for a 50% reduction in viable cells after a 3-day exposure was on average 10 times higher in the resistant (2-3 micromol/L) than in the sensitive (0.2-0.25 micromol/L) clones. The mechanism of resistance to STI571 varied among the cell lines. Thus, in Baf/BCR-ABL-r, LAMA84-r, and AR230-r, there was up-regulation of the Bcr-Abl protein associated with amplification of the BCR-ABL gene. In K562-r, there was no Bcr-Abl overexpression, but the IC(50) for the inhibition of Bcr-Abl autophosphorylation was increased in the resistant clones. Sequencing of the Abl kinase domain revealed no mutations. The multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (Pgp) was overexpressed in LAMA84-r, indicating that at least 2 mechanisms of resistance operate in this cell line. KCL22-r showed neither Bcr-Abl up-regulation nor a higher threshold for tyrosine kinase inhibition by STI571. We conclude that BCR-ABL-positive cells can evade the inhibitory effect of STI571 by different mechanisms, such as Bcr-Abl overexpression, reduced intake mediated by Pgp, and, possibly, acquisition of compensatory mutations in genes other than BCR-ABL.","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Science, Technology and Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A murine model of syngeneic GVL that features CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses against the MMB3.19 myeloid leukemia cell line has been previously described. MMB3.19 expresses high levels of functional Fas and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors that do not transduce proapoptotic signals. Through the use of perforin- and Fas ligand (FasL)-deficient mice, it was demonstrated that CD4(+) T cells mediate anti-MMB3.19 effects in vivo primarily through the use of FasL and secondarily through perforin mechanisms. Conversely, CD8(+) T cells induce GVL effects primarily through the use of perforin and minimally through FasL mechanisms. Although the in vivo observations of CD8(+) T cells were reflective of their in vitro cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, for CD4(+) T cells, in vitro responses were dominated by the perforin pathway. In addition, the diminished capacity of T cells from perforin- and FasL-deficient mice to lyse MMB3.19 target cells appeared directly related to their deficient cytotoxic functions rather than to defects in activation because these cells were fully capable of mounting proliferative responses to the tumor cells. These findings demonstrate that GVL responses of T-cell subsets can involve preferential use of different cytotoxic mechanisms. In particular, these findings identify a role for both FasL-employing CD4(+) CTLs and the more novel perforin-utilizing CD4(+) T-cell subset in responses against a myeloid leukemia.","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']","['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",,,,"['R01 CA60630/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL55593/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Serine/threonine kinase Akt (protein kinase B; PKB) is downstream of PI3K and activated by growth factors. This study found that erythropoietin (EPO) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt in a time- and dose-dependent manner in EPO-dependent human leukemia cell line UT-7/EPO. In vitro kinase assay using histone H2B and glucose synthase kinase as substrates demonstrated that Akt was actually activated by EPO. EPO-induced phosphorylation of Akt was completely blocked by a PI3K-specific inhibitor, LY294002, at 10 micromol/L, indicating that activation of Akt by EPO is dependent on PI3K activity. In addition, overexpression of the constitutively active form of Akt on UT-7/EPO cells partially blocked apoptosis induced by withdrawal of EPO from the culture medium. This finding suggested that the PI3K-Akt activation pathway plays some role in the antiapoptotic effect of EPO. EPO induced phosphorylation of a member of the trancription factor Forkhead family, FKHRL1, at threonine 32 and serine 253 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in UT-7/EPO cells. Moreover, results showed that Akt kinase activated by EPO directly phosphorylated FKHRL1 protein and that FKHRL1 phosphorylation was completely dependent on PI3K activity as is the case for Akt. In conjunction with the evidence that FKHRL1 is expressed in normal human erythroid progenitor cells and erythroblasts, the results suggest that FKHRL1 plays an important role in erythropoiesis as one of the downstream target molecules of PI3K-Akt.","['Departments of Pediatrics and Hematology, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This compound is being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. We sought to extend the activity profile of STI 571 by testing its ability to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of c-kit, a receptor structurally similar to PDGFR. We treated a c-kit expressing a human myeloid leukemia cell line, M-07e, with STI 571 before stimulation with Steel factor (SLF). STI 571 inhibited c-kit autophosphorylation, activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and activation of Akt without altering total protein levels of c-kit, MAP kinase, or Akt. The concentration that produced 50% inhibition for these effects was approximately 100 nmol/L. STI 571 also significantly decreased SLF-dependent growth of M-07e cells in a dose-dependent manner and blocked the antiapoptotic activity of SLF. In contrast, the compound had no effect on MAP kinase activation or cellular proliferation in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. We also tested the activity of STI 571 in a human mast cell leukemia cell line (HMC-1), which has an activated mutant form of c-kit. STI 571 had a more potent inhibitory effect on the kinase activity of this mutant receptor than it did on ligand-dependent activation of the wild-type receptor. These findings show that STI 571 selectively inhibits c-kit tyrosine kinase activity and downstream activation of target proteins involved in cellular proliferation and survival.

Recently, we and others have shown that gene transfer of MuLV-based vectors into T cells can be significantly augmented using a fibronectin-facilitated protocol. Nevertheless, the relative abilities of naive (CD45RA(+)) and memory (CD45RO(+)) lymphocyte subsets to be transduced has not been assessed. Although naive T cells demonstrate a restricted cytokine profile following antigen stimulation and a decreased susceptibility to infection with human immunodeficiency virus, it was not clear whether they could be efficiently infected with a MuLV vector. This study describes conditions that permitted gene transfer of an enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing retroviral vector in more than 50% of naive umbilical cord (UC) blood and peripheral blood (PB) T cells following CD3/CD28 ligation. Moreover, treatment of naive T cells with interleukin-7 resulted in the maintenance of a CD45RA phenotype and gene transfer levels approached 20%. Finally, it was determined that parameters for optimal transduction of CD45RA(+) T cells isolated from PB and UC blood differed: transduction of the UC cells was significantly increased by the presence of autologous mononuclear cells (24.5% versus 56.5%). Because naive T cells harbor a receptor repertoire that allows them to respond to novel antigens, the development of protocols targeting their transduction is crucial for gene therapy applications. This approach will also allow the functions of exogenous genes to be evaluated in primary nontransformed naive T cells.","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, CNRS UMR 5535 (IFR24), Montpellier, France.']","['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The European Group for the Immunological Classification of Leukaemias (EGIL) has proposed that AML be defined immunologically by the expression of 2 or more of the following myeloid markers: myeloperoxidase, CD13, CD33, CDw65, and CD117. With regard to this classification, the prognostic significance of 21 antigens taken separately and with immunophenotypic subgroups were evaluated and compared with other clinical and biological variables in 177 adult AML patients. None of the antigens tested were associated with treatment outcome. In contrast, patients with blasts disclosing a full expression of panmyeloid phenotype (defined by the expression of all 5 myeloid markers) had a higher complete remission rate (P <. 0001) and differed significantly in disease-free survival (P =.02) and overall survival (P =.008) than patients whose cells expressed fewer than 5 of these markers. In multivariate analysis, only age, panmyeloid phenotype, performance status, and permeability glycoprotein activity influence treatment outcome. Cytogenetics was significant in univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis, most likely because of the redundancy with panmyeloid phenotype and a higher sensitivity of immunophenotyping. Patients whose cells exhibit the panmyeloid phenotype appear to define a relatively homogeneous biological subset of AML. The 4 independent prognostic factors were used to create a prognostic score, defined by the number of factors present. This score permitted a stratification of patients with AML, thereby allowing for the consideration of innovative therapies to improve outcome in the poorer outcome groups.","[""Formation de Recherche Claude Bernard, Institute National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Universite Paris, and the Services d'Hematologie Biologique et Clinique, Hopital Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.""]","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of p53 activation by oncogenes remains largely unknown. Here we report that the tumour suppressor PML regulates the p53 response to oncogenic signals. We found that oncogenic Ras upregulates PML expression, and overexpression of PML induces senescence in a p53-dependent manner. p53 is acetylated at lysine 382 upon Ras expression, an event that is essential for its biological function. Ras induces re-localization of p53 and the CBP acetyltransferase within the PML nuclear bodies and induces the formation of a trimeric p53-PML-CBP complex. Lastly, Ras-induced p53 acetylation, p53-CBP complex stabilization and senescence are lost in PML-/- fibroblasts.

Development has previously centered on increasing end-point titers by producing maximal levels of Mo-MuLV Gag/Pol, envelope glycoproteins, and retroviral RNA genomes. We describe the production yields and transduction efficiency characteristics of two Mo-MuLV packaging cell lines, FLYA13 and TEFLYA. Although they both produce 4070A-pseudotyped retroviral vectors reproducibly at >1 x 10(6) LFU ml(-1), the transduction efficiency of unconcentrated and concentrated virus from FLYA13 lines is poor compared with vector preparations from TEFLYA lines. A powerful inhibitor of retroviral transduction is secreted by FLYA13 packaging cells. We show that the inhibitory factor does not affect transduction of target cells by RD114-pseudotyped vectors. This suggests that the inhibitory factor functions at the level of envelope-receptor interactions. Phosphate starvation of target cells shows a two-fold increase in Pit2 receptor mRNA and causes some improvement in FLYA13 virus transduction efficiency. Western blots show that FLYA13 viral samples contain an eight-fold higher ratio of 4070A envelope to p30gag than that of virus produced by TEFLYA producer cell lines. This study correlates overexpression of 4070A envelope glycoprotein in retroviral preparations with a reduction of transduction efficiency at high multiplicities of infection. We suggest that TEFLYA packaging cells express preferable levels of 4070A compared with FLYA13, which not only enables high-titer stocks to be generated, but also facilitates a high efficiency of transduction of target cells.","['Oxford BioMedica (UK) Ltd, Medawar Centre.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence analysis of one transcript that showed a profound decrease in expression after cytokine withdrawal revealed it to be a member of the SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling ATPases. This cDNA had a 2514-nucleotide (838-amino acid) open reading frame and encoded an additional 230 amino acids at the NH2 terminus compared with the murine homologue, lsh, and the human counterpart, Hells. This gene locus has been designated SMARCA6 (SWI/SNF2-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 6). The highest levels of mRNA expression in humans are observed in proliferative tissues such as the thymus, testis, and bone marrow. Whereas cytokine withdrawal in MO7e cells leads to apoptosis and decreased mRNA expression, growth arrest without the induction of apoptosis of MO7e cells also leads to down-regulation of mRNA expression, suggesting an association with cell proliferation and not suppression of apoptosis. Nuclear localization of this SNF2-like putative helicase is dependent on a nuclear localization sequence located in the NH2-terminal region. Based on sequence homology to other SNF2-like helicases, the pattern of tissue expression, and the association of expression with cell proliferation, we refer to the protein product as proliferation-associated SNF2-like gene product [PASG (D. W. Lee et al., Blood, 94: 594a, 1999)]. Examination of acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples revealed a high frequency of a PASG transcript containing an in-frame 75-nucleotide deletion, which codes for a conserved motif known to be critical for the transactivation activity of a related yeast SWI/SNF polypeptide. These results extend our knowledge of this SNF2-like family member and suggest a role for PASG in leukemogenesis.","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229, USA.""]","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 5.99.- (HELLS protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL transcripts were undetectable by reverse transcription-PCR, but a novel reciprocal translocation, t(5;10)(q33;q21.2), was seen by standard cytogenetic analysis. Chromosome band 5q33 contains the gene encoding the platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor (PDGFbetaR), the receptor tyrosine kinase that is disrupted by the t(5;7), t(5;12), and t(5;14) in myeloid disorders, resulting in the fusion of PDGFbetaR to HIP1, TEL/ETV6, and CEV14, respectively. Southern analysis with PDGFbetaR cDNA revealed novel bands in patient but not control DNA after digestion with several restriction enzymes, indicating that this gene is also targeted by the t(5;10). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of chromosome 5 indicated that a small inversion at 5q33 had taken place in addition to the interchromosomal translocation. The site of the chromosome 10 breakpoint fell within YAC 940e4. Because all PDGFbetaR fusions described thus far result in splicing to a common exon of this gene, we performed 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR on patient RNA. Several clones were isolated in which PDGFbetaR fused in frame to H4/D10S170, a previously described ubiquitously expressed gene that is fused to the ret protein tyrosine kinase to form the PTC-1 oncogene in approximately 20% of papillary thyroid carcinomas. The presence of H4-PDGFbetaR chimeric mRNA in the patient was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR; reciprocal PDGFbeta1R-H4 transcripts were not detected. We conclude that t(5;10)(q33;q21.2) is a novel translocation in BCR-ABL-negative chronic myeloid leukemia and that this abnormality results in an H4-PDGFbetaR fusion gene.

The recently identified cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1) bioactivates PAHs but is also a physiological regulator, as evidenced by linkage of CYP1B1 deficiency to congenital human glaucoma. This investigation demonstrates that CYP1B1 null mice are almost completely protected from the acute bone marrow cytotoxic and preleukemic effects of the prototypic PAH 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA).

Wild-type mice constitutively expressed low levels of bone marrow CYP1B1. These findings suggest that CYP1B1 is responsible for the formation of DMBA dihydrodiol epoxides in the bone marrow.

After i.v. injection, liposomal topotecan was eliminated from the plasma much more slowly than free drug, resulting in a 400-fold increase in plasma area under the curve. Further, high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of plasma samples demonstrated that topotecan was protected from hydrolysis within the liposomal carrier with >80% of the drug remaining as the active, lactone species up to 24 h. The improved pharmacokinetics observed with liposomal topotecan correlated with increased efficacy in both murine and human tumor models. In the L1210 ascitic tumor model, optimal doses of liposomal topotecan resulted in a 60-day survival rate of 60-80%, whereas in a L1210 liver metastasis model, 100% long-term survival (>60 days) was achieved. In contrast, long-term survivors were rarely seen after treatment with free topotecan. Further, in a human breast carcinoma model (MDA 435/LCC6), liposomal topotecan provided greatly improved increase in life span relative to the free drug. These results suggest that liposomal encapsulation can significantly enhance the therapeutic activity of topotecan.","['Inex Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A descriptive study of all new childhood cancer cases among residents of Puerto Rico reported to the Cancer Registry between the years 1980 and 1991 was conducted. The distribution of cases was described by age, gender, place of residence, histology, last date known to be alive, and stage of disease. Incidence rates and standardized incidence rates by age were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 1,823 new pediatric cases were reported from 1980 through 1991. Over half were males, and 52.2% were aged < 10 years. Most cases resided in urban areas. The most frequent histologic types were leukemia (31.0%), lymphomas and other reticulo-endothelial neoplasms (16.2%), and brain, central nervous system, and intracranial and intraspinal neoplasms (16.0%). The most frequent type of tumor was acute lymphocytic leukemia (22.0%). Although the overall distribution of most neoplasms was similar between genders, a higher proportion of lymphomas was reported among males, and there were significantly more carcinomas among girls. The largest increase in the age-adjusted incidence rate between periods (1980-84 and 1985-89) occurred in the 5-9 age group. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings are consistent with previous studies in USA. However, there were some differences in the distribution of histologic types when compared with similar studies in other countries, and with the results of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program. Factors such as differences in diagnostic capabilities among countries must be taken into consideration.","['Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan 00936-5067.

This gene was fused with MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) that occurred in an infant with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. GRAF encodes a member of the Rho family of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family. On the protein level, it is 90% homologous to the recently described chicken GRAF gene that functions as a GAP of RhoA in vivo and is thus a critical component of the integrin signaling transduction pathway. The particular position of the human GRAF gene at 5q31 and the proposed antiproliferative and tumor suppressor properties of its avian homologue suggest that it also might be pathogenetically relevant for hematologic malignancies with deletions of 5q. To investigate this possibility, we sequenced 4-5 individual cDNA clones from 13 cases in which one allele of GRAF was deleted. We found point mutations within the GAP domain of the second GRAF allele in one patient. In two additional patients we found an insertion of 52 or 74 bp within the GRAF cDNA that generates a reading frame shift followed by a premature stop codon. GRAF maps outside the previously defined commonly deleted 5q31 region. Nevertheless, inactivation of both alleles in at least some cases suggests that deletions and mutations of the GRAF gene may be instrumental in the development and progression of hematopoeitic disorders with a del(5q).","['Departments of General Pediatrics, Hematology, and Oncology, and Pathology, University of Giessen, D-35392-Giessen, Germany.']","['0 (ARHGAP26 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,PMC16840,,,,['GENBANK/Y10388'],,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate that DEK, together with SR proteins, associates with the SRm160 splicing coactivator in vitro. DEK is recruited to splicing factor-containing nuclear speckles upon concentration of SRm160 in these structures, indicating that DEK and SRm160 associate in vivo. We further demonstrate that DEK associates with splicing complexes through interactions mediated by SR proteins. Significantly, DEK remains bound to the exon-product RNA after splicing, and this association requires the prior formation of a spliceosome. Thus, DEK is a candidate factor for controlling postsplicing steps in gene expression that are influenced by the prior removal of an intron from pre-mRNA.","['Banting and Best Department of Medical Research, C.H.

Throughout pregnancy, the amount of the OSM protein in the decidua was larger than that in the chorionic tissue. Immunohistochemistry using an anti-OSM monoclonal antibody demonstrated that OSM was mainly localized in the decidual glands and stroma. OSM transcripts in the decidua and the chorionic tissue were detected during each trimester by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The regulation of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) release by the placenta in first trimester stimulated with recombinant OSM was also investigated. Stimulation of the placenta by OSM augmented HCG release in a time- and dose-dependent manner. HCG release induced by recombinant human OSM was completely blocked by antibodies against OSM and the signal transducer, gp130, but only partially inhibited by antibodies against the leukaemia inhibiting factor (LIF) receptor.

In this study, 15 nonspecific protein bands in the growth medium were observed. These bands interfered with the interpretation of results. A nonspecific protein (25 kD) that was highly reactive in cell lysate preparation from BLV-bat2 was also detected.

Histologic sections were examined to place the lesions in one of the diagnostic categories of the National Cancer Institute working formulation (NCI WF) for lymphomas or lymphoid leukemia. Correlations between the various factors determined were tested using contingency tables and chi-square analysis to provide a statistical comparison between the levels of observations determined by case examination with the numbers expected from chance alone. Significant correlations (P < or = 0.05) were found between diagnosis and tumor topography, the frequency of mitoses, necrosis, sclerosis, and age, between mitoses and necrosis, topography, age, and feline leukemia viral infection status, between topography and necrosis and age, and between leukemia viral status and age. Significant correlations between diagnosis and tumor topography included a greater than expected number of cases of acute and chronic lymphoid leukemia and multicentric distribution of tumor. Small cell lymphomas were more frequent than expected in enteric and cutaneous areas and less frequent than expected in mediastinal, renal, and multicentric areas. In contrast, the high-grade small noncleaved type of lymphomas was found significantly more frequently than expected in the mediastinum and less frequently than expected in enteric tissues. In comparing diagnosis and frequency of mitoses, the lymphomas classified as low grade by the NCI WF were significantly more frequent than expected in the lower categories (0-2/100x) of mitoses, and those classified as high-grade lymphomas were more frequent than expected in the higher categories (4-8/1OOx) of mitoses. In comparing diagnosis and sclerosis, diffuse sclerosis was more frequent than expected for the intermediate grade lymphomas of mixed cell type and for the high-grade lymphomas of the immunoblastic polymorphous type. In comparing diagnosis and locally extensive necrosis, this feature was more frequently observed than expected for cases of intermediate grade lymphoma of the small-cleaved cell category and for the high-grade lymphoma of the immunoblastic cell type.

As shown in experimental animals, which led to pilot clinical studies, elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes can be accomplished with high-dose chemoradiotherapy, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, by re-establishment of unresponsiveness to self antigens of newly generated lymphocytes, due to a mechanism of central clonal deletion. We hypothesized that self-reactive lymphocytes causing autoimmune disease may be successfully eliminated by highly immunosuppressive yet not necessarily myeloablative conditioning in conjunction with allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation, since immunocompetent alloreactive lymphocytes of donor origin can effectively eliminate residual host-type hematopoietic cells, self-reactive lymphocytes included, by a mechanism that resembles graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effects. The present report is an attempt to confirm the existence of graft-vs-autoimmunity (GVA) effects in parallel with amplification of the alloreactive potential of donor lymphocytes following allogeneic non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST). METHODS: We identified a patient with severe psoriatic arthritis who also had Philadelphia (bcr/abl) positive chronic myelogenous leukemia and therefore was fully eligible for NST. Both diseases responded initially to non-myeloablative conditioning involving fludarabine 30 mg/m2 x 6, anti-T-lymphocyte globulin 10 mg/kg X 4, and busulfan 4 mg/kg x 2. RESULTS: The initial NST procedure was uneventful and resulted in elimination of all signs of autoimmunity (psoriasis and arthritis). Recurrence of polyarthritis and exacerbation of psoriasis were observed in parallel with a significant increase in the proportion of male (host) DNA, and 5% of the mitoses were bcr/abl positive, indicating an increase in the clone of CML. Both bcr/abl-positive cells identified by RT-PCR and psoriatic arthritis were successfully eliminated following discontinuation of anti-GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporine A (CSA), which resulted in activation of the alloreactive potential of donor T cells, accompanied by graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), suggesting the existence of GVA effects. RT-PCR for bcr/abl remains consistently negative for nearly 3 years, and all DNA remains donor type. CONCLUSIONS: The response of autoimmune disease manifestations to GVA effects in parallel with elimination of all host-derived hematopoietic cells supports our working hypothesis that autoimmune diseases caused by self-reactive lymphocytes may be effectively treated by elimination of alloreactive self-reactive lymphocytes following induction of host-vs-graft tolerance, in analogy with replacement of malignant or genetically abnormal host cells following DLI. It is therefore suggested that intentional GVA effects may be inducible by DLI following a conventional or preferably safer non-myeloablative regimen in recipients with life-threatening autoimmune diseases resistant to conventional modalities. Adoptive immunotherapy of autoimmunity may thus involve a two-step procedure: first, inducing host-vs-graft and graft-vs-host transplantation tolerance through a transient stage of mixed chimerism; second, inducing controlled GVA effects, initially by discontinuation of CSA and then, if indicated, by late outpatient DLI to eradicate residual hematopoietic cells of host origin.","['The Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Cancer Immunotherapy & Immunobiology Research Center, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. slavin@cc.huji.ac.il']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which hematopoietic stem cells are specified to the osteoclast lineage is unclear. To understand the process of generation and differentiation of this lineage of cells, we performed in vitro studies on the differentiation of embryonic stem cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the potential of mutant embryonic stem cell lines harboring targeted deletions of the GATA-1, FOG, SCL/tal-1, or GATA-2 genes to differentiate into osteoclasts and determined when these molecules function in osteoclast development. RESULTS: The lack of GATA-1 or FOG did not affect osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, SCL/tal-1-null embryonic stem cells generated no osteoclasts. In the case of the loss of GATA-2, a small number of osteoclasts were generated. GATA-2-null osteoclasts were morphologically normal and the terminal maturation was not disturbed, but a defect was observed in the generation of osteoclast progenitors. Experiments using specific inhibitors that block the signaling through macrophage colony-stimulating factor and osteoclast differentiation factor/osteoprotegerin ligand suggested that GATA-2 seems to act earlier in osteoclastogenesis than these cytokines. Interestingly, macrophage colony-forming units were not severely reduced by the loss of GATA-2 compared to osteoclast progenitors. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that osteocalsts need SCL/tal-1 at an early point in development, and that GATA-2 is required for generation of osteoclast progenitors but not for the later stages when macrophage colony-stimulating factor and osteoclast differentiation factor/ osteoprotegerin ligand are needed. We also demonstrated that osteoclast progenitors behave as a different population than macrophage colony-forming units.","['Department of Immunology, School of Life Science, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, Yonago, Japan. yamanet@grape.med.tottori-u.ac.jp']","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TNFRSF11A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF11 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also exhibits synergistic effects with interferons on the induction of differentiation and growth inhibition in vitro. Recent studies showed that interferons engage a signaling pathway involving the CBL proto-oncogene and the CrkL adapter, which mediates interferon-induced growth inhibitory signals. The objective of this study was to determine whether the CBL-CrkL pathway is activated by treatment of the NB-4 and HL-60 acute leukemia cell lines with RA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of RA treatment on CBL and CrkL phosphorylation, as well as on protein-protein interactions, were determined in studies involving immunoprecipitations of cell extracts with specific antibodies and Western blots. In addition, glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins were used in binding studies to determine whether the SH2 domain of CrkL interacts with CBL in a RA-dependent manner and whether Rapl is activated by RA. RESULTS: Treatment of NB-4 or HL-60 cells with RA resulted in strong tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, which was time and dose dependent. Similarly, RA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the CrkL adapter and the association of CrkL with CBL. The RA-dependent interaction of CrkL with CBL was mediated by binding of the SH2 domain of CrkL to tyrosine phosphorylated CBL, suggesting that CBL provides a docking site for engagement of CrkL in a RA-activated cellular pathway. The guanine exchange factor C3G was found to be associated with CrkL at similar levels before and after RA treatment, but Rapl activation downstream of C3G was not inducible by RA. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that the CBL-CrkL pathway is one of the mediators of the effects of RA on APL cells and suggest that one of the mechanisms of synergy between RA and interferons may involve regulation of components of this signaling cascade.","['Section of Hematology-Oncology, University of Illinois at Chicago and West Side Veterans Administration Medical Center, USA.']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",,,,"['CA73381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77816/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The goals of this study were 1) to quantify apoptosis in patients with ""early stage"" myelodysplasia [including patients with refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), RA with excess blasts and with less than 10% blasts (RAEB(<10))], and in patients with ""late stage"" myelodysplasia [including RAEB with more than 10% blasts (RAEB(>10)), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), and acute myeloid leukemia secondary to myelodysplasia (LAM2)]; 2) to study the activation of the caspase-3/CPP32 enzyme, a major ""effector"" caspase in hematopoiesis, in patients with ""early stage"" myelodysplasia, and 3) to evaluate the effect of caspase inhibition on the apoptotic phenotype and clonogenicity of hematopoietic progenitors in vitro in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PATIENTS: Fifty-four patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, including 30 with ""early stage"" myelodysplasia and 24 with ""late stage"" myelodysplasia were studied. Study of apoptosis: TUNEL assay performed on bone marrow smears and/or quantification of annexin V positive bone marrow mononuclear cells by flow cytometric analysis. Caspacse-3/CPP32 activity: Quantitative measurement of caspase-3/CPP32 activity on total bone marrow mononuclear cells using a fluorogenic substrate. Effect of the caspase-inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK: 1) on the apoptotic phenotype of total bone marrow mononuclear cells and 2) on the clonogenicity of hematopoietic progenitor cells. RESULTS: The group of 30 patients with ""early stage"" myelodysplasia had statistically increased apoptosis compared to the group of 24 patients with ""late stage"" myelodysplasia (44.1% +/- 4.8 vs 21.8% +/- 3.6; p = 0.02) using the TDT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. In the group of patients with RAEB, those with MDS(RAEB<10) had excessive apoptosis compared to those with MDS(RAEB>10) (44.0% +/- 3.5% vs 29.5% +/- 3.6%;p = 0.042) The median caspase-3 activity in 20 ""early stage"" myelodysplasia patients was 19,000 U (range 3,460-41,000) and significantly increased compared to normal individuals (4,256 U, range 3,200-5,200; p = 0.032) Bone marrow mononuclear cells from 12 ""early stage"" MDS patients (including 11 from the 20 studied for caspase-3 activity) were incubated with or without the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. In 4 of 9 evaluable patients (44.4%) with excessive apoptosis, the number of annexin V positive cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of Z-VAD-FMK. However, in none of these patients was caspase inhibition with Z-VAD-FMK able to enhance colony formation in vitro. CONCLUSION: These results confirm that a major characteristic of patients with ""early stage"" myelodysplasia is increased apoptosis. The results also indicate that excessive apoptosis in these patients is accompanied by increased caspase-3/CPP32 activity. However, caspase inhibition with the broad-spectrum inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK cannot improve hematopoiesis in this group of patients, even when apoptosis is attenuated.","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Cochin, AP-HP, Universite Rene Descartes, Paris, France. bouscary@cochin.inserm.fr""]","['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,['Exp Hematol. 2000 Dec;28(12):1310-2.

In this article, we compare the activity of TGF-beta3 on highly purified CD34+ cells and more immature CD34-DR(-) cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients in chronic phase and normal donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primitive hematopoietic progenitors were stimulated in liquid cultures and clonogenic assays by early-acting growth factors such as stem cell factor (SCF) and interleukin 11 (IL-11) and the intermediate-late-acting stimulating factors IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and erythropoietin. Molecular analysis of bcr/abl mRNA was performed on single CML colonies by nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, cell cycle analysis and assessment of apoptosis of normal and leukemic CD34+ cells were performed by propidium iodide (PI) alone and simultaneous staining with annexin V and PI, respectively. RESULTS: The colony-forming efficiency of CML CD34+ cells was generally inhibited by more than 90% regardless of whether the colony-stimulating factors were used alone or combined. When compared to normal CD34+ cells, leukemic cells were significantly more suppressed in 6 of 8 culture conditions. The inhibitory effect of TGF-beta3 on CD34+ cells was exerted within the first 24 hours of incubation as demonstrated by short-term preincubation followed by IL-3-and SCF-stimulated colony assays. Evaluation of bcr/abl transcript on residual CML colonies incubated with TGF-beta3 demonstrated a small subset of neoplastic CD34+ cells unresponsive to the inhibitory effect of the study cytokine. TGF-beta3 demonstrated a greater inhibitory activity on primitive CD34+DR cells than on more mature CD34+ cells. Again, CML CD34+DR(-) cells were significantly more inhibited by TGF-beta3 than their normal counterparts in 3 of 8 culture conditions. Kinetic analysis performed on CD34+ cells showed that TGF-beta induces cell cycle arrest in G(1) phase. However, this mechanism of action is shared by normal and leukemic cells. Conversely, TGF-beta3 preferentially triggered the programmed cell death of CML CD34-cells without increasing the proportion of leukemic cells coexpressing CD95 (Fas receptor), and this effect was not reversed by functional blockade of Fas receptor. Conclusion. We demonstrate that TGF-beta3 exerts a potent suppressive effect on CML cells that is partly mediated by Fas-independent apoptosis.","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology L. & A.

Of the two techniques described for analyzing Ch oxidation products, TLC with color development suffices for preliminary, mainly qualitative product screening, whereas a high-performance approach such as HPLC-EC(Hg) is advised when maximum resolution and sensitivity of quantitation are necessary. By using these strategies, one can monitor the formation of 1O2, for example, in a biologically relevant milieu (membrane), thus avoiding the difficulties associated with external detection, e.g., by physical means. These approaches would be valuable for assessing reaction mechanisms for various oxidative agents of biomedical importance, including environmental phototoxins and the rapidly emerging family of phototherapeutic drugs.

Although the potential problem of tolerance may be overcome by transplantation, provision of high levels of T-cell help is likely to be an important factor in stimulating effective immune pathways. The fusion gene approach appears to provide the required help, and offers a rational design for raising both antibody and T-cell mediated attack against lymphoma and myeloma, which express idiotypic antigen at the cell surface or as a secreted protein respectively. Intriguingly, preliminary data indicate that the fusion gene approach promotes antibody responses against a different cell surface tumour antigen, CEA. Strategies for using DNA vaccines to induce attack on processed peptides bound to MHC class I molecules are also being developed. We hope and anticipate that all categories of tumour antigen may be susceptible to this powerful new technology. The critical clinical requirement, however, will be to treat the presenting tumour with maintenance or restoration of immune capacity. We await results of the preliminary clinical trials with great interest.","['Tenovus Laboratory, Southampton University Hospitals Trust, UK. fs@soton.ac.uk']","['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (immunoglobulin Fv)']",10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital. METHODS: 25 new cases of ALL underwent somatometric measurements and ultrasonographic evaluation of skeletal muscle and subcutaneous fat at initial presentation and after completion of induction therapy. RESULTS: Malnutrition (weight for age < 80percnt) was evident in 13 cases (52percnt), but cumulative incidence of malnutrition (weight for age < 80percnt, weight for height < 90percnt, height for age < 95percnt, skin fold thickness < 5th centile, midarm muscle circumference < 5th centile) was 88percnt. Nine children lost weight during induction (range: 0.2 to 5.8 kg; means +/- SD: 1.9 plusmn 1.8 kg). All these cases had a complicated course during induction chemotherapy. Fourteen children (56percnt) had skeletal muscle wasting during induction chemotherapy. All those children who had lost weight also had skeletal muscle wasting. Subcutaneous fat, in contrast increased in 24 cases (96percnt). CONCLUSION: Malnutrition exists in a significant proportion of children with ALL.

Although PBX proteins exhibit regulated subcellular localization and function in the nucleus in other tissues, little data exists on HOX and PBX protein localization during skin development. We now show that the HOXB6 protein is expressed in the suprabasal layer of the early developing epidermis and throughout the upper layers of late fetal and adult human skin. HOXB6 signal is cytoplasmic throughout fetal epidermal development, but substantially nuclear in normal adult skin. HOXB6 protein is also partially nuclear in hyperproliferative skin conditions, but appears to be cytoplasmic in basal and squamous cell carcinomas. Although all three PBX genes are expressed in fetal epidermis, none of the three PBX proteins exhibit nuclear co-localization with HOXB6 in either fetal or adult epidermis. RNA and protein data suggest that a truncated HOXB6 protein, lacking the homeodomain, is expressed in undifferentiated keratinocytes and that the full-length protein is induced by differentiation. GFP-fusion proteins were used to demonstrate that the full-length HOXB6 protein is localized to the nucleus while the truncated protein is largely cytoplasmic. Taken together, these data suggest that during epidermal development the truncated HOXB6 isoform may function by a mechanism other than as DNA binding protein, and that most of the nuclear, homeodomain-containing HOXB6 protein does not utilize PBX proteins as DNA binding partners in the skin.

We analyzed the representation and intranuclear distribution of PML domains. We find that multiple biological parameters contribute to heterogeneity in the subnuclear organization of PML domains in a broad spectrum of cell types. The subnuclear organization of PML domains was also evaluated following transient transfection with a series of vectors expressing normal hematopoietic and leukemia-related transcription factors. Our results show that expression of a chimeric transcription factor encoded by the tumor related chromosomal translocation (8;21) involving the AML1 and ETO loci is sufficient to cause reorganization of PML domains.

Additionally, intractable pruritus has been associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, reports of adult-onset eczematous dermatitis has rarely been linked to noncutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders. OBSERVATIONS: We observed one patient in 1993 who had the onset of intractable dermatitis characterized by prurigo nodularis-like lesions and widespread erythematous plaques. After 18 months of cutaneous symptoms he experienced dyspnea. At this time Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed. This observation prompted us to evaluate subsequent patients with adult-onset eczema who were poorly responsive to therapy and in whom an obvious cause could not be determined. Over the next 24 months we identified an additional 2 patients with lymphoma who met this criteria. CONCLUSION: Unexplained eczema of adult onset may be associated with an underlying lymphoproliferative malignancy. When a readily identifiable cause (eg, contactants, drugs, or atopy) is not found, a systematic evaluation should be pursued. Patients should be evaluated with a careful physical examination, complete blood cell counts, peripheral blood smears, chest roentgenography, computed tomography of the chest and abdomen, and serum protein electrophoresis.","['University of Louisville School of Medicine Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rate of recombination during reverse transcription between two identical sequences within the same RNA molecule is very high. In this study, we have developed a sensitive system to study recombination occurring within the proviral sequence. This system includes a murine Moloney leukemia virus vector which contains a neomycin resistance gene (neo) and two mutated green fluorescent protein genes (gfp) in tandem positions. The 3' end of the first gfp and the 5' end of the second gfp gene are both mutated, so that neither of these two gfp genes is functional. However, if recombination occurs between the two gfp genes it will create a functional gfp protein. Cells containing such a functional recombinant gfp appear green under fluorescence microscopy. The rate of recombination between the two gfp sequences during a single round of replication is as high as 51%. Green cells appear during proliferation of a clonal clear-cell population and allow a small portion of these recombinations between sequences of proviral DNA to be detected. The frequency of recombination at the proviral DNA level is about 10(-5) events/cell division, which is very low compared with the frequency of recombination (51%) caused by reverse transcriptase and/or RNA polymerase II.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536-0096, USA.']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",,,,['CA7040/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC112287,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the process of retroviral morphogenesis, we examined the properties of histidine-tagged (His-tagged) Moloney murine leukemia (M-MuLV) capsid plus nucleocapsid (CANC) (His-MoCANC) proteins in vitro. The His-MoCANC proteins bound RNA, possessed nucleic acid-annealing activities, and assembled into strand, circle (or sphere), and tube forms in the presence of RNA. Image analysis of electron micrographs revealed that tubes were formed by cage-like lattices of CANC proteins surrounding at least two different types of protein-free cage holes. By virtue of a His tag association with nickel-chelating lipids, His-MoCANC proteins also assembled into planar sheets on lipid monolayers, mimicking the membrane-associated immature PrGag protein forms. Membrane-bound His-MoCANC proteins organized into two-dimensional (2D) cage-like lattices that were closely related to the tube forms, and in the presence of both nickel-chelating lipids and RNAs, 2D lattice forms appeared similar to lattices assembled in the absence of RNA. Our observations are consistent with a M-MuLV morphogenesis model in which proteolytic processing of membrane-bound Gag proteins permits CA and NC domains to rearrange from an immature spherical structure to a condensed mature form while maintaining local protein-protein contacts.","['Laboratoire de Chimie Genetique, Faculte de Pharmacie, University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.']","['0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,"['1 S10 RR12935/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5RO1 GM 52914/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC112263,,,,,,,,,,,

The p21/waf1 protein was reproducibly observed to be complexed with cyclin A/cdk2 and not with any other known G(1), S, or G(2)/M cyclins. Functionally, the association of p21/cyclin A/cdk2 decreased histone H1 phosphorylation in vitro, as observed in immunoprecipitations followed by kinase assays, and affected other substrates, such as the C terminus of Rb protein involved in c-Abl and histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1) regulation. Interestingly, upon the use of a stress signal, such as gamma-irradiation, we found that the p21/cyclin A/cdk2 complex was able to block all known phosphorylation sites on the Rb molecule. Finally, using elutriated cell cycle fractions and a stress signal, we observed that the HTLV-1-infected T cells containing wild-type Tax, which had been in early or mid-G(1) phase prior to gamma-irradiation, arrested in G(1) and did not undergo apoptosis. This may be an important mechanism for an oncogenic virus such as HTLV-1 to stop the host at the G(1)/S boundary and to repair the damaged DNA upon injury, prior to S-phase entry.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']","['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,"['R01 AI043894/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI13969/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI42524/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI43894/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC112248,,,,,,,,,,,

To probe the function of the PPPY motif, a series of insertions of homologous and heterologous motifs from other retroviruses were introduced at various positions in a mutant gag gene lacking the PPPY motif. The assembly defects of the PPPY deletion mutant could be rescued by insertion of a wild-type PPPY motif and flanking sequences at several ectopic positions in the Gag protein. The late assembly domain (L-domain) of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) could also fully or partially restore M-MuLV assembly when introduced into matrix, p12, or nucleocapsid domains of the mutant M-MuLV Gag protein lacking the PPPY motif. Strikingly, mutant viruses carrying the RSV or the HIV-1 L-domain at the original location of the deleted PPPY motif were replication competent in rodent cells. These data suggest that the PPPY motif of M-MuLV acts in a partially position-independent manner and is functionally interchangeable with L-domains of other retroviruses. Electron microscopy studies revealed that deletion of the entire p12 region resulted in the formation of tube-like rather than spherical particles. Remarkably, the PPPY deletion mutant formed chain structures composed of multiple viral particles linked on the cell surface. Many of the mutants with heterologous L-domains released virions with wild-type morphology.","['Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular and Biophysical Studies, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,"['R01 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC112246,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax physically associates with the IKK regulatory subunit, IKK gamma, although the underlying biochemical mechanism and functional significance remain unclear. We show that the Tax-IKK gamma interaction requires two homologous leucine zipper domains located within IKK gamma. These leucine zipper domains are unique for the presence of a conserved upstream region that is essential for Tax binding. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed that a leucine-repeat region of Tax is important for IKK gamma binding. Interestingly, all the Tax mutants defective in IKK gamma binding failed to engage the IKK complex or stimulate IKK activity, and these functional defects can be rescued by fusing the Tax mutants to IKK gamma.

According to recent reports it is still a cause for concern. VC has been found as a degradation product of chloroethylene solvents (perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene) and in landfill gas and groundwater at concentrations up to 200 mg/m(3) and 10 mg/L, respectively. Worldwide occupational exposure to VC still seems to be high in some countries (e.g., averages of approximately 1,300 mg/m(3) until 1987 in one factory), and exposure may also be high in others where VC is not regulated. By combining the most relevant epidemiologic studies from several countries, we observed a 5-fold excess of liver cancer, primarily because of a 45-fold excess risk from angiosarcoma of the liver (ASL). The number of ASL cases reported up to the end of 1998 was 197 worldwide. The average latency for ASL is 22 years. Some studies show a small excess risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, and others suggest a possible risk of brain tumors among highly exposed workers. Lung cancer, lymphomas, or leukemia do not seem to be related to VC exposure according to recent results. The mutation spectra observed in rat and human liver tumors (ASL and/or hepatocellular carcinoma) that are associated with exposure to VC are clearly distinct from those observed in sporadic liver tumors or hepatic tumors that are associated with other exposures. In rats, the substitution mutations found at A:T base pairs in the ras and p53 genes are consistent with the promutagenic properties of the DNA adduct 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine formed from VC metabolites. Risk assessments derived from animal studies seem to overestimate the actual risk of cancer when comparing estimated and reported cases of ASL.","['Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology and Aerosol Research with Drug Research and Clinical Inhalation, Hanover, Germany. kielhorn@ita.fhg.de']","['0 (Carcinogens)', 'WD06X94M2D (Vinyl Chloride)']",151,,,,PMC1638183,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on this animal model, we initiated a trial of nonmyeloablative therapy with HLA-matched or -mismatched donor BMT and DLI for refractory hematologic malignancies. Twenty-one of 36 patients enrolled in this trial received a genotypically (n = 20) or phenotypically (n = 1) HLA-matched donor transplant; results reported here are for those patients only. Preparative therapy consisted of cyclophosphamide in doses of 150 to 200 mg/kg; peritransplant antithymocyte globulin; thymic irradiation (in patients who had not received previous mediastinal radiation therapy); and cyclosporine. Eighteen of 20 evaluable patients developed persistent mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism as defined by >1% donor peripheral white blood cells until at least day 35 posttransplantation. Ten patients received prophylactic DLI beginning 5 to 6 weeks after BMT for conversion of mixed chimerism to full donor hematopoiesis and to optimize a graft-versus-leukemia effect. Fourteen of 20 evaluable patients (70%) achieved an antitumor response; 8 of these responses were complete, and 6 were partial. Of the 8 evaluable patients who received prophylactic DLI, 6 showed conversion to full donor chimerism. Five of the 9 evaluable patients (56%) who received prophylactic DLI achieved a complete response, compared with 3 of 11 patients (27%) who did not receive prophylactic DLI. Currently 11 patients are alive, and 7 of these are free of disease progression at a median follow-up time of 445 days (range, 105-548 days) posttransplantation. Transplantation-related complications included cyclophosphamide-induced cardiac toxicity in 3 of 21 patients (14%) and grade II or greater GVHD in 6 patients (29%). One patient (5%) died from a complication of BMT, and 1 patient (5%) died from GVHD after 2 prophylactic DLIs were given for conversion of chimerism. In summary, mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism was reproducibly induced after a novel nonmyeloablative preparative regimen incorporating chemotherapy, peritransplant antithymocyte globulin, and thymic irradiation, allowing for early administration of DLI in 10 of 21 patients. After treatment, striking antitumor responses were observed in the majority of patients with chemotherapy-refractory hematologic malignancies.","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program/Department of Medicine, Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02114, USA.']","['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,"['1R01 CA79986-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA79988-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA79989-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate, we obtained adherence-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 3 individuals who had received a sex-mismatched allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) and cultured the cells on fibronectin-coated plates with endothelial growth factors. The phenotype of the spindle-shaped cells that emerged in culture was characterized by immunofluorescent staining, and the origin of the cells was determined using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay for polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs). The cells manifested a number of endothelial characteristics-such as von Wlllebrand factor, CD31, and Flk-1/KDR expression; Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin 1 binding; and acetylated low-density lipoprotein uptake-but lacked expression of certain markers of activation or differentiation, including intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and the epitope for the anti-endothelial cell antibody P1H12. For each patient and at all time points studied (ranging from 5 to 52 months after transplantation), STR-PCR analysis showed that cultured cells and nucleated blood cells came exclusively from the bone marrow donor.

Severe immunosuppression is the best recognized risk factor for NHL. Many factors in the environment that have been described as risk factors for NHL cause measurable changes in immune functions. Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare, indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, originating from B-lymphocytes. This was a case-control study including 111 male cases with HCL and 400 controls. In a subgroup of 57 cases and 65 controls analysis of antibodies to EBV early antigen, viral capsid antigen, and EBNA-1, measured as P107, was performed. In this study, we confirm other studies describing elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV early antigen (EA) in patients with HCL compared to controls. We found only minor differences in the levels of antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA) and EBNA-1. measured as P107.

The principal analysis included 41 leukemia cases that occurred more than 2 years after the first exposure to radiation. The case-control methodology was used to evaluate the risk of leukemia associated with various factors. Radiation dose, effective exposure dose rate, date of entry into the Chernobyl zone (ChZ), and the duration of stay in the zone were used as risk factors. The relationship between the date of entry and the duration of stay in the zone was investigated. All cases of leukemia, excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), were analyzed. An analysis was also performed on all EWs and on the EWs who worked in the zone from 1986 to 1987 (EWs of 1986 to 1987). No significant association was found between the risk of leukemia and the factors we investigated.

We investigated in a leukaemia model whether bone-marrow-derived endothelial cells contribute to this maintenance angiogenesis. METHODS: We studied six patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) carrying the BCR/ABL fusion gene in their bone-marrow-derived cells. We screened endothelial cells generated in vitro from bone-marrow-derived progenitor cells and vascular endothelium in myocardial tissue for the BCR/ABL fusion gene by in-situ hybridisation. For detection of donor-type endothelial cells after transplantation of haemopoietic stem cells, recipient tissue was stained with monoclonal antibodies against donor-type HLA antigens. FINDINGS: We identified the BCR/ABL fusion gene in variable proportions (0-56%) of endothelial cells generated in vitro. Endothelial cells expressing the fusion gene were found in the vascular endothelium of a patient. In a recipient of an allogeneic stem-cell transplant, normal donor-type endothelial cells were detected in the vascular endothelium. INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that CML is not solely a haematological disease but originates from a bone-marrow-derived haemangioblastic precursor cell that can give rise to both blood cells and endothelial cells. Moreover, normal bone-marrow-derived endothelial cells can contribute to the maintenance of the blood vascular endothelium. The integration of bone-marrow-derived endothelial cells into the vascular endothelium provides a rationale for developing vascular targeting strategies in vasculopathies, inflammatory diseases, and cancer.","['Division of Haematology and Oncology, University of Innsbruck, Austria. eberhard.gunsilius@uibk.ac.at']",,,,"['Lancet. 2000 May 13;355(9216):1659-60.

Lymphoproliferative disorders are reportedly caused mainly by reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and non-EBV-associated secondary lymphoma or leukemia. In this paper, we report massive proliferation of CD4+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood of a patient with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) from an HLA-identical sibling donor. The abnormal lymphocytes showed CD3low, CD4+, CD8-, CD2+, CD5+, CD7+, CD25-, CD19-, CD20-, CD21-, CD16-, CD56low, T-cell receptor (TCR)-alpha/beta- and TCR-gamma/delta- phenotypes, and no rearrangement of either TCR-C beta 1 or IG(H)JH was detected from the lymphocytes by Southern blot analysis. EBV was not found in the nuclei of lymphocytes by an immunofluorescence antibody. The lymphoproliferation was resistant against immunosuppressive drugs, administered for the treatment of chronic GVHD, and it effectively inhibited aggravation of the chronic GVHD. Although antithymocyte globulin and cytosine arabinoside were administered later, the patient died of respiratory failure with bilateral pleural effusion and interstitial pneumonia. Because we found no evidence of monoclonality of the abnormal lymphocytes, we could not conclude that this patient had suffered from malignant lymphoproliferation. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of proliferation of CD4+ lymphocytes in a patient with chronic GVHD following alloBMT. In this paper, we discuss the possible pathophysiology of the patient.","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan. shashino@med.hokudai.ac.jp']","['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These developmental processes can also be distinguished by the expression of specific cell-surface markers. Therefore, rearrangement of the Ig, T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, and surface markers are generally considered as useful markers of the B- and T-cell lineage in lymphoproliferative disorders. However, concomitant rearrangement of Ig and TCR genes (double genotype) has been reported in the most immature lymphoid malignancies (lineage promiscuity), mainly in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL), but the mechanism is not fully understood. DNA rearrangements and specific cell-surface markers are regulated by several specific transcription factors. To better characterize the lineage promiscuity, we studied the relationship among the expression of lymphoid-associated transcription factors, phenotype, and immunogenotype. Rearrangement of the Ig light chain kappa gene was found in 37% of pre-B ALL samples and in all B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) samples. Rearrangement of TCR gamma gene was shown in 40% of pre-B ALL samples but was not detected in any of the B-CLL samples. Among the tested B cell-associated transcription factors, Pax5 and E47 genes were expressed in all pre-B ALL and B-CLL samples. RAG-1 gene was expressed in all pre-B ALL samples but not in the B-CLL samples. Oct-2 gene was expressed in 82% of pre-B ALL and all B-CLL samples. The expression of PU.1 gene was shown in 56% of pre-B ALL but not in the B-CLL samples. Interestingly, the samples of pre-B ALL, which did not express the PU.1 gene, showed a significantly high frequency of TCR gamma gene rearrangement. This phenomenon was not found with Oct-2 gene expression. These findings suggest that absence of PU.1 expression may result in lineage promiscuity, such as the simultaneous rearrangements of Ig and TCR genes in pre-B ALL cells.","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan. kaz@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp']","['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to improve the survival of patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), or acute myelogenous leukemia transformed from MDS (MDS-AML), we conducted a small trial in which 28 such patients were treated with low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LDAraC) followed by administration of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The overall rate of response to the treatment was 61%, including 39% with a complete response, which is higher than rates obtained in previous studies in which LDAraC alone was administered to patients with MDS. Median survival was 23.5 months in cases of RAEB, 16.7 months in cases of RAEB-t, and 19.7 months in cases of MDS-AML. The overall survival of the study group appeared to be prolonged in comparison with a historical control group of patients treated with LDAraC alone.

We investigated the biochemical signal transduction pathways, in particular, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of caspases in dexamethasone (DEX)-induced apoptosis of eosinophils, and we compared them with those in DEX-sensitive myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cell lines. The GC-receptor antagonist completely abolished DEX-induced apoptosis of eosinophils and leukemia cells. Among inhibitors related to the ROS system, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide diphosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor, strongly inhibited both spontaneous and DEX-induced apoptosis of eosinophils at concentrations as low as 0.2 to 2 mumol/L, while promoting apoptosis of leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner. Apocynin, another NADPH oxidase inhibitor, and antioxidants did not affect the apoptosis of eosinophils or leukemia cells. DEX treatment did not change intracellular production of O2- and H2O2, and it decreased the extracellular release of O2- in both cells. These results suggest little or no involvement of ROS generation in DEX-induced apoptosis of both cells. Although among peptide-based caspase inhibitors, only z-VAD-FMK, a broad caspase inhibitor, partially inhibited the apoptosis of eosinophils and leukemia cells, DEX treatment increased the activities of caspases 2-, 3-, 6-, and 8-like proteases assessed by colorimetry in both cells, suggesting the involvement of a similar caspase activation pathway in DEX-induced apoptosis in both cells. DPI markedly reduced caspase 3-like activity in eosinophils, while augmenting the activity in leukemia cells, indicating that DPI acts upstream of caspase 3 activation opposingly in both cells. Thus, the action of DPI in eosinophils seems peculiar in respect to apoptosis induction, and DPI appears to exert an influence on unknown targets rather than those involved in NADPH oxidase inhibition.","['Department of Hematology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.']","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6HJ411TU98 (diphenyleneiodonium)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, cytogenetic analyses and the molecular characterization of chromosomal breakpoints in patients with acute leukemia have proven that homeobox (HOX) genes, an evolutionarily highly conserved family of transcription factors, are critically involved in human leukemogenesis. HOX genes themselves, as well as their upstream regulators and cofactors, are implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia, and experimental models using knock-in strategies or retrovirally induced overexpression of candidate genes have shown the leukemogenicity of homeobox genes.

We examined whether CT-1 plays a role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in carnitine-deficient juvenile visceral steatosis (JVS) mice. The CT-1 mRNA level was quantitatively measured by the competitive RT-PCR method. In contrast to other models including spontaneously hypertensive rats, CT-1 mRNA in the ventricles of JVS mice was comparable to the control at 5 days and was less than half the control value at 2 and 8 weeks when the ventricles of the JVS mice were highly hypertrophied. There were no significant differences in CT-1 mRNA levels in the lung, liver, kidney, small intestine and skeletal muscle between the JVS and control mice at 2 weeks. We did not find any difference between JVS and control mice at 2 weeks in the mRNA level of ventricular leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which binds to the same receptor as CT-1. Furthermore, almost no phosphorylated STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), downstream of the LIF receptor and the gp130 signaling subunit, was observed in the ventricles of JVS and control mice. These data show that the CT-1 signaling pathway does not play a significant role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in JVS mice. Furthermore, we could not detect any differences in insulin-like growth factor I and II mRNA levels. All these data suggest distinct differences in the mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy between JVS mice and other model animals.","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'S7UI8SM58A (Carnitine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of our study was to describe the risk of leukemia following radiotherapy and chemotherapy for testicular cancer. METHODS: Within a population-based cohort of 18 567 patients diagnosed with testicular cancer (from 1970 through 1993), a case-control study of leukemia was undertaken. Radiation dose to active bone marrow and type and cumulative amount of cytotoxic drugs were compared between 36 men who developed leukemia and 106 matched control patients without leukemia. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk of leukemia associated with specific treatments. All P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Radiotherapy (mean dose to active bone marrow, 12.6 Gy) without chemotherapy was associated with a threefold elevated risk of leukemia. Risk increased with increasing dose of radiation to active bone marrow (P for trend =.02), with patients receiving radiotherapy to the chest as well as to the abdominal/pelvic fields accounting for much of the risk at higher doses. Radiation dose to active bone marrow and the cumulative dose of cisplatin (P for trend =.001) were both predictive of excess leukemia risk in a model adjusted for all treatment variables. The estimated relative risk of leukemia at a cumulative dose of 650 mg cisplatin, which is commonly administered in current testicular cancer treatment regimens, was 3.2 (95% confidence interval = 1.5-8.4); larger doses (1000 mg) were linked with statistically significant sixfold increased risks. CONCLUSIONS: Past treatments for testicular cancer are associated with an increased risk of leukemia, with evidence for dose-response relationships for both radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Statistically nonsignificant excesses are estimated for current radiotherapy regimens limited to the abdomen and pelvis: Among 10 000 patients given a treatment dose of 25 Gy and followed for 15 years, an excess of nine leukemias is predicted; cisplatin-based chemotherapy (dose, 650 mg) might result in 16 cases of leukemia. The survival advantage provided by current radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens for testicular cancer far exceeds the small absolute risk of leukemia.","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to determine whether 50 Hz magnetic fields can alter the progression of leukaemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A well-characterized model of transplantable acute myeloid leukaemia in rats was used for the first time. This model is closely related to human acute myeloid leukaemia, the type most frequently reported in epidemiological studies of adults. After leukaemic cell implantation, rats were exposed to a sinusoidal 50 Hz MF of 100 microT for 18 h a day, 7 days a week, throughout leukaemia progression. The parameters investigated were: survival time, body weight, haematologic parameters, infiltration of blood, bone marrow, spleen and liver by leukaemic cells. RESULTS: The results showed no significant changes (p > 0.05) in leukaemic MF-exposed versus unexposed rats for any of the parameters involved in leukaemia progression. CONCLUSION: These data do not support the hypothesis that 50 Hz magnetic fields influence leukaemia progression in humans.","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Universite Rene Descartes, Paris, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primates are susceptible to viruses of genera HTLV (humans) and STLV (other primates). The high degree of homology in genomic arrangement of HTLV and STLV is probably due to the existence of a common simian ancestor. Most infections are asymptomatic but a few cases exhibit blood diseases, e.g., T-lymphoma or T-cell leukemia, or neurologic disease, mainly, HTLV-1 associated myelopathy and tropical spastic paraparesia (HAM-TSP). The four major modes of viral transmission are vertical transmission from mother to child either in utero or, more commonly, during breastfeeding, sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, and intravenous drug use. Geographic distribution of HTLV-1 and its confinement to a few well-defined ecosystems have yet to be explained. Diagnosis is now easy and can reduce transmission by intravenous drugs use. Development of a vaccine seems possible given the low genetic variability of this virus.","['Centre International de Recherche Medicale de Franceville, Gabon. mgeorges@lyon151.inserm.fr']",,48,,,,,HTLV-1 dans le temps et dans l'espace.,,,,,,,,,,

The rate of thromboembolic complications, expressed as the number of events per 100 patient years, was 16.7 for patients with PV, 13.8 for OMF, and 7.5 for ET. Fifty-four percent of thromboembolic events in PV involved cerebral or limb arteries. The rate of bleeding complications was highest in patients with OMF (31.8 per 100 patient years), followed by ET and PV (11.8). Ninety percent of bleeding episodes affected the skin. mucosal membranes, and the gastrointestinal tract. Eight-year survival was highest in ET with 91 +/- 17%, followed by PV (66 +/- 18%) and OMF (40 +/- 31%) (P< 0.01). Twenty-four patients died during the observation period, and fatal thrombosis (in five patients) represented the leading cause of death. Only two patients with MPD died from fatal hemorrhage and one from acute leukemia. We conclude that survival is highest in ET and lowest in OMF. Both thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications are frequent. However, thrombosis appears to be more often fatal than bleeding complications.

Thus, in contrast to the heterogeneity in the expression of CD45RO in B-CLL, the majority of the cells contained the CD45 mRNA splice product coding for CD45RO. Analysis of splice products of the CD45 mRNA may serve as an additional tool to differentiate CLL from the leukemic phase of NHL.","['Hubert H.

The combined effects of the macrolide antibiotics erythromycin, josamycin, clarithromycin and YM17K (3,4'-dideoxy mycaminosyl tylonolide hydrochloride) on in vitro intracellular accumulation of vinblastine or cyclosporine (Cs)A and on the in vivo antitumour activity of vinblastine were investigated using mouse leukaemia P388 cells (P388/S) and anticancer drug-resistant (P388/ADR) cells. These effects were compared with those of a calcium antagonist (verapamil) or immunosuppressants (FK506 and CsA). 2. All tested macrolide antibiotics increased the accumulation of both vinblastine and CsA in P388/ADR cells in a dose-dependent manner, but their potency was lower than that of verapamil, CsA or FK506. 3. When vinblastine (200 microg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally with each of the macrolide antibiotics (10 or 100 mg/kg) or with verapamil (25 mg/kg) once a day for 10 days in P388/ADR-bearing mice, combined effects of vinblastine with the macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin and YM17K) or verapamil were observed. 4. The present study suggests that macrolide antibiotics may overcome anticancer drug resistance by inhibiting the binding of vinblastine or CsA to P-glycoprotein in P388/ADR cells. 5. We believe that these results are encouraging for combination chemotherapy to overcome P-glycoprotein-dependent anticancer drug-resistant tumours in clinical practice.","['Department of Medical Technology, Nagoya University School of Health Sciences, Japan.']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Macrolides)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro cytotoxic and lytic activity of short mammalian-derived extended-helical cationic peptides and insect-derived alpha-helical peptides was measured in this study with the objective of establishing the anticancer potential of these agents. Two specific aims were addressed: (i) to assess the activity of peptides against non-malignant cells (sheep erythrocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells) versus tumor cells; and (ii) to characterize the cytotoxic activity using multidrug-resistant tumor cell lines in the presence and absence of the anthracycline doxorubicin. Cell lysis assays demonstrated that the lytic activity of the peptides tested was 2->50 times more cytotoxic to tumor cells than to non-malignant cells. Further, the cytotoxic activity of these peptides was equivalent when tested against sensitive and multidrug-resistant cell lines.

In leukemia cells from 12/19 patients and in ovarian carcinoma cells from 2/4 patients, novobiocin, in a concentration range of 150-1000 microM, increased the intracellular accumulation of VP-16 by 30-250% by inhibiting its efflux. Novobiocin did not significantly increase the intracellular concentration of VP-16 in human mononuclear bone marrow cells from two individuals with normal bone marrow, suggesting that it might be possible to selectively modulate the intracellular accumulation of the epipodophyllotoxin in tumor cells relative to normal hematopoietic tissue. Previous findings from our laboratory have provided evidence that the membrane transporter for VP-16 which is inhibited by novobiocin is distinct from the P-glycoprotein. The expression of MRP, measured by immunoblotting, was variable in novobiocin-responsive and non-responsive leukemia cells, indicating that no direct relationship existed between the modulatory activity of novobiocin on the transport of VP-16 and the expression of the MRP gene.

The highest number of hybridomas was produced with SOC; however, the majority of the hybridomas produced (> 90%) were against cellular proteins. Even though immunization with PV gave the lowest number of hybridomas, the majority of them were specific against BLV. Based on the reactivity of the mAbs in Western blot (WB), we classified the mAbs into five groups, namely anti-gp51SU (39 mAbs), anti-gp30TM (six mAbs), anti-Pr72env (nine mAbs), anti-Pr66gag-pro (one mAb) and anti-Prgag (four mAbs). A very high percentage of the mAbs produced (48 of 59) reacted with gp51SU, suggesting that this is the most immunogenic and accessible BLV protein presented in the different antigen preparations. The majority of our mAbs recognized more than one band in WB, suggesting that, aside from reacting with mature proteins, the mAbs also recognized viral precursors.","['Departamento de Patologia Animal I, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The comparison of the previously published BLV provirus sequence from Belgium, Australia and Japan showed that the protease gene (prt) of the Australian and the Japanese isolate contain a nucleotide deletion when compared to the Belgian isolate. Because all these proviruses were isolated from tumour tissue, the prt gene of functionally active and infectious proviruses from peripheral blood leucocytes (PBLs) of BLV-infected cattle and from BLV-infected fetal lamb kidney cells were sequenced. The only variations between these sequences and the Belgian isolate consist of nucleotide substitutions. The delection of one nucleotide of the prt gene of the Japanese and the Australian BLV tumour isolate caused a changed reading frame and a premature translational stop. It was shown that the Japanese provirus is non-infectious in transfected cell culture and in injected sheep. To analyse the impact of the prt mutation on viral protein expression and infectivity, the prt region of the Japanese provirus was exchanged with the prt region from the Belgian provirus. The resulting pBLVprtbelg was infectious in transfected cells and enabled the expression of gag and gag-precursor proteins. One sheep was injected with this mutated provirus and became positive in BLV-PCR, but no seroconversion was developed. The prt mutation of the Japanese tumour isolates was shown to be responsible for the loss of infectivity and changed viral expression. These results and the occurrence of this mutation in only two isolates from lymphosarcoma indicate a possible relation between the prt mutation and the induction of cell transformation.","['Institute of Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Free University Berlin, Germany.']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Miura et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274, 16392). To assess whether the antagonistic actions of TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 in HL-60 cells are related to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) breakdown, we investigated their effects on catabolism of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). In HL-60 cells, the C-24 but not the C-23 side-chain oxidation pathway of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) has been reported. Here we demonstrate that 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) was metabolized both to 24,25,26,27-tetranor-1alpha,23-(OH)(2)D(3) and 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)-26,23-lactone; thus HL-60 cells constitutively possess both the 24- and the 23-hydroxylases. Metabolism of 1alpha, 25(OH)(2)D(3) was strongly suppressed by 10(-7) M TEI-9647 or 10(-6) M TEI-9648. 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) alone slightly induced 24-hydroxylase gene expression by 8 h with full enhancement by 24-48 h; this induction was inhibited by 10(-6) M TEI-9647 and 10(-6) M TEI-9648 (86.2 and 31.9%, respectively) 24 h after treatment. However, analogs of TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 without the 25-dehydro functionality induced 24-hydroxylase gene expression. These results indicate that TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 clearly mediate their stereoselective antagonistic actions independent of their actions to block the catabolism of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). Therefore, TEI-9647 and TEI-9648 appear to be the first antagonists specific for the nuclear 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) receptor-mediated genomic actions of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in HL-60 cells.","['Department of Bone and Calcium Metabolism, Safety Research Department, Teijin Institute for Bio-Medical Research, 4-3-2 Asahigaoka, Hino, Tokyo, 191-8512, Japan.']","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (TEI 9647)', '81203-50-1 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of interest, OSM has functional effects within the CNS. We have shown recently that OSM can modulate expression of the cytokine IL-6 in astrocytes. Herein we characterize the molecular mechanisms and signaling cascades involved in this response. OSM induces IL-6 protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in astrocytes. In addition, OSM can synergize with the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, and transforming growth factor-beta for enhanced IL-6 expression. Using neutralizing antibodies to gp 130, the OSM receptor (OSMR), and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), we document that OSM exclusively uses the OSMR/gp 130 heterodimer in signaling events, rather than the LIFR/gp 130 heterodimer. Kinetic analysis of OSM-induced IL-6 mRNA reveals two up-regulatory events. The first, peaking at 1 h, is transient, does not require protein synthesis, and is regulated at the transcriptional level. The second, peaking between 6 and 8 h, is prolonged and sensitive to puromycin, suggesting a requirement for de novo protein synthesis, and also is transcriptionally regulated. OSM-induced IL-6 mRNA and protein expression is inhibited by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors U0126 and SB202190, suggesting a requirement for the MAPKs ERK1/2 and p38 in this response. Finally, we show that the MAPKs ERK1/2 and p38 are activated by OSM in astrocytes and that this activation is reduced by the MAPK inhibitors. These data demonstrate that OSM induces IL-6 expression in astrocytes and that the MAPKs ERK1/2 and p38 participate in this response.","['Department of Cell Biology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,"['MH55795/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS929719/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM08111/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Stxs belong to a large family of ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) that are found in a variety of higher plants and some bacteria. Many RIPs have potent antiviral activity for the plants that synthesize them. STEC strains, both virulent and nonvirulent to humans, are frequently isolated from healthy cattle. Interestingly, despite intensive investigations, it is not known why cattle carry STEC. We tested the hypothesis that Stx has antiviral properties for bovine viruses by assessing the impact of Stx type 1 (Stx1) on bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from cows infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV). PBMC from BLV-positive animals invariably displayed spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation (SLP) in vitro. Stx1 or the toxin A subunit (Stx1A) strongly inhibited SLP. Toxin only weakly reduced the pokeweed mitogen- or interleukin-2-induced proliferation of PBMC from normal (BLV-negative) cows and had no effect on concanavalin A-induced proliferation. The toxin activity in PBMC from BLV-positive cattle was selective for viral SLP and did not abrogate cell response to pokeweed mitogen- or interleukin-2-induced proliferation. Antibody to virus or Stx1A was most effective at inhibiting SLP if administered at the start of cell culture, indicating that both reagents likely interfere with BLV-dependent initiation of SLP. Stx1A inhibited expression of BLV p24 protein by PBMC.

These studies were designed to evaluate the conditions that influence transduction frequency of CD34(+) progenitors, with the goal of optimizing efficiency of stable gene transfer with lentiviral vectors. CD34(+) human cord blood cells and 293 cells were transduced with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 derived lentiviral vector pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein and carrying an internal human cytomegalovirus promoter driving enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of eGFP, we observed pseudotransduction beginning at the time of vector addition and lasting up to 24 h in CD34(+) cells and up to 72 h in 293 cells. Integrase-defective lentiviral vector caused transient eGFP expression for up to 10 days in CD34(+) cells and for up to 14 days in 293 cells. Protamine sulfate conferred no increase in transduction efficiency of CD34(+) cells on fibronectin-coated plates. Transduction frequency was related directly to vector concentration and not to multiplicity of infection across the ranges tested. First- and second-generation lentiviral vectors transduced CD34(+) cells equally, demonstrating a lack of dependence on HIV-1 accessory proteins. These findings will be useful for the optimal utilization of this new class of vectors for transduction of human hematopoietic stem cells.","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Southern California Medical School, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Heparin Antagonists)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protamines)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,"['1P50HL54850/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK54567/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK56287/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The computer wire coding method used a geographic information system approach with data on the local distribution electric system and from tax assessor records. Individual residences were represented as a circle scaled to the ground floor area of the residence and centered on the lot centroid. The wire code of the residence was determined from the distance between the circle and the relevant power line, and from the current carrying capacity of that line. Using this method, wire codes were generated for 238 290 residences built before 1986, the time of the Savitz et al. study, in the Denver metropolitan area. We then attempted to reconstruct the 1985 population of hypothetically eligible control children in the Denver metropolitan area by using 1980 census data. Since data were not available to locate the children in each residence within a census block, uniform, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions were used to randomly assign children to residences. To evaluate the likelihood of the wire code distribution of the controls selected by Savitz et al., 100 random trials were conducted for each distribution, matching two controls to each case. The odds ratios between childhood cancer and very high current configuration (VHCC) wire codes were reduced when the assigned controls were used, suggesting control selection bias may have been present. However, control selection bias is unlikely to account for all the reported association between childhood cancer and wire codes in the Savitz et al. study.","['EPRI, Palo Alto, CA 94303-0813, USA. krisebi@epri.com']",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All 700 patients with these diseases who had been counselled at the Tumour Ambulance of Community Hospital Herdecke since the foundation of the unit were included in a retrospective questionnaire study to collect information on the course of the disease and the survival time. Therapy with mistletoe extracts had been recommended to all patients. The treatment was carried out by the patient's physician outside the hospital. For inclusion into further analysis, information on survival time and mistletoe treatment had to be available. Survival times of patients who had actually received the recommended mistletoe treatment and of patients who had not received the recommended mistletoe treatment were compared (internal comparison). Furthermore, the results were compared to those of conventionally treated patients obtained from the literature (literature comparison). RESULTS: Of 237 patients for whom sufficient data was available, 14 had not been treated with a mistletoe extract. The median survival time was 9.18 years among patients who had received mistletoe compared to 7.54 years among those without. Before a statistical test was carried out, the equivalent distribution of diagnosis in the 2 groups was tested. Regarding this criterion, only 205 patients treated with mistletoe extract and 9 patients not treated with mistletoe extract could be included into the statistical tests of the median survival time. The median survival time was 11.4 years (mistletoe patients) and 8.6 years (patients without mistletoe therapy). The difference was not significant. There were no cases in which mistletoe treatment was associated with deterioration. The comparison with data from the literature yielded very similar survival times among patients not treated with mistletoe extract and those included in our study. CONCLUSION: No indications to risks of a mistletoe therapy on progress of the disease and the survival time could be found. Therefore, no ethical reservations should be opposed to future prospective investigations of mistletoe therapy in patients with malignant haematological diseases.","['Krebsforschung Herdecke e.V., Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus Herdecke.']",['0 (Plant Extracts)'],,"['Copyright 2000 S.

In the present study the two transcripts, detected by RT-PCR in 88 consecutive unselected CML patients, were correlated with haematological findings at diagnosis and with the megakaryocyte size and frequency by morphometric evaluation of 45 bone marrow biopsies. The secondary structure prediction and hydrophobicity of the b2a2 and b3a2 type BCR/ABL protein were also obtained. The prediction results for the b3 exon amino acids using GOR IV and NnPredict methods showed a short beta strand corresponding to the hydrophobic portion of the peptide.

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized comparative study. SETTING: Academic research environment. ANIMAL(S): Normally cycling rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys. INTERVENTION(S): Monkeys (5 per control or treatment group) received 0.03 mg of mifepristone in vehicle (sesame oil) per kilogram of body weight or vehicle daily from day 2 of the menstrual cycle to 7 days after the midcycle E2 surge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) levels; endometrial staging and immunoreactivity of leukemia inhibitory factor and interleukin-6 performed on fixed endometrial tissues; and relative abundance of endometrial estrogen and P receptor mRNA evaluated with semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in which cyclophilin mRNA, a housekeeping gene product, was coamplified as the reference standard. RESULT(S): Mifepristone at 0.03 mg/kg/d induced a delay in the endometrial cycle with a shift from the late to midsecretory phase. This treatment regimen did not suppress the midcycle gonadotropin surge or, presumably, ovulation because P levels were normal during the midluteal phase. The staining intensity of leukemia inhibitory factor and interleukin-6 was dependent upon the endometrial stage and was decreased in treated monkeys. E and P receptor mRNAs increased significantly with mifepristone treatment compared with controls, another indication of delayed uterine staging. CONCLUSION(S): Mifepristone at 0.03 mg/kg/d had no antiovulatory effect but delayed development of the endometrium from the late to midsecretory phase.

In vivo and in vitro studies in animals and humans have shown that the action of the drug is based on the modulation of the host immune response, and it has been found to upregulate interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, and IL-8. These immunomodulatory effects of the compound may explain its stimulation on T helper cells and natural killer cells. Following earlier findings that OM-85 BV induces the synthesis of IL-6, a study was undertaken to investigate its possible effect on other gp130 binding cytokines including IL-11, IL-12, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), and ciliary neutrophil factor (CNTF). Its modulation of the corresponding receptors of the above mentioned cytokines and of the signal transducer gp130 in human pulmonary fibroblasts and peripheral blood lymphocytes was also studied. METHODS: Transcription of cytokines was assessed by Northern blot analysis. Secretion of cytokines was analysed using commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits. Cytokine receptors and gp130 proteins were determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: OM-85 BV increased the expression of IL-11 in human lung fibroblasts, but not in lymphocytes, in a dose and time dependent manner by maximal fivefold within 20 hours. The compound inhibited serum induced IL-12 expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes but did not induce OSM, LIF, or CNTF at any concentration. In lung fibroblasts the expression of the IL-6 receptor was enhanced fourfold at a concentration of 10 microg/ml OM-85 BV while that of the IL-11 receptor was not altered. In peripheral blood lymphocytes LIF receptor alpha expression was downregulated in the presence of 10 microg/ml OM-85 BV. At a concentration of 10 microg/ml OM-85 BV enhanced gp130 gene transcription fivefold and increased gp130 protein accumulation in cell membranes by 2.5 times. CONCLUSION: In vitro OM-85 BV exerts immunomodulatory action via modulation of the signal transducer gp130 and gp130 binding cytokines. The increase of IL-6 and IL-11 may explain enhanced T and B cell activity, immunoglobulin synthesis, and IgM to IgG switch. Suppression of IL-12 and LIF receptor-alpha further contributes to organ protection. With regard to gp130 mediated signalling of the investigated cytokines, OM-85 BV modifies the host immune response towards an increased sensitisation of cells to gp130 binding proteins.","['Division of Pneumology, Departments of Research and Internal Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Hebelstrasse 20, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.']","['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Broncho-Vaxom)', '0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Inducers)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",,,,,PMC1745835,,,,,,,,,,,

GW1843-resistant cells displayed a approximately 100-fold resistance to GW1843 and methotrexate but were collaterally sensitive to the lipophilic antifolates trimetrexate and AG337, which enter cells by diffusion. These cells exhibited a 12-fold decreased methotrexate influx but surprisingly had a 2-fold decreased folic acid growth requirement. This was associated with a 4-fold increased influx of folic acid, a 3.5-fold increased steady-state level of folic acid, and a 2.3-fold expansion of the cellular folate pool. Characterization of the transport kinetic properties revealed that GW1843-resistant cells had the following alterations: (a) 11-fold decreased transport K(m) for folic acid; (b) 6-fold increased transport K(m) for GW1843; and (c) a slightly increased transport V(max) for folic acid. Sequence analysis showed that GW1843-resistant cells contained the mutations Val-29 --> Leu, Glu-45 --> Lys, and Ser-46 --> Ile in the first transmembrane domain of the reduced folate carrier. Transfection of the mutant-reduced folate carrier cDNA into methotrexate transport null cells conferred resistance to GW1843. This is the first demonstration of multiple mutations in a confined region of the human reduced folate carrier in an antifolate-resistant mutant. We conclude that certain amino acid residues in the first transmembrane domain play a key role in (anti)folate binding and in the conferring of drug resistance.","['Department of Biology, The Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel.']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoindoles)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '139987-54-5 (1843U89)', '4033-27-6 (dihydrofolate)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'K75ZUN743Q (nolatrexed)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of our study is to elucidate whether CT-1 affects the cardiovascular system in vivo. Intravenous injection of CT-1 (4-100 microg/kg) in conscious rats evoked significant declines in blood pressure and reflex increases in heart rate (HR) in a dose-dependent manner. CT-1 induced no significant change in cardiac output (from 260.7 +/- 11.0 to 264.7 +/- 26.6 ml. min(-1). kg(-1), P = not significant), which was compatible with the results from isolated perfused rat hearts; HR, change in pressure over time, left ventricular developed pressure, and perfusion pressure were unaffected. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed that CT-1 increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lung and aorta but not in heart or liver. Pretreatment with aminoguanidine, a specific iNOS inhibitor, inhibited both iNOS mRNA production and the depressor effect of CT-1. Interestingly, CT-1 increased ventricular expression of ANP and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The data demonstrate that CT-1 elicits its hypotensive effect via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism and that CT-1 induces ANP and BNP mRNA expression in vivo.","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan 606-8507.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, rat)', 'SCQ4EZQ113 (pimagedine)', 'V55S2QJN2X (NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to the onset of apoptosis, TGHQ depletes intracellular glutathione (GSH) in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-independent manner. Neutral, Mg(2+)-dependent sphingomyelinases, which are normally inhibited by GSH, are subsequently activated, as evidenced by increases in intracellular ceramide and depletion of sphingomyelin. As ceramide levels rise, effector caspase (DEVDase) activity steadily increases. Interestingly, while catalase has no effect on TGHQ-mediated depletion of GSH, this hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) scavenger does inhibit DEVDase activity and apoptosis, provided the enzyme is added to HL-60 cells before an increase in ceramide can be observed. Since ceramide analogues inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain, these data imply that ceramide-mediated generation of H(2)O(2) is necessary for the activation of effector caspases-3 and/or -7, and apoptosis. In summary, these studies indicate that TGHQ, and perhaps many quinol-based toxicants and chemotherapeutics, may induce apoptosis in hematopoietic cells by depleting GSH and inducing the proapoptotic ceramide-signaling pathway.","['Center for Molecular and Cellular Toxicology, Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Texas at Austin, 78712, USA.']","['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '119212-33-8 (2,3,5-(triglutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,,"['ES 07247/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 07784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome multidrug resistance, a diphtheria toxin fusion protein (DTIL3) was engineered by fusing the catalytic and translocation domains of diphtheria toxin (DT) to human interleukin-3 (IL-3). However, when blasts were isolated from patients and tested for colony growth inhibition by DTIL3, only a third of the samples showed sensitivity to the fusion protein. Prior to clinical development, we need to be able to identify which patients are likely to respond to therapy with DTIL3. In this report, we compared the inhibition of thymidine incorporation in human leukemia cell lines by DTIL3 to the IL-3 receptor number and affinity. We found DTIL3 was cytotoxic to four of the eight cell lines tested with half-maximal inhibition of thymidine incorporation (IC(50)) from 1 to 50 pM. The IL-3 receptor density for these cell lines ranged from 0 to 2635 receptors per cell. The dissociation constant for an IL-3 high-affinity receptor agonist was 0.5 nM for cell lines with receptors. We found a correlation for the cell lines between the presence of high-affinity IL-3 receptors and sensitivity to DTIL3 (p = 0.03). These results suggest the variability in sensitivity of patient leukemic progenitors to DTIL3 may be due in part to the presence or absence of high-affinity IL-3 receptors.","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Wake Forest, North Carolina 27157, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (diphtheria toxin-interleukin-3 fusion protein, recombinant)']",,,,"['CA12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-76178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

High doses of unlabeled or labeled antibodies are necessary to saturate specific sites on normal B-cells. We thus developed a new targeting strategy, taking advantage of dual binding cooperativity, to enhance the specificity of the radioactive uptake by tumor cells. This approach was evaluated using human Burkitt lymphoma cells (Ramos) which express both CD10 and CD20 antigens. Most normal cells express at most one of these two differentiation antigens but many hematological tumors, including most human B type acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, express both. Cells pretargeted with two bispecific antibodies, one recognizing CD10 and a histamine derivative (HSG), the other recognizing CD20 and the DTPA-indium complex, bind cooperatively radiolabeled mixed-haptens (DTPA-HSG). Increased binding (about 5-fold compared to binding to only one of CD10 or CD20 antigens) is observed at 37 degrees C, demonstrating the feasibility of the technique. This binding enhancement is a slow process, not observed at 4 degrees C. Such a binding enhancement will increase specificity for targeting isotopes to double antigen positive tumor cells compared to nontumor tissue cells bearing only one of them. This approach might be used to increase tumor irradiation with minimal irradiation of normal cells.","['INSERM U.339, Faculte de Medecine et Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.']","['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MTX-resistant phenotype generally occurs as a consequence of DHFR gene amplification which in turn is responsible for DHFR gene overexpression. We have designed antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (aODNs) against the DHFR mRNA and tested their in vitro effect on human leukemia CCRF-CEM/E cells, overexpressing the DHFR gene about 20-fold in comparison with the CCRF-CEM/S parental cell line. An aODN complementary to a region encompassing the AUG translation start (DHFR1) of DHFR mRNA and a mixture of two aODNs complementary to the 5' untranslated region (DHFR2+DHFR3) have been used. A DHFR1 scrambled-sequence ODN and a fully degenerated ODN were the controls. All ODNs had a phosphodiester backbone. DHFR1 and the relevant scrambled ODN were also capped with two phosphorothioate derivatives at both the 5' and 3' ends in order to increase ODN stability against serum nucleases. ODNs were vehiculated with a cationic lipid, N-[1-(dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate (DOTAP), known to enhance ODN cell uptake and biological activity. The effects of ODNs on DHFR gene expression were studied after a 4 day treatment by measuring both DHFR mRNA levels, using a semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method, and DHFR protein levels by flow cytometry. A marked reduction in DHFR mRNA levels (79.7 and 74.2%, respectively) was observed with both DHFR1 and DHFR2+DHFR3 aODNs, associated with a lower decrease in DHFR enzyme (44.8 and 61%, respectively). aODN effects on MTX cytotoxicity in CCRF-CEM/E cells were also assessed. No marked enhancement of in vitro MTX cytotoxicity was observed following co-exposure of cells with aODNs and the tested concentrations of the antifol (0.05 and 0.5 microM), indicating that no substantial reversal of the MTX-resistant phenotype was induced by the study aODNs.","['Dipartimento di Farmacologia Preclinica e Clinica, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Italy.']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early Phase II studies and the development of peripheral blood stem cell support to enable safe and tolerable myeloablative chemotherapy has resulted in its controversial and widespread use in the management of breast carcinoma. Recently, several randomized trials of both advanced breast carcinoma and the adjuvant setting have been reported. METHODS: The technical developments in HDC and results from the randomized clinical trials reported to date were reviewed. RESULTS: Three randomized trials of advanced breast carcinoma and five of high risk adjuvant patients were identified. Only two relatively small trials from South Africa have so far shown an advantage for high dose chemotherapy, and the validity of these trials has recently been seriously challenged. A Scandinavian adjuvant trial showed no advantage for HDC when compared with maximum nonablative doses supported with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Four trials were too small to detect clinically realistic differences in outcome, whereas the other large adjuvant trial was reported prematurely and the results in the HDC arm were dominated by high procedure-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to make specific treatment recommendations based on the conclusions from the currently available data. The 1999 American Society of Clinical Oncology reports were inconsistent and in some cases were presented before the results were sufficiently mature to provide statistically reliable data. However, it is clear that, unlike in leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, HDC in breast carcinoma should not be used outside the context of a clinical trial. The mature results of the ongoing trials are eagerly awaited, whereas the use of immediate as opposed to consolidation high dose treatment, tandem transplants, and developments in immunologic and genetic manipulation of the graft merit further evaluation.","['Yorkshire Cancer Research, Department of Clinical Oncology, Cancer Research Centre, Weston Park Hospital, Sheffield, England.']",,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is the causative agent in humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) and is frequently secreted from various kinds of solid tumors as well as from adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. PTHrP, like PTH, acts on PTH receptor type 1 (PTH1R). Activation of PTH1R may lead to stimulation of secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. It is expected, therefore, that PTHrP constitutes a key factor in the activation of the proinflammatory and cachectogenic cytokine network and consequently in the development of cachexia in patients with cancer. METHODS: Two groups of cancer-bearing patients of similar clinical backgrounds were enrolled. Plasma concentrations of PTHrP and cytokines were measured with immunoradiometric assay and radioimmunoassay, respectively. Cancer tissues from patients with HHM were transplanted into nude mice or nude rats. The effects of humanized antihuman PTHrP antibody were examined. RESULTS: In clinical studies, Group B patients (with elevated plasma PTHrP), compared with Group A patients (with normal plasma PTHrP), tended to exhibit higher plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (P = 0.13), interleukin (IL)-5 (P = 0.08), and IL-8 (P = 0.08), and had significantly higher levels of IL-6 (P = < or =0.01). The levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 correlated with those of PTHrP. In animal studies, the antibody caused a prompt and sustained decline in serum calcium. This response was accompanied by improvements in food intake, drinking, body weight gain, and general behavior. It also ameliorated the suppression of serum ADH. When those effects were compared with those induced either by bisphosphonate or calcitonin, it turned out that not all of the beneficial effects of the antibody were directly correlated with the depression of blood calcium. CONCLUSIONS: PTHrP is a promising molecular target for the development of a novel mode of treatment for patients with cancer-associated morbidity.","['Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the end of follow-up July 1995, 13 patients had relapsed (pEFS = 0.77). Weighted means of AT, WBC, and ANC during and after maintenance therapy (mAT, mWBCON, mWBCOFF, mANCON, mANCOFF), E-MTX (mE-MTX), and E-6TGN (mE-6TGN) were calculated, as well as the product of mE-MTX and mE-6TGN (mE-MTX*6TGN), as MTX and 6MP probably act synergistically. Beyond higher MTX and 6MP doses to patients with high mWBCON, neither mWBCON, (median 3.5 x 10(9)/L), mANCON, nor mAT was correlated with the dose of MTX and 6MP, mE-MTX, mE-6TGN, or risk of relapse. Patients with mE-MTX*6TGN above or below 828 (nmol/mmol Hb)2 (median value) had pEFS values of 0.84 and 0.70, respectively (P = .16). All 5 patients who relapsed during therapy had mE-MTX*6TGN < 828 (nmol/mmol Hb)2 (P = .03). mWBCOFF and the degree of myelosuppression (= mWBCSHIFT = mWBCOFF - mWBCON; median: 2.5 x 10(9)/L) were related to age (rs = -0.50, P = .001 and rs = -0.40, P = .006, respectively). All eight relapses off therapy occurred in patients with mWBCSHIFT < 2.5 x 10(9)/L (P = .02).

METHODS: DNA samples from 11 patients diagnosed with a T cell disease and 15 with no known T cell disorder were amplified using four multiplex T cell receptor gamma (TCR gamma) PCR reactions containing fluorescently labelled nucleotides. PCR products were analysed using both LIS-SSCP electrophoresis and an ABI 377 DNA sequencer using Genescan software. A Jurkat T cell leukaemia cell line was used to determine the sensitivity of the two methods. RESULTS: Clonal TCR gamma populations were detected in all 11 samples from patients with a T cell disease and no clonal populations were detected in samples from patients without a T cell disorder, using both LIS-SSCP and DNA sequencer analysis. Although the sensitivity of the two methods was comparable, the data generated by the sequencer were easier to interpret than the LIS-SSCP gels, and allowed accurate size determination of every product, which was not possible using LIS-SSCP. CONCLUSIONS: The use of fluorescent labelled nucleotides provides a more flexible and economical alternative to end labelled fluorescent primers for the detection of clonal TCR gamma gene rearrangements. This method allows clonal populations to be sized accurately and reproducibly, permitting the detection of identical clonal populations in different samples, and providing a method of monitoring disease progression and response to treatment.","['Department of Haematology, Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Healthcare Trust, UK. c.l.wickham@exeter.ac.uk']","['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,PMC1186922,,,,,,,,,,,

It has turned out, however, that immunosuppression is more important and myeloablation is not necessary for engraftment. At the same time, it is considered that the major anti-tumor effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation depends on the graft-versus-leukemia effect, not on the conditioning regimen itself. In patients with CML who relapsed after allogeneic transplantation, for example, infusion of donor lymphocytes can induce a second complete remission. Non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) was developed in the late 90s based on these theories. Low-dose, less toxic, so-called ""non-myeloablative"" preparative regimens have been designed not to eradicate the malignancies, but to provide sufficient immunosuppression to allow donor cells to engraft, while the graft-versus-malignancy effects eradicate the tumor. This strategy permits allogeneic transplantation to be used in patients who are not eligible for conventional, often myeloablative, transplantation because of advanced age or organ dysfunction. Non-myeloablative preparative regimens contain purine analogs, such as fludarabine or cladribine. The NST regimen being used at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, consists of cladribine (0.11 mg/kg x 6 days), busulfan (4 mg/kg x 2 days) and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/kg x 4 days). We enrolled 6 patients in this NST protocol so far: 1 with severe aplastic anemia (sibling-PBSCT), 2 with MDS-RA (1 for sibling-PBSCT and 1 for matched uBMT), 1 with AML-CR2 (matched uBMT), 1 with AML-CR3 (sibling-PBSCT), and 1 with relapsed AML (mismatched related PBSCT). All patients achieved engraftment within 14 days with complete donor chimerism.

Although the skin is involved in half of the reported EMD cases, the occurrence of cutaneous promyelocytic sarcoma (PS) has been described very rarely. We report here three cases of PS which have the peculiarity of appearing at sites of punctures for arterial and venous blood and marrow samples (sternal manubrium, antecubital fossa, wrist over the radial artery pulse, catheter insertion scar). At presentation, all patients had hyperleukocytosis and a morphologic diagnosis of microgranular acute promyelocytic leukemia variant confirmed at the genetic level by demonstration of the specific chromosomal translocation t(15;17). A BCR3 type PML/RARa transcript was documented in the two patients for whom diagnostic RT-PCR was available. Patients had morphologic bone marrow remission at the time the PS appeared. A predilection for the development of cutaneous PS at sites of previous vascular damage has been noted, but the pathogenesis remains largely unknown. A potential role for all-trans retinoic acid has been advocated, although one of the three patients in our series had received no ATRA. A review of the literature revealed six similar cases and hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis was a consistent finding in all of them. A careful physical examination of these particular sites in the follow-up of patients at risk, as well as cutaneous biopsy and laboratory examination of suspected lesions are strongly recommended.","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Av.

However, the exact prognostic significance of this resistance mechanism is still unclear, mostly due to methodologic problems in P-gp detection. We therefore investigated, whether P-gp expression levels or functional P-gp activity better predict response to induction chemotherapy, relapse rate and overall survival in acute leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined cell samples of 121 adults with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 102 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for P-gp expression and functional P-gp activity by flow cytometry. P-gp function was determined by the rhodamine 123 (rh123)-efflux test (AML n=121, ALL n=102) and P-gp expression levels using the P-gp specific monoclonal antibodies (moabs) MRK-16 (AML n=51, ALL n=31), 4.E3 (AML n=35, ALL n=32), or UIC-2 (AML n=68, ALL n=50). We correlated our findings with the immunophenotype, FAB morphology, cytogenetics and clinical data of the examined patients. RESULTS: P-gp expression levels as detected by MRK-16 and 4.E3 were very low and did not differ between AML and ALL as estimated using relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) values and D-values by Kolmogorow-Smirnov (KS) statistics. For moab UIC-2, P-gp expression levels were higher in AML than in ALL. Within AML, moab UIC-2 mainly reacted with myelomonocytic-differentiated leukemic cells of the FAB M4/5 subtypes. No correlation between P-gp expression levels as detected by MRK-16, 4.E3 or UIC-2 and the response to induction chemotherapy or relapse rate, both in AML and ALL, was observed. However, a prognostic impact of P-gp expression levels on overall survival in AML was seen for moab MRK-16. Moreover, within AML, P-gp function was higher in immature blast cells as defined by immunophenotype and FAB morphology and correlated with response to induction chemotherapy, relapse rate, overall survival as well as cytogenetic risk groups. In ALL, the overall functional P-gp activity was lower than in AML and did not correlate with immunophenotypical subgroups, response to induction chemotherapy, relapse rate or overall survival. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a prognostic impact of P-gp in AML but not ALL and indicate that the functional rh123-efflux assay should be preferred for flow-cytometric P-gp evaluation in acute leukemia compared with P-gp expression analysis by monoclonal antibodies.","['Robert-Rossle-Clinic, Charite Humboldt University of Berlin, Lindenberger Weg 80, 13125 Berlin, Germany. wuchter@rrk-berlin.de']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection before cytogenetic and hematologic relapse could be useful in early therapy. The most suitable methods for detecting MRD in Ph+ ALL are flow cytometry (FC) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, since both techniques carry the risk of false-negative results the combined use of these two techniques could overcome this problem. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report our experience using this approach in 47 bone marrow samples obtained from 10 Ph+ ALL patients. Twenty-seven marrow aspirates were taken from patients in clinical remission (CR). The samples were considered positive for MRD by FC when two conditions were met: 1) detection of an abnormal B-cell differentiation pattern and 2) presence of more than 1x10(-3) cells coexpressing CD22/CD34/CD45 or CD66/CD34/CD10. After FC analysis, RNA was purified using standard methods. RESULTS: FC was positive in 23/27 samples in CR (sensitivity 85%). RT-PCR was successfully performed in 23 samples in CR. RT-PCR was positive in 18/23 samples (sensitivity 78%). There were 5 samples with discordant results. FC was positive in 3 samples with a negative RT-PCR and FC was negative in 2 samples with a positive RT. All the 10 patients relapsed and only 1 is currently alive after an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). The median (range) time from MRD detection to relapse in patients treated with chemotherapy was 42 (39-71) days. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that RT-PCR may be negative despite the presence of neoplastic cells identified by their immunophenotypic traits. We conclude that immunologic and molecular techniques can be used in tandem for monitoring MRD in Ph+ ALL.","['Hematology Division, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the factors predicting relapse and the value of MRD monitoring by RT-PCR in a series of 16 patients with CBFb/MYH11-positive AML (15 M4Eo; 1 M4). Fifteen were newly diagnosed cases (CR1) and one was studied after first relapse (CR2). Eight patients had clinical relapse at 6 to 19 months from the achievement of CR. RESULTS: Presenting WBC count had a significant prognostic influence on disease-free survival (p=0.001). All four patients with a WBC count >100x10(9)/L relapsed, while only four additional relapses occurred among the eleven patients who had an initial WBC count below 100x10(9)/L. With regards to molecular monitoring, all relapses but one occurred in patients who showed persistent RT-PCR positivity during hematologic remission. By contrast, conversion to a repeatedly PCR-negative status was observed in the seven patients who remained in CR1 after a median follow-up of 48 months (range 31-79 months), as well as in the transplanted patient who was monitored in CR2. In these patients a PCR-positivity could be detected up to 24 months after diagnosis (median time to conversion to PCR-negative: 8 months). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, marked hyperleukocytosis (>100x10(9)/L) confers poor prognosis to the patient with CBFbeta/MYH11-positive AML. In addition, slow kinetics of molecular remission was observed in this subset of AML, but the CBFb/MYH11 fusion transcript is no longer detectable in long-term survivors, indicating that molecular remission is an important therapeutic goal.","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Av.

The incorporation of HIV Env and viral RNA genome was not greatly affected. The MAII was noninfectious or poorly infectious, however, when pseudotyped with an amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope protein or with the HIV envelope protein. Although the MAII mutant displayed an immunofluorescence staining pattern similar to that of the wild type virus, subcellular fractionation studies indicated that the membrane association of MAII Gag precursors was unstable under high-salt conditions. Electron microscopic studies showed that the mutant had a decreased density of particle cores compared with that of the wild type virus, suggesting an altered arrangement of the packed proteins.

One of the reasons is the lack of full understanding of the complexities of cellular pathways through which signals for differentiation lead to cell maturation. This was addressed in this study using HL60 cells, a well-established model of differentiation of neoplastic cells. SB 203580 and SB 202190, specific inhibitors of a signaling protein p38 MAP kinase, were found to markedly accelerate monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells induced by low concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D(3)). Surprisingly, inhibition of p38 activity resulted in sustained enhancement of p38 phosphorylation and of its in vitro activity in the absence of the inhibitor, indicating up-regulation of the upstream components of the p38 pathway. In addition, SB 203580 or SB 202190 treatment of HL60 cells resulted in a prolonged activation of the JNK and, to a lesser extent, the ERK pathways. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that in HL60 cells an interruption of a negative feedback loop from a p38 target activates a common regulator of multiple MAPK pathways. The possibility also exists that JNK and/or ERK pathways amplify a differentiation signal provided by 1,25D(3).","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, 185 S.

RES cells were characterized by their typical growth in highly compacted cell clusters, which were found to be sensitive against enzymatic dissociation. RES cells expressed stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) and transcription factor Oct-4, but Oct-4 mRNA was detected at lower levels compared to mouse ES cells. Once established to tissue culture, RES cells were able to grow in the absence of feeder cells under clonal conditions. Cytokines of the interleukin-6 family known to maintain the undifferentiated state of mouse ES cells were comparatively analyzed for their capacity to maintain the undifferentiated growth of two cell lines, RES-1 and RES-15, in a clonal assay. Rat ciliary neurotrophic factor (rCNTF), human oncostatin M (hOSM), and interleukin-6 and soluble interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6/sIL-6R) were found to support clonal growth of RES cells, but the cytokines did not reach the efficiency of the colony forming ability of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). When RES-1 and RES-15 cells were cultivated without feeder cells, SSEA-1 expression was maintained after clonal growth in the presence of LIF and LIF + rCNTF, respectively. Oct-4 mRNA was significantly detected in RES-15 cells when cultivated in the absence of feeder cells in media substituted by LIF and/or IL-6/sIL-6R, as well as without cytokines. In summary, rat embryonic stem-like cell lines could be established from rat blastocysts and were able to proliferate as undifferentiated alkaline phosphatase-positive cells. Embryonal stem cell properties, such as SSEA-1 and Oct-4 expression, were maintained by members of the IL-6 family of cytokines, but most significantly by LIF.","['In Vitro Differentiation Group, Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research Gatersleben, Gatersleben, D-06466, Germany.']","['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (POU5F1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elastase, derived from malignant promyelocytes, is believed to mediate the fibrinogeno- and fibrinolysis by aspecific proteolysis. In this study we measured the role of elastase in fifteen patients with APL by using an assay for elastase degraded fibrin(ogen) and the results were compared with those obtained in patients with sepsis induced DIC. High levels of elastase were observed in sepsis and APL. The levels of fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products were significantly higher in APL patients compared to patients with sepsis induced DIC. Nevertheless, the level of elastase degraded fibrin(ogen) was higher in the sepsis group (635.3 ng/ml, compared to 144.3 ng/ml in APL; p <0.0001). So, the enormous increase in fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products in APL cannot be explained by elastase activity.

The clinical infections due to Mucor include rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, gastrointestinal and disseminated diseases. The first two are the most common diseases and all entities are associated with a high mortality rate. Still hepatic involvement of Mucor is rarely reported. We experienced a case of hepatic and small bowel mucormycosis in a 56-year-old woman after induction chemotherapy for B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. Initial symptoms were a high fever unresponsive to broad spectrum antibiotics and pain in the left lower abdominal quadrant. It was followed by septic shock, deterioration of icterus and progressively elevated transaminase. An abdominal CT demonstrated multiple hypodense lesions with distinct margins in both lobes of liver and pericolic infiltration at small bowel and ascending colon. Diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy of the liver. The histopathology of the liver showed hyphae with the right-angle branching, typical of mucormycosis. The patient was managed with amphotericin B and operative correction of the perforated part of the small bowel was performed. However, the patient expired due to progressive hepatic failure despite corrective surgery and long-term amphotericin B therapy.","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",,,,,,PMC3054635,,,,,,,,,,,

We present the results of a 3-year prospective study to look at the clinico-haematologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular profile of 13 adult patients with Philadelphia (Ph) positive ALL out of 35 newly diagnosed ALL seen at our institution over the past 3 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five adult ALL patients seen between 1996 and 1998 comprised the study group. Marrow samples were obtained for immunophenotyping and karyotypic analysis at diagnosis. Samples were also obtained simultaneously for molecular testing for Ph chromosome. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were found to be Ph positive by molecular analysis while cytogenetic studies identified the chromosomal abnormality in 9 of these patients. The median age of our Ph positive patients was similar to those without Ph chromosome. Pre-B phenotype appears to be common in this group of patients. In concordance with other studies, Ph positive ALL was associated with a poor prognosis in our patients. CONCLUSION: Identification of Ph chromosome is important in the management of patients with ALL as it is an important prognostic marker.","['Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: Medline and non-Medline search of the literature; local data; and personal experience. STUDY SELECTION: Articles containing supportive scientific evidence were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and reviewed independently by the authors. DATA SYNTHESIS: Cancer is an uncommon disease in children, yet it is second only to accidents as a cause of death for children in many countries. Acute leukaemia is the most common type of malignancy encountered in children. The disease and its treatment can directly or indirectly affect the child's oral health and dental development. Any existing lesions that might have normally been dormant can also flare up and become life-threatening once the child is immunosuppressed. Proper oral care before, during, and after cancer therapy has been found to be effective in preventing and controlling such oral complications. CONCLUSION: Proper oral care for children with leukaemia is critical. Long-term follow-up of these children is also necessary to monitor their dental and orofacial growth.","['Tuen Mun School Dental Clinic, Department of Health, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong.']",,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These oncogenes are mutated or overexpressed in many human tumors, with a high incidence in tumors of the pancreas, thyroid, colon, lung and certain types of leukemia. Ras is a small guanine nucleotide binding protein that transduces biological information from the cell surface to cytoplasmic components within cells. The signal is transduced to the cell nucleus through second messengers, and it ultimately induces cell division. Oncogenic forms of p21(ras) lead to unregulated, sustained signaling through downstream effectors. The ras family of oncogenes is involved in the development of both primary tumors and metastases making it a good therapeutic target. Several therapeutic approaches to cancer have been developed pointing to reducing the altered gene product or to eliminating its biological function: (1) gene therapy with ribozymes, which are able to break down specific RNA sequences, or with antisense oligonucleotides, (2) immunotherapy through passive or active immunization protocols, and (3) inhibition of p21(ras) farnesylation either by inhibition of farnesyl transferase or synthesis inhibition of farnesyl moieties.","['Instituto de Genetica Experimental, Facultad de Ciencias Medicas, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Argentina. ogs@citynet.net.ar']",['EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))'],57,"['Copyright 2000 National Science Council, ROC and S.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with tumors appropriate for gemcitabine therapy and who had abnormal liver or renal function tests were eligible. Patients were assigned to one of three treatment cohorts: I-AST level less than or equal to two times normal and bilirubin level less than 1.6 mg/dL; II-bilirubin level 1.6 to 7.0 mg/dL; and III-creatinine level 1.6 to 5.0 mg/dL with normal liver function. Doses were explored in at least three patients within each cohort. Gemcitabine and its metabolite were to be measured in the blood in all patients. RESULTS: Forty patients were assessable for toxicity. Transient transaminase elevations were observed in many patients but were not dose limiting. Patients with AST elevations tolerated gemcitabine without increased toxicity, but patients with elevated bilirubin levels had significant deterioration in liver function after gemcitabine therapy. Patients with elevated creatinine levels had significant toxicity even at reduced doses of gemcitabine, including two instances of severe skin toxicity. There were no apparent pharmacokinetic differences among the three groups or compared with historical controls. CONCLUSION: If gemcitabine is used for patients with elevations in AST level, no dose reduction is necessary. Patients with elevated bilirubin levels have an increased risk of hepatic toxicity, and a dose reduction is recommended. Patients with elevated creatinine levels seem to have increased sensitivity to gemcitabine, but the data are not adequate to support a specific dosing recommendation.","['University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. venook@cc.ucsf.edu']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",,,,['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used a database developed by the University HealthSystems Consortium containing >1 million patients in 60 University Hospitals with diseases included in 486 diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). Laboratory costs included in the database comprised those associated with testing in the clinical laboratory together with those incurred in point-of-care testing and anatomic pathology but not those involving blood products and their transfusion. RESULTS: The mean laboratory costs to manage surgical patients were greater than those to manage medical patients in 19 of the 25 major diagnostic categories. The median laboratory costs for patients with liver transplants exceeded $8000, and the laboratory costs to support other organ transplants were among the highest. The highest proportion of total costs attributable to the laboratory was 18.3% for acute leukemia and kidney and urinary tract signs and symptoms, both in children. Laboratory costs were <1.0% of the total costs for only 15 DRGs. The highest median daily laboratory cost, $416, was attributable to liver transplant patients. Several conditions had median laboratory costs less than $30 per day, in spite of lengths of stay that exceeded 10 days in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although laboratory costs generally average 6% of the total costs for surgical conditions and 9% of the total costs for medical conditions, there is considerable variability. In general, laboratory costs were relatively poorly correlated with total costs. However, observation of high daily laboratory costs for many DRGs suggests that reducing length of stay would reduce both laboratory and total costs.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce St., Philadelphia, PA 19104-4283, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used an oligo(dT)-coated manifold support to capture the mRNA directly from the cell lysate. After reverse transcription, the cDNA was eluted from the manifold support, and BCR-ABL and GAPDH mRNAs were quantified in real time using the TaqMan fluorogenic detection system. RESULTS: The detection limit of the method was one positive K562 cell among 10(5) negative cells. GAPDH was chosen as a reference gene based on the low variation between samples from different stages of the disease and the low signal in the absence of reverse transcription. The day-to-day variation of the method (CV) was 32%. In 43 blood samples from 13 CML patients, mRNA quantification agreed well with cytogenetic data. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed procedure constitutes a reproducible and sensitive BCR-ABL mRNA quantification method and is suitable to monitor minimal residual disease in CML patients.","['Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, 75185 Uppsala, Sweden. gisela.barbany@medsci.uu.se']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assay allows discrimination between the amplification signals generated by genuine positive signals that result from retroviral RT activity and the RT-like activity from DNA polymerases. The RT-like activity from DNA polymerases was suppressed by the addition of activated calf-thymus DNA with no reduction in the RT activity. A linear relationship between threshold cycle (C(T)) and the number of virus particles was demonstrated, allowing quantification of retroviruses in unknown samples. The F-PERT assay was able to detect a wide range of retroviral RT activities, including that from porcine endogenous retrovirus (PoERV), murine leukaemia virus (MLV), simian foamy virus (SFV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) and squirrel monkey retrovirus (SMRV). The detection limit of SMRV, MLV and PoERV was approximately 100 virion particles and the test was able to detect at least 10(2) molecules of purified RT enzyme. RT activity was not detected in cellular lysates and supernatants from MRC-5, BT, VERO, or Raji cells, whereas RT activity was detected in C1271, Mus dunni, K-Balb, BHK-21, CHO-K1, SP2/0-Ag14 and NSO cell supernatants.

Although these techniques are sensitive, some slow growing hybridomas are identified as positive only when they are grown slowly long time. We standardized the dot-ELISA, a more sensitive technique, for the detection of antibodies against BLV. The main advantages of the dot-ELISA described in this study are (a) its sensitivity, detecting hybridomas which would otherwise be considered negative and discarded from the results of indirect ELISA and/or Western blot; and (b) the possibility of economizing reagents using as little as 1 microl of the antigen and 0.5 microl of antibody and conjugate. Different BLV-antigen preparations were bound to nitrocellulose membranes (NC), including cells lysed chemically (LYS) or by sonication (SOC), semi-purified virus (PV), and supernatant from infected cultures, either without treatment (SUP) or sonicated (SOS). The antigen preparations most adequate for detecting monoclonal antibodies against BLV and polyclonal antibodies in cattle sera were undiluted cell lysates (LYS) and semi-purified BLV (PV). When testing bovine sera, the supernatant (SUP) and sonicated supernatant (SOS) antigens gave a high background due to the presence of FCS which reacted with the anti-bovine labeled antibodies. In this study, 59 BLV specific antibody secreting hybridomas were identified using the dot-ELISA, compared to only 20 detected using iELISA, and doubtful reactions due to nonspecific binding to fetal calf serum (FCS) and cellular components were measured. The results of the improved dot-ELISA described may be stored at room temperature for future reference. Results were consistently reproducible in coated nitrocellulose membranes kept at different storage temperatures (-20 degrees C, 4 degrees C, and 25-30 degrees C) 48 h, 1 week and 5 months.","['Departamento de Patologia Animal I, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '9004-70-0 (Collodion)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Myrtaceae) is an antipyretic and anti-inflammatory herb of Asian folk medicine. A 70% acetone extract exerted the strongest cytotoxic effects on human leukemia cells (HL-60) from a preliminary screening of 15 plants. The cytotoxic principles were separated by bio-assay-guided fractionation to HL-60 cells; two hydrolyzable tannins (1-O-galloyl castalagin and casuarinin) were isolated from the 70% acetone extract. All significantly inhibited human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and showed less cytotoxicity to human adenocarcinoma cell line SK-HEP-1 and normal cell lines of human lymphocytes and Chang liver cells. Thus, these compounds were exhibited the dose-dependent manner in HL-60 cells and the IC(50) were 10.8 and 12.5 microM, respectively. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the presence of apoptotic cells with low DNA content, a decrease of cell population at G(2)/M phase, and a concomitant increase of cell population at G(1) phase. The apoptosis induced by these two compounds was also demonstrated by DNA fragmentation assay and microscopic observation. These results suggest that the cytotoxic mechanism of both antitumor principle constituents might be the induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Graduate Institute of Pharmacognosy Science, Taipei Medical College, Taiwan. llyang@tmc.edu.tw']","['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tannins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inversion of configuration at C-20 of the side chain to generate 20-epi-1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) (20E-125D) increases transcription 200-5000-fold over 125D with its 20-normal (20N) side chain. This enhancement has been attributed to the VDR ligand-binding domain (LBD) having different contact sites for 20N and 20E side chains that generate different VDR conformations. We synthesized 1alpha, 25-dihydroxy-21-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)vitamin D(3) (Gemini) with two six-carbon side chains (both 20N and 20E orientations). Energy minimization calculations indicate the Gemini side chain possesses significantly more energy minima than either 125D or 20E-125D (2346, 207, and 127 minima, respectively). We compared activities of 125D, 20E-125D, and Gemini, respectively, in several assays: binding to wild-type (100%, 147%, and 38%) and C-terminal-truncated mutant VDR; transcriptional activity (of the transfected osteopontin promoter in ROS 17/2.8 cells: ED(50) 10, 0.005, and 1.0 nM); mediation of conformational changes in VDR assessed by protease clipping (major trypsin-resistant fragment of 34, 34, and 28 kDa). For inhibition of cellular clonal growth of human leukemia (HL-60) and breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines, the ED(50)(125D)/ED(50)(Gem) was respectively 380 and 316. We conclude that while Gemini readily binds to the VDR and generates unique conformational changes, none of them is able to permit a superior gene transcription activity despite the presence of a 20E side chain.","['Departments of Biochemistry and Chemistry and Division of Biomedical Sciences, University of California, Riverside, California 92521, USA.

Treatment of APL patients with all-trans RA is commonly associated with leukocytosis, and approximately 50% of patients develop the RA syndrome. We reviewed our clinical experience with arsenic trioxide to determine the incidence of these two phenomena. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with relapsed or refractory APL were treated with arsenic trioxide for remission induction at daily doses that ranged from 0.06 to 0.17 mg/kg. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (88%) achieved complete remission. Leukocytosis was observed in 15 patients (58%). The median baseline leukocyte count for patients with leukocytosis was 3,900 cells/microL (range, 1,200 to 72,300 cells/microL), which was higher than that for patients who did not develop leukocytosis (2,100 cells/microL; range, 500 to 5,400 cells/microL; P =.01). No other cytotoxic therapy was administered, and the leukocytosis resolved in all cases. The RA syndrome was observed in eight patients (31%). Patients who developed leukocytosis were significantly more likely to develop the RA syndrome (P <.001), and no patient without a peak leukocyte count greater than 10,000 cells/microL developed the syndrome. Among the patients with leukocytosis, there was no observed relation between the leukocyte peak and the probability of developing the syndrome (P =.37). CONCLUSION: Induction therapy of APL with all-trans RA and arsenic trioxide is associated with leukocytosis and the RA syndrome. These clinical effects seem to be intrinsically related to the biologic responsiveness and the differentiation process induced by these new agents.","['Leukemia and Developmental Chemotherapy Services, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,['CA77136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we analyzed the nuclear distribution of the transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 in situ by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and in vivo complex formation by coimmunoprecipitation. A subpopulation of CBP and p300 is targeted to active sites of transcription and partially colocalizes with hyper- and hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II (pol II) in discrete regions of variable size throughout the nucleus. However, the coactivators were found in tight association with hypophosphorylated, but not hyperphosphorylated pol II. Transcriptional inhibition induced a relocation of CBP/p300 and pol II into speckles. Moreover, double and triple immunofluorescence analyses revealed the presence of CBP, p300, and pol II in a subset of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies. Our results provide evidence for a dynamic spacial link between coactivators of transcription and the basal transcription machinery in discrete nuclear domains dependent upon the transcriptional activity of the cell. The identification of pol II in CBP/PML-containing nuclear bodies supports the idea that transcription takes place at PML bodies.","['Junior Research Group of Molecular Cell Biology, Medizinisches Institut fur Umwelthygiene, Heinrich-Heine-Universat Dusseldorf, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.']","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",,,,,PMC2185550,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS: Unfractionated mouse peritoneal cells, purified rat peritoneal mast cells, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells of the C1.MC/C57.1 line (cultured mouse mast cells, CMMC) and rat basophilic leukemia cells of the RBL-2H3 line were used. METHODS: Mast cells were cultured with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-stimulated mouse peritoneal cells as a source of nitric oxide, or with the nitric oxide donor S-nitrosoglutathione (SNOG). After 24 h culture, the mast cells were challenged with anti-IgE, antigen, or calcium ionophore A23187, and degranulation measured as release of [3H]serotonin. RESULTS: Addition of IFN-gamma to mouse peritoneal cells led to nitric oxide synthesis and this was associated with decreased IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation. IFN-gamma did not induce nitric oxide production by CMMC and degranulation of CMMC was not inhibited by nitric oxide generated by co-cultured IFN-gamma-activated peritoneal cells. The nitric oxide donor SNOG inhibited degranulation of purified rat peritoneal mast cells, but not RBL-2H3 cells, stimulated by either IgE cross-linking or calcium ionophore. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibitory effects of nitric oxide on mast cell degranulation are variable and selective for phenotype.

Use of these classifications implies a new approach to lymphoma diagnosis, especially because of the inclusion of clinical data among which the site of involvement (nodal v extranodal) is very important. Recent technical advances allowing molecular biological investigations on the single cell level helped gain new insights into the cellular origin of B-cell lymphomas. Tumor cells of the majority of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) harbor somatically mutated immunoglobulin variable region genes, and are therefore derived from germinal center B cells or their descendants. The same is true for Hodgkin's disease, which (at least in the majority of cases) is a germinal center derived B-cell lymphoma. Significant news on the molecular pathogenesis of NHL include the prognostically relevant dichotomy of B-CLL, the involvement of translocations affecting 3q27 in 20% to 40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), the prognostical implication of the t(2;5) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and detection of the t(11;18) in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphoma. A major step forward with regard to gastric MALT-type lymphoma therapy was the discovery of a causal relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and lymphomagenesis.

This article reviews the conservation in structure and function of distinct receptors across different species and attempts to draw conclusions as to the evolution of this gene superfamily. Although sequences related to NRs can be found in plants and yeast, gene sequence analyses suggest that the NR ancestor(s) first appeared in the early metazoans and subsequently diversified into the six receptor sub-families, which were already recognisable at the time of the Arthropoda-Chordata split over 700 million years ago. At the time when a primitive NR emerged, the basic components of the transcription regulatory machinery, which are conserved from yeast to vertebrates, were already in place and the ancestral NR must have evolved with the ability to communicate with them. The first such NRs likely acted as monomers and in a ligand-independent fashion. As members of the NR superfamily acquired the ability to hetero- and homodimerise, and to bind and be regulated by ligands, the functional complexity of the NR superfamily increased. This exponentially increasing complexity subsequently provided a potential driving force for evolution of higher organisms by supplying a sophisticated regulatory gene network that could control complex physiological processes during development and in adult organisms.","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK.']","['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)']",155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown to have autocrine and paracrine functions in normal B cells and in B lymphoproliferative diseases. This study was conducted to determine the effect of TNF alpha (in vitro) on CD20 expression on cells from patients with B-CLL. Currently, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy is becoming a second line treatment in the management of B cell disorders like low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and B-CLL. Our results demonstrate amply that very low doses of TNF alpha (0. 0125 ng/ml) can be used to significantly increase CD20 expression on cells from patients of B-CLL as evidenced by increases in both percentage positivity and mean fluorescence intensity. The upregulation is evident as early as 24 hours and is maintained for up to 72 hours. We propose that the upregulation is a direct result of in vitro differentiation stimulated by TNF alpha. The results presented can be exploited in the designing of priming protocols prior to antibody therapy and this is discussed.","[""Rush Cancer Institute, Rush Presbyterian-St Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612-3750, USA. ssivaram@rush.edu""]","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['P0I CA 75606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We prospectively studied the effects of this therapy on adrenal function. STUDY DESIGN: Ten children with early B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia were evaluated by cosyntropin (corticotropin (1-24)) stimulation testing before initiation of dexamethasone therapy and every 4 weeks thereafter until adrenal function returned to normal. RESULTS: All 10 patients had normal adrenal function before dexamethasone treatment and insufficient adrenal responses 24 hours after completing therapy. Each child felt ill for 2 to 4 weeks after completing therapy. Although 7 patients recovered normal adrenal function after 4 weeks, 3 patients did not have normal adrenal function until 8 weeks after discontinuing therapy. Statistically significant differences in both basal and corticotropin-stimulated cortisol levels were noted when comparing tests performed at baseline, 24 hours after completing therapy, and 4 weeks after completing therapy. CONCLUSION: High-dose dexamethasone therapy, a standard treatment for early B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, can cause adrenal insufficiency lasting more than 4 weeks after cessation of treatment. This problem might be avoided by tapering doses of glucocorticoids and providing supplemental glucocorticoids during periods of increased stress.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75235-9063, USA.']","['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,['J Pediatr. 2000 Jul;137(1):3-4.

It is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, humoral and cellular immunodeficiencies and high incidence of neoplasia and radiosensitivity. A 5 year retrospective survey included 24 patients belonging to 17 families. Cerebellar ataxia was the first clinical symptom and was usually noticed when the child began to walk. Mean age of onset was 2.9+/-1.8 years. Oculocutaneous telangiectasia was present in 17 cases and appeared between 2 and 8 years and then spread in a characteristic symmetrical pattern. When ocular telangiectasia was absent (6 cases), the diagnostic of ataxia telangiectasia was retained on oculomotor apraxia (2 cases), recurrent sinopulmonary infections (3 cases) and/or a sib with typical ataxia telangiectasia (1 case). Recurrent sinopulmonary infections, absence or low serum level of IgA (78 p.100) and lymphopenia revealed immunodeficiency. Among 12 patients, chromosomal instability was observed in 5. Balanced rearrangements involving chromosomes 2, 7, 14, 22, 1, 3 and 11. The responsible gene, ATM, encodes a large protein kinase with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain. Ataxia telangiectasia patients have a 100 fold higher risk of cancer than the general population. We reported, in the same family two patients who developed neoplasia, (lymphoma and leukemia).

Tandem Maf recognition elements (MAREs) within the hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) subregion of the LCR are important for the strong enhancer activity of the LCR. Multiple proteins are capable of interacting with these sites in vitro, including the erythroid cell- and megakaryocyte-specific transcription factor, NF-E2. The importance of NF-E2 for beta-globin gene expression is evident in murine erythroleukemia cells lacking the p45 subunit of NF-E2. These CB3 cells have a severe defect in alpha- and beta-globin gene transcription, which can be restored by expression of NF-E2. However, mice nullizygous for p45 express nearly normal levels of beta-globin. Thus, either a redundant factor(s) exists in mice that can functionally replace NF-E2, or NF-E2 does not function through the LCR to regulate beta-globin gene expression. To address this issue, we asked whether NF-E2 binds directly to the tandem MAREs of HS2 in intact cells. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we provide evidence for NF-E2 binding directly and specifically to HS2 in living erythroleukemia cells and in mouse fetal liver. The specific immunoisolation of HS2 sequences was dependent on the presence of p45 and on intact MAREs within HS2.

Subclassification of T-ALL samples (n = 130) according to their in vitro IL-7 responses revealed that IL-7 refractory samples were more frequently positive for CD34 (P <.0001) and the myeloid-associated antigen CD33 (P =.01), whereas IL-7 responsiveness was associated with an expression of more mature differentiation-associated T-cell antigens (CD1a, surface CD3, CD4/8; P <.05). Furthermore, the extent of apoptosis inhibition by IL-7 in vitro quantitatively correlated with early cytoreduction as determined by the prednisone peripheral blood response on day 8 and cytoreduction in the marrow on day 15 (n = 87; P <.05). Multivariate analysis of the apoptosis-related parameters investigated, including spontaneous apoptosis, its inhibition by IL-7, and expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bax, showed that only IL-7 responsiveness has an independent impact on early cytoreduction (P <. 05), thus indicating a potential prognostic relevance of IL-7 sensitivity in T-ALL.","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, Robert-Rossle Clinic, Charite, Humboldt University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany. karawajew@rrkberlin.de']","['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this translocation, the AML1 (CBFA2/PEBP2aB) gene is disrupted and fused to the MTG8 (ETO) gene. The ectopic expression of the resulting AML1-MTG8 fusion gene product in L-G and 32Dcl3 murine myeloid precursor cells stimulates cell proliferation without inducing morphologic terminal differentiation into mature granulocytes in response to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). This study found that the ectopic expression of AML1-MTG8 elevates the expression of the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR). Analysis of the promoter region of the G-CSFR gene revealed that up-regulation of G-CSFR expression by AML1-MTG8 does not depend on the AML1-binding sequence, but on the C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein) binding site. The results suggest that the overproduction of G-CSFR is at least partly mediated by C/EBPepsilon, whose expression is activated by AML1-MTG8. The ectopic expression of G-CSFR in L-G cells induced cell proliferation in response to G-CSF, but did not inhibit cell differentiation into mature neutrophils. Overexpression of C/EBPepsilon in L-G cells also stimulated G-CSF-dependent cell proliferation. High expression levels of G-CSFR were also found in the leukemic cells of AML patients with t(8;21). Therefore, G-CSF-dependent cell proliferation of myeloid precursor cells may be implicated in leukemogenesis.","['Radiobiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan. kkikuchi@ncc.go.jp']","['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The control of apoptotic pathways has emerged as a critical step in the development of many cancer types. As a result, the underlying mechanism of long-term survival of HTLV-I and HTLV-II was studied in infected T cells in vitro and in ex vivo ATLL samples. Results indicate that HTLV-I- and HTLV-II-infected T cells in vitro express high levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl compared with other human leukemic T cell lines or uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The levels of proapoptotic proteins Bax, BAD, and Bak were not significantly altered. HTLV-I and HTLV-II viral transactivators, Tax1 and Tax2, are known to increase expression of cellular genes. These proteins were tested for increased transcription from the human Bcl2 and Bcl-X(L) promoters. Whereas no effect was observed on the Bcl2 promoter, both Tax1 and Tax2 increased transcription of the Bcl-X(L) promoter in T cells, although Tax1 appeared to be more efficient than Tax2. The biological significance of these observations was validated by the finding of an increased expression of Bcl-X(L) in ex vivo ATLL cells, especially from patients unresponsive to various chemotherapy regimens. Altogether, these data suggest that overexpression of Bcl-X(L )in vivo( )may be in part responsible for the resistance of ATLL cells to chemotherapy. In addition, inefficient activation of the Bcl-X(L) promoter by Tax2 may result in a shorter survival time of HTLV-II-infected cells in vivo and a diminished risk of leukemia development.","['Basic Research Laboratory Division of Basic Sciences, Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. cbeben@helix.nih.gov']","['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that only specific-not nonspecific-proteasomal inhibitors can discriminate between malignant and normal lymphocytes in inducing the apoptotic death response. Indeed, lactacystin and its active metabolite clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone induced apoptotic death in CLL but not in normal lymphocytes. This difference was completely abolished when tripeptide aldehydes such as MG132 or LLnL (which can also inhibit calpains) were used as less specific proteasomal inhibitors. Moreover, B-CLL cells exhibited a constitutive altered ubiquitin-proteasome system, including a threefold higher chymotrypsin-like proteasomal activity and high levels of nuclear ubiquitin-conjugated proteins compared with normal lymphocytes. Interestingly, B-CLL cells also displayed altered proteolytic regulation of wild-type p53, an apoptotic factor reported to be a substrate for the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Nuclear wild-type p53 accumulated after lactacystin treatment used at the discriminating concentration in malignant, but not in normal, lymphocytes. In contrast, p53 was stabilized by MG132 or LLnL in malignant and normal cells undergoing apoptosis, indicating that in normal lymphocytes p53 is regulated mainly by calpains and not by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This work raises the possibility that two different proteolytic pathways controlling p53 stability may be pathologically imbalanced. This could result in modification of apoptosis control, since in CLL-lymphocytes a highly upregulated ubiquitin-proteasome system, which controls p53 stability among other apoptotic factors, was correlated with an increased propensity of these cells to apoptosis triggered by lactacystin.","['Laboratoire de Recherche Correspondant and Laboratoire de Radiopathologie, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']","['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleotide sequencing showed a paucity of N or P regions and shortened D germ line and conserved J sequences, indicative of cells arising from fetal hematopoiesis.

Because leukemia-free survival (LFS) is at present defined as survival without evidence of relapse at any time posttransplant, patients who relapse but are then restored to complete remission are treated as failures when estimating LFS. We have established a new category of LFS, termed current LFS (CLFS), which we define as survival without evidence of leukemia at the time of most recent assessment. To gauge the contribution of treatment for relapse to the efficacy of allogeneic SCT in the management of CML in chronic phase, we compared conventional LFS and CLFS in 189 consecutive patients who underwent SCT over a 7-year period with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Patients with sibling donors (n = 111) received cyclosporine and methotrexate as prophylaxis for graft versus host disease; patients with unrelated donors (n = 78) also received Campath-1G or 1H as intravenous T-cell depletion. The 5-year LFS defined conventionally was 36% (CI: 29% to 43%) versus a 5-year CLFS of 49% (CI: 36% to 62%). This new method of defining LFS confirms the view that appropriate ""salvage"" therapy, principally DLI, makes a major contribution to the capacity of allogeneic SCT to produce long-term LFS in patients who receive SCT for CML and emphasizes the importance of redefining LFS to take account of successful treatment of relapse.","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Hammersmith Hospital, London, England.']",['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],,,,['R01-CA54706-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Progression through these checkpoints is also influenced by stromal cells in the microenvironment of the primary tissues wherein B-cell development occurs, ie, fetal liver and bone marrow and adult bone marrow. This review focuses on the developmental biology of human bone marrow B-lineage cells, including perturbations that contribute to the origin and evolution of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia and primary immunodeficiency diseases characterized by agammaglobulinemia. Recently described in vitro and in vivo models that support development and expansion of human B-lineage cells through multiple checkpoints provide new tools for identifying the bone marrow stromal cell-derived molecules necessary for survival and proliferation. Mutations in genes encoding subunits of the pre-B cell receptor and molecules involved in pre-B cell receptor signaling culminate in X-linked and non-X-linked agammaglobulinemia. A cardinal feature of these immunodeficiencies is an apparent apoptotic sensitivity of B-lineage cells at the pro-B to pre-B transition. On the other end of the spectrum is the apoptotic resistance that accompanies the development of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, potentially a reflection of genetic abnormalities that subvert normal apoptotic programs. The triad of laboratory models that mimic the bone marrow microenvironment, immunodeficiency diseases with specific defects in B-cell development, and B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia can now be integrated to deepen our understanding of human B-cell development.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. lebie001@tc.umn.edu']",,220,,,"['R01CA31685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA76055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 1434 bp that encodes 478 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 53.9 kDa. Sequence pattern analysis shows that BPOZ contains an N-terminal ankyrin repeat, a bipartite nuclear localization signal and two BTB/POZ domains. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR, the BPOZ transcript was found to be ubiquitously expressed in all fetal tissues examined (heart, brain, liver, and kidney) suggesting that BPOZ is involved in basic cellular function. Low expression of BPOZ in adult tissues (normal and hypertrophic heart) suggests that BPOZ mRNA is developmentally regulated and may play a role in developmental processes. Chromosomal localization by radiation hybrid mapping revealed that this gene is localized between D3S1269 and D3S3606 markers corresponding to the region of chromosome 3q21, a region frequently associated with leukemia.

In this study, we generated Lewis T cell lines specific for Dark Agouti rat alloantigens and tested the potential of allospecific T lymphocytes as carriers of genes encoding therapeutic proteins in transplantation gene therapy. These allospecific T lymphocytes were successfully, stably transduced with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by an Mo-MuLV-based retrovirus vector. A novel gene delivery protocol was utilized, resulting in nearly 100% EGFP-expressing T cells. This approach enabled tracking of allospecific transduced T cells in vivo and illustrates their transgene production by fluorometric determination after ex vivo isolation. Quantitation of EGFP transgene expression was used to determine the influence of T cell receptor-specific activation on transgene regulation. A strict positive correlation between activation state and expression level was detected in vitro and in vivo. The activation-induced increase in transgene expression could be blocked by interference with T cell activation signaling pathways by cyclosporin A, anti-CD4 MAb, or CTLA4-Ig. These data provide strong evidence that direct or indirect effects caused by activation-induced transcription factors are crucial in transgene upregulation. Allospecific activation in spleens, lymph nodes, and transplanted grafts can be considered as antigen-specific targeting strategy. This activation might be useful in expressing therapeutic proteins such as TGF-beta or IL-10 specific to these sites. T lymphocyte priming and activation might be prevented or altered by modification of the local microenvironments, thereby exerting a therapeutic influence on acute and chronic graft rejection processes.","['Institute of Medical Immunology, Charite, Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany.']","['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Ctla4 protein, rat)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uveal melanoma may spontaneously occur in some animals, including dogs, cats, horses, rats, mice, birds and fish. The histological features, metastatic behaviour and unpredictable nature of occurrence of these uncommon spontaneous tumours detract from their suitability as a model. Several methods have been developed to induce intraocular melanoma chemically or by radiation in laboratory animals. Some of these induced tumours resemble human uveal melanoma, although the majority originate from the retinal pigment epithelium. Uveal proliferations have been biologically induced by feline leukaemia/sarcoma virus and simian virus 40, although the presence of virus in tumour cells and extraocular tumours resulting from shed virus detract from the utility of this model. Inoculation of tissue culture hamster, murine or human melanoma cells into animal eyes has the advantage that the inoculation site and size of inoculum can be controlled. Disadvantages include the immune suppression necessary for tumour growth in some models as well as the fact that many of the melanoma cell lines are of cutaneous origin.

METHODS: Forty eight formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded bone marrow biopsy specimens that had been decalcified in EDTA were investigated, including 42 thought to exhibit ALL on the basis of bone marrow smears. Five specimens exhibited AML and one biphenotypic leukaemia, as diagnosed immunohistochemically in bone marrow biopsies. Immunostaining was performed with antibodies against relatively specific B and T cell antigens. The blasts were investigated for rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) genes. RESULTS: Amplifiable DNA was obtained from all 48 specimens. An IgH gene rearrangement was detected in 20 of 23 c-ALL specimens. Four of seven T cell ALL (T-ALL) specimens had a TCR-gamma gene rearrangement, and the one B cell ALL (B-ALL) specimen exhibited a clonal IgH gene. Three of four cases of unclassifiable ALL could be assigned to the B cell lineage on the basis of gene rearrangement analysis. Seven cases originally diagnosed in smears as ALL were rediagnosed as AML (n = 5) or biphenotypic leukaemia (n = 2) because of immunohistochemical reactivity for myeloperoxidase or lysozyme. Two of these AML cases and two of three cases of biphenotypic leukaemia exhibited a monoclonal IgH gene rearrangement. CONCLUSIONS: Acute leukaemia can be subtyped in bone marrow sections with a limited panel of antibodies suitable for use on paraffin wax embedded sections (against CD3, CD10, CD20, CD79a, myeloperoxidase, and lysozyme). In patients with ALL and a diagnostically equivocal immunophenotype, gene rearrangement analysis might indicate whether the B or T cell lineage is involved.","['Institute of Pathology, University of Tubingen, Germany. stefan-martin.kroeber@med.uni-tuebingen.de']","['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,PMC1186910,,,,,,,,,,,

Successful implantation requires appropriate communication between the embryo and maternal endometrium. There is evidence to suggest that cytokines produced by the maternal endometrium and the developing embryo play a crucial role in this signalling process. Although numerous cytokine-receptor pairs are expressed by the maternal endometrium and the embryo during implantation, functional knowledge of these cytokines is limited. Compelling data demonstrating a functional role for cytokines in implantation comes from studies using specific cytokine and cytokine receptor knockout mice. There are limited similar data for human implantation, but clinical correlative data and studies using in vitro models indicate that cytokines may have an important functional role in this process. Cytokines that appear to have a functional role in mammalian implantation include leukaemia inhibitory factor, interleukin 1, hepatocyte growth factor, stem cell factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor and insulin-like growth factors. As implantation failure is a significant cause of natural and in vitro fertilization pregnancy failure, a better understanding of the functional role of these cytokine-receptor pairs is important for improving the diagnosis and treatment of infertility.","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298, USA.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Somatomedins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (leukocyte inhibitory factor)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ferrous iron can react with hydroperoxides, via a Fenton-type reaction, to initiate free radical chain processes. Iron is more soluble at lower pH values, therefore we hypothesized that decreasing the environmental pH would lead to increased iron-mediated lipid peroxidation. We used Photofrin, a photosensitizer that produces singlet oxygen, to introduce lipid hydroperoxides into leukemia cells (HL-60, K-562, and L1210). Singlet oxygen reacts with the PUFA of cells producing lipid hydroperoxides. Using EPR spin trapping with POBN, free radical formation from HL-60 cells was only detected when Photofrin, light, and ferrous iron were present. Free radical formation increased with increasing iron concentration; in the absence of extracellular iron, radical formation was below the limit of detection and lipid hydroperoxides accumulated in the membrane. In the presence of iron, lipid-derived radical formation in cells is pH dependent; the lower the extracellular pH (7.5-5.5), the higher the free radical flux; the lower the pH, the greater the membrane permeability induced in K-562 cells, as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. These data demonstrate that lipid peroxidation processes, mediated by iron, are enhanced with decreasing extracellular pH. Thus, acidic pH not only releases iron from ""safe"" sites, but this iron will also be more damaging.","['Free Radical Research Institute & ESR Facility, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242-1101, USA. freya-schafer@uiowa.edu']","['0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Nitrogen Oxides)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Spin Labels)', '0 (alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '97067-70-4 (Dihematoporphyrin Ether)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,"['CA66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Attempts to exploit the ability of interferons to limit the growth of tumors in patients has met with limited results because of cancer-specific mutations of gene products in the interferon pathway. Although interferon-non-responsive cancer cells may have acquired a growth/survival advantage over their normal counterparts, they may have simultaneously compromised their antiviral response. To test this, we used vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), an enveloped, negative-sense RNA virus exquisitely sensitive to treatment with interferon. VSV rapidly replicated in and selectively killed a variety of human tumor cell lines even in the presence of doses of interferon that completely protected normal human primary cell cultures.

We quantified the effect of mutations in the YXDD motif, the deoxynucleoside triphosphate binding site, the thumb domain, and the RNase H domain of RT and hydroxyurea treatment on the frequencies of template switching. Hydroxyurea treatment and some mutations in RT increased the frequency of RT template switching up to fivefold, while all of the mutations tested in the RNase H domain decreased the frequency of template switching by twofold.

In order to determine the conditions that are necessary for the synthesis of HM DNA in vivo, we have characterized the physical forms of HM DNA that were synthesized in vitro in chronically infected SC-1 cells after temperature upshift. At the permissive temperature of 34 degrees C, the chronically infected SC-1 cells did not synthesize HM DNA. After temperature upshift of the cultured cells from 34 to 37 degrees C, the chronically infected SC-1 cells developed extremely high levels of HM DNA. Following temperature downshift of the cultured cells from 37 to 34 degrees C, a decrease in the level of HM DNA and an increase in the level of unintegrated linear proviral DNA occurred simultaneously. These results suggested that the accumulation of HM DNA both in vitro and in vivo may be the result of superinfection.","['Neurology and Research Services, William S.

Previous results indicated that intramolecular template switching occurred far more frequently than intermolecular template switching. We hypothesized that intermolecular template-switching events (recombination) occurred at a lower efficiency because the copackaged RNA was not accessible to the RT. To test our hypothesis, the murine leukemia virus (MLV) extended packaging signal (Psi(+)) containing a dimer linkage structure (DLS) was relocated from the 5' untranslated region (UTR) to between selectable markers, allowing the two viral RNAs to interact closely in this region. It was found that the overall maximum recombination rates of vectors with Psi(+) in the 5' UTR or Psi(+) between selectable markers were not drastically different. However, vectors with Psi(+) located between selectable markers reached a plateau of recombination rate at a shorter distance. This suggested a limited enhancement of recombination by Psi(+). The locations of the recombination events were also examined by using restriction enzyme markers. Recombination occurred in all four regions between the selectable markers; the region containing 5' Psi(+) including DLS did not undergo more recombination than expected from the size of the region. These experiments indicated that although the accessibility of the copackaged RNA was important in recombination, other factors existed to limit the number of viruses that were capable of undergoing intermolecular template switching. In addition, recombinants with multiple template switches were observed at a frequency much higher than expected, indicating the presence of high negative interference in the MLV-based system. This extends our observation with the spleen necrosis virus system and suggests that high negative interference may be a common phenomenon in retroviral recombination.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia 26506, USA.']","[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,['CA58875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC112212,,,,,,,,,,,

We generated recombinant adenoviruses expressing constitutively active MEK1 (MEK1 EE) and dominant negative MEK1 (MEK1 DN). Overexpression of MEK1 EE in MCs activated ERK1/2 and subsequently induced atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA expression.

MEK1 DN overexpression inhibited ET-1-, PE-, LIF-, and ISP-induced increases in cell size and sarcomeric reorganization. Consistent with the observed effects on cellular morphology, overexpression of MEK1 EE resulted in an increase in amino acid incorporation, while overexpression of MEK1 DN inhibited ET-1-, PE-, LIF-, ISP-, and mechanical stretch-induced increases in amino acid incorporation.

METHODS: Longitudinal Study of 1% of population of England and Wales followed from 1971 to 1989. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were derived for commonly occurring cancers and all cancers using the age-sex-specific rates for all females and all males in the Longitudinal Study. RESULTS: The incidence of all malignant neoplasms among West Indians (females SIR = 67, male SIR = 70) and Indians (female SIR = 32, male SIR = 52) was low. Among South Asians, this pattern was consistent for Hindus, Sikhs and Moslems. Scottish females showed raised incidence of lung cancer (SIR = 149) and those from the Irish Republic of oral cavity and pharynx (SIR = 321), oesophageal (SIR = 219) and liver (SIR = 373) cancers. Among Northern Irish females, incidence of lung cancer (SIR = 193) was raised. West Indian and South Asian females showed low incidence of breast cancer (SIR = 55 and 45, respectively). High incidence of laryngeal (SIR = 229) and renal (SIR = 203) cancers was observed for Scottish males and of oral cancer (SIR = 259) for males from the Irish Republic. At ages 15-64, raised incidence of prostate cancer (SIR = 129) and of leukaemia (SIR = 252) was also observed for men from the Irish Republic. Northern Irish males showed raised incidence of stomach cancer (SIR = 200). CONCLUSION: This study describes patterns of cancer incidence among migrant groups, most of which reflect environmental influences. This has challenging implications for sensitive targeting of primary interventions. It is important not to be complacent about lower risks of main cancers among West Indians and South Asians. In all Longitudinal Study members, breast cancer was the most common malignancy among females and lung cancer among males. This was also true for all migrant groups with the exception of Northern Irish women for whom lung cancer was the most common.","['Longitudinal Study Unit, Office for National Statistics, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BPV-1 has served as the prototype for studies of the molecular biology of the papillomaviruses. BPV-1 efficiently induces anchorage-independent growth and focus formation in murine C127 cells. The transforming properties of BPV-1 primarily reside in two genes, E5 and E6. Each of these genes is sufficient to transform cells. Although no independent transformation activity has been detected for E7, it was shown to be required for full transformation of C127 by BPV-1. We investigated the biological activities of BPV-1 E7 in several assays. Our results indicate that expression of BPV-1 E7 sensitizes cells to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-induced apoptosis. The TNF-induced apoptosis in E7-expressing cells was accompanied by increased release of arachidonic acid, indicating that phospholipase A(2) was activated. Unlike the E7 proteins from the cancer-related human papillomaviruses, the BPV-1 E7 protein does not associate efficiently with the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) in vitro, nor does it significantly affect the pRB levels in cultured cells. Furthermore, BPV-1 E7 sensitizes Rb-null cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. These studies indicate that BPV-1 E7 can sensitize cells to apoptosis through mechanisms that are independent of pRB.","['Department of Dermatology, New England Medical Center and Tufts University School of Medicine and the Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']","['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (oncogene protein E7, Bovine papillomavirus type 1)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)']",,,,"['F32/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 CA73558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated with the t(4;11)(q21;q23) translocation, the 4q21 gene that fuses with Mll is AF4. To gain insight into the potential role of AF4 in leukemogenesis and development, this gene was inactivated by homologous recombination in mice. As expected from the tissue distribution of the AF4 transcript, development of both B and T cells is affected in AF4 mutant mice. A severe reduction of the thymic double positive CD4/CD8 (CD4(+)/CD8(+)) population was observed; in addition most double- and single-positive cells expressed lower levels of CD4 and CD8 coreceptors. Most importantly, the reconstitution of the double-positive compartment by expansion of the double-negative cell compartment was severely impaired in these mutant mice. In the bone marrow pre-B and mature B-cell numbers are reduced. These results demonstrate that the function of the mAF4 gene is critical for normal lymphocyte development. This raises the possibility that the disruption of the normal AF4 gene or its association with Mll function by translocation may orient the oncogenic process toward the lymphoid lineage.

Pertussis toxin S1 blocked dissemination of MDAY-D2 murine myeloid leukemia cells to the liver and spleen, as in T-cell hybridoma cells, but it did not prevent bone marrow colonization. In contrast, overexpression of a function-defective mutant of the Gq/11 protein blocked dissemination to the bone marrow and also prevented Gq/11 dissemination to the liver and spleen.

We show here that both the wild-type (WT) and the S112A/ S136A double mutant (DM) BAD are more potent inducers of apoptosis in parental than in BCR/ABL-expressing 32D myeloid precursor cells. Stable lines of parental cells expressing DM BAD could not be established and most clones from WT BAD retrovirus-infected parental cells lost BAD expression. On IL-3 withdrawal from parental 32D cells, BAD was rapidly dephosphorylated by the serine-threonine phosphatase 1 alpha, and localized in the mitochondria, whereas it remained phosphorylated and did not localize to the mitochondria in the cohort of BCR/ABL-expressing cells escaping apoptosis induced by WT BAD. Moreover, these cells showed high levels of BCL-2 and BCL-X(L) expression. The cohort of BCR/ABL-expressing cells resistant to apoptosis induced by DM BAD showed only high levels of BCL-2 and BCL-X(L). These findings suggest that BCR/ABL-expressing cells are more versatile than normal hematopoietic progenitors in counteracting the apoptotic potential of BAD, and raise the possibility that tumor cells activate multiple antiapoptotic pathways for survival in the face of death-inducing stimuli.

The Bcr/Abl fusion protein is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that stimulates several intracellular signaling pathways, including activation of Ras through direct binding of the SH2-containing adapter protein Grb2 to Bcr tyrosine 177. A tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation (Y177F) at this site blocks the co-association of Bcr/Abl and Grb2 in vivo and impairs focus formation by Bcr/Abl in fibroblasts. However, the Bcr/Abl Y177F mutant can transform hematopoietic cell lines and primary bone marrow cells in vitro, so the importance of the Bcr/Abl-Grb2 interaction to myeloid and lymphoid leukemogenesis in vivo is unclear. We have recently demonstrated the efficient induction of CML-like myeloproliferative disease by BCR/ABL in a murine bone marrow transduction/transplantation model system. The Y177F mutation greatly attenuates the myeloproliferative disease induced by BCR/ABL, with mice developing B- and T-lymphoid leukemias of longer latency. In addition, the v-abl oncogene of Abelson murine leukemia virus, whose protein product lacks interaction with Grb2, is completely defective for the induction of CML-like disease. These results suggest that direct binding of Grb2 is required for the efficient induction of CML-like myeloproliferative disease by oncogenic Abl proteins.

Although AML1-MTG8 has been shown to repress the transcription of AML1 targets, none of the known targets of AML1 are probably responsible for AML1-MTG8-mediated leukemogenesis. In this study, 24 genes under the downstream control of AML1-MTG8 were isolated by using a differential display technique. Analysis with deletion mutants of AML1-MTG8 demonstrated that the regulation of the majority of these genes requires the region of 51 residues (488-538) containing the Nervy homology region 2 (NHR2), through which AML1-MTG8 interacts with MTGR1. Among the 24 genes identified, 10 were considered to be genes under the control of AML1, because their expression was altered by AML1b or AML1a or both. However, the other 14 genes were not affected by either AML1b or AML1a, suggesting the possibility that AML1-MTG8 regulates a number of specific target genes that are not normally regulated by AML1. Furthermore, an up-regulated gene, TIS11b (ERF-1, cMG1), was highly expressed in t(8;21) leukemic cells, and the overexpression of TIS11b induced myeloid cell proliferation in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. These results suggest that the high-level expression of TIS11b contributes to AML1-MTG8-mediated leukemogenesis.

Therefore, the demonstration of clonal B-cell or T-cell populations by detecting identically rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) or T-cell receptor (TCR) genes is often used to solve this diagnostic problem. Whereas the detection of rearranged Ig genes is well established, TCR gamma (gamma) and beta (beta) gene rearrangements often escape detection with the currently available polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. To establish a sensitive, specific, and rapid method for the detection of rearranged TCR-beta genes, we developed a new PCR approach with family-specific Jbeta primers and analyzed the resulting PCR products by high-resolution GeneScan technique. The superior efficiency of this new method was demonstrated by investigating 132 DNA samples extracted from lymph node and skin biopsy specimens (mostly formalin fixed) and blood samples of 62 patients who had a variety of T-cell lymphomas and leukemias. In all but 1 of the tumor samples (98.4%) a clonal amplificate was detectable after TCR-beta PCR and the same clonal T-cell population was also found in 15 of 18 (83%) of the regional lymph nodes and in 7 of 11 (64%) of the peripheral blood samples. Direct comparison of these results with those obtained currently by the most widely applied TCR-gamma PCR revealed an approximate 20% lower detection rate in the same set of samples than with the TCR-beta PCR method. These results indicate that the new TCR-beta PCR is most suitable for a rapid and reliable detection of clonal T-cell populations.

Grb4 bound to Bcr-Abl in a variety of systems, both in vitro and in vivo, and is an excellent substrate of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. The association of Grb4 and Bcr-Abl in intact cells was mediated by an src homology (SH)2-mediated phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction as well as an SH3-mediated phosphotyrosine-independent interaction. Grb4 has 68% homology to the adapter protein Nck and has similar but distinct binding specificities in K562 lysates. Subcellular localization studies indicate that Grb4 localizes to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Coexpression of kinase-active Bcr-Abl with Grb4 resulted in the translocation of Grb4 from the cytoplasm and the nucleus to the cytoskeleton to colocalize with Bcr-Abl. In addition, expression of Grb4 with kinase-active Bcr-Abl resulted in a redistribution of actin-associated Bcr-Abl. Finally, coexpression of Grb4 and oncogenic v-Abl strongly inhibited v-Abl-induced AP-1 activation. Together, these data indicate that Grb4 in conjunction with Bcr-Abl may be capable of modulating the cytoskeletal structure and negatively interfering with the signaling of oncogenic Abl kinases. Grb4 may therefore play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Here we describe a novel escape mechanism employed by tumor cells to protect themselves from granule-mediated cell death: We were able to demonstrate that the resistance of the human leukemia cell line ML-2 to natural killer (NK)-cell-mediated killing is not caused by impaired NK-cell activation but by resistance against effector molecules contained in the granules of cytotoxic cells. No resistance was observed against other pore-forming agents like complement and streptolysin O. By using the NK-susceptible leukemia cell line K562, we could show that the induction of cell death by cytotoxic granules can be blocked completely by anti-perforin antibodies, indicating that perforin is essentially involved in this process. Flow cytometric data revealed that an impaired binding of perforin on the tumor cell membrane is mainly responsible for target cell resistance, because perforin turned out to bind well on K562 cells but is not able to attach to the surface of ML-2 cells. After impaired binding of perforin was identified as a potential mechanism of tumor cell resistance, leukemia cells from 6 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were examined. As predicted, AML cells that failed to bind perforin on their surface demonstrated complete resistance toward NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Thus, perforin resistance could represent an important tumor escape mechanism that should be considered when cytotoxic effector cells are used for cellular immunotherapy.

Here we report on the cloning, functional significance, and expression of a complementary DNA (cDNA) that is involved in hypoxia-mediated expression of these 2 genes. The full-length cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 806 amino acids that contains a leucine zipper motif. This protein, termed HAF for hypoxia-associated factor, binds to a 17-base pair (bp) region of the erythropoietin promoter, which was shown earlier to participate in hypoxia-induced expression of the erythropoietin gene. In Hep3B cells, clones modified to express HAF antisense RNA showed an attenuated response to hypoxia-mediated induction of both erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor transcription. HAF showed sequence-specific interaction with a DNA element in the 5' untranslated region of VEGF gene. The HAF 2.6-kilobase (kb) messenger RNA (mRNA) is expressed in most adult tissues. The highest expression occurs in fetal liver and the least in adult liver. HAF is the murine homolog of Sart-1, a 125-kd human protein expressed in the nuclei of normal and malignant cells.

Exogenous expression of E2F-1, under growth restrictive conditions, was shown to result in p53-dependent programmed cell death. The consequences of deregulated expression of E2F-1 on terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells in the absence of E2F-1-mediated apoptosis, as well as mechanistic insights into how deregulated E2F-1 may affect terminal differentiation, have not been established. The autonomously proliferating M1 myeloblastic leukemia cell line, which is null for p53 expression and can be induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) to undergo terminal macrophage differentiation with concomitant loss of leukemogenicity, provides a particularly attractive model system to address these issues. Deregulated and continued expression of E2F-1 blocked the IL-6-induced terminal differentiation program at an early blast stage, giving rise to immature cells, which continued to proliferate without undergoing apoptosis and retained their leukemogenic phenotype. Although E2F-1 blocked IL-6-mediated terminal differentiation and its associated growth arrest, it did not prevent the rapid induction of both p15(INK4B) and p16(INK4A), inhibition of cdk4 kinase activity, and subsequent hypophosphorylation of pRb. The results obtained imply that genetic alterations that both impair p53 function and deregulate E2F-1 expression may render hematopoietic cells refractory to the induction of differentiation and are, thereby, likely to play a major role in the progression of leukemias.

Almost all patients respond to G-CSF with increased neutrophils, reduced infections, and improved survival. Some responders with congenital neutropenia have developed myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloblastic leukemia (MDS/AML), which raises the question of the role of G-CSF in pathogenesis. The Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR), Seattle, WA, has data on 696 neutropenic patients, including 352 patients with congenital neutropenia, treated with G-CSF from 1987 to present. Treatment and patient demographic data were analyzed. The 352 congenital patients were observed for a mean of 6 years (range, 0.1-11 years) while being treated. Of these patients, 31 developed MDS/AML, for a crude rate of malignant transformation of nearly 9%. None of the 344 patients with idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia developed MDS/AML. Transformation was associated with acquired marrow cytogenetic clonal changes: 18 patients developed a partial or complete loss of chromosome 7, and 9 patients manifested abnormalities of chromosome 21 (usually trisomy 21). For each yearly treatment interval, the annual rate of MDS/AML development was less than 2%. No significant relationships between age at onset of MDS/AML and patient gender, G-CSF dose, or treatment duration were found (P >.15). In addition to the 31 patients who developed MDS/AML, the SCNIR also has data on 9 additional neutropenic patients whose bone marrow studies show cytogenetic clonal changes but the patients are without transformation to MDS/AML. Although our data does not support a cause-and-effect relationship between development of MDS/AML and G-CSF therapy or other patient demographics, we cannot exclude a direct contribution of G-CSF in the pathogenesis of MDS/AML. This issue is unclear because MDS/AML was not seen in cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia. Improved survival of congenital neutropenia patients receiving G-CSF therapy may allow time for the expression of the leukemic predisposition that characterizes the natural history of these disorders. However, other factors related to G-CSF may also be operative in the setting of congenital neutropenia.

The kinase inhibitors flavopiridol and 7 hydroxy-staurosporine (UCN-01) were examined for their effects on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells in vitro (n = 49). Flavopiridol and UCN-01 induced concentration-dependent apoptosis of most B-CLL samples tested, with greater than 50% cell killing occurring at concentrations of less than 1 mcmol/L, and with flavopiridol displaying more potent activity than UCN-01. Flavopiridol (0.1 mcmol/L) and UCN-01 (1 mcmol/L) also induced striking decreases in the levels of the antiapoptosis proteins Mcl-1, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), and BAG-1 in nearly all cases of B-CLL and of Bcl-2 in approximately half of B-CLL specimens evaluated. In contrast, expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak was not significantly influenced by these kinase inhibitors. Flavopiridol-induced decreases in the levels of antiapoptosis proteins Mcl-1 and XIAP preceded apoptosis and were not substantially affected by the addition of caspase inhibitors to cultures. In contrast, UCN-01-stimulated decreases in antiapoptosis proteins were slower, occurred concurrently with apoptosis, and were partially prevented by caspase inhibitors. The findings suggest that flavopiridol and UCN-01 induce apoptosis of B-CLL cells through different mechanisms. The potent apoptotic activities of flavopiridol and UCN-01 against cultured B-CLL cells suggest that they may be effective as single agents in the treatment of B-CLL or for sensitizing B-CLL cells to conventional cytotoxic drugs.

In addition, the SAA gene is expressed in monocytes/macrophages, which are believed to play a central role in amyloid fibrillogenesis. Consequently, the pathogenic implication of SAA produced from these cells has been of major concern. Because SAA synthesis at the protein level in such cells has never been analyzed quantitatively, in this study an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was generated with a detection level sufficiently high to measure SAA concentrations in the culture supernatants of the human monocytic leukaemia cell line THP-1. SAA secretion by THP-1 with interleukin (IL)-1beta required the presence of dexamethasone as proposed previously. We also found that unidentified components in fetal calf serum (FCS) could induce SAA production by THP-1 in the presence of dexamethasone. These findings are in contrast to the results obtained from hepatoma cell line HepG2, in which IL-1beta alone could induce SAA secretion, while dexamethasone-supplemented FCS could not. The method was able to quantify SAA secreted from cultured human peripheral monocytes. The findings suggest that monocytes produce SAA in almost the same manner as THP-1. Thus, THP-1 cells can be utilized to investigate a distinctive manner of SAA production from monocytes.","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['0 (Serum Amyloid A Protein)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin (IL)-18, a novel immunoregulatory cytokine, strongly stimulates type 1 T cells, therefore we postulated that IL-18 may be involved in the pathogenesis of aGVHD. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we serially measured serum levels of IL-18 in 37 patients with haematological malignancy before and after allogeneic BMT. Patients with aGVHD had high levels of IL-18 that strongly correlated with the severity of aGVHD. We also found that they showed reduced serum levels of IL-18 after appropriate treatment or at a state of resolution. IL-18 levels were not affected by the pretransplant regimen, engraftment or bacterial infection. Compared with circulating interferon (IFN)-gamma or IL-12 levels, serum levels of IL-18 showed a more sensitive and specific correlation with the disease status of aGVHD. These findings suggest that IL-18 may play important roles in the pathogenesis of aGVHD and that measurement of serum IL-18 levels can be useful indicator of aGVHD.","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan. fuji-y@hyo-med.ac.jp']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, donor T cells have been shown to mediate the so-called graft-versus-leukaemia effect and are, therefore, increasingly used for adoptive immunotherapy. However, T-cell infusions are associated with the risk of a graft-versus-host reaction, which may lead to a life-threatening disease. To overcome this problem, we followed a new strategy for the exclusive depletion of alloreactive cells. We activated allogeneic T cells by cultivation on an adherent cell layer derived from peripheral blood. We then depleted activated cells based on the expression of CD25, CD69 or both activation-induced antigens using magnetic cell sorting. Mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) reactions and helper T-lymphocyte precursor cell frequency (HTLP-f) assays demonstrated that this technique led to a significant decrease in alloreactivity of 'donor' cells, which at the same time preserved reactivity against third-party cells. The lowest level of alloreactivity was found when CD25 and CD69 antibodies were used together for depletion. This corresponds with our observation that expression of CD25 or CD69 may partially represent different activation pathways. We conclude that ex vivo depletion of CD25- and CD69-expressing alloreactive cells may help to overcome limitations of adoptive immunotherapy.","['Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. fehse@uke.uni-hamburg.de']","['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about MTX resistance in relapsed ALL. In this study, we determined ex vivo MTX resistance in precursor-B ALL at relapse (rALL) and determined possible defects in MTX membrane transport and polyglutamylation. Using the in situ thymidylate synthase inhibition assay, 21 rALL samples were threefold more MTX resistant than 63 initial precursor-B ALL samples, both after short-term and after continuous MTX exposure (P < or = 0.01). [3H]-MTX membrane transport did not differ between eight rALL and 25 precursor-B ALL samples. Incubation for 24 h with 1 microM [3H]-MTX resulted in a trend towards a lower accumulation of MTX in 20 relapsed than in 83 initial samples of precursor-B ALL samples (906 vs. 1364 pmol/109 cells; P = 0.07). Accumulation of long-chain MTX polyglutamates (MTX-Glu4-6) did not differ between relapsed and newly diagnosed samples (746 and 889 pmol/109 cells; P = 0.1). Activities of the enzymes involved in polyglutamylation (folylpolyglutamate synthetase and folylpolyglutamate hydrolase) did not differ between rALL and untreated c/pre-B-ALL.

Intensive salvage therapy was unable to induce a second remission in the relapsed patients. One of the six MLL-AF6-positive patients achieved a molecular CR. He is still in CR at 33 months after diagnosis. Survival analysis indicates a poor prognosis in MLL-AF6-positive patients. The median event-free survival was 6.8 months, the median overall survival 15 months. Persistent PCR positivity was consistently associated with relapse. Thus, RT-PCR provides a valuable and sensitive tool for the identification of t(6;11)-positive AML and the monitoring of response to treatment in these patients. The results of RT-PCR may be useful to evaluate therapeutic procedures and to make treatment decisions, which will enable molecular remissions to be achieved and improve the clinical outcome in this group of patients.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Vienna, Medical School, Austria. gerlinde.mitterbauer@univie.ac.at']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were prepared from HLA-A3- or -B8-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by incubation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and interleukin (IL)-2 for 7 d. These APCs were pulsed with the respective b3a2 junctional peptide in the presence of beta2-microglobulin and were then used to challenge autologous PBMCs at 7-d intervals in the presence of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7 and IL-12. On subsequent exposure to target cells (either further pulsed normal APCs or unpulsed CML cells), specific HLA-restricted CTL responses were observed against all HLA-A3/-B8 matched normal target cells tested, but not to targets that were HLA mismatched. Cytotoxicity was also induced against HLA-A3/-B8 unpulsed CML cells, but not against unmatched CML cells. These data indicate (i) that endogenous BCR-ABL junctional peptides may be presented by CML cells and (ii) that exogenous peptides are potential stimulators of autologous antileukaemic CTLs.","['University Departments of Haematology and Immunology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, UK.']","['0 (HLA-A3 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-B8 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We screened 226 cases, including 123 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 50 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 20 chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), 10 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia-prolymphocytic leukaemia (CLL/PLL) and 23 cases with 1p abnormalities, for Bcl10 mutations by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformation polymorphism (RT-PCR/SSCP). Three known polymorphisms and two common splice variants were identified; however, no mutations were detected. One splice variant led to a 33-bp in frame deletion, whereas the other caused a 16-bp deletion predicting C-terminal truncation of Bcl10. However, both splice variants were also detected in normal bone marrow, suggesting that they are unlikely to be of pathogenetic significance. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis revealed no rearrangements of Bcl10 among 16 ALL and 11 cases of haematological malignancy with 1p abnormalities. Our results suggest that mutation of the Bcl10 gene as a mechanism of tumorigenesis is not associated with leukaemia.","[""Division of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine, London, UK. david.grimwade@kcl.ac.uk""]","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (BCL10 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regenerating bone marrow cells obtained from mice given one injection of cytosine arabinoside (100 mg/kg) as well as SA2 myeloid leukaemia cells were incubated in vitro for 24 h with 10-6 M captopril. Captopril significantly reduced the proportion of high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC-1) in S-phase, whereas it had no effect on the proportion of SA2 leukaemic colony-forming cells in S-phase. When given in vivo to mice 1 h after 2 Gy gamma-irradiation or cytosine arabinoside (AraC) injection, captopril (100 mg/kg) was shown to prevent HPP-CFC-1 entry into S-phase induced by these cytotoxic treatments. The observed effects correlated with a reduction in ACE degradative activity and an increase in the level of endogenous AcSDKP both in the supernatants of captopril-treated bone marrow cells and in plasma of treated animals.

Since several studies indicated that ras oncogenes may modulate the cellular response to cisplatin or radiation, we investigated the gene-specific repair of the N-ras gene in the human K 562 cell line after exposure to cisplatin using a novel nonradioactive polymerase chain reaction inhibition assay. This assay is based on the fact that DNA lesions can block the Taq polymerase and thereby result in a decreased amplification of a damaged segment compared to the amplification of the same segment in a non-damaged template. The overall genomic repair rate was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Immediately after cisplatin exposure no amplification segment was observed. However, a complete restoration of the N-ras gene (2.4 kb) was seen after 8 h posttreatment incubation. In contrast, only 60% of the overall genome was repaired at this time. Our results clearly indicate that cisplatin-induced DNA lesions are more efficiently removed from transcribed regions within the DNA, suggesting that the efficiency of DNA repair in a given gene may be correlated to its transcriptional activity. Since ras oncogenes control several cellular signal transduction pathways, known to be involved in DNA damage response, preferential repair of the N-ras gene could therefore be an important step to prevent inactivation of cellular defense mechanisms after exposure to genotoxic agents.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Martin Luther University, Halle/Saale, Germany.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antisense Elements (Genetics))', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Literature is reviewed showing that the inhibitory action of dietary restriction on carcinogenesis is global and pervasive--it is effective in several laboratory species, for a variety of tumor types, and for both spontaneous tumors and tumors caused by different types of tumor-inducing agents. Evidence is presented showing the IGF-1 pathway responds appropriately to nutritional interventions including diet restriction. Recent evidence points to an obligatory role for the IGF-1 receptor in the establishment and maintenance of the transformed phenotype and reveals that IGF-1 in concert with insulin-like binding protein 3 and p53 is involved in autocrine/paracrine growth signaling pathways as adaptive responses to environmental stimuli. Considered together these works show that the IGF-1 pathway is uniquely poised to influence cellular transformation leading to the malignant phenotype by modulating the balance of cellular proliferation and cell death (apoptosis) in precancerous and cancerous cells and by influencing metastasis of nascent tumors. We evaluated these hypotheses directly using animal models of mononuclear cell leukemia, bladder transitional cell carcinogenesis, and breast cancer. Our studies demonstrate that manipulation of IGF-1 level through dietary intervention influences tumor growth and metastasis. Upregulation of this pathway demonstrated that increased IGF-1 stimulates tumor proliferation, progression and metastasis. Conversely, downregulation of this pathway in vivo as a consequence of dietary restriction results in antitumorigenic activity. We found that the functional disruption of IGF-1R markedly influences breast cancer metastasis in nude mice by suppressing cellular adhesion, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer cells to the lung, lymph nodes, and lymph vessels. Epidemiological observations and clinical oncology results support the involvement of IGF-1 in carcinogenesis and anticarcinogenesis. This leads to the hypothesis that factors such as IGF-1 which regulate body size and composition may be related to human cancer incidence or prognosis. Additional understanding of this pathway and its interactions with other signaling pathways will advance our ability to develop new interventions towards decreased cancer risk in humans.","['Laboratory of Environmental Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.']","['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used flow cytometry to evaluate B-cell differentiation antigen and adhesion molecule expression and immunohistochemistry on clot sections to evaluate architectural distribution.

Adhesion molecules (CD44, CD54) were expressed more heterogeneously compared with expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CD34+, TdT-positive cells were dispersed without significant clustering, while CD20+ cells exceeded CD34/TdT-positive cells in 24 of 25 cases. This multidisciplinary study demonstrates that hematogone-rich lymphoid proliferations exhibit a spectrum of B-lymphoid differentiation antigen expression with predominance of intermediate and mature B-lineage cells, heterogeneity of adhesion molecule expression, and nonclustered bone marrow architectural distribution.","['Department of Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.']",['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To compute dynamics of histopathology implicating corresponding changes in time, relevant indices were calculated. Quantification of megakaryocytopoiesis and its precursor cell population showed a significant increase in the IFN-alfa and busulfan groups compared with the hydroxyurea group.

Although a significant increase in fiber density was detectable in the busulfan group, the progression index proved to be twice as high after IFN-alfa therapy. In contrast, a considerable number of patients displayed a regression of myelofibrosis after hydroxyurea treatment. The general association of the megakaryocyte lineage with myelofibrosis was in line with experimental findings. The mature macrophage population and its activated subfraction revealed a marked proliferation (IFN-alfa group) during treatment.

We describe 2 examples of B-cell CLL/SLL that subtotally replaced the bone marrow with an interfollicular pattern. In both cases, the neoplasms were composed of small round lymphoid cells; proliferation centers also were present. The neoplasms surrounded large reactive germinal centers that were devoid of peripheral mantle zones. The germinal centers were paratrabecular and nonparatrabecular in case 1 and nonparatrabecular in case 2. Flow cytometry immunophenotypic studies done on bone marrow aspiration samples of both cases showed a uniform population of neoplastic cells positive for pan-B-cell antigens and the CD5 and CD23 antigens. Immunohistochemical studies done on bone marrow biopsy sections supported the flow cytometry results and demonstrated that the germinal centers were negative for BCL-2. B-cell CLL/SLL may rarely involve the bone marrow with an interfollicular pattern.

Both these aspects apply in cardiac catheterization and angiocardiography of children. Effective doses are a good indicator of radiation risk, particularly for leukaemia. Effective doses have been determined for 2114 infants and children undergoing cardiac catheterization from 1984 to 1996 at the University Hospital in Essen. Conversion factors (effective dose/dose-area product) were calculated based on direct dose-area product measurements for posteroanterior (PA) and lateral (Lat) projections as well as on patient records and examination details. The factors are calculated for eight age groups of children, taking into account the X-ray tube voltage for fluoroscopy and cine-film sequences, with and without zoom mode. Frequency distributions are presented for 2114 patients, for dose-area product, number of angiographic examinations (each combined with one cine-film sequence both PA and Lat) and for calculated effective doses. Highest effective doses are found in newborns (18.0 mSv and 6.5 mSv 90th and 50th percentiles, respectively) compared with adolescents of 15-21 years (8.0 mSv and 3.0 mSv 90th and 50th percentiles, respectively). Effective dose for cardiac catheterization is highest for newborns, in spite of lowest measured dose-area products, because the decreased value of the conversion factors overcompensates for the increase of dose-area product with age. This is especially important because of the higher tumour risk for equal effective dose for young children compared with adults.","['Institute for Medical Radiation Physics, University Hospitals Essen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both vegetative tissues and spores of bracken can induce adducts in DNA in animal tissues, but the possible genotoxic or carcinogenic effects of spores from fern species other than bracken are unknown. The single-cell gel electrophoresis ('comet') assay was used to investigate whether fern spores can cause DNA damage in vitro. Extracts of spores from six fern species were administered to cultured human premyeloid leukaemia (K562) cells. Spore extracts of five fern species: Anemia phyllitidis, Dicksonia antarctica, Pteridium aquilinum, Pteris vittata and Sadleria pallida, induced significantly more DNA strand breaks than those in the control groups. Only in one species, Osmunda regalis, was the effect no different from that in the control groups. Using extracts from A. phyllitidis and P. vittata, the extent of DNA damage was increased by increasing the original dose 10 times, whereas an experiment in which exposure times were varied suggested that the highest levels of strand breaks appear after 2 h exposure.

Encouraging new approaches to this problem recently have emerged from studies of small molecule regulators of protein-protein complexes. This review outlines the basic concepts for two of these approaches, based on structural and chemical strategies, by illustrating their application in the design of small molecule inhibitors for three biological systems: (1) cell surface molecules CD4 and CD8 involved in immune response, (2) chemokine receptor-ligand interactions implicated in human immunodeficiency virus entry, and (3) B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 family proteins essential for regulation of programmed cell death or apoptosis. The design and discovery of these novel reagents provide valuable tools to probe fundamental questions about a particular protein-protein complex, and may lead to a new generation of potential therapeutic agents. Furthermore, these studies suggest a framework for chemical intervention of other protein-protein interactions involved in many pathological processes.","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, 802 BLSB, 233 South 10th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA. zhuang@nana.jci.tju.edu']","['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Proteins)']",115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD11a/CD18 leukocyte-restricted expression is controlled by the CD11a gene promoter, which confers tissue-specific expression to reporter genes in vitro and in vivo. DNase I protection analysis of the CD11a proximal gene promoter revealed DNA-protein interactions centered at position -110 (CD11a-110). Disruption of CD11a-110 reduced CD11a promoter activity in a cell type-specific manner, as it reduced its activity by 70% in Jurkat lymphoid cells, whereas the effect was considerably lower in K562 and HepG2 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed evidence of cell type-specific differences in CD11a-110 binding and indicated its specific recognition by members of the polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2/core binding factor (CBF)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) family of transcription factors. AML1B/CBFbeta transactivated the CD11a promoter, with AML1B/CBFbeta-mediated transactivation being completely dependent on the integrity of the CD11a-110 element. Therefore, CBF/AML factors play a role in the cell type-restricted transcription of the CD11a integrin gene through recognition of CD11a-110. The involvement of CBF/AML factors in CD11a expression raises the possibility that CD11a/CD18 expression might be deregulated in acute myeloid and B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias, thus contributing to their altered adhesion and metastatic potential.","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid 28006, Spain.']","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A differential response was observed: in 3/7 myeloid cell lines a significant down-regulation of CD95 happened which correlated with the induction of differentiation. A significant induction of CD95 was observed in 4/ 12 lymphoid lines (2 HHV8+ cell lines, one Burkitt line and another lymphoma line). The modulation of CD95 was both time- and dose- dependent (maximum reached after 3-5 days of culture with 10-6 M retinoid).

We performed a prospective phase II clinical trial in a referral-based patient population. After confirmation of diagnosis and staging evaluation, 44 patients (10 small lymphocytic lymphoma, 27 follicular lymphoma, 7 mantle cell lymphoma; 30 without prior therapy, 14 previously treated) received six cycles of ProMACE-CytaBOM (cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine [Oncovin], mechlorethamine) combination chemotherapy (with etoposide given orally daily for five days) followed by a 7-day continuous infusion of anti-B4-blocked ricin immunotoxin at 30 microg/kg/day given every 14 days for up to six cycles. A complete response was achieved in 25 of 44 patients (57%), 21 from the chemotherapy alone, 3 converted from partial to complete response with the immunotoxin, and 1 patient became a complete responder after a surgical procedure to remove an enlarged spleen that was histologically negative for lymphoma. With a median follow-up of 5 years, 14 of 25 complete responders have relapsed (56%); median remission duration was 2 years, and overall survival was 61%. Forty-two percent of the complete responders have been in continuous remission for more than 4 years. The median number of courses of immunotoxin delivered was two usually because of the development of human anti-ricin antibodies. ProMACE-CytaBOM plus anti-B4-blocked ricin does not produce durable complete remissions in the majority of patients with indolent lymphoma.

The increasing number of survivors has led to a heightened appreciation of the late complications of treatment caused by both radiation and chemotherapy. Important late effects include decreased growth, poor school performance, altered cardiac function, infertility, and second malignant neoplasms. The long term outcome of children and adolescents suffering from the most recently recognized acute complication of treatment, avascular necrosis of weight-bearing bones, is still not known. These, and all patients treated on clinical trials, should be followed throughout their lives. Many of the complications of treatment are often not realized until years after the completion of therapy; some have been found to be related to dose intensity, emphasizing the importance of clinical trials that examine reduction of therapy for diseases with excellent cure rates. A successful example of this strategy is the elimination or reduction of radiation dose for the prevention of central nervous system acute lymphocytic leukemia. This has resulted in fewer long term central nervous system complications without a decrease in survival rates. As knowledge of late effects increases, design of future trials will need to focus on striking a balance between cure and long term toxicity.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that the ability of PML-RARalpha to form homodimers is both necessary and sufficient for its increased binding efficiency to corepressor and inhibitory effects on hormonal responses in myeloid differentiation. We further provide evidence that altered stoichiometric interaction of SMRT with PML-RARalpha homodimers may underlie these processes. Finally, we demonstrate that a RXR AF2 mutant recapitulates many biochemical and functional properties of PML-RARalpha.

As seen previously in the monomeric series, small, lipophilic 4-substituents significantly increased potency in cell culture. The dimeric compounds were all slightly to significantly more potent in the mutant JL(A) and JL(D) cell lines that under-express topo II, suggesting that this enzyme is not their primary target. An 11-imino-linked dimer was much less active, and an asymmetric indeno[1,2-b]quinoline-6-carboxamide/naphthalimide dimer was less active than the comparable symmetric bis(indeno[1,2-b]quinoline-6-carboxamide). Selected analogues were active against sub-cutaneously implanted colon 38 tumors in mice, giving growth delays comparable to that of the clinical topo I inhibitor irinotecan at up to 10-fold lower doses.

STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Cells from four B-CLL patients were infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Noninfected and infected aliquots were exposed to CD40L. Five days later, the cultures were analyzed for cell survival, activation, DNA synthesis, and expression of EBV-encoded and of cellular regulatory proteins retinoblastoma (Rb), p53, recombinant sequence binding protein (RBP)Jk, and PU.1. The proteins were detected by immunoblotting and by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: A proportion of the cells were activated and expressed Epstein-Barr nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and elevated Rb level but not latent membrane protein (LMP)-1 and p53. They did not enter the cell cycle. Exposure to CD40L induced DNA synthesis but it did not modify the expression of the EBNAs. CONCLUSIONS: The virus could activate CLL cells, but the full course of the early events that leads to immortalization--as seen in normal B cells--did not proceed beyond a certain point.

Dysregulated expansion of one or the other subset may contribute to the impaired function of the T-cell-mediated immune system in cancer patients. In the present study we have investigated whether such dysregulation might exist in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: We analyzed 61 blood samples from 45 children with B cell precursor ALL and 16 healthy children. Interleukin(IL)-2, IL-4, and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) production of their respective purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were assessed at the single-cell level by intracellular-cytokine-staining flow cytometry. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, IL-2-producing cell populations in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were reduced below the normal range in 31 of 44 (70.5%) and 23 of 38 (60.5%) cases respectively. Similarly, IFN gamma-producing cell populations in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells decreased in 17 of 44 (38.6%) and 18 of 38 (47.4%) cases respectively. Conversely cell populations capable of IL-4 production in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were increased in 13 of 30 (43.3%) and 15 of 30 (50.0%) cases respectively. Therefore, the Th1-to-Th2 and Tc1-to-Tc2 ratios (1.6 +/- 2.2 and 7.7 +/- 6.7 respectively) were significantly lower in peripheral blood T cells of ALL patients (n = 30) than those (6.0 +/- 2.9 and 20.1 +/- 10.3 respectively) in 15 healthy controls (P < 0.0001). Although both CD45RA+/CD4+ and CD45RA+/CD8+ cells significantly increased in 43 ALL patients (P < 0.05), there existed no apparent correlation between CD45 isoform expression and cytokine (IL-2 and IFN gamma) production. Interestingly, the ability to produce both IL-2 and IFN gamma was recovered in 8 cases examined, after complete remission had been achieved. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that, in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of ALL patients, there is a dysregulation in the functionality of Th1 (Tc1) and Th2 (Tc2) cells with a gross reduction of Th1 (Tc1) cell populations and an expansion in Th2 (Tc2).","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']","['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for the 92 cases of pediatric herpes zoster patients diagnosed during the period from 1981 to 1998. The age at onset of herpes zoster and of varicella, the interval between varicella and zoster, the dermatomal distribution of herpes zoster and complications were compared between immunocompetent and immunocompromised children. RESULTS: The mean age at onset of zoster in immunocompetent children was 8.5 +/- 4.0 years and in immunosuppressed children was 9.7 +/- 3.8 years. The age at onset of varicella was significantly lower (1.6 +/- 1.8 years) in immunocompetent than in immunosuppressed children (4.6 +/- 2.7 years). The interval between varicella and zoster was 6.2 +/- 3.2 years in immunocompetent children. More than 80% of patients with acute leukemia or malignant lymphoma had herpes zoster within 2 years after diagnosis of malignancy. Lesions of herpes zoster were most frequently found in the thoracic nerve regions. Five of 11 zoster patients with cutaneous dissemination, three of five zoster patients having aseptic meningitis and three of four patients complicated facial palsy were children without underlying disease. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirmed that varicella in the first year of life was a risk factor in immunocompetent children, as reported previously. Herpes zoster in children without immunosuppression was found not to be as mild as generally accepted.","['Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital, Japan. takyamnd-k@komagome-hospital.bunkyo.tokyo.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: A retrospective study was conducted of gonadal and sexual function of 77 adult male survivors of childhood malignancies treated and cured at a single center from 1970 to 1989 and followed for a median of 13 years. The study included an interview, physical examination, sperm test, and hormonal analyses. RESULTS: One-third of the patients were treated for hematological malignancies, one-third for CNS tumors, and one-third for other malignancies. Eleven patients required androgen substitution after treatment for tumors of the pituitary-hypothalamic region or acute lymphoblastic leukemia including testicular irradiation and/or orchiectomy. In three patients the testicles were removed. The other eight had small testicles, and those providing sperm samples had azoospermia, and sexual function was disturbed in most of them. Most of the remaining 66 patients had small testicles. Normozoospermia was found in 63%, oligozoospermia in 20%, and azoospermia in 17%. Although there was a highly significant correlation between testicular volume and sperm test, 25% of patients with testicles of <10 ml had normozoospermia. Sexual function was normal in 46 patients, and they were married at a frequency comparable to the normal population. Twenty-one patients had no signs of gonadal dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated for tumors in the hypothalamic-pituitary region or treated with testicular irradiation or with high doses of alkylating agents had severe gonadal and sexual dysfunction. Most of the other patients had good prospects for preserved gonadal and sexual function.","['Department of Oncology, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. thomas.relander@onk.lu.se']","['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)']",,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Between May, 1993, and September, 1998, a total of 151 children (95 boys, 56 girls), 29 (19%) with lymphoma, 58 (39%) with leukemia, and 64 (42%) with solid tumor, were screened for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The mean age was 7. 5 +/- 2.5 years. Children with negative serology received active and/or passive immunization. HBsAg and anti-HBs were positive prior to vaccination in 16 (10%) and 17 (11%) children, respectively. One hundred eighteen children (78%) of one hundred fifty-one with negative serology were included in the vaccination program. The vaccine dose was 40 microg. Children with solid tumor and lymphoma received recombinant hepatitis B vaccine at diagnosis, repeated at months 1, 2, and 12. Hyperimmunglobulin was administered monthly in children with leukemia during the intensive chemotherapy period. They were then vaccinated following the third month of maintenance therapy with the schedule described above. Anti-HBs titers were measured every 3 months, and titers above 10 mlU/ml were accepted as protective. RESULTS: Anti-HBs positivity after the first three doses was 77% in solid tumors, 88% in acute leukemia, and 48% in lymphomas. Anti-HBs positivity with respect to diagnosis in children completing the vaccination schedule was 94% in solid tumor, 90% in leukemia, and 74% in lymphoma (P > 0.05). Thirty-three percent of children have not received the fourth dose as yet. In total 78% of the children developed protective antibody titers with or without the fourth dose, and none was infected with HBV during 3 years of follow-up. Ten (39%) of twenty-six children who remained unresponsive to immunization were infected with HBV. CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal that HBV prophylaxis is necessary and that our vaccination schedule is effective in preventing HBV infection in these children.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Gorukle, Bursa, Turkey.']","['0 (Hepatitis B Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Vaccines)']",,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, acute and chronic neurotoxicity has been described following HDMTX therapy, and the long-term intellectual outcome in children treated in this way is inadequately documented. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of the brain is a noninvasive, quantitative way of assessing aspects of cerebral metabolism, which has not previously been applied to the study of children undergoing central nervous system directed therapy. PROCEDURE: To evaluate the potential role of (1)H-MRS in the investigation of related neurotoxicity, 11 children who had received HDMTX (cumulative dose 6-96 g/m(2)) underwent localised (1)H-MRS, magnetic resonance imaging. Neuropsychological assessments were performed on the children who had more than 1 year of follow-up time since last methotrexate treatment. Control (1)H-MRS studies on 11 adult and 6 young volunteers were undertaken. Eight patients had spectra of adequate quality. Comparisons between (1)H-MRS metabolite ratios and normal controls were made. RESULTS: Patients had a low choline/water ratio compared to controls (P < 0.01). No differences between patient and control NAA/water, Cr/water, Naa/Cr, and Cho/Cr ratios were seen. Overall, 3 patients had abnormal white matter changes on MRI. The mean IQ of the patients (104.1) was in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that choline depletion in the brains of these patients may reflect subclinical disturbances of myelin metabolism as a result of methotrexate therapy and may represent a possible avenue of treatment in patients with clinical chronic methotrexate-related neurotoxicity.","['Department of Oncology, The Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, England.

The purpose of our study was to investigate frequency and clinicopathological features of PBLL in children and to test prospectively the efficacy of an ALL-type therapy for treatment of these patients. PROCEDURE: From October, 1986, to March, 1995, 1,075 patients up to 18 years of age suffering from all kinds of NHL were registered in the two consecutive multicenter studies NHL-BFM 86 and 90. Of these, 27 patients were diagnosed with PBLL. Twenty-one PBLL patients were treated according to a BFM-ALL-type protocol: an eight-drug induction over 9 weeks was followed by an 8-week consolidation including methotrexate 5 g/m(2) x4. Patients in stages I and II continued with maintenance up to a total therapy duration of 24 months, whereas patients in stages III and IV received an additional eight-drug intensification and cranial radiotherapy (12 Gy for prophylaxis) after consolidation. Six PBLL patients were treated according to the BFM-protocol for B-NHL, stratified according to stage and tumor load and consisiting of two to six 5-day courses of chemotherapy. RESULTS: The median age of the 27 patients with PBLL (18 boys, 9 girls) was 6.2 (range 0.7-15) years. Stages (St. Jude) were: I (n = 3), II (n = 7), III (n = 9), and IV (n = 8). Twenty-one PBLL patients had nodal disease, 6 patients had subcutaneous manifestations, and 8 patients had bone marrow disease (<25% blasts). All patients achieved remission. With a median follow-up time of 4. 25 years, the estimated probability for event-free survival (pEFS) at 10 years for the total group was 0.73 (SE 0.10). Five patients (2, 1, 1, and 1 patients at stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively) relapsed: 2 of 21 patients who were treated according to the ALL strategy and 3 of 6 who were treated according to the B-NHL-protocol. CONCLUSIONS: PBLL accounts for 2.5% of childhood NHL. An ALL-type therapy strategy appears to be superior to a short-pulse B-NHL protocol.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover, Germany.']","['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this role, we expressed murine ETK2 in the interleukin 3 (IL-3) dependent myeloid progenitor cell line FDC-P1 and examined its effect on growth factor dependence.ETK2 cDNAs encoding full-length or kinase domain-deleted receptor were retrovirally transduced into murine FDC-P1 cells. Survival, cell cycle status, and proliferative responses of ETK2 expressing clones were studied at normal and reduced growth factor concentrations. ETK2 was expressed as a functional tyrosine kinase of 110 and 150 kDa. This proto-oncogene altered the growth of FDC-P1 cells, allowing survival at reduced growth factor concentrations and delaying apoptosis after IL-3 withdrawal. ETK2-expressing clones contained a higher fraction of cells in the S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle, both after cytokine withdrawal and in the presence of IL-3. Furthermore, these cells had a modestly enhanced proliferative response to IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, suggesting that ETK2 intracellular signaling may converge with that of hematopoietic growth factors.

In many of our factor-independent subclonal cell lines that we examined, transformation to factor independence appeared to be due to the retrotransposition of intracisternal type A particles (IAP) into the growth factor genes that are normally required for survival and growth of FDCP-1JL26 cells. To determine the role of the irradiated microenvironment in the evolution of factor-independent cells, we have examined the expression and retrotransposition of IAPs after exposure to the irradiated bone marrow stromal cell line D2XRII. Differential display and Northern blot analysis demonstrated that IAPs were overexpressed in a nonautocrine factor-independent subclonal cell line, FI7CL2. The frequency of retrotransposition was determined by the introduction of the IAP-neo(RT) plasmid into FDCP-1JL26 cells. The IAP-neo(RT) contains a neomycin resistance gene (neo) that only becomes active after retrotransposition, and thus the frequency of retrotransposition in FDCP-1JL26 cells was quantified by determining the frequency of neo-resistant cells.No significant increases in the expression of IAPs were observed after the cells were exposed to the irradiated stromal cells. This observation is in agreement with the observation that no increase in the frequency of retrotransposition could be detected. These results suggest that the irradiated bone marrow may have a passive role in the selection of factor-independent cells. During cocultivation, bone marrow stromal cells may provide a factor(s) to hematopoietic cells that allow it to survive in medium lacking IL-3. At random, a retrotransposition may occur that provides a selective advantage to the hematopoietic cells. In the absence of the irradiated stromal cells, the hematopoietic cells are perhaps more likely to die and therefore are not available for a random retrotransposition event to occur. This model is to be distinguished from an active role in which the irradiated microenvironment would synthesize or activate a factor(s) that promotes retrotransposition.","['Department of Radiation Oncology and Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. geile+@pitt.edu']","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,"['CA39851/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE08798/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'T15-HG00015-08/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To further characterize this AML cell hierarchy, we evaluated the coexpression of CD34 and c-kit (CD117) on cells that are capable of long-term proliferation in vitro and in vivo.AML cells were sorted for coexpression of CD34 and c-kit (CD117) using two c-kit monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), clones 95C3 and 104D2. Sorted subfractions were evaluated for the ability to produce colony-forming units (CFU) for up to 8 weeks in suspension culture (SC) and for the capacity to repopulate NOD/SCID mice. When expression of c-kit on blood cells from 19 AML patients at diagnosis was compared using both mAbs, expression defined by 104D2 (34% +/- 6% c-kit(+)) was somewhat higher than that defined using 95C3 (18% +/- 4%). AML cells were sorted for coexpression of CD34 and c-kit using both c-kit mAbs, and the subfractions were assayed in vitro and in vivo. Whereas the majority of AML blast cells lacked expression of CD34, most AML cells capable of proliferating to produce CFU after 4 to 8 weeks in SC were CD34(+)/c-kit(-). Cultures of sorted CD34(+)/c-kit(-) cells, supplemented with steel factor, were composed of a large proportion (18% to 87%) of CD34(+)/c-kit(+) cells after 1 week, suggesting that either c-kit expression was upregulated or CD34(+)/c-kit(+) cells were produced. Moreover, the CD34(+)/c-kit(-) subfraction was found to be capable of responding to steel factor alone to produce CFU after 4 weeks in SC. In most AML patients tested (11/15), the only sorted subfraction capable of engrafting NOD/SCID mice was CD34(+)/c-kit(-). The CD34(+)/c-kit(+) subfraction from only 2 of the 15 patients and CD34(-) cells from 3 patients also engrafted the NOD/SCIDs. Only the CD34(+)/c-kit(+) subfraction of normal bone marrow engrafted. These studies suggest that primitive AML cells capable of long-term proliferation in vitro and NOD/SCID repopulation differ from primitive normal progenitor cells in their lack of surface expression of c-kit.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Here, 45 patients with CML were treated with busulfan (Bu) 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide (Cy) 120 mg/kg before allogeneic BMT from an HLA-identical sibling 27 (60%) or a 1-antigen mismatch donor 18 (40%). Eighteen patients (40%) were in the early chronic phase (CP) and 27 (60%) in late CP. We used cyclosporin-A (CsA) in 20 patients and cyclosporin-A-methotrexate (CsA-MTX) in 25 for graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. RESULTS: We observed a high incidence of acute and chronic GVHD (69% and 67%, respectively). A multivariate analysis identified differences in the sex of the donor and the recipient (p = 0.03) and grade III-IV acute GVHD (p = 0.0001) as significant adverse influences on disease-free survival. Age, sex, chronic GVHD, disease phase, one antigen-mismatch and use of CsA or CsA-MTX had no statistical significance. The 3-year probabilities of relapse, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 11%, 55%, and 60%, respectively. Transplant-related mortality occurred in 31% of the cases. The high frequency of GVHD is explained by HLA determination by serological typing, differences in sex between the donor and recipient, and a high proportion (40%) of 1 antigen-mismatch donors. CONCLUSIONS: BMT is a procedure feasible for patients with CML in early and late chronic phase and even in those with an HLA non-identical donor. Strategies directed to decrease acute GVHD could improve the outcome of these patients.","['Departamento de Hematologia, Programa de Trasplante de Medula Osea, Hospital de Especialidades, Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Mexico, D.F., Mexico. velaj12x@df1.telmex.net.mx']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Committed Th1 cells cannot be induced to change their cytokine profiles in response to antigenic stimulation and Th2 cytokine-inducing conditions. Here, we report that ectopic expression of GATA-3 induced Th2-specific cytokine expression not only in developing Th1 cells but also in otherwise irreversibly committed Th1 cells and a Th1 clone, HDK1. Moreover, cAMP, an inhibitor of cytokine production by Th1 cells, markedly augmented Th2 cytokine production in GATA-3-expressing Th1 cells. Ectopic expression of GATA-3 in developing Th1 cells, but not in Th1 clone HDK1, induced endogenous GATA-3, suggesting an autoregulatory mechanism for maintenance of GATA-3 expression in Th2 cells. Structure-function analyses of GATA-3 revealed that the NH(2)-terminal transactivation domain and the COOH-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA-3 were critical, whereas the NH(2)-terminal zinc finger domain was dispensable for the induction of IL-4. Both zinc fingers, however, were required for IL-5 induction. A Th2-specific DNaseI-hypersensitive site of the IL-4 locus was detected in GATA-3-expressing Th1 cells. Thus, GATA-3 can change the phenotype of committed Th1 cells, previously considered to be irreversible.","['Department of Immunology, DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, California 94304-1104, USA.']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,PMC1887713,,,,,,,,,,,

Notch3 is expressed in CD4(-)8(-) thymocytes and is down-regulated across the CD4(-)8(-) to CD4(+)8(+) transition, controlled by pre-T-cell receptor signaling. To determine the effects of Notch3 on thymocyte development, transgenic mice were generated, expressing lck promoter-driven intracellular Notch3. Thymuses of young transgenics showed an increased number of thymocytes, particularly late CD4(-)8(-) cells, a failure to down-regulate CD25 in post-CD4(-)8(-) subsets and sustained activity of NF-kappaB. Subsequently, aggressive multicentric T-cell lymphomas developed with high penetrance. Tumors sustained characteristics of immature thymocytes, including expression of CD25, pTalpha and activated NF-kappaB via IKKalpha-dependent degradation of IkappaBalpha and enhancement of NF-kappaB-dependent anti-apoptotic and proliferative pathways. Together, these data identify activated Notch3 as a link between signals leading to NF-kappaB activation and T-cell tumorigenesis. The phenotypes of pre-malignant thymocytes and of lymphomas indicate a novel and particular role for Notch3 in co-ordinating growth and differentiation of thymocytes, across the pre-T/T cell transition, consistent with the normal expression pattern of Notch3.","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Pathology, University La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptor, Notch4)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '146991-60-8 (Notch4 protein, mouse)']",,,,['B.40/Telethon/Italy'],PMC313949,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been suggested that IL-10 may be involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Using an ELISA we investigated the presence of IL-10 in the serum and blister fluid of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) patients with active disease and those in prolonged clinical remission compared with normal controls. Sera from patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP), ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP), oral pemphigoid (OP) and blister fluid from five patients with BP were also studied. Increased levels of IL-10 were detected in the sera of 87.5% of patients with active PV and were statistically significant (P=0.0003) when compared with levels in normal human serum. Lower levels of IL-10 were detected in 12.5% PV patients in remission and were statistically significant (P=0.0001) when compared with levels in patients with active disease. Levels of IL-10 were detected in sera of 4.6% (1 of 24) of the normal controls. The levels of IL-10 were approximately four times higher in blister fluids than levels in the serum in the same PV patients. This difference was highly statistically significant (P=0.0008). A correlation was observed between serum levels of IL-10 and titres of pemphigus autoantibodies and with disease severity. Elevated level of IL-10 was detected in the blister fluid from five BP patients. Levels of IL-10 in the sera of patients with BP, OCP and OP were not significantly increased. These preliminary data suggest that IL-10 in concert with other cytokines may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PV and BP.","['Department of Oral Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']","['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,['EY08379/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The adult liver still provides a favourable environment for extramedullary haematopoiesis. Nevertheless, regulation of liver haematopoiesis by cell-cell contacts or by cytokines remains poorly understood. Recently, we have shown that rat liver epithelial cells (RLECs) support long-term survival and multilineage differentiation of adult human CD34(+)and CD34(+)/CD38(-)haematopoietic cells obtained from granulocyte-colony stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood and from bone marrow respectively. In addition, the importance of physical proximity between haematopoietic cells and RLECs was clearly demonstrated. Here, our findings give evidence that RLECs belonging to the epithelial but non-parenchymal liver compartment also sustain the long-term production of progenitors from human CD34(+)umbilical cord blood cells. Moreover, to better analyse the regulation of haematopoiesis in this RLEC coculture model, we have investigated the cytokine expression by RLECs alone and by RLECs coming from coculture with CD34(+)cells from umbilical cord blood. We demonstrated that a broad spectrum of cytokines acting at different stages of haematopoiesis is produced by RLECs. Interestingly, an upregulation of leukemia inhibitory factor expression by RLECs in presence of CD34(+)haematopoietic cells was observed. These data suggest an important role of cell-cell interactions in the regulation of haematopoiesis.","['INSERM Unite 522 ""Regulations des Equilibres Fonctionnels du Foie Normal et Pathologique"", Hopital de Pontchaillou, Rennes, France. mickael.rialland@rennes.inserm.fr']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We carried out a case-control study in Quebec, Canada, including 491 incident cases aged 0-9 years and as many healthy controls matched on age and sex. Each parent was interviewed separately with respect to smoking habits during and after pregnancy. In addition, we carried out a case-only substudy with 158 cases classified according to presence or absence of the alleles *2A, *2B, and *4 in the CYP1A1 gene. RESULTS: There were small risk increases with maternal smoking during the later trimesters. Interaction odds ratios were increased (although often not significantly) for the CYP1A1*4 allele at high levels of maternal smoking in the last trimesters and at low level of paternal postnatal smoking, and decreased for the CYP1A1*2B allele. The latter appeared to confer a protective advantage at low levels for maternal prenatal smoking and at high levels for paternal postnatal smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Reported smoking habits showed no association with leukemia; risks for genetic polymorphisms lacked precision but indicated that the effect of parental smoking could be modified by variant alleles in the CYP1A1 gene.","['Joint Department of Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. cirivard@epid.lan.mcgill.ca']","['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We engineered human T lymphocytes with herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase and neomycin resistance genes, with an LXSN-derived vector that confers a ganciclovir-specific sensitivity to the transduced T cells. We analyzed proliferation, interleukin-2 production, alloreactivity in a mixed lymphocyte culture, and clonogenicity during the different stages of retroviral infection and G418 selection. Our results confirm that a sufficient number of transduced T lymphocytes can be obtained after selection for clinical studies. Their proliferative activity, alloresponsiveness, and ability to produce and respond to interleukin-2 were retained. Compared with control populations, their clonogenicity, as assessed by limiting dilution assays, was reduced after retroviral infection and G418 selection by 1.6 and 2.9 logs, respectively, with both viral supernatant incubation and coculture procedures. This study shows that infection and selection with the thymidine kinase-neomycin resistance gene retroviral vector significantly reduces the number of functional T lymphocytes.

The authors review and critique research studies that evaluated the impact of treatment for childhood cancers. Implications for nursing practice are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Research to evaluate the effects of treatment on neurocognition and behavioral and social competency of children with cancer has produced conflicting results. Most studies found deleterious effects on all three areas associated with childhood cancer treatment. Some studies, however, found no differences between childhood cancer survivors and children on therapy compared to normative data or healthy controls. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Knowledge of the short- and long-term impact of treatment for childhood cancer on neurocognition and behavioral and social competence allows nurses to design interventions that mitigate neurocognitive effects, decrease behavioral problems, and improve social competence.","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, USA.']",,80,,,,,,,['J Soc Pediatr Nurs 2000 Oct-Dec;5(4):188'],,,,,,,,

Aim of this study was to report experience of the Padua Apheresis Unit on a series of children weighting < 15 kg who have undergone such an apheresis procedure. METHODS: This retrospective study includes 15 pediatric patients affected with various malignancies (neuroblastoma: 7; acute myelogenous leukemia: 3; rhabdomyosarcoma: 2; PNET: 1; retinoblastoma: 1; Burkitt's lymphoma: 1) collecting peripheral blood stem cells by a Cobe Spectra blood cell separator. Main procedure parameters, including vascular access, leukapheresis duration, blood flow rate, processed blood volumes, side effects, mononuclear and CD34+ cell yields, have been registered. RESULTS: Altogether 22 sessions have been carried out, by processing a mean of 2.8 blood volumes. No leukapheresis related complications have been recorded, such as hypotension, hypocalcemia and hypothermia. Noteworthy, in 4 procedures two or more peripheral venipunctures have been performed to ensure an adequate blood flow. CONCLUSIONS: Leukapheresis for peripheral blood stem cell collection can be safely and efficaciously carried out in pediatric patients, even weighing < 15 kg, on the condition that certain aspects of apheresis practice in children (vascular access, volume shifts, anticoagulation, side effects) are carefully considered.","['Servizio di Immunoematologia e Trasfusionale, Azienda Ospedaliera di Padova.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,Raccolta di cellule staminali periferiche in oncoematologia pediatrica.

For many years it has been suggested that this response is directed to an MuLV-encoded peptide as well as to a nonviral tumor-associated peptide. Recently, a peptide from the leader sequence of gag was demonstrated to be the MuLV-derived epitope. Here we describe the molecular identification of the tumor-associated epitope. Furthermore, we show that the CTL response against this epitope can restrict the outgrowth of MuLV-induced tumors in vivo. The epitope is selectively presented by the MuLV-induced T cell tumors RBL-5, RMA, and MBL-2 as well as by the chemically induced T cell lymphoma EL-4. Intriguingly, these tumors share expression of the newly identified epitope because they represent variants of the same clonal tumor cell line, as evident from sequencing of the TCR alpha- and beta-chains, which proved to be identical. Our research shows that all sources of RBL-5, RMA, RMA-S, MBL-2, and EL-4 tumors are derived from a single tumor line, most likely EL-4.","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']","['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Oligopeptides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall success rate (survival of neutropenia, both with and without protocol modification) was 90%: 39% without modification and 51% with modification. We documented a significant difference in documented infections (DI) and fever of undetermined origin (FUO): success without modification was lower in DI and higher in FUO. Failure (death due to documented or presumed infection) was recorded in 10% of all episodes. Episodes with severe neutropenia were treated in 48% of cases without modification and in 41% with modification. No significant difference was observed in the status of underlying disease. 33% of gram-negative bacteria responsible for bloodstream infections were resistant to ceftazidime, of which 21% were multiresistant strains. We conclude that initial chemotherapy with ceftazidime plus amikacin remains a reasonable option for treating febrile and prolonged neutropenia, although patients with DI are likely to require additional or modified treatment.

Because of the reported discrepancy in childhood leukemia incidence rates an analysis of the SEER database was undertaken. METHODS: The latest SEER data (1973-1995) were analyzed for trends in childhood (age 0-14) leukemia incidence rates by histologic group (all leukemia combined, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute mylogenous leukemia (AML), and other acute leukemia) for each SEER reporting region. RESULTS: A significant increase in ALL during 1973-1995 was observed in the combined SEER data, but the increase was a function of whether the first 3 years, data from the SEER Detroit reporting region are included. For the years 1973-1975 the Detroit region reported to much lower rates for ALL and much higher rates for ""other acute leukemias"" relative to the other SEER regions, resulting in an exaggerated temporal increase in ALL. CONCLUSION: Excluding both the temporal variability, and coding differences for Detroit in the 1973-1975 time frame, there has been no significant increase in childhood leukemia of any histologic group or age category in the United States from the 1970s to 1990s.","['PHB Hagler Bailly Inc., NW, Washington, DC 20006, USA. gliberson@hagler-bailly.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pentostatin was administered at a dosage of 4 mg/m2 every week for the first 3 weeks, then every 14 days, followed by maintenance therapy of 4 mg/m2 monthly for a maximum of 6 months. We have previously reported the results in T- and B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia This report focuses on the outcome in T-cell malignancies: T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Sezary syndrome, mycosis fungoides, and T-zone lymphoma. Of 92 patients with these diagnoses enrolled, 76 were evaluable for response and toxicity, ie, 25 of 28 with T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 21 of 26 with Sezary syndrome, 22 of 26 with mycosis fungoides, and eight of 12 with T-zone lymphoma. All patients had progressive and advanced disease. Sixteen patients (21%) died during the first 9 weeks of treatment: 12 of progressive disease, two of infectious complications thought to be unrelated to treatment, one of myocardial infarction, and one of renal failure related to administration of intravenous contrast. Major toxicity (grades 3 and 4) included infection in 10.5% of patients, nausea/vomiting in 5%, and hepatotoxicity in 3%. One patient (1.3%) achieved a complete remission and 15 (19.7%) a partial remission. Better results were achieved in patients with Sezary syndrome or mycosis fungoides (complete remission + partial remission = 33.4% and 22.7%, respectively) than in patients with T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (8%) or T-zone lymphoma (25%). We conclude that pentostatin is active in low-grade T-cell malignancies. Toxicities are mild to moderate at the dose schedule administered. Severe hematologic toxicity has not been observed.

In fact, the evolution of research in the area of molecular aberrations in CLL and their impact on treatment resistance alone is striking. These data, along with the advent of the purine analogs, have been central to this paradigm shift. The inferior response rate, the abbreviated response duration, and the inability to prolong survival with alkylating agents such as chlorambucil have resulted in purine analogs being used as first- and second-line therapy for patients with CLL. In fact, patients treated with fludarabine have a higher overall and complete response rate as well as a disease-free survival advantage compared with patients treated with alkylator-based therapy. Pentostatin, the first purine analog to enter clinical trials, was never subjected to extensive schedule optimization despite its demonstrated efficacy and its paucity of significant myelosuppression compared with the other purine analogs. However, pentostatin induced a 25% to 30% response rate in heavily pretreated CLL patients, including some who had received prior fludarabine, suggesting possible non-cross-resistance. Based on preclinical data demonstrating synergistic activity when a DNA damaging agent (eg, an alkylating agent) is followed by an inhibitor of DNA repair (a purine analog), a number of purine analog/alkylator combinations have been and are presently being examined in a variety of lymphoid neoplasms. While the clinical data conflict, at least two phase II studies examining a combination of a purine analog and an alkylator in untreated patients with CLL have generated promising data. This report describes the scientific justification and the design of a new phase II study examining the combination of pentostatin and chlorambucil with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor support for patients with untreated, treated, and fludarabine-refractory B-cell CLL.","['Hematology/Oncology Department, Brooke Army Medical Center, San Antonio, TX 78234, USA.']","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although fludarabine is the most widely tested purine analog in CLL, myelosuppression has limited its use in combination chemotherapy regimens. Because pentostatin (Nipent; SuperGen, San Ramon, CA), a related purine analog with proven activity in CLL, has less myelosuppression, we postulated that it would prove advantageous and could be more readily combined with alkylating agents. We are conducting a phase I/II trial of combination chemotherapy with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide for previously treated patients with CLL. Patients need to have Rai high-risk disease or ""active"" intermediate-risk disease. The treatment regimen consists of a fixed dose of pentostatin (4 mg/m2) combined with an increasing dose of cyclophosphamide. We plan to treat cohorts of three patients each at cyclophosphamide dose levels of 600, 900, 1,200, 1,500, and 2,000 mg/m2. Cycles will be repeated every 21 days. If unacceptable toxicity is encountered at one dose level, then three additional patients (total of six patients) will be accrued to that dose level before further dose escalations will be permitted. A second instance of unacceptable toxicity will close that dose level and identify the preceding level as the phase II dose. Additional patients will be accrued to the phase II dose level to better assess response. Supportive measures include the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (5 microg/kg/d) to limit neutropenia. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim will be given as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and acyclovir will be administered as prophylaxis for herpes zoster.

Due to evidence that the drug was effective in lymphoproliferative disease, patients with HCL were treated with pentostatin. The promising initial results led to phase II studies in both untreated and previously treated patients. These studies demonstrated that pentostatin was highly effective as a single agent, with complete responses seen in 60% to 90% of patients. These responses were durable without maintenance chemotherapy and were seen in patients previously treated with interferon or chemotherapy. Toxicity was usually mild, with nausea and skin rashes predominating. When seen, infections resulting from neutropenia occurred early in treatment.

However, advances in medical science in recent years have prompted some alterations to this purely morphological classification. In the comprehensive new classification four categories are distinguished, such as I. Primary MDS, II. MDS with myeloproliferative features, III. Mutagen induced (secondary) MDS and IV. MDS with hereditary predisposition. Treatment of MDS patients is nowadays stratified according to age of patient, availability of an HLA-identical sibling donor and risk assignment. Therapeutic strategies have been inspired by either missionary approaches converting premalignant cells into normal behaviour or by crusader tactics destroying non-compliant elements at the expense of innocent bystanders. Since apoptosis appears to be final pathway by which the hematopoietic cells undergo premature cell death, reversal of apoptosis would be the principal goal in the missionary treatment. The rational approach to suppress apoptosis would either aim at eliminating inducers of apoptosis or at preventing apoptosis by the administration of factors that can shift the balance to cell survival. Intensive acute leukemia-type treatment studies showed complete remission rates varying from 15% to 64%. The prolonged cytopenia leads to high early death rate. Transplantation of allogeneic stem cells has proven to be the only curative treatment option, but the expense of considerable transplant related mortality. The elaboration of risk adapted treatment algorithms has been much facilitated by the publication of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), which uses marrow blast percentage, cytogenetic data and number of cytopenias to delineate low, intermediate (1 and 2) and high risk categories.","['Szegedi Tudomanyegyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar, Szent-Gyorgyi Albert Orvos- es Gyogyszeresztudomanyi Centrum, Szeged II.']",,47,,,,,Ujabb ismeretek a myelodysplasticus szindroma klasszifikaciojaban es kezeleseben.,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation of L5178Y-S PFU in cytochalasin resulted in polyploidy (> or =32C) and most polykaryons (>75%) ultimately underwent apoptosis, detected using chromatin condensation and externalised phosphatidylserine. However, large polykaryons carrying terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL)-labelled DNA strand breaks were not observed, presumably due to rapid loss of DNA. Gamma irradiation of PFU prior to cytochalasin exposure caused a reduction in the frequency of highly polyploid cells (>16C), consistent with either a supra-induction of apoptosis or a reduction in the ability of PFU to reach high ploidies.

The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of cells from two human cancer types to synthesise PpIX after ALA administration. Biopsies of glioma cells have been obtained from patients with glioblastomas that have or have not been given ALA IV (ex vivo incubation). Peripheral blood lymphocytes, obtained from leukemic patients, have also been ALA-incubated in vitro. In glioma cells, fluorescence heterogeneity was extensive either in ALA infused patients or in ex vivo ALA incubated cells. Mean intensities after 3 h were 110 cts (range 0-340) and 1000 cts (range 0-3600). Similar results were found in leukemic lymphocytes where cell fluorescence varied from 0 to 480 cts with a percentage of fluorescent cells varying with time and from one patient to another. Furthermore, PpIX was not detectable in two patients with CLL. These observations suggest that a marked heterogeneity of ALA uptake and/or PpIX synthesis exists in a given human cancer cell population particularly after systemic administration. Improvements for ALA transformation into PpIX are strongly recommended to ensure the efficacy of ALA/PpIX-PDT.","['Departement Laser, Hopital Laennec, Nantes, France.']","['0 (Protoporphyrins)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary tumor had been present and unchanged for as long as 40 years before excision. Typical trichogenic TB with dystrophic calcification and even ossification was still present peripheral to the malignant transformation. The malignant neoplasm consisted of basaloid cells, spindle cells arranged in fascicles and densely packed rounded nests or ""cell balls."" The metastases consisted of immature basaloid cells and cell balls, and the recurrences became successively more undifferentiated. The residual TB reacted with antibodies to cytokeratin (CK) 6, 8, 14, and 17 and focally to S-100; the malignant primary tumor reacted uniformly with antibodies to vimentin and only focally with antibodies to CK and S-100. The metastatic tumor had lost epidermal CK expression but maintained expression of S-100 in paraffin-embedded tissues. Trichoblastic differentiation was confirmed in frozen tissues with antibodies to hair keratins. No expression of p53 or bcl-2 was identified, but p-glycoprotein (MDR-1 gene related) was expressed by primary and metastatic tumor cells. We believe that this neoplasm is best classified as a trichoblastic carcinoma arising in a TB in association with a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This case illustrates that TBs have the potential for malignant transformation and aggressive behavior.","['Institute of Pathology, University of Graz Medical School, Austria. sigrid.regauer@email.kfunigraz.ac.at']",['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a 180 amino acid single-chain protein, named after its effect on haematopoietic cells. Leukaemia inhibitory factor belongs to a group of cytokines that includes ciliary neurotrophic factor, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, cardiotrophin-1 and oncostatin M. All group members use the gp130 signal transducing subunit for intracellular signalling, but show differences in biological effect. 2. Research over the past 6-8 years has shown LIF to have potent neuromuscular activity. In vitro and in vivo studies on axotomy and nerve crush models demonstrate a powerful effect of LIF in enhancing the survival of both motor and sensory neurons, while reducing denervation-induced muscle atrophy. In models of both axotomy induced neuronal death and in the wobbler mouse, LIF is active at doses as low as 1 microgram/kg delivered systemically. 3. In muscle, LIF will increase the rate of muscle regeneration in vivo when applied exogenously after injury and will stimulate intrinsic muscle repair following its targeted release to dystrophic muscle in the mdx mouse. Leukaemia inhibitory factor may also have a role as an adjunct to myoblast transfer therapy, with studies showing that the transplantation of genetically competent myoblasts into mdx mouse muscle is enhanced when cells are injected with LIF. 4. Distribution and pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in primates with doses of 20 micrograms/kg recombinant human LIF given subcutaneously over 2 weeks tolerated without major side effects. 5. A pharmaceutical form of recombinant human LIF (AM424; AMRAD Operations, Richmond, Victoria, Australia) entered human clinical trials during 1997 and a phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers has been completed. A phase I repeat dose study has also been completed in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The primary indication for a phase II study is the treatment of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. Other potential indications include muscle wasting diseases, acute nerve trauma and motor neuron disease. 6. The role of LIF in modulating nerve loss should make it an ideal candidate for the treatment of a number of neurological conditions. The phase I study represents the first trial in a programme for the clinical development of AM424.","['AMRAD Operations Pty Ltd, Richmond, Victoria, Australia. jkurek@amrad.com.au']","['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neuromuscular Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rise of such a parameter should ideally precede the date of significant microbiologic findings or justify additional intensive search for a focus of infection even in patients without pyrexia. However, the literature concerning the significance of CRP, proinflammatory cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules in the clinical evaluation of neutropenic fever is surprisingly small. In the case of procalcitonin, available data look very preliminary. Furthermore, in case of CRP, it appears that the widespread view that its determination may add substantially to the clinical evaluation of neutropenic fever is not well founded by most clinical trials listed here. Most of the studies available demonstrate several limitations such as poor design and small size of the study population. Additionally, studies were heterogeneous with respect to patients recruited (children and adults, patients with leukemia and patients with solid tumors) and compared different categories of febrile episodes. None of the investigators analyzed cost-effectiveness or impact of serial measurements of these parameters on patients' outcome. To our knowledge no single multicenter trial has been published addressing this issue. Although the group of proinflammatory cytokines and known acute-phase reactants will surely grow, more data on relevance of the available parameters in the diagnosis of neutropenic fever are needed.","['Abteilung Interne Medizin, Knappschaftskrankenhaus Bochum-Langendreer, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum.

One of the spicamycin derivatives, KRN5500, shows a broad spectrum of antitumor activity against human tumor xenografts in nude mice. In this study, we first investigated the differentiation efficacy of spicamycin and KRN5500 in HL-60 and acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, NB4, and found that low concentrations of both compounds induced differentiation to a small extent in both cell lines, but markedly induced apoptosis in NB4 cells. Further investigation in a myeloid leukemia cell line, NKM-1, a lymphoma cell line, Daudi, and a multiple myeloma cell line, NOP-1, showed that high concentrations of both compounds also induced apoptosis in these cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) determined by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed that myeloid cells were more sensitive to both compounds than lymphoid cells, and spicamycin was more potent than KRN5500. Western blot analysis of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bax expression and immunofluorescence analysis of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein indicated that apoptosis induced by spicamycin and KRN5500 was associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression and modulation of PML protein. Thus, spicamycin and KRN5500 may be useful for the treatment of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms.","['Department of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 3600 Handa-cho, Hamamatsu 431-3192, Japan.']","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '62362-59-8 (septacidin)', '8VH13L5K20 (KRN 5500)']",,,,,PMC5926402,,,,,,,,,,,

This marine alkaloid exhibits marked cytotoxic activities against a range of tumor cells, but its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. We investigated the effects of ASC on DNA cleavage by human topoisomerases I and II. Relaxation assays using supercoiled DNA showed that ASC stimulated double-stranded cleavage of DNA by topoisomerase II, but exerted only a very weak effect on topoisomerase I. ASC is a conventional topoisomerase II poison that significantly promoted DNA cleavage, essentially at sites having a C on the 3' side of the cleaved bond (-1 position), as observed with etoposide. The stimulation of DNA cleavage by topoisomerase I in the presence of ASC was considerably weaker than that observed with camptothecin. Cytotoxicity measurements showed that ASC was even less toxic to P388 leukemia cells than to P388CPT5 cells resistant to camptothecin. In addition, the marine alkaloid was found to be equally toxic to HL-60 leukemia cells sensitive or resistant to mitoxantrone. It is therefore unlikely that topoisomerases are the main cellular targets for ASC. This alkaloid was found to strongly induce apoptosis in HL-60 and P388 leukemia cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that ASC treatment was associated with a loss of cells in the G1 phase accompanied with a large increase in the sub-G1 region. Cleavage experiments with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) revealed that caspase-3 was a mediator of the apoptotic pathway induced by ASC. The DNA of ASC-treated cells was severely fragmented. Collectively, these findings indicate that ASC is a potent inducer of apoptosis in leukemia cells.","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret and INSERM U 524, IRCL, 59045, Lille, France.']","['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '855096HP36 (ascididemin)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beginning on the first day of magnetic field exposure, 1710 mice were treated with one of three levels of split-dose Cobalt-60 gamma-radiation (cumulative 3.0, 4.0 or 5.1 Gy). The remaining 570 mice received sham irradiation treatment. Sections from 10 lymphoid tissues were evaluated histopathologically for hematopoietic neoplasia. The primary statistical analysis used the Poly3 method to compare lymphoma incidences in magnetic field (MF)-exposed and control mice. Secondary analyses used the Cox proportional hazards model to analyze incidence rates for mortality and development of specific types of neoplasia. The mortality incidence rate was increased by ionizing radiation treatment, and all neoplasms were observed sooner in irradiated mice. However, the lifetime incidence of hematopoietic neoplasia was similar in all experimental groups, including those that were not exposed to ionizing radiation. Chronic exposure to MFs did not affect the mortality incidence rates and did not change the relative incidences of hematopoietic neoplasia in mice that received the same ionizing radiation treatment, with the exception of a marginally significant reduced relative risk of 0.97 (P = 0.05) for lymphoblastic lymphoma in mice exposed to a magnetic field and treated with 5.1 Gy. Lymphomas and histiocytic sarcomas were first observed approximately 50 days sooner in mice that were exposed to magnetic fields but not ionizing radiation, although this comparison was not statistically significant and the incidence of hematopoietic neoplasia in these mice was not different from that of mice in the 0 T/0 Gy group.","['Department of Medicine and Department of Radiology, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. jbabbit@ucla.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, they play a fundamental role in chemoprevention of epithelial carcinogenesis and in differentiation therapy. Physiological retinoic acid is obtained through two oxidation steps from dietary retinol, i.e. retinol-->retinal-->retinoic acid. The latter retinal-->retinoic acid step is irreversible and eventually marks disposal of this essential nutrient, through cytochrome P450-dependent oxidative steps. Mutant mice deficient in aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) accumulate retinyl palmitate, retinol and retinoic acid. This suggests a direct connection between the AHR and retinoid homeostasis. Retinoids control gene expression through the nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs) alpha, beta and gamma and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors alpha, beta and gamma, which bind with high affinity the natural ligands all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid, respectively. Retinoids are effective chemopreventive agents against skin, head and neck, breast, liver and other forms of cancer. Differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is based on the ability of retinoic acid to induce differentiation of leukemic promyelocytes. Patients with relapsed, retinoid-resistant APL are now being treated with arsenic oxide, which results in apoptosis of the leukemic cells. Interestingly, induction of differentiation in promyelocytes and consequent remission of APL following retinoid therapy depends on expression of a chimeric PML-RAR alpha fusion protein resulting from a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation. This protein functions as a dominant negative against the function of both PML and RARs and its overexpression is able to recreate the phenotypes of the disease in transgenic mice. The development of new, more effective and less toxic retinoids, alone or in combination with other drugs, may provide additional avenues for cancer chemoprevention and differentiation therapy.","['Laboratory of Cellular Carcinogenesis and Tumor Promotion, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']","['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Retinoids)']",116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of the renal lesion in such cases remains unclear. We report the case of a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia who developed renal failure and nephrotic syndrome while being treated with hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha. The renal biopsy showed features of chronic thrombotic microangiopathy. The patient had serologic and functional evidence of anti-phospholipid antibody. Interferon-alpha is known to cause induction of multiple autoantibodies. We propose that in the context of CML, interferon-alpha treatment can induce pathogenic anti-phospholipid antibodies that result in renal thrombotic microangiopathy. This has important implications for patients with CML receiving immune-stimulating therapy because it suggests that prospective monitoring of such patients for anti-phospholipid antibody might identify those at risk of developing thrombotic microangiopathy. Furthermore, patients with established anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome in this context might benefit from intervention such as early anticoagulation.","['Departments of Nephrology and Pathology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.']",['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that the MAIDS-resistant H-2(d) strains BALB/cByJ and C57BL/KsJ generate MHC class I (K(d)) restricted virus-specific CD8(+) cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that lyse cells expressing either defective or ecotropic gag proteins. In contrast, the congenic BALB.B and closely related C57BL/6J MAIDS-susceptible H-2(b) strains were unable to serve as a source of gag-specific CTLs (Schwarz and Green, 1994), suggesting that anti-gag CTLs might provide a basis for resistance to MAIDS. Although its susceptibility to MAIDS was unknown, the (BALB/c x C57BL/6J) F(1) (CBY6F(1)) strain could also produce H-2(d)-, but not H-2(b)-, restricted, anti-gag CTLs (Schwarz and Green, 1994). Because of this correlation between anti-gag CTLs and resistance to MAIDS, it was important to provide more direct evidence in support of CTL-mediated protection and to determine both the fine specificity of CByB6F(1) anti-gag CTLs, in comparison with the resistant C57BL/Ks and BALB/c strains, and the susceptibility of this F(1) strain to LP-BM5-induced MAIDS. We report here that no symptoms of MAIDS were observed in CBY6F(1) (H-2(dxb)) mice. For F(2) mice, in contrast to the high susceptibility of H-2(b/b) mice, 77% of H-2(d/d) and 81% of H-2(b/d) F(2) mice did not exhibit MAIDS after LP-BM5 infection. These results are in contrast to other published studies that concluded that susceptibility, rather than resistance, is dominant in F(1) (resistant x susceptible or susceptible x resistant) mice. We also show that CBY6F(1) anti-gag CTLs exhibit a fine specificity shared by the MAIDS-resistant BALB/c and C57BL/Ks strains, that is, the immunodominant gag epitope, SYNTGRFPPL, encoded by an alternative open reading frame. Together with our direct demonstration here that in vivo monoclonal antibody (mAb) depletion of CD8(+) T cells converts genetically resistant mice to MAIDS susceptibility, these data on the ability to mount anti-ORF2/SYNTGRFPPL, gag-specific CTL responses strongly suggest that CTLs are a primary factor in determining MAIDS resistance. Accordingly, given the K(d)-restricted nature of the CTLs, the main genetic determinant of resistance appeared to be the codominant expression of the resistant H-2(d) haplotype. Interestingly, however, 19% of H-2(d/b) and 23% of the H-2(d/d) F(2) mice had at least one clinical aspect of MAIDS, suggesting that a non-MHC genetic determinant(s) can negatively influence T-cell protection and thus disease outcome","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, New Hampshire, 03756, USA.']","['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,"['CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50157/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Many biological systems (e.g., cell cycle, apoptosis) require the use of regulated expression systems. We therefore developed a regulated retroviral vector system, TRA99, based on a tetracycline transactivator-dependent LTR, where the MMLV enhancer was replaced with a tetracycline-response element. Using fluorescence-activated flow cytometric analysis of a destabilized green fluorescent protein to monitor expression levels, we optimized the minimal promoter configuration with respect to both activated and repressed transcription. The TRA99 vectors demonstrate regulated expression with activated levels comparable to those of standard retroviral vectors and repressed levels indistinguishable from background.

The expression level of human fucosyltransferase 4 (FUT4) mRNA is high in both colon adenocarcinoma and myeloid cell lines. We will demonstrate here cell-specific expression and transcriptional regulation of the FUT4 gene. FUT4 has two different transcription initiation sites that respectively produce long- and short-form mRNAs. To determine the major FUT4 transcript in colon adenocarcinoma and myeloid cell lines, we analyzed the transcriptional starting sites of the FUT4 gene in myeloid and colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, using 5'-RACE, RT-PCR, and luciferase analysis. The results suggested that the expression level of short-form mRNA is higher than the long-form transcript in the colon adenocarcinoma cell lines and that the expression level of long-form mRNA is higher than the short-form transcript in the myeloid cell lines. Using a luciferase assay, we identified a functional DNA portion within FUT4 genomic DNA that confers a colon adenocarcinoma cell line-specific enhancer, located in nucleotide number (nt) -256 to -44, and a myeloid cell line-specific enhancer, located in nt -686 to -582. The present results suggest that these elements play a critical role in the colon adenocarcinoma and leukemia cell-specific transcriptional regulation of the FUT4 gene.","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toho University, 2-2-1, Miyama, Funabashi, Chiba, 274-8510, Japan. taniaki@phar.toho-u.ac.jp']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.152 (galactoside 3-fucosyltransferase)']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,['GENBANK/AB041774'],,,,,,,

Human growth hormone has the ability to influence certain immune functions; the majority of immune cells express growth hormone receptor (GHR) on plasma membranes. We determined GHR gene expression on different human lymphocyte (JURKAT, CESS) and monocyte (U937, THP1) cell lines by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of GHR mRNA after stimulating the cells with phytohaemagglutinin or phorbolester, human growth hormone and with a combination of these. The receptor gene expression showed differences; in the U937 and CESS cell lines only the stimulants were able to induce GHR mRNA expression; in the case of JURKAT cells even the hormone alone had the ability to express its own receptor gene. Both the increased TNF-alpha production of U937 (but not that of THP1 cells), and the decreased proliferation of JURKAT cells in response to GH stimuli also prove the presence of biologically active GHR on the cell surface. Our data suggest asymmetric interaction between GH or phorbolester-induced signal pathways in U937 cells sharply depending on the temporal sequence of treatments. THP1 monocytes showed no gene expression in response to any of the stimulants. The phenomenon that certain human lymphoid and monocytoid cell lines at different levels of cell differentiation are able to express the GH receptor gene could have importance in the rhGH therapy.","['Department of Genetics, Cell and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University of Medicine, Budapest, 1089, Nagyvarad ter 4, Hungary.']","['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Somatotropin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CPI-2-induced apoptosis in LYN-deficient and BTK-deficient subclones of the DT-40 lymphoma B cell line as effectively as it did in wild-type DT-40 cells. Thus, CPI-2-induced apoptosis is not dependent on the protein tyrosine kinases LYN or BTK. Notably, caspase inhibitor I effectively inhibited CPI-2-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the inhibition of a CPI-2-susceptible protease results in caspase activation, leading to apoptosis in ALL/NHL cells. Unlike the high calpain-expressing ALL/NHL cell lines, myeloid leukemia cell lines HL-60/AML, K562/CML, and U937/AMML, or solid tumor cell lines BT-20/breast cancer, PC-3/prostate cancer, U373/glioblastoma, and HeLa/epitheloid cancer, were not susceptible to the cytotoxicity of CPI-2.

Inducer-mediated differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells is a multiple step process characterized by modulation of several genes as well as by a transient increase in the amount of membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Here we demonstrate that a rapid translocation of PKC activity from cytosol to the membranes occurs during the differentiation induced by HNE. When PKC is completely translocated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (TPA), the degree of HNE-induced MEL cells differentiation is highly decreased. However, if TPA is washed out from the culture medium before the exposition to the aldehyde, HNE gradually resumes its differentiative ability. The incubation of cells with a selective inhibitor of PKC activity, bisindolylmaleimide GF 109203X, partially prevents the HNE-induced differentiation in MEL cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that HNE-induced MEL cell differentiation is preceded by a rapid translocation of PKC activity, and that the inhibition of this phenomenon prevents the onset of terminal differentiation.","['Laboratory of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, University Campus Bio-Medico, School of Medicine, Rome, Italy.']","['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'K1CVM13F96 (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iron is well known to be an important initiator of free radical oxidations. We propose that the principal route to iron-mediated lipid peroxidations is via iron-oxygen complexes rather than the reaction of iron with hydrogen peroxide, the Fenton reaction. To test this hypothesis, we enriched leukemia cells (K-562 and L1210 cells) with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as a model for brain tissue, increasing the amount of DHA from approximately 3 mole % to 32 mole %. These cells were then subjected to ferrous iron and dioxygen to initiate lipid peroxidation in the presence or absence of hydrogen peroxide. Lipid-derived radicals were detected using EPR spin trapping with alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-t-butylnitrone (POBN). As expected, lipid-derived radical formation increases with increasing cellular lipid unsaturation. Experiments with desferal demonstrate that iron is required for the formation of lipid radicals from these cells. Addition of iron to DHA-enriched L1210 cells resulted in significant amounts of radical formation; radical formation increased with increasing amount of iron. However, the exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide before the addition of ferrous iron did not increase cellular radical formation, but actually decreased spin adduct formation. These data suggest that iron-oxygen complexes are the primary route to the initiation of biological free radical oxidations. This model proposes a mechanism to explain how catalytic iron in brain tissue can be so destructive.","['Free Radical Research Institute and ESR Facility, The University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242-1101, USA. freya-schafer@uiowa.edu']","['0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Ferrous Compounds)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,"['P01 CA066081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-81090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3800086,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS517793'],,

SKY permitted reinterpretation of the chromosomal alterations defined by G-banding and identified several cryptic translocations. In agreement with G-band, 6q deletion was detected in all 3 cases. Structural rearrangement involving chromosome X was observed in 2 cases, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated that both translocations involved Xp21-pter. Chromosome 8 translocation was also identified in 2 cases and shared a common breakpoint, 8p23. The present study shows the value of SKY in providing additional information on karyotypic abnormalities.

Over the past 20 years, biochemical studies of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis have largely focused on the preinitiation and initiation stages of transcription. These studies led to the discovery of the class of general initiation factors (TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH), which function in intimate association with RNA polymerase II and are required for selective binding of polymerase to its promoters, formation of the open complex, and synthesis of the first few phosphodiester bonds of nascent transcripts. Recently, biochemical studies of the elongation stage of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis have led to the discovery of several cellular proteins that have properties expected of general elongation factors and that have been found to play unanticipated roles in human disease. Among these candidate general elongation factors are the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), eleven-nineteen lysine-rich in leukemia (ELL), Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB), and elongin proteins, which all function in vitro to expedite elongation by RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing or premature arrest by polymerase through direct interactions with the elongation complex. Despite their similar activities in elongation, the P-TEFb, ELL, CSB, and elongin proteins appear to play roles in a diverse collection of human diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection, acute myeloid leukemia, Cockayne syndrome, and the familial cancer predisposition syndrome von Hippel-Lindau disease. here we review our current understanding of the P-TEFb, ELL, CSB, and elongin proteins, their mechanisms of action, and their roles in human disease.","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City 73104, USA.']",['0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)'],136,,,['GM41628/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

There were scaly, partially vesicular or crusty, erythematous lesions mainly involving the extremities that histopathologically showed peculiar features of focal, total epidermal necrosis accompanied by a lichenoid tissue reaction. He developed the skin eruption after receiving a blood transfusion from his mother when he showed debility induced by vaccination with an alternated live measles virus vaccine. The lesions rapidly regressed after sun exposure. To our knowledge, there has been no report of a similar case despite such unique features. OBSERVATION: We encountered a similar case of columnar epidermal necrosis in a 15-year-old Japanese girl with chronic graft-vs-host disease; the lesions occurred 3 months after the transfusion of peripheral blood stem cells from her HLA antigen-matched brother. However, there was no exacerbation of liver dysfunction, diarrhea, or bone marrow aplasia. The peculiar cutaneous lesions responded well to topical phototherapy. CONCLUSION: These 2 patients shared a similarity in their lesions and circumstances under which the blood transfusion was performed to a debilitated patient from a close family member. We believe that focal epidermal necrosis observed in patients with this condition represents a variant of blood transfusion-associated lichenoid graft-vs-host disease that occurs uniquely in a skin-targeted fashion.","['Department of Dermatology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective study based on review of a BMT database. SETTING: Leukemia/BMT ward of a tertiary care, university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and eighty-seven consecutive patients who received allogeneic BMT between January 1, 1994, and June 30, 1997, at Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Skin biopsy frequency for patients with rashes suggestive of acute GVHD; (2) clinical significance of skin biopsy in the management of patients with suspected acute GVHD after BMT; (3) relationship between severity of clinical GVHD and the likelihood to receive GVHD therapy; and (4) relationship between biopsy status or biopsy result and outcome of BMT (acute and chronic GVHD, transplant-related mortality, and overall and event-free survival). RESULTS: During the early post-BMT period (<30 days after BMT), 88 patients had rashes suggestive of acute GVHD; of these, 51 (58%) underwent skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Skin biopsies were performed more often for higher clinical stages of cutaneous GVHD. There was no significant difference between the patients with positive biopsy findings and those with negative findings, either in the clinical severity of acute GVHD or in likelihood to receive treatment for GVHD. Most (85%) of the patients who underwent biopsies and received GVHD therapy had treatment initiated before skin biopsies were performed or before the results were available. The higher the clinical grade of overall acute GVHD, the more likely it was that the patients were treated for GVHD (P<.001). The outcome of BMT was not influenced by the skin biopsy status or biopsy result. CONCLUSIONS: The biopsy findings correlated poorly with the clinical severity of skin rash suggestive of acute GVHD soon after BMT. The decision to treat suspected acute GVHD depended not on skin biopsy findings but rather on clinical severity of acute GVHD. In this regard, skin biopsy has a limited role in the management of patients early after allogeneic BMT.","['Department of Medicine, Vancouver General Hospital and University of British Columbia.']",,,,['Arch Dermatol. 2000 Jun;136(6):779-80.

It was recently proved that variations of base sequence occurred exclusively in gene 62 (immediate-early gene) in comparison of vaccine Oka virus and parent Oka virus. This variation is presumed to have occurred during passage in guinea pig cells. Live varicella vaccine (Oka strain) has increasingly been used throughout the world.

To compare the biological activities between p51A and p53, cell lines with low-level, constitutive expression of each protein were obtained by cDNA transfection of mouse erythroleukemic cells. Production of p51A with an apparent molecular mass of 57-kilodalton (kD) accompanied induction of p21waf1 and appearance of hemoglobin-producing cells. After DNA-damaging treatment either with ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation or with actinomycin D, the p51A protein accumulated in time courses corresponding to those of wild-type p53, and caused an increase in the hemoglobin-positive cell count. In contrast, p53-accumulated cells underwent apoptosis without exhibiting the feature of erythroid differentiation. The mode of p21waf1 and Bax-alpha upregulations varied between p51A- and p53-expressing cells and between the types of DNA damage. These results suggest the possibility that p51A induces differentiation under genotoxic circumstances. There may be cellular factors that control p51A protein stability and transactivating ability.","['Department of Retroviral Regulation, Medical Research Division, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']","['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TP63 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has recently been shown that the abundance of p27KIP1 is also regulated during apoptosis; p27KIP1 is cleaved by a Z-VAD-fmk-sensitive caspase during apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation in endothelial cells, and also following exposure of myeloid leukaemia cells to etoposide. Here, we investigate p27KIP1 regulation in B- and T-lymphoid cells undergoing apoptosis. We observe that p27KIP1 is down-regulated following exposure to a variety of apoptotic stimuli including an agonistic anti-Fas antibody, cycloheximide and etoposide. Further investigation revealed the existence of two different routes of p27KIP1 regulation in lymphoid cells undergoing apoptosis. The first pathway is utilized by lymphoid cells stimulated through Fas, is abrogated in a caspase-8-deficient T-cell line, and is blocked by the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and Boc-D-fmk. In contrast, the loss of p27KIP1 in cells exposed to cycloheximide and etoposide occurs in the absence of caspase-8 or any Z-VAD-fmk- or Boc-D-fmk-sensitive caspase activities. Thus the down-regulation of p27KIP1 is a common occurrence in lymphoid cells undergoing apoptosis but, depending on the apoptotic trigger, this can be affected by two different mechanisms.","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, BN1 9QG, UK.']","['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basis for the increased doubling time of IL-6-treated M1myc cells was found to be due to the induction of a p53-independent apoptotic pathway. The apoptotic response was not completely penetrant; in the same population of cells both proliferation and apoptosis were continuously ongoing. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 was insufficient to account for the apoptotic response, since deregulated expression of Bcl-2 delayed, but did not block, the onset of apoptosis. Furthermore, our results indicated that the IL-6-induced partial hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb), observed in M1myc cells, was not responsible for the apoptotic response. Finally, the findings in M1 cells were extended to myeloid cells derived from the bone marrow of wild type and p53-deficient mice, where the deregulated expression of c-myc was also shown to block terminal differentiation and induce apoptosis independent of p53. These findings provide new insights into how myc participates in the neoplastic process, and how additional mutations can promote more aggressive tumors.

When implantation does not take place, further changes occur which eventually result in the shedding of human endometrium. The present study was carried out to examine whether there are changes in the cytokine gene expression in human endometrium which are correlated with endometrial function in various phases of the menstrual cycle. The RNase protection assay was performed on carefully dated endometria from normal subjects to characterize the expression of cytokines which potentially contribute to endometrial function. These included: tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF or colony stimulating factor-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNAs. A low level of expression of these cytokine mRNAs was found during the proliferative and early secretory phase. Expression of cytokine mRNA increased during the mid-secretory phase and rose to a peak in the late secretory phase. The level of cytokine mRNA expression during gestation was most akin to that observed during the mid-secretory phase. Individuals with habitual abortion presented with an abnormal expression of IL-1beta and IL-6 mRNA in endometrium, during the mid-secretory phase. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a progressive rise in the expression of cytokines in human endometrium during the secretory phase in natural cycles. Furthermore, the findings show that habitual abortion is associated with the abnormal expression of IL-1beta and IL-6 in the mid-secretory phase.","['Department of Pathology, North Shore University Hospital, Biomedical Science Research Center, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,['CA46866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Based upon the ability of the related serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2) to protect cells against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced cell death, this study was initiated to investigate the potential cytoprotective activity of PI10. Two different expression systems (i.e. plasmids encoding either PI10 alone or PI10 fused to the tag: enhanced green fluorescent protein, EGFP) were utilized to stably transfect an eukaryotic model cell system (i.e. HeLa cells) that neither expresses PAI-2 nor PI10. The level of PI10 expression in the stable transfectants was found to correlate with their resistance to TNFalpha-induced cell death. Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PI10 is able to form SDS-stable complexes (i.e. M(r) >100,000) with a cytosolic protein(s). Increased levels of the PI10-containing complexes can be detected by TNFalpha treatment by preventing intracellular degradative activities with the proteasome inhibitor N-carbobenzyloxy-leucine-leucine-norvalinal. PI10-containing complexes are dissociated with conditions known to separate classical protease-serpin complexes (i.e., 1.5 m ammonium hydroxide in the presence of SDS). These data support a role for the regulation of intracellular protease activities by ov-serpins.","['Department of Vascular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA. rschleef@scripps.edu']","['0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (SERPINB10 protein, human)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,['HL45954/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A mismatch can be introduced in retroviral double-stranded DNA by a pre-existing mutation within the primer binding site (PBS) of the viral RNA genome. In order to evaluate mismatch repair of retroviral double-stranded DNA, Moloney leukemia virus (MLV)-based vectors with a mutation in their PBS were used to infect mismatch repair-competent as well as mismatch repair-deficient cell lines. If the target cells were capable of repairing the mismatch before an infected cell divided, the mismatch within the PBS could be repaired to the wild-type or mutant PBS. If the target cells were unable to repair the mismatch, half the cells in the colony should contain the mutant PBS while the other half should contain the wild-type PBS. To evaluate these predictions, individual colonies were isolated and analyzed by PCR. Almost all mismatch-deficient cell colonies analyzed (cell lines HCT 116 and PMS2-/-) contained both the wild-type and mutated PBS, therefore, mismatches within retroviral double-strand DNA could not be repaired by the mismatch-deficient cells. In contrast, mismatches in approximately 25% of the mismatch repair-competent cell clones analyzed (cell lines HeLa and PMS2+/+) were repaired, while 75% were not.

The prongs have a high binding capacity for the polyA-tails of mRNA and the captured mRNA is directly used to synthesize cDNA on the supports, followed by amplification. The convenience and reproducibility of the procedure allows profiling of gene expression over time, by comparing many different samples. Using the device mRNA was simultaneously isolated and accurately measured from up to 96 different samples of anywhere between 10 and 200 000 cells.

Of interest, 21 patients went off study due to GVHD (5 in the CSP/MTX/PSE group and 16 in the CSP/MITX group [P = .02]), and 11 patients went off study because of alveolar hemorrhage (3 in the CSP/MTX/PSE group and 8 in the CSP/MTX group [P = .22]). The addition of PSE did not result in a higher incidence of infectious complications, bacterial (66% versus 58%), viral (77% versus 66%), or fungal (20% versus 20%), in those receiving CSP/MTX/PSE versus CSP/MTX, respectively. These data suggest that the addition of PSE was associated with a somewhat lower incidence of early posttransplantation complications but did not have a positive impact on the incidence of acute or chronic GVHD or event-free or overall survival.","['Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA. chao0002@mc.duke.edu']","['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used MMB1.10, a myeloid leukemia of C57Bl/6 (B6) origin, to examine the cytolytic pathways employed by syngeneic GVL-mediating, and therefore tumor antigen-specific, T-cell subsets. Wright-Giemsa staining and flow cytometric analysis indicated that MMB1.10 cells exhibited the morphology and markers most consistent with a monocytic-myeloid origin. Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that MMB1.10 cells expressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor types I and H, in vitro assays suggested that these cells were resistant to TNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity. For study of in vivo GVL responses, mice were challenged with MMBl.10 cells, lethally irradiated, and administered anti-Thy-1-treated (T-cell-depleted) bone marrow (ATBM) either alone or in combination with T-cell subsets from MMB1.10-presensitized mice. In regard to CD4+ donor T cells, 4 x 10(6) MMB1.10-presensitized wild-type (wt) cells exhibited increased GVL responses and survival values relative to tumor-challenged recipients of ATBM only. CD4 T cells from either perforin-deficient (pfp0) or Fas ligand (FasL)-deficient (gld) mice exhibited a lower level of GVL activity but did not produce any long-term survivors. Recipients of 5 x 10(6) wt B6 CD8+ T cells had significantly improved survival relative to tumor-challenged mice that received ATBM only. The same dose of gld CD8+ T cells exhibited a reduced but significant level of GVL activity, whereas cells from mice that were perforin-deficient or cytotoxicity doubly deficient (cdd) (ie, lacking perforin and FasL) exhibited no discernable GVL activity. Doubling the gld CD8+ T-cell dose to 10(7) cells resulted in further improved survival of recipients. We conclude that GVL effects mediated by CD4+ T cells can depend on either perforin- or FasL-mediated mechanisms, whereas the CD8+ T-cell subset is heavily dependent on perforin-mediated cytotoxicity.","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']","['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",,,,"['R01 CA60630/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL55593/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ninety-eight cases of AML were diagnosed from September 1986 to March 1990 in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, and in two London hospitals from September 1988 and May 1994 and from July 1992 and July 1994, respectively. Two controls were matched to each case by hospital, year of admission, gender and 5-year age group. Information on solvent exposure was collected by interview. Odds ratios (ORs) were derived with conditional logistic regression. The degree of solvent exposure was determined by three experts blind to the status of the subject with good agreement between them (the kappa coefficient ranged between 0.52 and 0.86). The response rate for cases was 80%. Exposure to solvents was associated with the increased risk of AML (OR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.45-4.39; p = 0.001) and those with probable exposure to solvents were found to have an odds ratio of AML over three times greater than non-exposed. We also found an elevated OR for exposure to oils (OR: 1.56) but this was not statistically significant. There is no clear pattern of increasing risks with increasing duration of employment but a significant risk was found for exposures of 10 years or less. An induction period of less than 10 years or more than 30 years was associated with a significantly raised OR. There was a significant excess of machinery mechanics and fitters among the cases.","['West London Occupational Health Service, UK. wlohs@btinternet.com']",['0 (Solvents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a real-time AGT assay that utilizes a fluorescent guanosine analog (3-methylisoxantopterin, 3-MI). 3-MI fluorescence is quenched in DNA and fluorescence intensity increases substantially with digestion of the oligonucleotide and release of 3-MI. The substrate is a doubled-stranded oligonucleotide with 3'-overhangs on each end and a PvuII recognition site. PvuII is inhibited by O6-methylguanine, positioned within the restriction site. 3-MI is incorporated in the opposite strand just outside of the PvuII restriction site. AGT repairs O6-methylguanine; PvuII cleaves at its restriction site, yielding a blunt-ended double strand, which is then digested by exonuclease III. This releases 3-MI from the oligonucleotide, resulting in an increase in fluorescence intensity. All reaction components (100-microL volume) are monitored in a single microcuvette. Rate of increase in fluorescence intensity is related to the amount of AGT in the reaction mixture. We measured AGT levels in extracts from a leukemia cell line, from leukemic lymphoblasts from patients, and from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal controls. This method may prove useful for mechanistic studies of AGT.","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']","['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion protein responsible for greater than 99% of APL cases, PML-RAR alpha, inhibits PML-dependent apoptotic pathways in a dominant negative fashion and blocks myeloid differentiation by direct transcriptional inhibition of retinoic acid target genes. This transcriptional inhibition is mediated by recruitment of co-repressor proteins and resultant deacetylation of histones in the promoter regions of genes (yet to be identified) that control promyelocyte development. In the presence of high levels of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), both PML-dependent apoptotic mechanisms and myeloid-specific gene expression programs are reactivated. In the clinic, the combination of anthracycline-based chemotherapy plus ATRA cures approximately 80% of APL patients, and a high percentage of relapsed patients can achieve second remissions with arsenic trioxide. With the publication of results from the European APL 93 trial, the 'standard-of-care' for induction treatment of APL now includes ATRA plus concurrent anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The amount and type of consolidation therapy necessary for an individual APL patient remains somewhat of an open question, but at present should include at least two cycles of chemotherapy. Based on recent trials that demonstrate a benefit of maintenance ATRA (+/- low-dose chemotherapy), all APL patients should probably receive some type of maintenance therapy. While the above approach currently cures the majority of APL patients, future improvements in the treatment of this disease will require risk-adapted protocols that incorporate real-time molecular monitoring and appropriate introduction of novel therapeutic agents.","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.

However, it is not known whether NE can induce apoptosis in neonatal cardiac myocytes. This study examined the ability of NE to stimulate apoptosis in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes in vitro. METHODS: Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were exposed to NE alone, NE + propranolol, or NE + prazosin for 24 hours. Apoptosis was assayed by DNA laddering with agarose gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescent terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the expression of Mcl-1. Creatine kinase activity in the cultured medium was used as a measure of the toxicity of NE on myocytes. RESULTS: NE increased DNA laddering on agarose gel electrophoresis and increased the number of apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner. No increase in apoptosis was found in response to NE doses between 1 and 50 mumol/L. NE at concentrations of 100 to 400 mumol/L increased apoptosis from 10% to 31% of cells. The ability of NE to stimulate apoptosis in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes was completely blocked by propranolol, but not prazosin. NE treatment at high concentrations sharply reduced the level of Mcl-1 mRNA, coincident with the increase in the number of apoptotic cells. Creatine kinase activity in the cultured medium was similar among the controls and NE-treated myocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that NE at high concentrations stimulated apoptosis in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes in vitro. Apoptosis induced by NE was associated with down-regulation of Mcl-1. However, NE at the same concentration was not toxic to rat neonatal cardiac myocytes.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']","['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the cytogenetic pattern of childhood leukemia in Taiwanese patients. METHODS: A modified trypsin method of Seabright was used for G-banding of metaphase cells. RESULTS: From October 1996 to January 1999, 111 children with a diagnosis of leukemia were enrolled in the study. Of these, 73 patients had a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 63 of these patients had successful karyotyping of their leukemic cells. Among them, 20 (30.3%) had a normal karyotype, five had hypodiploidy (all had 45 chromosomes), five had low hyperdiploidy (47-50 chromosomes), 16 (24.2%) had high hyperdiploidy (> 50 chromosomes), and 20 had pseudodiploidy. Chromosomal translocation was identified in 24 (36.4%) of the ALL patients, 17 of whom had recurrent translocations including 10 with CD10+ B-precursor ALL [4 with t(9;22), 5 with t(1;19), and 1 infant with t(8;14)(q24;q11)], one neonate with CD10- early pre-B ALL with t(4;11), three B-cell cases with t(8;14), and three T-cell cases [2 with t(11;19)(q23;p13), and 1 (11;14)(p13;q11)]. One B-precursor patient had dic (9;12). Karyotypes of the 30 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) included eight with t(8;21); seven with the French-American-British-M2 subtype (FAB-M2) and one with M1. All four of the patients with M3 had t(15;17), one patient with M4 had inv(16) and 7q-, one with M4Eo (M4 with eosinophilia) had t(7;16)(q21;q22), one with M0 had t(4;11)(q21;q23), and the remaining 11 had a normal karyotype. Three of the five adult-type chronic myeloid leukemia patients had standard Philadelphia chromosome, and the other two had a variant-form of Philadelphia chromosome. Both of the patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and one patient with myelodysplastic syndrome had a normal karyotype. CONCLUSIONS: Most findings were similar to previous reports. Although the high proportion of FAB-M2 patients (7/8) with t(8;21) and the consequently higher frequency (26.7%) of this translocation in the 30 AML cases in this study might have significance, a larger series of cases is needed to establish this finding.","[""Department of Medicine, Chang-Gung Children's Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 402 bone marrow samples from 40 patients transplanted in chronic phase (group 1) and 15 in accelerated/blastic phase (group 2) were analyzed by qualitative and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Regarding clinical outcome, 34/40 (85%) group 1 vs. 8/15 (54%) group 2 patients are alive. Only 1/40 (2.5%) group 1 patient relapsed, as against 6/15 (40%) in group 2 (p = 0. 0002). At qualitative PCR, 8/40 (19%) group 1 vs. 9/15 (60%) group 2 patients were positive, with a significantly greater total number of positive samples in group 2 (33/129, 27% vs. 16/273, 5%; p<0.001). The probability of qualitative PCR positivity >1 year after BMT was significantly lower in group 1 patients (4/40 pts, 10% vs. 9/15 pts, 60%; p = 0.01). At quantitative PCR, 4/8 (50%) group 1 patients were positive only once (< 400 transcripts/microg RNA).

This study investigate the feasibility of collective, Ph-re cells from patients with CML in chronic phase. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 18 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase who had responded to varying degrees to treatment with interferon-a (IFN) were subjected to mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and peripheral blood progenitor cell collection. Nine patients were in complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) and nine were partial responders. IFN was stopped 2 to 4 weeks before the procedure. G-CSF was given by subcutaneous injection once daily at a dose of 10 microg/kg. RESULTS: Five patients underwent one collection procedure only, 10 underwent two procedures and 3 patients had three collections. The median number of nucleated cells (NC) per patient collected was 10.2 x 10(8)/kg (4.4-19.7) and the median number of CD34(+) cells was 2.5 x 10(6)/kg (0.4-9.4). Analyzable cytogenetic data were available for 26/34 (76%) leukapheresis procedures. The median percentage of Ph- negative metaphases for patients in CCR was 100% (73-100). Patients not in CCR had a higher level of Ph-positive cells in their collections (median 23%, range 0-79%, p=0.01). Of the nine patients in CCR, 8 had at least one apheresis from which progenitor cells were 100% Ph-negative; conversely, patients not in CCR had detectable Ph-positive cells in every collection. Four patients have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to collect sufficient Ph negative progenitor cells from patients in CCR but collections from other patients contained significant numbers of Ph-positive cells.","['Haematology Department, Hammersmith Hospital, ICSM, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK. e.olavarria@ic.ac.uk.']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to test the RxFISH technique for better characterization of complex karyotypes in patients with T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL). DESIGN AND METHODS: The study evaluated the cross-species color banding technique in four patients affected with T-PLL previously studied by conventional cytogenetics. RESULTS: All patients showed an abnormal karyotype and three of them had a complex karyotype. The involvement of 14q11 in all four cases, the gain of 8q in three cases and a loss of chromosome 10, 15 and 17 and a gain of chromosome 21 in two cases were noted.

We wanted to evaluate the clinical relevance of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in B-CLL. As the plasma levels of IL-6, IL-1 beta and IL-1Ra have been suggested to be partly dependent on gene polymorphism, the previously described polymorphisms of the IL-1 complex genes and the IL-6 gene were also studied. DESIGN AND METHODS: The plasma levels of these cytokines were measured in a cohort of 36 patients with B-CLL and in 400 healthy subjects. The previously described polymorphisms of the IL-1 complex genes and the IL-6 gene were studied using PCR and RFLP. These data was correlated with other parameters associated with severity and prognosis of B-CLL and a number of clinical and laboratory findings. RESULTS: The plasma concentrations of IL-1 beta and IL-1Ra were lower in B-CLL patients than in normal controls (p < 0.001). The IL-1 beta plasma levels were dependent on the cell immunophenotype score and state of progression of the disease. Moreover, plasma concentrations of IL-6 were elevated in B-CLL patients compared with healthy subjects (p < 0.005) and correlated with disease stage, hemoglobin levels, anemia and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the patients. The allele frequencies of the analyzed genes were similar in patients and controls. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that in B-CLL, plasma levels of IL-1 beta, IL-1Ra and IL-6 differ from normal, and mechanisms other than allelic imbalance of their genes account for the distinct cytokine profiles observed in this disease.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Tampere Medical School, Tampere, Finland. bljahu@uta.fi']","['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about dFdC efficacy in hematologic malignancies, either as a single drug or in combination with other drugs. In this study we have tried to determine whether the cytotoxic effect of Ara-C can be increased by using it in combined therapy with dFdC. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the in vivo part of our study, mice bearing L1210 or P388 leukemia were treated with dFdC and Ara-C. The drugs were administered alone and in combination according to the following schedules: Ara-C and dFdC at the same time, dFdC before Ara-C, and Ara-C before dFdC. The efficacy of the therapy against leukemia (defined as the increase in lifespan, ILS) was assessed as the percentage of the median survival time (MST) of the treated group (T) in relationship to that of the control group (C): ILS=[(MST(C)/MST(T)) -1]x100. In the in vitro part of our study, normal granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) cells as well as CFU-GM cells obtained from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were incubated either with dFdC or Ara-C alone or with adequate concentrations of a combination of these drugs. RESULTS: The in vivo experiment revealed that in both leukemias tested, combined therapy with dFdC given before Ara-C and dFdC given at the same time with Ara-C were more effective than monotherapy with either dFdC or Ara-C. The other treatment schedule (Ara-C before dFdC) did not significantly prolong the survival time of the treated mice bearing L1210 or P388 leukemia as compared with the treatment with dFdC alone. The in vitro experiments showed that dFdC used together with Ara-C acted additively on normal as well as CML CFU-GM cells. Furthermore, the drugs used jointly inhibited the growth of colonies formed by CML CFU-GM cells to a significantly higher degree than normal CFU-GM and the differences were statistically significant in the case of the combination of highest concentrations. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine increased the activity of Ara-C. As these agents incorporate into DNA blocking chain elongation, and moreover, dFdC influences the cytotoxicity of Ara-C, our results could be explained by the drugs acting at these levels. dFdC used jointly with Ara-C may have an important clinical implication in the treatment of CML and other hematologic malignancies in future.","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four equal groups of Sprague-Dawley male rats (four animals in each group; mean+/-S.D. body weight, 183+/-13 g, in their rapid growth phase) were subjected to the following drug treatment: one group was given MTX (0.2 mg kg(-1) body weight) subcutaneously on every fourth day, another received indomethacin (2.5 mg kg(-1) body weight) subcutaneously daily and the third group was given both of these drugs (MTX on every fourth day and indomethacin daily). The fourth group was injected subcutaneously with physiological saline every day to serve as a control group. Total body weight, food and water consumption by animals in each group were monitored every second day for a period of 10 weeks. After this period, liver, spleen and kidneys were excised, weighed and analysed for MTX and dihydrofolate reductase activity. Compared with the groups, which received MTX alone, indomethacin alone, or physiological saline, mean increase (17+/-11 g) in body weight of rats was minimal in the group receiving both MTX and indomethacin. The difference was statistically significant (p=0.001) when the values of mean increase in body weight of rats in different treatment groups after a 10-week treatment were compared. The mean weights of liver and spleen in this group receiving both MTX and indomethacin were also found to be significantly less than the weights of these organs in the control group (p<0.01). There also appears to be a decline in food consumption in this group (p<0.05). This negative effect on growth of animals in this group appears to be not only due to decreased food consumption but also due to increased inhibition of de novo pathway of DNA synthesis. This is supported by increased accumulation of MTX and decreased dihydrofolate reductase activity in this group receiving both MTX and indomethacin, as compared with the group receiving MTX alone. The data indicate an additive effect of MTX and indomethacin on the suppression of growth in young rats, alluding to the notion that patients suffering from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia receiving these two drugs concomitantly over a long period of time might be at a risk of experiencing short-term suppression of growth.","['Department of Biochemistry, The Aga Khan University, PO Box 3500, Stadium Road, Karachi, Pakistan. perwaiz.iqbal@aku.edu']","['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,"['Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, several risk factors have been defined, permitting the definition of a lower risk group of patients who may benefit form less aggressive therapy. The use of an oral antibiotic approach was tested in the current trial. METHODS: From May 1997 to March 1998, 154 episodes of lower risk febrile neutropenia in 128 children with a mean age of 62 (range, 8-200) months were enrolled in this randomized, single-institution trial. Inclusion criteria were fever (> 38 degrees C), neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm(3)), lower risk features (i.e., absence of severe comorbidity factors, good clinical condition, negative blood cultures, control of local infection, no fever during the last 24 hours), and compliance of parents. After 3 days of ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/day administered intravenously [i.v.]) every 12 hours plus amikacin (15 mg/kg/day i.v.) every 24 hours for 3 days, all patients were discharged and randomized to be allocated to 2 treatment arms. Group A (n = 74) received ceftriaxone cefixime (8 mg/kg/day administered orally) every 24 hours for 4 days, whereas Group B (n = 80) was treated with ceftriaxone plus amikacin for 7 days. Failure was defined as the need for second hospitalization during the same episode of neutropenia, or fever during the 7 days after discharge. RESULTS: Most of the patients (49% in Group A and 55% in Group B) had acute leukemia. Fifty-four (72%) children in Group A and 46 (56%) in Group B had fever of unknown origin (P = not significant [NS]). No significant differences were found in the sites of initial infection between the two groups. Overall results were outstanding, with a favorable outcome in 73 of 78 cases (98.6%) in Group A and 78 of 80 cases (97.5%) in Group B (P = NS). Three patients needed a second hospitalization due to failure of the initial therapy: one in Group A and two in Group B. All three did well with secondary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In lower risk febrile neutropenic children receiving anticancer therapy, the efficacy of oral cefixime, given for 4 days after 72 hours of intravenous ceftriaxone plus amikacin, was similar to that of 7 days of parenteral ceftriaxone plus amikacin. The oral outpatient therapy approach to the treatment of lower risk febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy is safe and may be cost-saving. This strategy might be adopted as standard therapy in the future.","['Department of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases, Hospital de Pediatria Prof. Dr. Juan P.

The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) 10-18, a 30-item patient-rated instrument adapted from a previously validated adult version, provided multidimensional information about the symptoms experienced by children with cancer. This instrument was administered to 160 children with cancer aged 10-18 (45 inpatients, 115 outpatients). To confirm the instrument's reliability and validity, additional data about symptoms were collected from both the parents and the medical charts, and retesting was performed on a subgroup of inpatients. Patients could easily complete the scale in a mean of 11 minutes. The analyses supported the reliability and validity of the MSAS 10-18 subscale scores as measures of physical, psychological, and global symptom distress, respectively. Symptom prevalence ranged from 49.7% for lack of energy to 6.3% for problems with urination. The mean (+/- SD) number of symptoms per inpatient was 12.7 +/- 4.9 (range, 4-26), significantly more than the mean 6.5 +/- 5.7 (range, 0-28) symptoms per outpatient. Patients who had recently received chemotherapy had significantly more symptoms than patients who had not received chemotherapy for more than 4 months (11.6 +/- 6.0 vs. 5. 2 +/- 5.1), and those patients with solid tumors had significantly more symptoms than patients with either leukemia, lymphoma, or central nervous system malignancies (9.9 +/- 7.0 vs. 6.8 +/- 5.5 vs. 6.8 +/- 5.0 vs. 8.0 +/- 6.1). The most common symptoms (prevalence > 35%) were lack of energy, pain, drowsiness, nausea, cough, lack of appetite, and psychological symptoms (feeling sad, feeling nervous, worrying, feeling irritable). Of the symptoms with prevalence rates > 35%, those that caused high distress in more than one-third of patients were feeling sad, pain, nausea, lack of appetite, and feeling irritable. Subscale scores demonstrated large variability in symptom distress and could identify subgroups with high distress. The prevalence, characteristics, and distress associated with physical and psychological symptoms could be quantified in older children with cancer. The data confirm a high prevalence of symptoms overall and the existence of subgroups with high distress associated with one or multiple symptoms. Symptom distress is relatively higher among inpatients, children with solid tumors, and children who are undergoing antineoplastic treatment. Systematic symptom assessment may be useful in future epidemiological studies of symptoms and in clinical chemotherapeutic trials. Symptom epidemiology may also provide a focus for future clinical trials related to symptom management in children with cancer.","[""Pain and Palliative Care Service, The New Children's Hospital, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we developed a novel DNA vaccine strategy to induce restricted replication of an avirulent virus and evaluated it in a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection model. We generated a chimeric SIV, FMSIV, by replacing SIV env with ecotropic Friend murine leukemia virus (FMLV) env to confine its replication to FMLV receptor (mCAT1)-expressing cells. In primate cells lacking mCAT1, FMSIV did not replicate unless mCAT1 was introduced exogenously. Vaccination to macaques with both the FMSIV DNA and the mCAT1-expression plasmid DNA induced SIV Gag-specific cellular immune responses and resistance against pathogenic SIV(mac239) challenge more efficiently than the replication-negative control vaccination with the FMSIV DNA alone.

The usual practice was to give very low individual TBI fraction sizes (0.1-0. 25 Gy) several times a week to a total dose of 1.5-2 Gy. Despite this very low total dose, LTBI could induce long term remissions and was always as effective as the chemotherapy to which it was compared. In modern radiotherapy, LTBI is still a valid option in treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and the advanced stages of indolent low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Its use in the early stages of low-grade NHL is under investigation in a large multi-institutional trial. The efficacy of LTBI is believed to stem from three mechanisms, namely; immune-enhancement, induction of apoptosis, and the intrinsic hypersensitivity to low-radiation doses demonstrated in many cell lines and tumour systems. Thus, LTBI seems to provide 'alternative' mechanisms of action against cancer cells. This should encourage researchers to explore strategies that integrate LTBI in new and innovative experimental treatment protocols that explore the possible synergism between LTBI and chemotherapy, biological response modifiers and/or immunotherapy. The increased incidence of secondary leukaemia that occurs when LTBI is combined with alkylating agents and/or total lymphoid irradiation should be kept in mind when designing such protocols as it may limit the use of LTBI in highly curable diseases and young patients in whom long survival is expected.","['Group for Biostatistics in Oncology, Gray Laboratory, Middlesex HA6 2JR, Northwood, UK.']",,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proteins encoded by nonclustered homeobox genes have been shown to be essential for cell lineage differentiation and gene expression in pancreatic islets. Using specific antiserum in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and in vitro transcribed/translated proteins, the nuclear proteins binding domain B of the G3 enhancer-like element of the glucagon gene were identified in the present study as heterodimers consisting of the ubiquitously expressed homeodomain protein Prep1 and the also widely expressed PBC homeoprotein Pbx (isoform 1a, 1b, or 2). These heterodimeric complexes were found to bind also to the glucagon cAMP response element and to a newly identified element termed G5 (from -169 to -140). Whereas the expression of Prep1 or Pbx forms alone had no effect, coexpression of Pbx1a/1b-Prep1 inhibited the glucagon promoter when activated by cotransfected Pax6 or another transcription factor in non-glucagon-producing cells. In contrast, in glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cells, Pbx-Prep1 had no effect on GAL4-Pax6-induced mutant glucagon promoter activity or on Pax6-dependent wild-type glucagon promoter activity. Furthermore, 5'-deletion of G5 enhanced glucagon promoter activity in a non-glucagon-producing cell line but not in glucagon-producing islet cells. This study thus identifies a novel target and Hox-independent function of Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers that, through repression of glucagon gene transcription in non-glucagon-producing cells, may help to establish islet cell-specific expression of the glucagon gene.","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Department of Gastroenteropathology, University of Gottingen, 37075 Gottingen, Germany.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PKNOX1 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-92-5 (Glucagon)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, only a few follow-up studies of children subjected to cardiac catheterization have been performed, yielding inconsistent results. METHODS: Our study group included 674 children who underwent cardiac catheterization due to congenital anomalies, between the years 1950-1970 in three major medical centres in Israel. A registered nurse conducted a review of the children's medical files in each hospital. Demographic data and vital status were ascertained from the Israeli National Registry, using a unique identity number. Subsequently, the study cohort was linked with the Israeli National Cancer Registry, in order to identify cancer cases that had been diagnosed through December 1996, the last follow-up date of the study. RESULTS: Over 75% of the study participants were native-born; 56.2% were males. Approximately 78% of the cohort subjects were alive at the end of follow-up; 28.6% of the participants underwent more than one procedure. All of the diagnosed cases occurred in males. Expected number of malignancies for all sites was 4.75, while the observed number was 11.0 (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 2. 3; 95% CI : 1.2-4.1). Of the 11 cancer cases, 4 lymphomas were observed (0.63 were expected, SIR = 6.3; 95% CI : 1.7-16.2). One of these was Hodgkin's Disease. There were also three cases of melanoma as opposed to 0.62 expected (SIR = 4.9; 95% CI : 1.0-14.2). CONCLUSIONS: This finding is compatible with current knowledge about the carcinogenic effect of low-dose irradiation but differs in the occurrence of an excess of lymphoma in the absence of an excess of leukaemia, which has not been reported before. The dissonance between males and females is yet to be resolved. IMPLICATIONS: Radiation doses that are used currently during cardiac catheterization are lower than in the past. Yet, the procedure is more common and frequently involves longer duration due to therapeutic interventions. The possible long-term results of such an exposure should be kept in mind.","['Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, The Stanley Steyer Institute for Cancer Research, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Municipal incinerators had previously shown significant excesses of adult cancers within 7.5 and 3.0 km. The relative risks for adults had been marginal and an analysis of childhood cancers seemed to offer a more sensitive approach. METHODS: A newly developed technique of analysis compares distances from suspect sources to the birth addresses and to the death addresses of cancer-children who had moved house. A localized hazard, effective at only one of these times, must be preferentially associated with the corresponding address. This creates an asymmetry of migrations towards or away from age-restricted effective sources. RESULTS: The child-cancer/leukaemia data showed no systematic migration-asymmetries around toxic-waste landfill sites; but showed highly significant excesses of migrations away from birthplaces close to municipal incinerators. Relative risks within 5.0 km of these sites were about 2:1. Hospital incinerators gave analogous results. The ratios greatly exceed findings around 'non-combustion' urban sites. CONCLUSIONS: Because of their locations, the specific effects of the municipal incinerators could not be separated clearly from those of adjacent industrial sources of combustion-effluents. Both were probably carcinogenic. Landfill waste sites showed no such effect.",['E.G.Knox@btinternet.com'],"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Hazardous Waste)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Absence of enzyme activity is due to homozygous inherited deletion of the gene, reducing detoxification of carcinogens such as epoxides and alkylating agents and potentially increasing cancer risk. We hypothesized that GST null genotype would increase risk of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia (AML/MDS) in children. DNA was extracted from bone marrow slides of 292 AML/MDS patients. PCR amplification was used to assign GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes for cases and controls. Given that the frequency of the null genotype varies by ethnicity and that the majority of the cases were Caucasian, analyses were restricted to 232 white (non-Hispanic) cases and 153 Caucasian non cancer controls. The frequency of GSTM1 null was significantly increased in AML/MDS cases compared with controls [64 versus 47%; odds ratio (OR), 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-3.1]; P = 0.001], whereas the frequency of GSTT1 null genotype in AML/MDS cases was not statistically different from controls. AML comprises biologically distinct subtypes, and a test for homogeneity revealed a statistically significant difference among subtypes (P = 0.04; df, 8) for GSTM1 only. In particular, there was an increased frequency of GSTM1 null genotypes in French-American-British groups M3 [82%; n = 22; OR, 5.1 (95% CI, 1.6-21.3)] and M4 [72%; n = 53; OR, 2.9 (95% CI, 1.4-6.0)].

In utero and postnatal exposures to various carcinogens may play a role in the etiology of this disease. N-acetyltransferases, encoded by the NAT1 and NAT2 genes are involved in the biotransformation of aromatic amines present in tobacco smoke, environment, and diet. Their rapid and slow acetylation activity alleles have been shown to modify the risk to a variety of solid tumors in adults. To investigate the role of NAT1 and NAT2 variants as risk-modifying factors in leukemogenesis, we conducted a case-control study on 176 ALL patients and 306 healthy controls of French-Canadian origin. Slow NAT2 acetylation genotype was found to be a significant risk determinant of ALL (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.2) because of overrepresentation of the alleles NAT2*5C and *7B and underrepresentation of NAT2*4. Besides a slight increase in NAT1*4 allele frequency among cases, no independent association of NAT1 acetylation genotypes and ALL risk was observed. However, the risk associated with NAT2 slow acetylators was more apparent among homozygous individuals for NAT1*4 (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.4). When NAT2 slow acetylators were considered together with the other risk-elevating genotypes, GSTM1 null and CYP1A1*2A, the risk of ALL increased further, which showed that the combination of these genotypes is more predictive of risk then either of them independently. These findings suggest that leukemogenesis in children is associated with carcinogen metabolism and consequently related to environmental exposures.","[""Service d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Cancerologie Charles-Bruneau, Centre de Recherche, Hopital Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.""]",['EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: To report upon a 31 year follow up of MGUS in a New Zealand community. METHODS: Serum from 2,192 subjects (82% of the adult population) of a New Zealand town was collected in 1967 and subsequently screened by cellulose acetate electrophoresis. Eleven of the 2,192 (0.5%) were found to have MGUS. Clinical correlation was sought in 1970 and subsequently to elucidate the underlying cause. RESULTS: Seven of the 11 patients have developed a haematological malignancy. Two have been diagnosed as having Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, one malignant lymphoma and acute myelomonocytic leukaemia and four developed myeloma. Myeloma developed at one, nine, 23 and 25 years after the original screening. One myeloma patient and one patient with MGUS are currently alive and well, 31 years after discovery of their gammopathy. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of MGUS in this community is only half that detected in a comparable study. The association with haematological malignancy in this study (64%) is considerably higher than that found in the Swedish study (6%), possibly because of the longer follow up in New Zealand. MGUS should not only be studied in depth at the time of its discovery, but needs very long term follow up as the underlying disease may not surface until the third decade.","['Oncology Service, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand.']","['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Collections of PBPC contain large numbers of haemopoietic progenitors and T-lymphocytes when compared with bone marrow (BM). AIMS: To assess the clinical effects and safety of filgrastim-mobilised allogeneic PBPC, in particular whether PBPC would alter the kinetics of engraftment or the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). METHODS: Twenty-seven patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation were randomised to receive BM or BM supplemented by PBPC. Patients were conditioned with busulphan 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg. GVHD prophylaxis was with methotrexate and cyclosporin. Ganciclovir prophylaxis was administered to all cytomegalovirus seropositive patients. No haemopoietic growth factor was used after BMT. Donors of PBPC underwent a single, seven litre apheresis after four days of filgrastim, 10 microg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection. RESULTS: Donor toxicity was mild, with the most frequently reported being bone pain in the cytokine-treated donors. The patients transplanted with BM+PBPC received an eight-fold increase in CD3+ T-lymphocytes (1.65X 10(8)kg vs 0.22 x 10(8)/kg, p=0.04) and the cytokine product contained a median of 5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg. BM+PBPC patients had more rapid engraftment of neutrophils to 0.5x 10(9)/L (17 days vs 19 days, p=0.02) and platelets to 50X 10(9)/L (22 days vs 35 days, p=0.04). BM megakaryocyte numbers were significantly enhanced at days 14 and 28 after BMT (both p=0.04), however platelet transfusions were not significantly different. The incidence, organ distribution, severity and time to onset of acute and chronic GVHD were not different between the treatment groups and there was no difference in overall survival or event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic PBPC from HLA-identical siblings may speed engraftment of neutrophils and platelets without detrimental effects on GVHD or survival.","['Department of Clinical Haematology and Medical Oncology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Vic.']","['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has generally restricted such potentially curative treatment to patients <50-55 years with normal organ function. Recent studies suggest that purine-analogue based non-myeloablative regimens are sufficiently immunosuppressive to facilitate allogeneic donor cell engraftment. AIM: To review the outcome of HLA-compatible sibling allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplants using fludarabine-based conditioning in patients ineligible for a conventional transplant, with emphasis on engraftment, graft vs host disease (GVHD) and graft vs tumour effects. METHODS: Eleven patients (nine > or = 47 years age) with advanced haematological malignancies received one of three different fludarabine-based chemotherapy followed by infusion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilised PBPC. Cyclosporin-methotrexate was used as GVHD prophylaxis. RESULTS: Two patients died early; minimal non-haematological toxicity apart from mucositis occurred in the other nine. Eight of the nine evaluable patients had evidence of durable donor cell engraftment in preference to recipient cells. Acute GVHD (> or = grade 2) occurred in seven of eight patients with donor engraftment who survived beyond two months. Four patients are alive in complete remission 8-28 months post-transplant; another is alive in probable remission at four months. CONCLUSIONS: Fludarabine-based non myeloablative chemotherapy facilitates rapid engraftment of allogeneic donor cells, which produce powerful GVHD and graft vs tumour effects. This approach has the potential to extend the applicability of allogeneic stem cell transplants to patients traditionally regarded as too old or sick for conventional marrow transplants.","['Department of Clinical Haematology and Medical Oncology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Vic.']","['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that a minimum of 31% of adult bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients and 18% of adults with leukemia who are hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness have a community respiratory virus infection. The temporal occurrence of these infections in immunocompromised patients tends to mirror their occurrence in the community. The clinical illnesses range from self-limited upper respiratory illnesses to fatal pneumonias, depending on the type of virus and the type and degree of immunosuppression. The pneumonias may be viral, bacterial/fungal, or mixed. The highest frequency of progression to fatal viral pneumonia has been reported for RSV infections in recently transplanted BMT recipients and myelosuppressed patients with leukemia. Studies have suggested that early therapy for RSV pneumonia with a combination of aerosolized ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin may be of benefit. Defining effective prophylactic and therapeutic strategies will be a challenge, given the diversity of viruses, the wide spectrum of immunocompromised patients with varying vulnerability to serious community respiratory virus disease, and the frequent presence of other opportunistic infections and medical problems. A combination of antiviral drugs and immunotherapy may need to be considered for their potential additive effect as well as to prevent the emergence of resistant virus, as occurs during monotherapy for influenza with amantadine or rimantadine. The optimal therapies need to be defined in controlled trials; however, it appears that a favorable response will hinge on the initiation of therapy at an early stage of the respiratory illness.","['Section of Infectious Diseases, University of Texas M.

The respiratory viruses--which include influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses--cause the majority of these illnesses. Some of these viruses cause illness throughout the year, whereas others are most common in winter. All population groups experience these infections and illnesses. As the number of elderly persons and those with underlying disease increases, awareness is growing that these common infections can have serious consequences. This has recently been emphasized for immunocompromised persons. At the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), infection surveillance of mostly hospitalized adults with leukemia or a recent bone marrow transplant yielded a respiratory virus from 181 of 668 (27.1%) respiratory illness episodes. In descending order of frequency, infections with RSV, rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses were detected in each of three surveillance years. High frequencies of nosocomial acquisition occurred, as has been noted in prior reports. Similarly, persistence of infection and high frequencies of pneumonia and death among infected patients occurred, which have also been noted earlier. At MDACC, pneumonia occurred in 58-78% of infected patients, and 22-44% died. The role of the virus infection in many cases of pneumonia is uncertain, but death from pure viral pneumonia is well documented. A number of immune deficiencies in this patient population and options for control of these infections have been described that can, respectively, account for the medical problem and provide ways to approach prevention and treatment.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",,47,,,['1-AI-15103/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7124320,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study utilized interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) to detect TP53 deletions and trisomy 12 in 101 clinical specimens from 98 patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (B-LPDs). Twelve patients had TP53 deletions (group A), 23 had trisomy 12 (group B), and 63 had neither (group C). The groups did not significantly differ in age, duration of disease, absolute lymphocyte count, or percentage with an immunophenotype or cytology atypical for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The clinical stage of disease and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level were higher in group A, with less response to therapy. After a median follow-up of 19 months, seven of the patients in group A had died of disease (another patient subsequently has had large cell transformation) compared with none in group B and nine in group C. Multivariate analysis found the stage of disease and TP53 deletions as the only parameters independently associated with shortened survival (P < 0.001). Thirty-nine patients had conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) which was complexly abnormal in 11 patients; 6 of whom died of disease. There was a trend for complex cytogenetics to be seen more frequently in group A, often with 17p involvement. For most laboratories, CCA may be the preferable initial study to identify prognostically different subgroups of B-LPDs. However, as more probes and clinical outcome data become available, I-FISH will likely play an increasingly important ancillary role.","['Department of Pathology, Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield, WI 54449, USA.']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies suggested a 33% incidence of grade IV/V non-hematologic toxicity with the use of mitoxantrone 10 mg/M(2) and etoposide 100 mg/M(2), each for 5 days, in this patient population. Since PSC 833 alters the pharmacokinetic excretion of MDR-related cytotoxins, this phase I dose-finding study was performed to identify doses of mitoxantrone/etoposide associated with a similar 33% incidence of grade IV/V non-hematologic toxicity, when given with PSC 833. Mitoxantrone/etoposide (M/E) doses were escalated in fixed ratio from a starting dose of M: 4 mg/M(2) and E: 40 mg/M(2), to M: 7 mg/M(2) and E: 70 mg/M(2), in successive cohorts of eight patients each. PSC 833 was well tolerated and the MTD of this M/E regimen with PSC 833 in this population was M: 6 mg/M(2) and E: 60 mg/M(2). The complete response (CR) rate for all patients was 50% (15/30) and was considerably higher for de novo than for secondary AML.

Our investigation was designed to delineate the biochemical mechanism of AT3 depletion that can occur in the plasma of ALL patients undergoing ASNase therapy. SDS-PAGE showed no cleavage of purified AT3 following treatment with ASNase. Furthermore, purified AT3 treated with ASNase demonstrated no decrease in inhibitory activity. Human plasma and whole blood treated with approximate therapeutic concentrations of ASNase showed no loss of AT3 activity as detected by a plasma-based factor Xa inhibition assay. Treatment of a confluent monolayer of HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma) cells with ASNase showed no gross loss in AT3 message levels detected by rtPCR. However, a decrease of cell viability was observed in cultures treated with ASNase. Interestingly, medium from HepG2 cells treated with ASNase showed a marked decrease in secretion of AT3 and another serpin, heparin cofactor II. Collectively, these data show that ASNase has no direct effect on AT3 in blood or plasma, but that ASNase may affect plasma levels of AT3 by interfering with translation and/or secretion of the protein in liver cells.","['Department of Chemistry, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3290, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Serpins)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,"['5T32-ES-07017/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', '5T32-HL-07149/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-32656/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The pentamer can assemble on a consensus tal-1 binding site. In the pRb(-) SAOS-2 cell line transiently transfected with a reporter plasmid containing six tal-1 binding site, pRb enhances the transcriptional activity of tal-1-E12-Lmo2 and tal-1-E12-Lmo2-Ldb1 complexes but not that of a tal-1-E12 heterodimer. We explored the functional significance of the pentamer in erythropoiesis, specifically, its transcriptional effect on the c-kit receptor, a tal-1 target gene stimulating early hematopoietic proliferation downmodulated in erythroblasts. In TF1 cells, the pentamer decreased the activity of the reporter plasmid containing the c-kit proximal promoter with two inverted E box-2 type motifs. In SAOS-2 cells the pentamer negatively regulates (i) the activity of the reporter plasmid containing the proximal human c-kit promoter and (ii) endogenous c-kit expression. In both cases pRb significantly potentiates the inhibitory effect of the tal-1-E12-Lmo2-Ldb1 tetramer. These data indicate that this pentameric complex assembled in maturing erythroblasts plays an important regulatory role in c-kit downmodulation; hypothetically, the complex may regulate the expression of other critical erythroid genes.","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161 Rome, Italy.']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,PMC85982,,,,,,,,,,,

The proteins contain four to six zinc fingers and function as DNA-binding transcriptional regulators. Various members of the family have been demonstrated to regulate cell movement, neural cell fate, left-right asymmetry, cell cycle, and apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of how these regulators function and the target genes involved are largely unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that human Slug (hSlug) is a repressor and modulates both activator-dependent and basal transcription. The repression depends on the C-terminal DNA-binding zinc fingers and on a separable repression domain located in the N terminus. This domain may recruit histone deacetylases to modify the chromatin and effect repression. Protein localization study demonstrates that hSlug is present in discrete foci in the nucleus. This subnuclear pattern does not colocalize with the PML foci or the coiled bodies. Instead, the hSlug foci overlap extensively with areas of the SC-35 staining, some of which have been suggested to be sites of active splicing or transcription. These results lead us to postulate that hSlug localizes to target promoters, where activation occurs, to repress basal and activator-mediated transcription.","['Program in Molecular Medicine, Department of Cell Biology and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605, USA.']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SNAI1 protein, human)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,"['R01 DK052542/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK52542/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC85958,,,,['GENBANK/AF042001'],,,,,,,

Here we report on the real-time quantification of MRD in 25 ALL patients using LightCycler technology. We designed and adapted allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)-PCR protocols that enabled the detection of >90% of the IGH, IGK, TCRD, and TCRG rearrangements observed in ALL patients. In all patients, at least two suitable markers could be identified (average, 3.4 markers/patient). We applied ASO-PCR with 35 immunoglobulin and TCR rearrangements (11 IGH, 6 IGK, 12 TCRG, and 6 TCRD) and compared the sensitivity and practicability of the LightCycler strategy with conventional ASO-PCR on a block thermocycler followed by quantification with gel electrophoresis. The LightCycler measured leukemia-specific PCR products at each cycle (real-time) by staining the PCR product with the DNA-binding dye SYBR Green I. LightCycler technology showed a higher sensitivity than the conventional method in eight cases, whereas the sensitivity of the other markers matched exactly. The detection level varied between 10(-4) and 10(-6) leukemic cells. Furthermore, we determined the MRD status of 27 bone marrow follow-up samples from 15 ALL patients by both methods and revealed comparable results. However, the LightCycler also allowed accurate quantification in samples containing relatively high levels (>10(-3)) of residual leukemia cells. The conventional ASO-PCR technique comprises various laborious and time-consuming PCR experiments and post-PCR steps to determine the number of cycles with the optimal linearity and sensitivity of the PCR. Real-time quantification through LightCycler technology obviates these post-PCR steps, provides the highest sensitivity via software analysis, and therefore represents a rapid, reliable, sensitive, and cost-effective technique for the routine monitoring of MRD in ALL patients.","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']","['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Quinolines)', '163795-75-3 (SYBR Green I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous in vitro studies suggested that the compound undergoes hepatic biotransformation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A into a more cytotoxic metabolite(s). The present study examined the role of CYP3A-mediated metabolism in the in vivo antitumor activity and host toxicity of MMDX in the mouse model and investigated the potential for increasing the therapeutic effectiveness of the drug by inducing its hepatic CYP-catalyzed activation. We found that MMDX cytotoxicity for cultured M5076 tumor cells was potentiated 22-fold by preincubating the drug with NADPH-supplemented liver microsomes from untreated C57BL/6 female mice. A greater (50-fold) potentiation of MMDX cytotoxicity was observed after its preincubation with liver microsomes isolated from animals pretreated with the prototypical CYP3A inducer pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile. In contrast, in vivo administration of the selective CYP3A inhibitor troleandomycin (TAO) reduced both potentiation of MMDX cytotoxicity and the rate of CYP3A-catalyzed N-demethylation of erythromycin by isolated liver microsomes (55.5 and 49% reduction, respectively). In vivo antitumor activity experiments revealed that TAO completely suppressed the ability of 90 microg/kg MMDX i.v., a dose close to the LD10, to delay growth of s.c. M5076 tumors in C57BL/6 mice and to prolong survival of DBA/2 mice with disseminated L1210 leukemia. Moreover, TAO administration markedly inhibited the therapeutic efficacy of 90 microg/kg MMDX i.v. in mice bearing experimental M5076 liver metastases; a complete loss of MMDX activity was observed in liver metastases-bearing animals receiving 40 microg/kg MMDX i.v. plus TAO. However, pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile pretreatment failed to enhance MMDX activity in mice bearing either s.c. M5076 tumors or experimental M5076 liver metastases. Additional experiments carried out in healthy C57BL/6 mice showed that TAO markedly inhibited MMDX-induced myelosuppression and protected the animals against lethal doses of MMDX. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that an active metabolite(s) of MMDX synthesized via CYP3A contributes significantly to its in vivo antitumor activity and host toxicity.","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Italy. lquintie@ux1.unipd.it']","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '108852-90-0 (methoxy-morpholinyl-doxorubicin)', '1434-54-4 (Pregnenolone Carbonitrile)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '63937KV33D (Erythromycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'C4DZ64560D (Troleandomycin)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, PD180970 potently inhibited autophosphorylation of p210Bcr-Abl (IC50 = 5 nM) and the kinase activity of purified recombinant Abl tyrosine kinase (IC50 = 2.2 nM). Incubation of K562 cells with PD180970 resulted in cell death. Results of nuclear staining, apoptotic-specific poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and annexin V binding assays indicated that PD180970 induced apoptosis of K562 cells. In contrast, PD180970 had no apparent effects on the growth and viability of p210Bcr-Abl-negative HL60 human leukemic cells. Thus, PD180970 is among the most potent inhibitors of the p210Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, which is present in almost all cases of human chronic myelogenous leukemia.

A combination of fluorescent multiplex and Vgamma-Jgamma-specific monoplex follow-up, as described here, will allow detection of both significant clonal evolution and of the diagnostic clone at a level of prognostic significance, by techniques which can readily be applied to large-scale prospective studies for which real-time analysis is required.","['Biological Hematology, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades and Universite Paris V, France.']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,['Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1301-3.

Detailed examination of the various cell types produced in such cultures has now demonstrated the rapid, factor-independent, generation of clonogenic progenitors for all lineages (granulocyte-macrophage, megakaryocyte and erythroid) with the additional appearance within 10 days of large numbers of mature granulocytes, macrophages, and megakaryocytes, as well as occasional erythroid cells. Inclusion of flt3-ligand, Steel factor, IL-3, IL-6, and G-CSF +/- erythropoietin (EPO) in the cultures enhanced only slightly the output of mature cells (except for the erythroid population which was much larger when EPO was added). Analogous subpopulations of normal CD34+ cells produced similar numbers and types of cells but, as expected, only when growth factors were added. Thus primitive CD34+ CML cells proliferating autonomously in vitro recapitulate the full spectrum of differentiation responses of normal CD34+ cells stimulated by IL-3 and G-CSF.

Retinoic acid has been shown to induce differentiation and reduce TF expression in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cells in vitro, and to induce remission in APL patients. Treatment of the APL cell line NB4 with the specific retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha) agonists Ro4-6055 or TTNPB resulted in down-regulation of TF expression and in induction of differentiation. The activation of RARbeta, RARgamma or retinoid X receptor (RXR) did not suppress the constitutive TF expression in NB4 cells. Moreover, the RARalpha antagonist Ro41-5253 blocked the retinoid-induced down-regulation of TF. In contrast, in the monoblastic U-937 cell line only a partial suppression of TF antigen expression and activity was observed by treatment with the RAR agonist TTNPB or the RXR agonist SR11237 alone. However, the combination of TTNPB and SR11237 resulted in a pronounced down-regulation of TF expression and induction of differentiation in U-937 cells. We show for the first time that the activation of both subunits of the RARalpha-RXR transcriptional complex is needed for TF suppression in U-937 cells, whereas in NB4 cells RARalpha activation alone is sufficient.

In order to examine this pathway's role in leukemic transformation, a conditionally active (beta-estradiol-inducible) form of the MEK1 protein was created by ligating a cDNA encoding an N-terminal truncated form of MEK1 to the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER). We introduced this chimeric deltaMEK1:ER oncoprotein into cytokine-dependent human TF-1 and murine FDC-P1 hematopoietic cell lines. Two different types of cells were recovered after drug selection in medium containing either cytokine or beta-estradiol: (1) cells that expressed the deltaMEK1:ER oncoprotein but remained cytokine-dependent and (2) MEK1-responsive cells that grew in response to deltaMEK1:ER activation. Cytokine-dependent cells were recovered 10(2) to 10(4) times more frequently than MEK1-responsive cells depending upon the particular cell line. To determine whether BCL2 overexpression could synergize with the deltaMEK1:ER oncoprotein in relieving cytokine dependence, the cytokine-dependent deltaMEK1:ER-expressing cells were infected with a BCL2-containing retrovirus, and the frequency of MEK1-responsive cells determined. BCL2 overexpression, by itself, did not relieve cytokine dependency of the parental cells, however, it did increase the frequency at which MEK1-responsive cells were recovered approximately 10-fold. DeltaMEK1:ER+BCL2 cells remained viable for at least 3 days after estradiol deprivation, whereas viability was readily lost upon withdrawal of beta-estradiol in the MEK1-responsive cells which lacked BCL2 overexpression. The MAP kinases, ERK1 and ERK2 were activated in response to deltaMEK1:ER stimulation in both deltaMEK1:ER and deltaMEK1:ER+BCL2 cells. As compared to the cytokine-dependent deltaMEK1:ER and BCL2 infected cells, MEK1-responsive BCL2 infected cells expressed higher levels of BCL2. While both MEK1-responsive deltaMEK1:ER and deltaMEK1:ER+BCL2 infected cells expressed cDNAs encoding the autocrine cytokine GM-CSF, more GM-CSF cDNAs and bioactivity were detected in the MEK1-responsive deltaMEK1:ER+BCL2 cells than in the MEK1-responsive cells lacking BCL2 or cytokine-dependent cells.

There are three Raf family members: A-Raf, B-Raf and Raf-1. Conditionally active forms of the Raf proteins were created by ligating N-terminal truncated activated forms to the estrogen-receptor (ER) hormone-binding domain resulting in beta-estradiol-inducible constructs. We introduced these chimeric deltaRaf:ER oncoproteins into the murine FDC-P1 hematopoietic cell line. Two different types of cells were recovered after drug selection in medium containing either cytokine or beta-estradiol: (1) cytokine-dependent cells that expressed the deltaRaf:ER oncoproteins; and (2) Raf-responsive cells that grew in response to the deltaRaf:ER oncoprotein. Depending upon the particular deltaRaf:ER oncoprotein, cytokine-dependent cells were recovered 10(3) to 10(5) times more frequently than Raf-responsive cells. To determine whether BCL2 could synergize with the deltaRaf:ER oncoproteins and increase the frequency of cytokine-independent cells, cytokine-dependent deltaRaf:ER-expressing cells were infected with either a BCL2 containing retrovirus or an empty retroviral vector. BCL2 overexpression, by itself, did not relieve cytokine dependency of the parental cell line. However, BCL2 overexpression increased the frequency of Raf-responsive cells approximately five- to 100-fold. Cytokine-dependent deltaRaf:ER-infected cells entered the G1 phase of the cell cycle after cytokine withdrawal and entered S phase only after cytokine addition. Raf-responsive deltaRaf:ER cells entered the G1 phase of the cell cycle after estrogen deprivation and re-entered the cell cycle after addition of either IL-3 or the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen which activates the deltaRaf:ER constructs. Expression of the BCL2 oncoprotein often delayed the exit from the S and G2/M phases demonstrating the protective effects BCL2 provided to these Raf and BCL2 infected cells. The deltaRaf:ER cells expressed the deltaRaf:ER proteins and downstream MEK and ERK activities after beta-estradiol treatment. Raf-responsive cells that were also infected with BCL2 expressed higher levels of BCL2 than the cells that were not infected with BCL2. Thus BCL2 can synergize with the activated Raf in the abrogation of cytokine dependency of certain hematopoietic cells. These cells will be useful in furthering our understanding of the roles of the Raf and BCL2 oncoproteins in hematopoietic cell growth, cell cycle progression and prevention of apoptosis.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Proteins v-raf)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,['R01CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To further characterize IL-18R, we analyzed IL-18R expression using a series of human hematopoietic cell lines selected from various cell lineages. We found the IL-18R expression on cells of T and B lineages as expected from analysis on normal cells. The IL-18R expression, however, was found not to be restricted to any specific maturation stages of T and B cells. In addition, we detected IL-18R expression in myeloid, monocytoid, erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines, indicating that normal counterparts of these cell lineages could express IL-18R and participate in in vivo reactions caused by IL-18. Biochemical studies showed that IL-18R proteins exist as heterogeneous molecules ranging from 60 to 110 kDa. Deglycosylation experiments indicated that the heterogeneity could not be explained only by a difference in glycosylation. We also found that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) modulated the IL-18R expression, which implies an important in vivo effect of TNF-alpha on IL-18-induced reaction. Analyzing the responsiveness of IL-18R, we found that only KG-1 responded to IL-18 stimulation.

These studies included small numbers of cases in which key features such as cytogenetic abnormalities were not reported.

The cases included a range of cytogenetic abnormalities. MSI was assessed at three loci (BAT 25, BAT 26, BAT 40) in DNA isolated from sorted leukemic blasts and paired T cell controls. Fluoresceinated PCR products were analyzed using an automated capillary electrophoresis system. Of the 132 AML cases, no single case demonstrated MSI. Our studies indicate that MSI, and defective DNA mismatch repair, is not a defining feature of the majority of adult patients with AML.

This would suggest that the expression of Pgp in AML is high enough to have significant impact on intracellular DNR concentrations and on clinical therapy failure in AML. Recently, DNR has been replaced in many centers by idarubicin (IDA) as the first choice anthracycline in AML treatment. We have, therefore, performed a study in a group of 98 primary AML patients, who all received IDA, but not DNR during induction therapy in order to determine if the response to IDA-containing induction therapy might be related to the biologic characteristic of Pgp expression in AML. The AML samples were studied for Pgp expression by MRK16 antibody staining and for Pgp activity measured as the modulation of rhodamine 123 uptake by 2 microM PSC 833. No correlation of Pgp with complete response rate, event-free survival or overall survival was found. In addition to Pgp, the expression of another protein that has been implicated by some studies in response failure to DNR-containing therapy, the major vault protein (Mvp/LRP), was studied. This marker did not correlate with CR or survival after IDA-containing therapy. The results of this patient study are consistent with model studies showing that the steady-state cellular accumulation of lipophilic anthracyclines such as IDA are little affected by Pgp.

Chemotherapy including topoisomerase II inhibitors was used in 10 cases in which mitoxantrone was used in eight cases. In these eight cases, leukemia had clinical and biological characteristics usually described with topoisomerase II inhibitors but 44% were promyelocytic sub-type with the t(15;17) specific karyotypic abnormality.

Fifty adult patients with a first relapsed APL, of whom 39 had been previously treated with ATRA, entered a multicenter trial of oral ATRA until complete remission (CR) achievement followed by timed sequential chemotherapy (EMA combining etoposide 200 mg/m2/day for 3 days, mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2/day for 3 days, and cytarabine 500 mg/m2/day for two sequences of 3 days). EMA was started either after CR achievement, or on day 1 of ATRA because of initial white blood cell (WBC) counts >5 x 10(9)/l, or rapidly added to ATRA in order to prevent ATRA syndrome because WBC count increased under ATRA. Forty-five patients (90%, 95% CI 78%-97%) were in CR after induction therapy. Five patients died from infection during aplasia following EMA chemotherapy. Eleven patients who achieved CR had a familial HLA-identical donor and were allografted. The median disease-free survival (DFS) of allografted patients was 8.2 months. The 34 other CR patients were scheduled for autologous peripheral blood (PB) SCT (intent-to-treat group). Actually, autologous transplantation was only carried out in 22 patients (65%) (17 PBSCT and five autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT)). Reasons for not autografting were early relapse (three patients), severe toxicity of EMA chemotherapy (six patients), and refusal or failure of stem cell harvest (three patients). The 3-year DFS rate of patients actually autografted was 77%. Among the 17 autografted patients still in CR2, nine patients have already reached a longer CR2 than first CR (CR1). Results of detection of PML/RARalpha by RT-PCR after autologous transplantation show negative findings in eight of the nine patients tested. We conclude that (1) ATRA combined to EMA chemotherapy is effective in the treatment of relapsed APL; (2) allogeneic BMT may be too toxic after salvage treatment including EMA intensive chemotherapy; (3) clinical outcome of autografted patients and preliminary molecular results regarding detection of PML/RARalpha after autologous PBSCT are encouraging.","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.']","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional metaphase analysis has been considered to be the 'gold standard' for evaluating patient response to treatment but this technique normally requires bone marrow aspiration and is therefore invasive. The frequency of cytogenetic analyses can be considerably reduced if patients are also monitored by molecular methods, which can be performed on peripheral blood specimens. Of the various techniques available, most attention has been paid to RT-PCR for BCR-ABL mRNA since this is by far the most sensitive. Simple, non-quantitative RT-PCR analysis gives only limited information on patients after treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR assays have been developed to monitor the kinetics of residual BCR-ABL transcripts over time. Variables in the quantitative PCR assay may be controlled for by quantification of transcripts of a normal gene (eg ABL or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PD) as an internal standard. After allogeneic stem cell transplantation, most patients become RT-PCR negative, often after a period of low level positivity that may persist for several months. Those patients destined to relapse are characterized by the reappearance and/or rising levels of BCR-ABL transcripts. In contrast, for patients treated with interferon-alpha (IFN) residual disease is rarely, if ever, eliminated. The actual level of minimal residual disease in complete cytogenetic responders to IFN correlates with the probability of relapse. New quantitative real time procedures promise to simplify the protocols that are currently in use, but standardization and the introduction of rigorous, internationally accepted controls are required to enable RT-PCR to become a robust and routine basis for therapeutic decisions.","['III.

One such receptor is annexin II, a calcium- and phospholipid-binding protein that serves as a profibrinolytic co-receptor for tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen on endothelial cells.

The aim of this study was to determine the etiology and to evaluate the clinical consequences of extreme thrombocytosis. Seventy patients (55.5%) had reactive thrombocytosis (RT) with an age range of 43 +/- 2.2 years, 56 (44.5%) had chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) with an age range of 53 +/- 2.4 years. Underlying causes of RT were malignancy (25/70 or 35.7%), infection (16/70 or 22.9%), postsplenectomized beta-thalassemia/Hb E (11/70 or 15.7%), inflammation (12/70 or 17.1%), iron deficiency anemia (6/70 or 8.6%). Duration post splenectomy in our beta-thalassemia/Hb E patients ranged from 4 months to 21 years, with a median of 10 years. Subtypes of our MPD cases were chronic myeloid leukemia (30/56 or 53.6%), essential thrombocytosis (18/56 or 32.1%), polycythemia vera (4/56 or 7.1%), agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (3/56 or 5.4%) and unclassified MPD (1/56 or 1.8%). Bleeding and thrombotic tendency were respectively noted in 7 (12.5%) and 2 (3.6%) of MPD patients. Two patients of the MPD group (3.6%) experienced both bleeding and thrombotic episodes. One patient (1.4%) of the RT group developed vasculitis-associated thrombosis. However, none of the patients in the RT group had bleeding complications. Extreme thrombocytosis was not a rare condition in a university hospital population, and bleeding and/or thrombotic complication was more common in the MPD group.","['Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For further analysis of this relationship, an in vitro model of endochondral ossification is required. In this context, we investigated the characteristics of Pi transport in the new chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 in relation to extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and mineralization. Pi uptake in ATDC-5 cells and in isolated matrix vesicles (MVs) is mediated by an Na-dependent Pi transporter with a pH dependency characteristic of a type III Pi carrier (lower activity at alkaline pH). Northern blot analysis indicated that ATDC-5 cells express Glvr-1 transcripts during the various stages of their maturation with a maximal level during the proliferating stage. In isolated MVs, Pi transport activity was maximal at day 21, concomitant with the beginning of type X collagen messenger RNA expression. These events preceded the initiation of matrix mineralization, which was apparent at day 25, and then gradually increased until day 47. This temporal relationship between maximal Pi transport activity in MVs and the expression of a marker of mineralizing chondrocytes is compatible with the possible involvement of Pi transport in the ECM calcification observed in ATDC-5 cell cultures. In conclusion, these observations suggest that ATCD-5 cells in culture represent a promising model for the analysis of a functional role of Pi transport in the initial events of endochondral ossification.","['Division of Bone Diseases, WHO Collaborating Center for Osteoporosis, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland.']","['0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: A 50-year-old woman with secondary acute myeloid leukemia transforming from a myelodysplastic syndrome received an ABO-compatible PBPC graft from her HLA-identical sister. For prophylaxis of GVHD, the patient was treated with cyclosporine and methotrexate. Eighteen days after the transplant, the patient experienced a severe hemolytic transfusion reaction due to an alloantibody (anti-Jk(a)) produced by donor lymphocytes. RESULTS: The patient was typed as group A, Jk(a+) before transplantation; the donor was typed as group A, Jk(a-). On Day 18 after transplantation, the immunohematologic screening revealed a positive DAT (C3d 3+) and an alloanti-Jk(a). Hemolysis in the patient at that time was indicated by a drop in the Hb and an increase in the LDH level (maximum, 592 IU/L on Day 23). CONCLUSION: The course of hemolysis and the time of appearance of an alloantibody in this patient meet the criteria for passenger lymphocyte syndrome. In most cases, this syndrome is triggered by ABO system antibodies. This is the first reported case of passenger lymphocyte syndrome after PBPC transplantation that was due to an alloantibody that did not belong to the ABO system.","['Institute for Immunology and the Department of Internal Medicine, University Clinics of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. dk9@popix.urz.uni-heidelberg.de']","['0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Kidd Blood-Group System)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic testis cell underlays had potent inhibitory activity on gonocyte-derived colony formation (23 +/- 15% compared with 84 +/- 1% in controls; P = 0.0001) when added to cultures of gonocytes in vitro. A Sertoli cell line, TM4B, had an even more pronounced effect on gonocyte clonogenic capacity, with 1 +/- 1% compared with 72 +/- 17% colony formation in controls (P = 0.0003). Testis cells appeared to have a direct inhibitory effect since testis-conditioned medium did not show a significant reduction in the number of colonies. The observed reduction in colony formation with the testis cell underlay was not accounted for by decreased attachment of gonocytes as simultaneous addition of a single cell suspension of testis cells was still effective in significantly reducing colony number when compared with controls (P = 0.01). Therefore, the observed inhibition exerted by testis cells appears to be a consequence of decreased proliferation of gonocytes. Growth factors belonging to the transforming growth factor beta superfamily which are known to be expressed in testis, such as transforming growth factor beta and epidermal growth factor, did not exert any inhibitory action on gonocyte-derived colony formation when added together or alone. However, a shift to a smaller colony size occurred in the presence of transforming growth factor beta and transforming growth factor beta plus epidermal growth factor, indicating a reduction in colony cell proliferation. Evidence for the expression of the Mullerian inhibiting substance receptor on newborn gonocytes using in situ hybridization was inconclusive. This finding was in agreement with the lack of a direct action of Mullerian inhibiting substance on the formation of gonocyte-derived colonies in vitro. Leukaemia inhibitory factor, alone or in combination with forskolin, had neither an inhibitory nor an enhancing effect on gonocyte-derived colony formation. An in vitro clonogenic method to assay for the proliferation of gonocytes in the presence of specific growth factors, cell lines, testis cell underlays and cell suspensions was used to identify a somatic cell-mediated inhibitor which may be responsible for the inhibitory action on gonocyte proliferation in vivo shortly after birth.","[""F.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine children with febrile neutropenia were treated in a prospective, randomized trial comparing ABCD with amphotericin B. An additional 70 children with presumed or proven fungal infection were treated with 5 different open-label studies of ABCD. Patients were registered into these studies for reasons of: 1) failure to respond to amphotericin B; 2) development of nephrotoxicity or preexisting renal impairment; or 3) willingness to participate in a dose-escalation study. Extensive data detailing response and toxicity were collected from each patient. RESULTS: In the randomized trial, there was significantly less renal toxicity in the children receiving ABCD than in those receiving amphotericin B (12.0% vs. 52.4% [P = 0.003]). Other adverse symptoms were not significantly different. In the additional open-label studies, although 80% of patients receiving ABCD reported some adverse symptom, the majority of these were infusion related, and nephrotoxicity was reported in only 12% of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: ABCD was well-tolerated at doses up to 5 times greater then those usually tolerated with amphotericin B. Renal toxicity was markedly less than expected, and there were no other unexpected severe toxicities. Further randomized studies are needed to further define the role of this and other liposomal products in children.","[""University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and Children's Medical Center of Dallas, USA.""]","['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Suspensions)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because MTX and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5CH3THF) share uptake and metabolic pathways, the efficacy of MTX is likely to depend not only on its metabolism but also on how well folate is accumulated by lymphoblasts. The authors' goal was to compare in vitro folate and antifolate uptake in B-lineage lymphoblasts from patients who remained in continuous complete remission (CCR) and those in whom relapse occurred. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four children with B-lineage ALL were studied at diagnosis (n = 20) or relapse (n = 4). Lymphoblasts obtained by bone marrow aspiration were incubated for 24 hours in vitro with 0.05 microM 5CH3[3H]THF or 1 microM [3H]MTX. RESULTS: As of July 1999, 16 patients studied at diagnosis remained in CCR at a median follow-up of 45 months after achieving remission. Two of the patients studied at relapse are in second CCR; the remaining two died from progressive disease. The median uptake of neither [3H]MTX nor 5CH3[3H]THF differed significantly between the 16 patients in first CCR studied at diagnosis and the 4 patients studied at relapse. However, the median ratio of [3H]MTX:5CH3[3H]THF uptake differed significantly for patients who remained in first CCR versus patients studied at relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of [3H]MTX in relation to 5CH3[3H]THF by leukemic lymphoblasts in vitro may correlate positively with treatment outcome in children with B-lineage ALL. A larger study of homogeneously treated patients is necessary to confirm these results.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Sep-Oct;22(5):403-4.

METHODS: Patients treated for ALL on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute protocols 87-01 (n = 44) and 91-01 (n = 23) were evaluated by standard cognitive and achievement tests. Corticosteroid therapy was delivered in 5-day pulses given every 3 weeks during intensification and continuation phases of therapy for a total of 2 years. RESULTS: Children treated on protocol 87-01 received prednisone at a dose of 40 mg/m2/d (standard risk, SR) or 120 mg/ m2/d (high risk, HR); those treated on protocol 91-01 received dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg/m2 per day (SR) or 18 mg/m2 per day (HR). Children treated on protocol 91-01 performed less well on cognitive testing. Subsample analysis indicated that cranial radiation therapy and methotrexate dose did not account for differences in cognitive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this preliminary study are consistent with the hypothesis that dexamethasone therapy can increase risk for neurocognitive late effects in children treated for ALL and indicate that further investigation of this question is warranted.","[""Department of Psychiatry, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 May-Jun;22(3):193-6.

In the present study we show that falconensone A alone induced apoptosis of HL60 human leukemia cells, while falconensone B, the 4'-nor-methyl derivative of falconensone A, had much lower activity. The synthetic derivatives of falconensone A, falconensone A p-bromophenylhydrazone and falconensone A dioxime, were more potent than natural falconensone A and B as far as the induction of apoptosis was concerned. The induction of apoptosis by the falconensones correlated with their inhibition of cell growth. In addition, falconensones A and B, and falconensone A dioxime, increased the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, while falconensone A p-bromophenylhydrazone was inactive. These results suggest that falconensone A, falconensone A p-bromophenylhydrazone and falconensone A dioxime are potential new apoptosis-inducing agents. The enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species in cells may be involved in apoptosis induced by falconensone A and falconensone A dioxime, but not by falconensone A p-bromophenylhydrazone. It is also suggested that the methyl residue at the 4' position of the falconensone A cyclopentenone ring may be essential for the induction of apoptosis. Based on these results, falconensone A and its derivatives may be clinically useful in the treatment of some leukemias.","['Department of Health Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hoshi University, Tokyo, Japan. t-noriko@rascal.hoshi.ac.jp']","['0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Ketones)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (falconensone A)', '0 (falconensone B)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA), we have analyzed the binding activity of CD28RC in the mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from the patients before and after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). The binding activity of CD28RC was low in MLCs using PBMC from patients without acute GVHD and it was also low in MLCs using PBMC from patients without chronic GVHD (cGVHD). In contrast, this activity in patients with cGVHD was estimated to be high. The relative values of CD28RC in comparison with third party MLCs were significantly higher in MLCs using PBMC from patients with cGVHD than those in MLCs using PBMC from patients without GVHD (0.55+/-0.31 versus 0.23+/-0.12, respectively, n = 10, p = 0.05). IL-2 concentrations in the MLC medium from patients without GVHD were undetectable; however, a detectable level of IL-2 was present in MLC medium from a patient with extensive cGVHD. These data were interpreted to suggest that the CD28 costimulatory pathway was specifically activated against recipient antigen in allo-BMT patients with GVHD. In other words, it was suggested that the CD28 costimulatory pathway was specifically suppressed in allo-BMT patients without GVHD, and this suppression might contribute immunological tolerance after allo-BMT.","['Hematology and Oncology, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']","['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we established Fas-resistant adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cell subclones RSO4 and RST1 from their parental Fas-sensitive cell lines SO4 and ST1, and examined whether LC can overcome Fas resistance. LC completely inhibited proteasome function as determined by a peptidyl-MCA substrate (LLVY-MCA and LLE-MCA), and induced apoptosis in these cell lines irrespective of Fas sensitivity at low concentrations (approximately 10 microM). LC induced the activation of caspase 3 (CPP32/Yama) and caspase 6 proteases in an identical manner to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, LC induced the activation of caspase 8 (FLICE) protease, which is the initiator of the Fas-mediated apoptotic cascade. Synthesized proteasome inhibitory peptide MG-115 (ZLLnV-CHO) also induced apoptosis in these cell lines. These results indicated that proteasome inhibitors overcome Fas-resistance by bypassing the proximal part of the Fas signal.

Recent studies have also confirmed the presence of undifferentiated hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as the expression of stem cell factor in the synovial membranes in RA. The present study investigates whether RA synovial fluids contain factors that can induce differentiation of CD 14 positive/HLA-DR positive cells from undifferentiated hematopoietic cells. Synovial fluid specimens from 18 patients with RA and from 10 control patients, including patients with osteoarthritis and Behcet's disease, were studied. Human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL 60 (5 x 10(4)/well) were cultured in the presence or absence of the synovial fluids for 5 days, after which the expression of CD 14 and HLA-DR was examined by flow cytometry. The induction of differentiation of CD 14 positive/HLA-DR positive cells or HLA-DR positive cells from HL 60 cells was significantly enhanced more in the presence of synovial fluids from RA patients than in the presence of those of control patients. However, the sera from the RA patients could not induce the differentiation of CD 14 positive/HLA-DR positive cells or HLA-DR positive cells from HL 60 cells. Most cytokines found in RA synovial fluid could not induce the differentiation of HL 60 cells. Of note, treatment of synovial fluids with hyaluronidase significantly decreased or abrogated their capacity to induce the differentiation of HLA-DR positive cells from HL 60. There was no significant difference in the concentration of hyaluronic acid in the synovial fluid between the RA patients and the control patients. These results indicate that there are factors that can induce differentiation of HLA-DR positive cells from undifferentiated hematopoietic cells in the synovial fluid of RA. The data also suggest that such differentiation factors might be related with qualitative abnormality of hyaluronic acid.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Teikyo University, School of Medicine.']","['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old woman, well-known for a rheumatoid arthritis, developed a bullous eruption. It was associated with voluminous lymphadenopathies, and laboratory investigations revealed a chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Clinicopathological aspect and immunofluorescence studies argued for a paraneoplastic pemphigus but immunoblot showed only antibodies against desmoglein 1. DISCUSSION: Paraneoplastic pemphigus is an autoimmune bullous disease defined by the criteria of Anhalt, including autoantibodies mostly directed against cytoplasmic proteins of the plakin family. Our case is unusual for the absence of these antibodies and for the presence of antibodies directed against a cell surface target, desmoglein 1.

Recent advances in immunohistochemistry and molecular techniques have improved our knowledge of the immune system and lymphoid neoplasms. An international consensus has been recently reached among pathologists and clinicians, that recognises clinico-pathological entities which are defined by a combination of morphological, immunophenotypical, genetic and clinical features. In each entity, a range of histological grade and clinical aggressiveness can be encountered. Recognition of these entities, combined with clinical prognostic factors has clinical implications in terms of response to treatment and prognosis. The purpose of this paper is to focus on a practical approach, either clinical or pathological, of the diagnosis of small B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia.","['Institut Bergonie, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, 180, rue de Saint-Genes, 33076 cedex, Bordeaux, France. soubeyran_i@bergonie.org']",,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear proteins that are localized in discrete domains within the nucleus include the leukemia-associated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) factors, the SC-35 RNA-processing factors, nucleolar proteins and components of both transcriptional and DNA replication complexes. Mechanisms that control the spatial distribution of transcription factors within the three-dimensional context of the nucleus may involve the sorting of regulatory information, as well as contribute to the assembly and activity of sites that support gene expression. Molecular, cellular, genetic and biochemical approaches have identified distinct protein segments, termed intranuclear-targeting signals, that are responsible for directing regulatory factors to specific subnuclear sites. Gene rearrangements that remove or alter intranuclear-targeting signals are prevalent in leukemias and have been linked to altered localization of regulatory factors within the nucleus. These modifications in the intranuclear targeting of transcription factors might abrogate fidelity of gene expression in tumor cells by influencing the spatial organization and/or assembly of machineries involved in the synthesis and processing of gene transcripts.","['Department of Cell Biology and Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01655, USA.']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",63,,,"['5RO3TW00990/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'AR45688/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR45689/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, there may be both common and different factors that are involved in the process of the uncontrolled cell growth of pancreatic cancers and the development of the fetal pancreas. The common part of the mechanisms should be in the regulation of the cell cycle, resulting in rapid proliferation via such mechanisms as growth stimulation and avoidance of apoptosis. Therefore, in the current study we investigated the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in fetal pancreatic tissues. METHODS: Sixteen human embryonic and fetal pancreatic tissues obtained between 6 and 32 wk of gestation were used. We immunohistochemically examined the protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and Bax. Further, the expression of insulin, glucagon, and proliferting cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining were examined. RESULTS: In embryonic and fetal pancreatic tissues, Bcl-2 was not detected in any type of pancreatic cell (acinar, ductal, or islet). Bcl-XL was expressed in all types of pancreatic cells throughout the gestation. Mcl-1 was expressed in all types of pancreatic components, and strongly expressed in the margin of the islets. Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein, was expressed in all components. PCNA was strongly expressed in the embryonic and fetal pancreas, especially in early stages of gestation; however, TUNEL staining was negative in all samples. At least one antiapoptotic protein was expressed in all types of pancreatic cells. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study indicate that active proliferation and avoidance of apoptosis take place in embryonic and fetal pancreatic tissues, which may be controlled by particular combinations of apoptosis-related proteins. Among these proteins, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 may play an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of the embryonic and fetal pancreas.","['Department of Surgery and Surgical Basic Science, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Japan. khiro@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp']","['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-92-5 (Glucagon)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(8;16) fuses the MOZ gene from 8p11 with the CBP (also named CREBBP) gene from 16p13. Previously published studies of MOZ and CBP rearrangements in t(8;16)-positive AML have used fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern blot methodologies, whereas attempts to amplify and to analyze further the chimeric MOZ-CBP and CBP-MOZ transcripts by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have largely been unsuccessful. In the only t(8;16) that has been described at the sequence level using RT-PCR, the CBP-MOZ fusion was found to be out-of-frame, suggesting that the reciprocal MOZ-CBP transcript is the essential one for leukemogenesis. We have developed an RT-PCR strategy that enables us to detect the MOZ-CBP as well as the CBP-MOZ fusions in the two AML M5 with t(8;16)(p11;p13) analyzed. In both leukemias, the combination of a MOZ forward and a CBP reverse primer amplified a strongly expressed 1,128 bp fragment (type I transcript) and a weakly expressed 415 bp fragment (type II transcript). In the type I transcript, nucleotide (nt) 3,745 of MOZ was fused in-frame with nt 284 of CBP, whereas in the type II transcript, nt 3,745 of MOZ was fused out-of-frame with nt 997 of CBP. Nested PCR with a combination of two forward CBP and two reverse MOZ primers amplified CBP-MOZ chimeric transcripts in both cases. Direct sequence analysis showed that nt 283 of CBP was fused in-frame with nt 3,746 of MOZ, that the initiation ATG codon of the CBP gene remained intact, and that there was no mutation or deletion in the part of the CBP gene included in the CBP-MOZ transcript. Thus, the data we present are not informative with regard to the question whether it is the MOZ-CBP or the CBP-MOZ transcript that is leukemogenic. The present RT-PCR method may be of value for rapid identification of the t(8;16) and also for further molecular genetic studies of the two fusion transcripts and their roles in leukemogenesis.","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.

Based on this potentially increased sensitivity, we investigated, in a preliminary manner, whether spectral karyotyping could detect cytogenetic aberrations in karyotypically normal leukemia. The test population was comprised of 28 cryopreserved, cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples from patients registered to a randomized trial for previously untreated AML (SWOG 9031). Two normal and 12 samples with known cytogenetic aberrations were used to validate and establish the diagnostic accuracy of the spectral karyotyping assay and instrumentation in a clinical setting. Enumeration and region-specific DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes verified discrepant results. In the validation data set, spectral karyotyping refined complex karyotypic rearrangements in six cases and defined the chromosomal origin of a ""jumping"" homogeneously staining region; however, the technology was less sensitive in the detection of subtelomeric rearrangements and double minute chromosomes. In the test population, spectral karyotyping identified previously undetected cytogenetic aberrations in two cases (7%) of karyotypically normal AML: a cryptic 11q23 translocation in 20/20 cells and a minor monosomy 7 clone in 3/21 cells (FISH, 10.5%). Both of these abnormalities are considered to confer a poor prognosis when based on classical cytogenetic prognostic criteria. As an adjunct to classical cytogenetics and standard FISH analyses, the additive resolution of spectral karyotyping, in particular, with chromosome paints spiked with subtelomeric and/or locus-specific probes, may allow significant gains to be made in diagnostic accuracy and recognition of genotype/phenotype prognostic relationships, and in defining underlying biologic mechanisms in cancer.

It is currently used in the clinical treatment of different malignancies. However, the possible beneficial actions of octreotide in T-cell leukemia have not been addressed before, although these cells express SRIF receptors. For instance, human leukemia Jurkat T cells have been shown to express a single SRIF receptor isotype: sst3 that can be pharmacologically targeted by octreotide. In this study, we therefore studied SMS 201995 effects on in vitro [(3)H-CH3]thymidine incorporation in Jurkat T cells. Our data show that octreotide inhibits the proliferation of Jurkat cells both in the absence and in the presence of mitogens. By contrast, SRIF28, an endogenous SRIF analog sharing with SMS 201995 an almost identical affinity for somatostatin sst3 receptors, increases [(3)H-CH3]thymidine uptake in both mitogen-activated and nonactivated cells. To assess the mechanisms of the opposite actions of these two analogs on leukemia T-cell proliferation, we next studied their effects on adenylyl cyclase activity in whole Jurkat cells. At least in the presence of mitogens, SMS 201995 significantly enhances the adenylyl cyclase activity whereas SRIF28 inhibits it.

Here we demonstrate that Jurkat human leukemia cells which survive after 24 h treatment with NO form subpopulations with higher and lower cardiolipin content (designated as NAO(high) and NAO(low), respectively). Sorted NAO(high) cells were found to survive in culture whereas sorted NAO(low) cells died. Moreover, NAO(high) cells acquired an increased resistance to the exposure to NO donors which remained unchanged during long-term culture. These cells showed a similar cardiolipin content and expressed the same level of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) as APO-S unsorted cells but contained significantly higher concentration of the antioxidant glutathione. Depletion of glutathione in these cells with buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) correlated with a significant stimulation of NO-mediated apoptosis whereas the exposure of NO-sensitive APO-S cells to the glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) resulted in a substantial suppression of this effect. Our data suggest a complex mechanism of the resistence to NO-induced apoptosis in Jurkat human leukemia cells in which glutathione plays an important role.","['Division of Cellular Immunology, Tumor Immunology Program, German Cancer Research Center, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.

We have found that in most unbalanced translocations, a third event takes place: a morphologically normal copy of one of the two translocation participants is added to the karyotype. This creates a complex abnormal karyotype with monosomy, disomy, and trisomy for different segments of the translocation participants. We have examined 82 unbalanced translocations from 77 patients, 73 of whom had a myeloid hemopoietic malignancy. Acquisition of a normal copy of a translocation participant was found in 49 translocations. Twenty-five of these showed trisomy for 1q. In 16 of the 25 1q-trisomic cases the translocation was t(1;7)(q10;p10) (trisomy for 1q and monosomy for 7q). Patients with trisomy for 1q were younger than the remaining patients.

Plasma levels of D-dimer, soluble fibrin monomer (sFM), plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex (PPIC), and thrombin antithrombin complex (TAT) levels were significantly high in both groups. Plasma levels of PPIC, sFM, and D-dimer were significantly higher at initial onset of APL than during relapse.

TF and tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen levels in leukemic cell lysate were significantly increased in both groups, and they were significantly lower during relapse than at initial onset. Hemostatic abnormalities occurring in patients with relapsed APL might be the result of the decrease of TF and t-PA in leukemic cells.

Risk assessment, and the setting of occupational and environmental standards, has assumed that risk is constant in time after a unit of exposure. Leukemia risk is known to vary with time after exposure to ionizing radiation. METHODS: A matched case-control study of leukemia risk in relation to the temporal pattern of benzene exposures was performed using data from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. RESULTS: Leukemia risk following exposure to benzene varied with time in a manner similar to that following exposure to ionizing radiation. More recent exposures were more strongly associated with risk than were more distant ones. There was no significant relation between leukemia death and benzene exposures incurred more than 20 years previously. CONCLUSIONS: Recent analyses of specific occupational and environmental carcinogens, including benzene and radon, have indicated that cancer risk tends to decline as the time from exposure increases. This suggests that standards for the control of occupational or public risk must be selected to control exposures over a narrower time frame than the usual lifetime one. In the case of benzene, it would appear that risk is attributable primarily to exposures incurred during the previous 10 to 20 years, with exposures in the most recent 10 years being the most potent. To limit risk, exposures must be controlled during that interval. It is important that epidemiologists explore the temporal pattern of risk in their studies to facilitate the risk assessment of other carcinogens.","['Family Medicine Centre, Mt.

In addition to the accumulation of neoplastic B cells, numerous T-cell abnormalities also occur in B-CLL patients. In this study, the presence, and distribution within the T-cell subsets, of clonal/oligoclonal T cells was studied. Multicolor flow cytometric techniques were employed using combinations of anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD8 antibodies coupled with antibodies specific for V(alpha) and V(beta) T-cell receptor (TCR) epitopes. Molecular studies of TCR gene sequences were done to confirm the presence of clonal/oligoclonal T-cell populations. In the flow cytometric studies, examination of V(alpha)/V(beta)expression found evidence of clonal/oligoclonal expansion in 9 of 19 patients studied. In eight of the nine patients, the expansions were restricted to the CD3(+)CD8(+) cell population. Molecular analyses were performed in 16 patients, 12 of whom showed a clonal or oligoclonal pattern. Of the four patients who were negative in the molecular analyses, all demonstrated flow cytometric evidence of clonal/oligoclonal expansions. Thus, when the flow cytometric and molecular analyses were considered together, all 16 patients for whom parallel analyses were done showed evidence of clonal/oligoclonal expansions. These results confirm previous work demonstrating that the majority of B-CLL patients harbor clonal/oligoclonal expansions within the T-cell population. Additionally, based on the relative numbers of cells expressing specific V(alpha) or V(beta)epitopes, these results show that these expansions occur primarily within the CD3(+)CD8(+) T-cell population.","['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Medical School, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois. c-goolsby@nwu.edu']","['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oligoclonality or monoclonality for any of the T-cell receptor (TCR) chain genes can be demonstrated in the majority of the cases. During systematic screening for the presence of circulating lymphocytes with atypical coexpression of differentiation antigens in patients with T-cell lymphomas, we have discovered a minor population (accounting for 0.2% to 10.% of all lymphocytes) of atypical lymphocytes in the blood of five of seven patients consecutively diagnosed in 1997/1998 by lymph node histology to have AITL. The major distinguishing feature of these cells consists of the lack of the surface expression of the CD3 antigen, but not of the intracellular expression. These cells express the T-cell antigens CD2 and CD5 on their surface, but not CD7, and they express CD4 and CD45 at numbers of molecules per cell typical for T lymphocytes. Gene scan analyses for the TCR gamma chain revealed oligoclonality of these flow-sorted cells in one patient and monoclonality in two patients, the same patterns of TCR gamma chain gene as determined processing the respective diagnostic lymph nodes. Circulating CD4-expressing T lymphocytes with exclusively cytoplasmic expression of CD3 appear to represent the malignant population in patients with histologically diagnosed AITL.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology-Oncology, Virchow Hospital, Charite, Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany.']","['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To circumvent this, the 5.1-kb 5;-flanking sequence of the human afp gene including the entire enhancer and silencer regions as well as the promoter region was employed for achieving strong, HCC-selective transgene expression. To thoroughly inhibit the promoter activity of the 5;-flanking sequence of the human afp gene, the afp 5;-flanking region was inserted downstream of the human interleukin-2 (il-2) gene controlled by the simian-virus-40 (SV40) early promoter. il-2-production ability of HCC cells transduced with the construct was significantly enhanced compared with that transduced with the same construct lacking the afp 5;-flanking region. Importantly, il-2 production of non-HCC cells was substantially inhibited by the addition of the afp 5;-flanking region to the construct. When the afp 5;-flanking region was inserted downstream of the human tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) gene controlled by the retrovirus long-terminal-repeat (LTR) enhancer/promoter, tnf-alpha production ability of HCC cells was significantly enhanced and that of non-HCC cells was significantly suppressed compared with that transduced with the same construct lacking the afp 5;-flanking region. Our results indicated that the afp 5;-flanking region gave the enhanced HCC-selective activity to the non-tissue specific SV40 early promoter and LTR enhancer/promoter. It is essential for successful gene therapy to induce strong, target-cell-selective transgene expression. This novel strategy, therefore, may contribute to the establishment of HCC-selective cancer gene therapy.","[""Department of Microbiology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)']",,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 16 years, with a median of 7 years. Thirty-nine patients developed SMTs during the 7,145 person-year follow-up [standardized incidence ratio (SIR): 2. 8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0 to 3.9]. Increased risks of developing SMTs were observed for head and neck (H/N) cancer (SIR: 16.5; 95% CI: 10.0 to 26.8), gastric cancer (SIR: 5.5; 95% CI: 2.2 to 11.4) and leukemia (SIR: 9; 95% CI: 1.9 to 26.3). Paraffin-embedded specimens of secondary H/N cancer (11), secondary gastric cancer (6) and their corresponding NPC specimens were examined by EBER in situ hybridization to assess the association between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and these SMTs. Twenty-six primary H/N and 5 gastric cancer specimens were chosen as the control groups. In H/N cancer, EBV was detected in 3.8% of the primary cancers and 9.1% of the secondary cancers. All the positive specimens resulted from hypopharyngeal cancer. Of the secondary gastric cancers, only 1 case (16.6%) was associated with EBV. None of the primary gastric cancers was associated with EBV. Our results indicate an increased risk of developing SMTs, with a preference for head and neck cancer, gastric cancer and leukemia, in NPC patients after RT in Taiwan.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been recognized as its major etiologic factor. Because MC frequently evolves into overt B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic HCV infection is hypothesized to lead to both benign and malignant lymphoproliferative disease. In this study, we investigated mutations in the V(H) and V(K) genes of the B-cell clone originating the overt B-cell lymphoma in a subject with MC. Mutational patterns were analyzed longitudinally in two bone marrow biopsies obtained at the stage of MC, as well as in multiple involved tissues (bone marrow, liver, and peripheral blood cells) at the stage of overt NHL. Hybridization of variable-diversity-joining (VDJ) PCR products with a probe specific for the neoplastic clone indicated that the lymphoma originated from one of the clones over-stimulated during MC. This clone producing an IgM highly homologous to a protein with RF specificity may explain the MC syndrome in the patient. Moreover, the presence of an IgH ongoing mutation process and the expression of an Ig antigen receptor significantly homologous to an anti-HCV protein support the hypothesis that the MC syndrome and the subsequent evolution to NHL are antigen-driven lymphoproliferative processes possibly sustained by HCV. Furthermore, the marked reduction in intra-clonal diversity in the last bone marrow biopsy obtained at the stage of overt NHL points out a minor dependence of the cells on the antigen-driven mechanism, although an intrinsic propensity of the neoplastic cell to undergo replacement mutations cannot be excluded.","['Division of Experimental Oncology1, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Aviano (PN), Italy.']",['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)'],,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The toxin moiety Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) of these recombinant molecules leads to the arrest of protein synthesis due to inactivation of elongation factor 2. Here, we provide evidence that cell lines derived from patients with hematologic malignancies react to immunotoxins not only with inhibition of protein synthesis but also with characteristic hallmarks of apoptosis such as caspase activation, cleavage of the ""death substrate poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase and DNA laddering. Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38 leads to a 10-fold increase in the cleavage of the fluorescent substrate DEVD-AFC, suggesting that a caspase-3-like enzyme is involved. This was verified by cleavage of caspase-3 (CPP32). MT1 cells exhibited DNA laddering after treatment with immunotoxin, which was reversed by pre-treatment with the protease inhibitor zVAD-fmk. This caspase inhibitor led to an at least 5-fold improvement in cell viability without altering inhibition of protein synthesis. Interestingly, HUT-102 cells did not undergo programmed cell death after exposure to immunotoxins that kill these cells. We conclude that immunotoxins may be valuable in the treatment of cancers that are resistant toward apoptosis because their targeted killing is often facilitated by, but not completely dependent on, programmed cell death.

METHODS: Six hundred thirty-five consecutive patients with extragonadal GCT treated at 11 centers in the U.S. and Europe during the era of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (1975-1996) were included into a large database. These patients were evaluated for the occurrence of second malignancies. RESULTS: No treatment-related leukemia was observed in 611 patients treated with chemotherapy. In 7 patients, second solid tumors were observed, resulting in a frequency of 1.86% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.79-1.93%) after a median follow-up of 55 months (95% CI, 50-60 months) (annual incidence, 0.30% [95% CI, 0.14-0.59]). Four solid tumors (57%) developed in patients with primary mediastinal and 3 tumors (43%) developed in patients with retroperitoneal GCT. Three patients (43%) had a nonseminomatous and 4 patients (57%) had a seminomatous histology. Six patients had been treated with chemotherapy and one patient with radiotherapy. Six of 7 solid tumors (86%) had developed within 5 years and 7 of 7 solid tumors within 10 years of diagnosis. The median time period to the occurrence of neoplasia was 47 months (range, 9-145 months). Four cutaneous tumors were observed (melanoma, two patients; basal cell carcinoma, one patient; and squamous cell carcinoma, one patient); the other three tumors were angiosarcoma, nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma. The overall risk for developing a second tumor was not increased compared with an age-matched general population with a standard incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.49 (95% CI, 0.60-3.06). An elevated risk for skin tumors was observed in all extragonadal GCT patients (SIR, 4.00 [95% CI, 1. 09-10.24]), as well as in the subgroup of patients treated with chemotherapy (SIR, 5.33 [95% CI, 1.45-13.65]). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis excludes an increased biologic risk of developing second solid malignancies in patients with extragonadal GCT except for the previously reported association between primary mediastinal nonseminoma and hematologic disorders. The overall risk of developing second malignancies in extragonadal GCT patients appears to be comparable to that in patients with primary testicular carcinoma. The incremental occurrence of skin malignancies in patients treated with chemotherapy should be investigated further.","['Tuebingen University Medical Center II, Tuebingen, Germany.']",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the authors reviewed such previous studies to establish a definite conclusion. METHODS: Using MEDLINE, the authors identified studies that evaluated the prognostic significance of CD34 expression in AML. The outcome measure was the complete remission rate. They used the random-effect method to combine the results. Results were presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The ORs were less than 1 if the complete remission occurred more frequently in the CD34 negative group. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies including 2483 patients were reviewed. The combined OR was 0.38 (95% CI, 0. 26-0.57), which suggested that CD34 expression was associated with a poor remission rate. However, the authors found statistical evidence of marked heterogeneity among trials (P < 0.001), especially according to time of publication. The combined OR in studies published in or after 1994 was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.47-1.09). The authors divided the studies into several subgroups, but they could not determine the reason for the heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: At present, CD34 expression should not be considered a marker of poor prognosis because it is not supported by the combined data from recent studies. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the intensity of CD34 expression in specific populations of patients, such as those with t(8;21) or t(15;17) translocations or the AML-M0 subtype.","['Department of Hematology, International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo, Japan.']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",31,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MLL-AF9 fusion gene is associated with de novo acute myelo-genous leukemia (AML), rarely with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and with therapy related leukemia (t-AML). The AF9 gene is >100 kb and two patient breakpoint cluster regions (BCRs) have been identified; BCR1 is within intron 4, previously called site A, whereas BCR2 or site B spans introns 7 and 8. Patient breakpoint locations were determined previously by RT-PCR and by genomic DNA cloning. In this study, we defined the exon-intron boundaries and identified several different structural elements in AF9 including a co-localizing in vivo DNA topo II cleavage site and an in vitro DNase I hypersensitive (DNase 1 HS) site in intron 7 in BCR2. Reversibility experiments demonstrated a religation of the topo II cleavage sites. The location of the in vivo topo II cleavage site was confirmed in vitro using a topo II cleavage assay. In addition, two scaffold associated regions (SARs) are located centromeric to the topo II and DNase I HS cleavage sites and border both patient breakpoint regions: SAR1 is located in intron 4, whereas SAR2 encompasses parts of exons 5-7. This study demonstrates that the patient breakpoint regions of AF9 share the same structural elements as the MLL BCR. We describe a DNA breakage and repair model for non-homologous recombination between MLL and its partner genes, particularly AF9.","['University of Chicago Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology Oncology, Chicago, IL 60637-1470, USA. pstrisse@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,"['CA-40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['GENBANK/AC000007', 'GENBANK/AC002050', 'GENBANK/AC002052', 'GENBANK/AC002053', 'GENBANK/AC002469']",,,,,,,

It is the only costimulatory T cell molecule known to be specifically up-regulated in human T cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I)-producing cells. In a T cell line, OX40 surface expression was shown to be induced by HTLV-I Tax alone. To understand molecular mechanisms of OX40 gene regulation and modulation by HTLV-I Tax, we have cloned the human OX40 gene and analyzed its 5'-flanking region. By reporter gene analysis with progressive 5' deletions from nucleotides -1259 to -64, we have defined a 157-bp DNA fragment as a minimal promoter for constitutive expression. In addition, we show that in the OX40+ cell line, Co, Tax is able to further increase OX40 surface expression. Up-regulation of OX40 promoter activity by Tax requires two upstream NF-kappaB sites, which are not active in the constitutive OX40 expression. Their deletion abrogates Tax responsiveness in reporter gene analysis. The site-directed mutagenesis of each NF-kappaB site demonstrates that cooperative NF-kappaB binding is a prerequisite for Tax-directed activity as neither site alone is sufficient for a full Tax responsiveness of the OX40 promoter. Upon Tax expression, both sites bind p65 and c-Rel. These data provide new insight into the direct regulation of OX40 by Tax and add to our understanding of the possible role of the OX40/OX40 ligand system in the proliferation of HTLV-I+ T cells.","['Departments of Pathology and Urology, University Hospital Benjamin Franklin, Free University Berlin, Germany.']","['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF4 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ CTLs is mediated through two mechanisms, which involve the perforin/granzyme and the FasL/Fas pathways, in this study we investigated the effects of VIP/PACAP on the generation and activity of allogeneic CTLs, of CD8+ T1 and T2 effector cells and of alloreactive peritoneal exudate cytotoxic T cells (PEL) generated in vivo. VIP/PACAP did not affect perforin/granzyme-mediated cytotoxicity, perforin gene expression, or granzyme B enzymatic activity, but drastically inhibited FasL/Fas-mediated cytotoxicity against allogeneic or syngeneic Fas-bearing targets. VIP/PACAP inhibit CTL generation, but not the activity of competent CTLs. The inhibition is associated with a profound down-regulation of FasL expression, and these effects are mediated through both VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors. VIP/PACAP inhibit the FasL/Fas-mediated cytotoxicity of T1 effectors and do not affect T2 cytotoxicity, which is entirely perforin/granzyme mediated. Similar effects were observed in vivo. Both the FasL/Fas-mediated cytotoxicity and FasL expression of cytotoxic allogeneic PELs generated in vivo in the presence of VIP or PACAP were significantly reduced. We conclude that, similar to their effect on CD4+ T cells, the two structurally related neuropeptides inhibit FasL expression in CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and the subsequent lysis of Fas-bearing target cells.","['Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.']","['0 (Adcyap1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide)', '0 (Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide, Type II)', '0 (Receptors, Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide, Type I)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)']",,,,['AI041786-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently showed that cell-permeable Bcl-2 binding peptides could induce apoptosis of human myeloid leukemia in vitro and suppress its growth in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Here we report the discovery of HA14-1, a small molecule (molecular weight = 409) and nonpeptidic ligand of a Bcl-2 surface pocket, by using a computer screening strategy based on the predicted structure of Bcl-2 protein. In vitro binding studies demonstrated the interaction of HA14-1 with this Bcl-2 surface pocket that is essential for Bcl-2 biological function. HA14-1 effectively induced apoptosis of human acute myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells overexpressing Bcl-2 protein that was associated with the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9 followed by caspase-3. Cytokine response modifier A, a potent inhibitor of Fas-mediated apoptosis, did not block apoptosis induced by HA14-1. Whereas HA14-1 strongly induced the death of NIH 3T3 (Apaf-1(+/+)) cells, it had little apoptotic effect on Apaf-1-deficient (Apaf-1(-/-)) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells.

A human promyelocytic leukemia /TER286-resistant cell line was selected by chronic, long-term exposure to the prodrug. Although resistance was not readily achieved, eventually a 5-fold resistant clone was isolated. Cross-resistance to melphalan occurred, but not to doxorubicin (Adriamycin), taxol, and gamma-glutamyl-S-(benzyl)cysteinyl-R(-)-phenyl glycine diethyl ester, a GSTP1-1 inhibitor. The protein and transcript levels and enzymatic activity of GSTP1-1 were reduced significantly in the selected resistant line. GSTalpha levels were unchanged, and GSTmu was undetectable. Although glutathione levels were elevated in human promyelocytic leukemia/TER286 cells, no changes in the expression of thiol-related genes including gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, or multidrug resistance protein were found. A 7-fold increase in catalase expression in the resistant cell line indicated an adaptive response to oxidative and electrophilic stress, and this was also reflected in the lower prevalence of drug-induced DNA single-strand breaks in the resistant cells. Mouse embryo fibroblast GSTP1-1(-/-) cells exhibited 2-fold resistance to TER286 compared with GSTP1-1(+/+) cells. NIH3T3 cells transfected with combinations of gamma-GCS and multidrug resistance protein exhibited enhanced resistance to TER286, although the degree of resistance was impaired by cotransfection of GSTP1-1. These results are consistent with responses in the TER286-resistant cells indicative of GSTP1-1-mediated mechanism of activation. In consequence, these data support the rationale that tumors expressing high levels of GSTP1-1 will be more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the drug.","['Department of Pharmacology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '158382-37-7 (TER 286)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Gstp1 protein, mouse)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,"['CA06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA53893/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In light of its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis and to induce cell cycle arrest through inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, the effects of hydroxyurea on replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been investigated. In vitro hydroxyurea has been shown to block HIV-1 reverse transcription and/or replication in quiescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and macrophages. Hydroxyurea was also found to be synergistic with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor didanosine and to inhibit HIV-1 replication in activated PBMC; this inhibition may be due to a reduction in deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool sizes. Finally, hydroxyurea has been shown to sensitize didanosine-resistant mutants. Hydroxyurea may therefore be useful for limiting the spread of didanosine-resistant HIV-1 variants. The favorable toxicity profile of hydroxyurea and the lack of significant overlapping toxicities with some of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, as well as their distinct mechanisms of action, have provided further rationale for use of these agents in combination therapies.","['Research Institute for Genetic and Human Therapy, Washington, DC 20007, USA.

The gene MLL, a target of such translocation events, forms chimaeric fusion products with a variety of partner genes. While MLL appears to be involved in chromatin-mediated gene regulation, the functions of its partner genes are largely speculative. We report the biochemical analysis of the MLL partner gene AF10 and its possible role in leukaemogenesis. AF10 has been reported to be re-arranged with genes other than MLL leading to the same phenotype, a myeloid leukaemia. We have identified a novel protein-protein interaction motif in the AF10 protein comprising the extended LAP/PHD-finger. This domain mediates homo-oligomerisation of recombinant AF10 and is conserved in several proteins, including MLL itself. AF10 binds cruciform DNA via a specific interaction with an AT-hook motif and is localised to the nucleus by a defined bipartite nuclear localisation signal in the N-terminal region.","[""Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London Hospital School of Medicine, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Charterhouse Square, London, EC1 M 6BQ, England. blinder@gwdg.de""]","['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 58-year-old white man with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was initially treated with hydroxyurea. Interferon-alfa therapy was started six weeks later in order to enhance the response, with gradual reduction and eventual discontinuation of hydroxyurea. Interferon-alfa was continued for one year. Following bone marrow aspiration at one year, the patient developed significant bleeding and bruising at the site of extraction. His hemoglobin decreased from 11.3 to 9.3 g/dL and his activated partial thromboplastin time was elevated at 72 seconds. The factor VIII concentration was 0.02 units/mL; factor VIII inhibitor concentration was 58 Bethesda units. A diagnosis of an acquired factor VIII inhibitor was made, and the patient was treated with activated factor VII concentrates and prednisone. Interferon-alfa was discontinued, and the inhibitor subsequently disappeared over the next six weeks. The patient did not have any further bleeding problems. DISCUSSION: Acquired factor VIII inhibitors other than in patients with hemophilia are rare. To date, there are no reported cases of factor VIII inhibitors associated with CML. Moreover, the temporal association with interferon-alfa administration suggests a causal relationship. There are only two previous case reports suggesting interferon-alfa as a cause of factor VIII inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Induction of factor VIII inhibitors is a serious potential complication of therapy with interferon-alfa. We suggest that a diagnosis of an acquired factor VIII inhibitor be considered in patients who experience unexplained bleeding with interferon-alfa therapy.","['Department of Hematology, University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is mainly because of the rapid increasing use of such EMFs within our modern society. Exposure to EMFs has been linked to different cancer forms, e.g. leukemia, brain tumors, neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, asthma and allergy, and recently to the phenomena of 'electrosupersensitivity' and 'screen dermatitis'. There is an increasing number of reports about cutaneous problems as well as symptoms from internal organs, such as the heart, in people exposed to video display terminals (VDTs). These people suffer from subjective and objective skin and mucosa-related symptoms, such as itch, heat sensation, pain, erythema, papules and pustules. In severe cases, people can not, for instance, use VDTs or artificial light at all, or be close to mobile telephones. Mast cells (MCs), when activated, release a spectrum of mediators, among them histamine, which is involved in a variety of biological effects with clinical relevance, e.g. allergic hypersensitivity, itch, edema, local erythema and many types of dermatoses. From the results of recent studies, it is clear that EMFs affect the MC, and also the dendritic cell, population and may degranulate these cells. The release of inflammatory substances, such as histamine, from MCs in the skin results in a local erythema, edema and sensation of itch and pain, and the release of somatostatin from the dendritic cells may give rise to subjective sensations of on-going inflammation and sensitivity to ordinary light. These are, as mentioned, the common symptoms reported from patients suffering from 'electrosupersensitivity'/'screen dermatitis'. MCs are also present in the heart tissue and their localization is of particular relevance to their function. Data from studies made on interactions of EMFs with the cardiac function have demonstrated that highly interesting changes are present in the heart after exposure to EMFs. One could speculate that the cardiac MCs are responsible for these changes due to degranulation after exposure to EMFs. However, it is still not known how, and through which mechanisms, all these different cells are affected by EMFs. In this article, we present a theoretical model, based upon observations on EMFs and their cellular effects, to explain the proclaimed sensitivity to electric and/or magnetic fields in humans.","['Experimental Dermatology Unit, Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['820484N8I3 (Histamine)'],,['Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We isolated and purified a lactose-binding protein, MCF-pl5-L (MW of about 50 kD, pl of about 5) from a conditioned medium of STO-5. By using highly purified MCF-pl5-L, its biological and physicochemical properties were elucidated in comparison with C5a and MCP-1. RESULTS: MCF-pl5-L exhibited an evident dose-dependent monocyte chemotactic activity (MCA). MCF-pl5-L had no or little affinity for heparin unlike chemokines such as MCP-1. We further found that MCF-pl5-L exhibited potent chemotactic activity not only for monocytes but also for alveolar macrophages. In contrast, C5a and MCP-1 failed to show evident chemotactic activity for alveolar macrophages though they did show MCA. MCF-pl5-L failed to exhibit evident eosinophil and neutrophil chemotactic activities, indicating its chemotactic activity is selective for monocytes/macrophages. Regarding the biological functions of MCF-pl5-L other than MCA and chemotactic activity for alveolar macrophages, we found that MCF-pl5-L but not C5a and MCP-1 could prolong the life span of alveolar macrophages, probably by inhibiting apoptosis of macrophages, and stimulate the production of TNF-alpha from macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MCF-pl5-L plays a role as an immune modulator for monocytes/macrophages in the site.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (LacY protein, E coli)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (Symporters)']",,"['Copyright 2000 S.

METHODS: In a prospective pilot trial, the safety and efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis with intravenous (i.v.) amphotericin B (AMB; 1 mg/kg every 48 h) was studied in 46 consecutive cycles. Prophylaxis with i.v. AMB was carried out in patients treated with intensive chemotherapy for AL and compared with a control of 49 cycles without prophylaxis. RESULTS: Pulmonary infiltrates (5 vs. 23; p < 0.001) and fungal microabscesses in the liver or spleen (0 vs. 6; p = 0.014) occurred significantly less frequently in the prophylaxis group. While there were 3 deaths related to systemic fungal infections in the control group, there were none in the prophylaxis group. Escalation to conventional AMB (1.0 mg/kg/day) was significantly less frequent in the prophylaxis group (9 out of 46 cycles) compared with the control arm (29 out of 49 cycles; p = 0.001). A total of 695 mg of AMB per cycle was administered in the prophylaxis arm, compared with 634 mg/cycle for empirical treatment in the control group (p = 0.6).

This disruption event has been frequently visualized in immunofluorescence assays using the anti-PML mouse monoclonal antibody PG-M3. This antibody was surprisingly found to also stain nuclear virus replication compartments when employed at higher concentrations. This was shown to be due to an unexpected cross-reactivity of the PG-M3 antibody with the HSV-1 immediate early protein ICP4, a known component of replication compartments. The sequences of ICP4 recognized by PG-M3 were found to map to the extreme amino-terminal end of the protein, which includes a 21 amino acid segment that is partially homologous to the peptide of PML that was used to make PG-M3. These results suggest that PG-M3 may no longer represent an appropriate antibody for use in visualizing the fate of PML and ND10 during HSV-1 infection.","['Infectious Diseases Section, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, A Division of Warner-Lambert Company, 2800 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, USA.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (herpes simplex virus, type 1 protein ICP4)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in the uterine concentration of LIFRbeta mRNA during pregnancy or in response to hormones after ovariectomy were determined by Northern hybridization analysis and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The skunk uterus produces two LIFRbeta transcripts, the levels of which increase in concentration when the blastocysts resume their development but then decline somewhat during the latter stage of blastocyst activation. Ovariectomy significantly reduced uterine LIFRbeta expression. Estradiol and/or progesterone failed to significantly elevate LIFRbeta mRNA levels in ovariectomized animals. Prolactin significantly increased uterine concentrations of LIFRbeta mRNA to greater than those of ovariectomized controls, but these levels were not comparable to those observed during preimplantation.

These studies also show that terminal differentiation in the erythroid lineage is unusual since the acquisition of the phenotypic traits of mature cells occurs while the cells are still actively dividing. Furthermore, under specific stress conditions, a massive and sustained self-renewal of committed erythroid progenitors can take place to replenish the pool of terminally differentiated cells. We review here how the erythroid genetic program and its interplay with specific cytokines, growth factors and hormones controls survival, proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors both in normal and stress conditions. Special emphasis is laid on our present understanding of the differences in cell cycle control, which result either in self-renewal of erythroid progenitors or in the particular cell divisions which accompany terminal differentiation. Finally, we discuss how deregulation of the various aspects of the physiological control of erythroid progenitor survival, proliferation and differentiation can lead to erythroblast transformation and erythroleukemia.","['CNRS UMR 146/Institut Curie, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.']",,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study demonstrates that in different cell types, the level of LIFRalpha decreases during treatment with LIF or the closely related cytokine oncostatin M (OSM). Moreover, insulin and epidermal growth factor induce a similar LIFRalpha down-regulation. The regulated loss of LIFRalpha is specific since neither gp130 nor OSM receptor beta shows a comparable change in turnover. LIFRalpha down-regulation correlates with reduced cell responsiveness to LIF. Using protein kinase inhibitors and point mutations in LIFRalpha, we demonstrate that LIFRalpha down-regulation depends on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of LIFRalpha at serine 185. This modification appears to promote the endosomal/lysosomal pathway of the LIFRalpha. These results suggest that extracellular signal-regulated kinase-activating factors like OSM and growth factors have the potential to lower specifically LIF responsiveness in vivo by regulating LIFRalpha half-life.","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, INSERM U463, France. frederic.blanchard@roswellpark.org']","['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,"['CA 26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 38866/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed previously that a novel allosterically controllable ribozyme, of the type known as a maxizyme, can cleave this mRNA, with high specificity and high-level activity in vivo. We designed the maxizyme in such a way that it was able to form an active core with which to capture the catalytically indispensable Mg2+ ions only in the presence of the BCR-ABL mRNA junction. In order to probe the putative conformational changes, we used a weakly alkaline solution (pH 9.2) in the presence of 25 mM Mg2+ ions to hydrolyze differentially phosphodiester bonds that were located in different environments.

The LIF receptor shares a common gp130 receptor subunit with the IL-6 cytokine superfamily. LIF signaling is mediated mainly by JAK-STAT (janus-kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathways and is abrogated by the SOCS (suppressor-of cytokine signaling) and PIAS (protein inhibitors of activated STAT) proteins. In addition to classic hematopoietic and neuronal actions, LIF plays a critical role in several endocrine functions including the utero-placental unit, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, bone cell metabolism, energy homeostasis, and hormonally responsive tumors. This paper reviews recent advances in our understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating LIF expression and action and also provides a systemic overview of LIF-mediated endocrine regulation. Local and systemic LIF serve to integrate multiple developmental and functional cell signals, culminating in maintaining appropriate hormonal and metabolic homeostasis. LIF thus functions as a critical molecular interface between the neuroimmune and endocrine systems.","['Academic Affairs, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine, 90048, USA.']","['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",447,,,['DK 50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the functional and phenotypic characteristics of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in comparison to peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were analyzed in patients with and without Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients with Crohn's disease and six control patients were studied. Isolated IEL and PBL were tested for cytolytic activity against the human adenocarcinoma cells DLD-1 and the human leukemia cells K562 in a 51Cr-release assay. Two-color flow cytometry was performed for phenotype analysis of isolated lymphocytes. RESULTS: IEL from patients with Crohn's disease showed significantly increased cytolytic activity against epithelial-derived target cells when compared with IEL from control patients. In contrast, no functional changes were detectable among PBL from patients with Crohn's disease. IEL from patients with Crohn's disease contained a significantly higher percentage of CD8+ lymphocytes when compared with IEL from control patients, whereas no phenotypic changes were observed among PBL. CONCLUSIONS: In Crohn's disease, the functional and phenotypic changes of T cells are limited to lymphocytes of the intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, it is conceivable that the increased cytolytic activity of IEL contributes to the tissue damage in this disease.","['Department of Surgery, Charite, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin, Germany. natascha.nuessler@charite.de']",,,,,['AI 14032/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The active metabolite 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine triphosphate (ara-CTP) is a potent inhibitor of DNA polymerases alpha, delta, and epsilon, and is responsible for inhibiting intact cell DNA synthesis. We have shown that a multiprotein complex, exhibiting many of the properties expected of the human cell DNA replication apparatus, can be readily isolated from human cells and tissues and is capable of supporting origin-dependent DNA synthesis in vitro. DNA polymerases alpha, delta, and epsilon are components of this multiprotein complex, termed the DNA synthesome, and we report here that the activities of these DNA synthesome-associated DNA polymerases are inhibited differentially by ara-CTP. Inhibition of the DNA synthesome-associated DNA polymerase alpha increased in a concentration-dependent manner, and was correlated closely with the inhibition of simian virus 40 (SV40) origin-dependent in vitro DNA replication, whereas DNA synthesome-associated DNA polymerase delta activity was not inhibited significantly by ara-CTP at 100 microM. Recent work has shown that the synthesome-associated DNA polymerase epsilon does not function in in vitro SV40 DNA replication, suggesting that only polymerases alpha and delta drive the DNA replication fork. Therefore, our results suggest that inhibition of the activity of the mammalian cell DNA synthesome by ara-CTP is due primarily to the inhibition of the DNA synthesome-associated DNA polymerase alpha.

Since resistance to oxazaphosphorines can be produced in mammalian cells by transfecting them with the gene for human ALDH isozyme 3 (hALDH3), it seems possible that patients receiving therapy for solid tumors with cyclophosphamide might be protected from myelosuppression by their prior transplantation with autologous bone marrow that has been transduced with a retroviral vector causing overexpression of hALDH3. We investigated whether retroviral introduction of hALDH3 into a human leukemia cell line confers resistance to oxazaphosphorines. This was examined in the polyclonal transduced population, that is, without selecting out high expression clones. hALDH3 activity was 0.016 IU/mg protein in the transduced cells (compared with 2x10(-5) IU/mg in untransduced cells), but there was no detectable resistance to aldophosphamide-generating compounds (mafosfamide or 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide). The lack of protection was due, in part, to low catalytic activity of hALDH3 towards aldophosphamide, since, with NAD as cofactor, the catalytic efficiency of homogeneous, recombinant hALDH3 for aldophosphamide oxidation was shown to be about seven times lower than that of recombinant hALDH1. The two polymorphic forms of hALDH3 had identical kinetics with either benzaldehyde or aldophosphamide as substrate. Results of initial velocity measurements were consistent with an ordered sequential mechanism for ALDH1 but not for hALDH3; a kinetic mechanism for the latter is proposed, and the corresponding rate equation is presented.","[""Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 38105, Memphis, TN, USA.""]","['0 (5-chlorocyclophosphamide)', '0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzaldehydes)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (corneal protein 54, bovine)', '7AM2ILM9FI (aldophosphamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'AMJ2B4M67V (propionaldehyde)', 'EC 1.2.1 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (ALDH1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (Retinal Dehydrogenase)', 'TA269SD04T (benzaldehyde)']",,,,"['P01 HL 53749/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, Hibiscus PCA was found to inhibit the survival of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The study revealed that HL-60 cells underwent internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis after a 9-hr treatment with Hibiscus PCA (2 mM). Flow cytometric analysis of the DNA content of cells treated with PCA for 12 hr showed that the cells were distributed mainly in the hypodiploid phase (apoptotic peak, 46.7%), less in the G(1) (34.2%) and S phase (14.0%), and few in the G(2)/M phase (5.1%). Moreover, PCA treatment caused an increase in the level of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma (RB; 180% of control at the 6-hr time point) and, on the contrary, a decline in hyperphosphorylated RB. A rapid loss of RB was observed when the treatment period was extended. Further studies showed that Hibiscus PCA application reduced Bcl-2 protein expression to 47%, and increased Bax protein expression to 181% after 1.5 hr as compared with time 0.

Endogenous folate pools were modestly reduced but polyglutamate derivatives of DDATHF and ALIMTA (LY231514, MTA) were markedly decreased in these mutant cell lines. Membrane transport was not a factor in drug resistance; rather, folypolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity was decreased by >98%. In each cell line, FPGS mRNA expression was unchanged but both alleles of the FPGS gene bore a point mutation in highly conserved domains of the coding region. Four mutations were in the predicted ATP-, folate-, and/or glutamate-binding sites of FPGS, and two others were clustered in a peptide predicted to be beta sheet 5, based on the crystal structure of the Lactobacillus casei enzyme. Transfection of cDNAs for three mutant enzymes into FPGS-null Chinese hamster ovary cells restored a reduced level of clonal growth, whereas a T339I mutant supported growth at a level comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme. The two mutations predicted to be in beta sheet 5, and one in the loop between NH(2)- and COOH-terminal domains did not support cell growth. When sets of mutated cDNAs were co-transfected into FPGS-null cells to mimic the genotype of drug-selected resistant cells, clonal growth was restored. These results demonstrate for the first time that single amino acid substitutions in several critical regions of FPGS can cause marked resistance to tetrahydrofolate antimetabolites, while still allowing cell survival.","['Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']","['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,"['CA-39687/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-82621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1998 and February 1999, 41 patients with metastatic RCC were enrolled onto this multi-institutional phase II study of gemcitabine 600 mg/m(2) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and 5-FU 150 mg/m(2)/d via continuous IV infusion through a permanent catheter on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. Patients had a Cancer and Leukemia Group B performance status of 0 or 1, with a median time since diagnosis of metastatic disease of 10 months (range, 0 to 129 months). Thirty-three patients (80%) had multiple metastatic sites, and 34 patients (83%) had prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy. RESULTS: Of the 39 assessable patients, there were no complete responses but seven partial responses (objective response rate = 17%; 95% confidence interval, 8% to 34%). Five minor responses (25% to 50% decreased tumor size) were also observed. The duration of response for the seven partial responders was 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 14 months. Median progression-free survival for the gemcitabine/5-FU group was 28.7 weeks versus 8 weeks for a similar cohort of patients treated on previous phase II studies at the University of Chicago (P =.008). The regimen was well tolerated, with fatigue, mucositis, nausea/vomiting, and grade 2 hematologic toxicities being most common. CONCLUSION: Weekly gemcitabine with continuous infusion 5-FU is an active combination in patients with metastatic RCC.

We used data from 23,829 British Columbian sawmill workers employed for at least 1 continuous year between 1950 and 1985 in 11 sawmills that used chlorophenates. Probabilistic linkage of the sawmill worker cohort to the provincial marriage and birth files produced an offspring cohort of 19,674 children born at least 1 year after the initiation of employment in the period 1952-1988. We then linked the offspring cohort to the British Columbia Cancer Registry. We included all malignancies in cases younger than 20 years of age that appeared on the cancer registry between 1969 and 1993. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) using the British Columbia population as a reference. A nested case-control analysis assessed the effects of paternal cumulative exposure and windows of exposure on the risk of developing cancer in the offspring. We identified 40 cases of cancer during 259,919 person-years of follow-up. The all-cancer SIR was 1.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7-1.4]; the SIR for leukemia was 1.0 (CI, 0.5-1.8); and the SIR for brain cancer was 1.3 (CI, 0.6-2.5). The nested case-control analysis showed slightly increased risks in the highest categories of chlorophenol exposure, although none was statistically significant.

To evaluate gene-environment interaction, we used a subgroup of 129 cases. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for one reported postnatal child X ray versus none was 1.04 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72-1.49], whereas the OR for two or more X rays was 1.61 (CI, 1.13-2.28).

Lithium salt compounds are used to limit the degree and duration of neutropenia in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer and acute leukemia. Lithium influences the hematopoietic system, which is known to be regulated by numerous cytokines including IL-8. METHODS: We selected three groups of subjects (15 per group): patients affected by BCaM0, BCaM1 and healthy donors (HD) matched for sex and age. IL-8 release was assessed in supernatants of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or LiCl-treated monocyte cultures. RESULTS: Monocytes from BCaM1 released higher IL-8 levels than monocytes from BCaM0 (P <0.0001); the IL-8 levels of both groups were significantly higher (P <0.0001) than those of HD. In vitro LiCl treatment reduced IL-8 production by monocytes obtained from all subjects compared to the same cells when untreated or LPS treated. The suppressive effect of LiCl on IL-8 production by monocytes from breast cancer patients was particularly marked in monocytes from BCaM0 with respect to those from BCaM1. LPS treatment increased the IL-8 production more in BCaM1 monocytes than in BCaM0 monocytes. Moreover, combined LPS/LiCl treatment of monocytes significantly (p <0.0001) downregulated the release of IL-8 compared to treatment with LPS alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that monocytes from BCaM0 release larger amounts of IL-8 than monocytes from BCaM0 and from HD. Lithium was able to downregulate IL-8 production by monocytes from different subgroups. Further studies are needed to clarify if the improvement of the hematopoietic system in vivo observed following lithium therapy could reside, at least in part, in the ability of lithium to downregulate this chemokine.","['Department of Human Pathology, University of Messina Medical School, Italy.']","['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most predictable side effects of these products is a constellation of various systemic effects including flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever, sweats, skin rash, shortness of breath, hypotension, nausea, and asthenia that occurs with the first infusion of such products. Rarely severe hypotension, bronchospasm, and hypoxia and even death have occurred. The pathophysiology of these reactions appears to be secondary to the release of cytokines as the antibodies bind do circulating antigen-expressing cells that are then removed in the reticuloendothelial system of the lungs, spleen and liver. In patients with large numbers of antigen-dense cells that have a high mitotic index, such as prolymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, or lymphosarcoma cell leukemia, there is a risk of true tumor lysis syndrome.

One of the goals of molecular epidemiology studies of cancer is to determine the role of environmental and genetic factors in initiation and progression of malignancies and to use this knowledge to develop preventive strategies. This approach promises extraordinary opportunities for revolutionizing the practice of medicine and reducing risk. However, this will be accompanied by the need to address and resolve many challenges, such as ensuring the appropriate interpretation of molecular testing and resolving associated ethical, legal, and social issues. Traditional epidemiologic approaches determined that exposure to ionizing radiation poses significantly increased risk of leukemia and several other types of cancer. Such studies provided the basis for setting exposure standards to protect the public and the workforce from potentially adverse effects of ionizing radiation. These standards were set by using modeling approaches to extrapolate from the biological effects observed in high-dose radiation studies to predicted, but mostly unmeasurable, effects at low radiation doses. It is anticipated that the addition of the molecular parameters to the population-based studies will help identify the genes and pathways characteristic of cancers due to radiation exposure of individuals, as well as identify susceptible or resistant subpopulations. In turn, the information about the molecular mechanisms should aid to improve risk assessment. While studies on radiogenic cancers are currently limited to only a few candidate genes, the exponential growth of scientific knowledge and technology promises expansion of knowledge about identity of participating genes and pathways in the future. This article is meant to provide an introductory overview of recent advances in understanding of carcinogenesis at the molecular level, with an emphasis of the aspects that may be of use in establishing the association between radiation and cancer.","['Office of International Health Programs, U.S. Department of Energy, Germantown, MD 20874, USA. ruth.neta@eh.doe.gov']",,30,,,,,,,,,,['NASA'],['Non-programmatic'],,,,

However, over the last years, it has become increasingly clear that paracrine and autocrine mechanisms are also important for steroid synthesis in the adrenal gland. The current study was designed to analyze whether the pleiotropic cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and/or its receptor (LIF-R) are expressed in the normal human adrenal cortex, and whether they may play a role in regulating steroidogenesis. Using LIF- and LIF-R-specific primers, we show by RT-PCR that both mRNAs are expressed in this tissue, as well as in the NCI-H295 adrenal carcinoma cell line. The correct sequences of the PCR products were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Immunohistochemistry, employing specific antibodies against LIF and LIF-R, reveals expression of both proteins in the normal human adrenal cortex. Finally, we show that LIF can significantly enhance basal and ACTH-induced production of cortisol and aldosterone in NCI-H295 cells. In summary, we show for the first time that LIF and its receptor are expressed in the normal human adrenal cortex. Our stimulation experiments indicate that the intraadrenal LIF/LIF-R system may participate in regulating adrenal steroidogenesis.","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. bamberger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Steroids)', '4964P6T9RB (Aldosterone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using HL60, CEM7, Jurkat and U937 cell lines and cytotoxic agents known to induce apoptosis, there was a significant correlation (P<0.01 for all models) between the ADP:ATP ratio and the degree of apoptosis measured by TUNEL and estimation of the sub G(0) fraction by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. The ratio measured in viable proliferating cells was found to be less than 0.11 compared with ratios between 0.11 and 1.0 seen in cells undergoing apoptosis. The higher the percentage of hypodiploidy the greater the ratio. Necrosis induced by heat shock resulted in ADP:ATP ratios in excess of 15.0. When primary cultures of AML blast cells were used, there was again a significant correlation between the ADP:ATP ratio and the degree of hypodiploidy. Recent evidence suggests that apoptosis is accompanied by opening of the mitochondrial permeability pores, leading to disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). This results in caspase activation due to the release of cytochrome c and apoptogenic factors into the cytosol. In five experiments using CEM7 and dexamethasone the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was assessed using the fluorescent cyanine dye JC-1 and flow cytometry. Functioning mitochondria concentrate the JC-1 to produce red fluorescence. Loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential results in green fluorescence only.

Each complex includes the common signal-transducing subunit gp130. OSM and LIF also recruit the signaling competent, but structurally distinct OSMRbeta and LIFRalpha subunits, respectively. To test the hypothesis that the particularly prominent cell regulation by OSM is due to signals contributed by OSMRbeta, we introduced stable expression of human or mouse OSMRbeta in rat hepatoma cells which have endogenous receptors for IL-6 and LIF, but not OSM. Both mouse and human OSM engaged gp130 with their respective OSMRbeta subunits, but only human OSM also acted through LIFR. Signaling by OSMRbeta-containing receptors was characterized by highest activation of STAT5 and ERK, recruitment of the insulin receptor substrate and Jun-N-terminal kinase pathways, and induction of a characteristic pattern of acute phase proteins. Since LIF together with LIFRalpha appear to form a more stable complex with gp130 than OSM with gp130 and OSMRbeta, co-activation of LIFR and OSMR resulted in a predominant LIF-like response. These results suggest that signaling by IL-6 cytokines is not identical, and that a hierarchical order of cytokine receptor action exists in which LIFR ranks as dominant member.","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']","['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Shc1 protein, rat)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, rat)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,"['CA 26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 38866/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This trial found a significant benefit of combination chemotherapy followed by irradiation (CTRT) in comparison to radiotherapy alone (RT) for the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer. The validity of the results obtained and the decision to terminate taken by the CALGB, were assessed using sequential methods. The reliability and efficiency of sequential methods were also assessed for this study. Two sequential designs were used: the triangular and the restricted procedure. Initial analyses were conducted with the data from patients actually recruited, adjusting for important prognostic variables at any interim analysis. As a confirmatory technique, a continuation of the trial was simulated, sampling extra patients under the assumption of no treatment difference, preserving the effect of the prognostic variables. Using the results from the 155 patients recruited by the CALGB (88 deaths at termination and 136 after follow-up), the sample path stayed within the continuation region of both sequential designs considered. An underpowered sequential analysis showed significant superiority of CTRT over RT (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.50-0.96, p=0.03 for the triangular; 95% CI 0.37-0.88, p=0.01 for the restricted procedure). Conventional analysis of the follow-up data also showed significant superiority of CTRT. The trial extended with simulated data ended at 60 months with 251 patients (178 deaths), showing significant superiority of CTRT under both designs (95% CI for hazard ratio 0.55-0.97). The two sequential procedures would have led to the same conclusion as that reached by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, still achieving considerable savings in patients recruited and time over the conventional design. The data simulated under the rather conservative null hypothesis did not reverse the positive result claimed by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B.","['Dept of Statistics, Stanford University, CA, USA.']",,,,['Eur Respir J. 2000 May;15(5):819-20.

Investigation revealed infection caused by Rhodotorula. The outcome was favourable after removal of the catheter in both patients. Rhodotorula species have been isolated during a variety of infectious complications. Almost all published cases of fungaemia concern patients with central venous catheters that have been in place over long periods, who have also been treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. Neoplasia represents the most frequent underlying disease. The pathogenicity of Rhodotorula species appears to be moderate in most cases; fungal therapy or the removal of infected catheters is generally effective.

There was a direct correlation between the modulating effect of AK-2123 and dose increase from 1 to 10 mg/kg.

By determining whether human DNA sequences are present or absent in each of the hybrids, localization of single genes may routinely be achieved at approximately 250-kb resolution. In this paper we have tested whether similarly precise localization might be achieved by phenotypic screening of the hybrids to facilitate positional cloning of unknown genes. We assayed the susceptibility of each of the hybrid cell lines to transduction by retroviral vectors bearing different retroviral envelope proteins that recognize receptors present on human but not on hamster cells. The results for each of the retroviral vectors were informative and allowed precise localization of the receptor genes for the RD114 cat endogenous retrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia virus, and type C feline leukemia virus. After cloning of the receptors for these retroviruses, we found that standard genotypic mapping by PCR gave results that were nearly identical to those from phenotypic mapping. These experiments show that precise gene localization by phenotypic assay of radiation hybrids is practical and was not appreciably impacted by the known instability of such hybrid cells. This technique should be applicable to many other human genes having discernible phenotypes in hamster cells and, with completion of the human genome project, will allow rapid identification of unknown genes on the basis of phenotype.","['Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",,,,,"['P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HL054881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC16555,,,,,,,,,,,

We have purified Moloney murine leukemia virus Gag particles by sedimentation in an iodixanol gradient and donor PMs by flotation in a sucrose gradient and compared their protein compositions at equal lipid basis. We found that most PM proteins are present at similar density in both membranes. The inclusion of PM proteins was unaffected by incorporation of Env protein into the envelope of the Gag particles and whether these were produced at high or low level in the cells. These findings indicate that most PM proteins become incorporated into the retrovirus envelope without significant sorting.

The evidence for exposures occurring during the preconceptional period that have an association with childhood or adulthood cancers is equivocal. Agents definitely related to cancer in children, and adulthood if exposure occurs in utero, include: maternal exposure to ionizing radiation during pregnancy and childhood leukemia and certain other cancers, and maternal use of diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy and clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina of their daughters. The list of environmental exposures that occur during the perinatal/postnatal period with potential to increase the risk of cancer is lengthening, but evidence available to date is inconsistent and inconclusive. In animal models, preconceptional carcinogenesis has been demonstrated for a variety of types of radiation and chemicals, with demonstrated sensitivity for all stages from fetal gonocytes to postmeiotic germ cells. Transplacental and neonatal carcinogenesis show marked ontogenetic stage specificity in some cases. Mechanistic factors include the number of cells at risk, the rate of cell division, the development of differentiated characteristics including the ability to activate and detoxify carcinogens, the presence of stem cells, and possibly others. Usefulness for human risk estimation would be strengthened by the study of these factors in more than one species, and by a focus on specific human risk issues.","['Laboratory of Comparative Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute, FCRDC, Frederick, Maryland, USA. andersol@mail.ncifcrf.gov']",['0 (Xenobiotics)'],257,,,,PMC1637809,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, the internalisation of two antibodies in two different cellular systems is analysed: the anti-p21ras monoclonal antibody (MoAb) after surface Ig binding on murine placental cells and anti-cdc2 MoAb that binds directly to its surface receptor expressed on the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. In both cases, binding and internalisation is followed by Electron Microscopy (EM) and function is assessed by different assays. The first involves abrogation of class II antigen expression induced by Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and 5-Azacytidine (5-AzaC) known to be mediated by activation of the ras pathway. The second involves growth cessation of HL-60 cells after antibody adsorption when a G1-S-specific culture supernatant containing anti-cdc2 activity is employed, whereas no growth hindrance is observed when a G2-M-specific anti-cdc2 MoAb is used. Thus, the antibodies do not follow the lysosyme pathway and do not lose their functional activity.

It has shown efficacy against various malignancies, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and septic shock in animal models and has been investigated for clinical use in minimal residual myeloid leukemia with promising results. Interleukin-2 has shown considerable efficacy in palliative anti-tumor-treatment of advanced renal cell cancer, revealing remission rates of up to 40% in combination therapy regimens. Linomide is reported to exhibit synergistic effects with interleukin-2. Here we report on a clinical phase I/II study examining tolerance and efficacy of a combination therapy schedule of SQ interleukin-2 and PO Linomide in advanced renal cell cancer. Seventeen patients received 10 IU/m2 interleukin-2 per week for 8 weeks, resting interleukin-2 for another 8 weeks. In week 5 they started 5 mg Linomide daily, continued with 10 mg from week 7 to 16. No objective remissions were observed. Among 15 patients evaluable for response, 10 (66.7%) were progredient during the study. Three patients died during the observation period, including two not evaluable for response. Median survival was 4.0 months, median progression-free survival 2.5 months with a Kaplan-Meier estimate of 3.63 months. Fever, reduced general condition, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, anorexia, chills and hypotension were the most common side effects, reaching WHO grade 3 in 6 and grade 4 in 2 cases. In summary, Linomide in combination with interleukin-2 provides no advantages in efficacy or toxicity over other therapy regimens employing interleukin-2.","['Abteilung Haematologie und Onkologie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']","['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Hydroxyquinolines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '372T2944C0 (roquinimex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most reported studies have used cultured tumor cell lines as targets to assess antitumor cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, it is difficult to translate the data generated from the cytotoxic activity against cultured tumor cell lines to cytotoxicity against autologous tumors. In a recent study, we have reported on the prognostic significance of circulating cytotoxic lymphocytes against autologous tumor cells in patients with bladder cancer. In this study, we examined whether established bladder cancer cell line like T24 or NK-sensitive K562 target cells can be substituted for autologous bladder cancer cells. The cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) against freshly isolated autologous tumor cells, the T24 human bladder cancer cell line and the NK-sensitive K562 human myelogenous leukemia cell line was studied in 63 patients with primary initial bladder cancer by a 12-h 51Cr release assay. The mean percent cytotoxic activity of PBL directed against autologous tumor cells, T24 cells and K562 cells were 11.3%, 18.2% and 29.4%, respectively, using an E:T of 40:1. The cytotoxic activity against T24 cells in patients with bladder cancer was higher than that in normal individuals. The anti-K562 and the anti-T24 cytotoxic activities in patients with low-stage or low-grade bladder cancer were relatively higher than those in patients with high-stage or high-grade cancer, but not statistically significant. There was no correlation between the anti-autologous tumor cytotoxic activity and either the histologic grade or stage in patients with bladder cancer. The extent of the anti-autologous tumor cytotoxic activity was not paralleled with that of either the anti-K562 or the anti-T24 cytotoxic activity. In contrast, the anti-K562 cytotoxic activity correlated positively with the anti-T24 cytotoxic activity. Separation of PBL revealed that the anti-K562 and the anti-T24 cytotoxic activities were mediated mainly by the NK cells, whereas the anti-autologous tumor cytotoxic activity was mediated by both the NK cells and the T lymphocytes. These findings demonstrate that cytotoxicity against T24 or K562 cells is not of prognostic value. The magnitude of the anti-autologous tumor cytotoxic activity of PBL derived from bladder cancer patients might represent an independent and important immunological parameter to monitor disease progression.","['Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The breakpoints of the different rearrangements segregate into two clusters; a cluster due to inversion on the centromeric side and a cluster due to simple balanced translocations on the telomeric side. If the target gene activated by these different types of chromosomal rearrangements is the same, the gene must be localized between the two clusters of breakpoints in a region of around 160 kb. Within this breakpoint cluster region, we isolated two genes; namely, TCL1 and TML1/TCL1b genes. In the course of characterizing the TML1 gene, we further identified a third novel gene, which we named TCL6 (T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6), from a region 7 kb upstream of the TML1 locus. The TCL6 gene expressed at least 11 isoforms through very complex alternative-splicing, including splicing with the TML1 gene. Those isoforms encode at least five open reading frames (ORFs) with no homology to known sequences. The localization of the proteins corresponding to these ORF was determined by fusing green fluorescence protein at the carboxyl terminal of each ORF. ORF141 and ORF72 were observed in the cytoplasmic region, while ORF105, ORF119, and ORF163 were predominantly localized in the nuclear region. Since the TCL6 gene was expressed in T-cell leukemia carrying a t(14;14)(q11;q32.1) chromosome translocation and was not expressed in normal T-cells (just like the TML1 and TCL1 genes), it is also a candidate gene potentially involved in leukemogenesis.

However, only leukemic progenitors express the membrane bound IL-15. Colocalization and internalization of IL-15Rbeta/gammac and IL-15Ralpha/gammac complexes indicated that IL-15 was specifically uptaken by leukemic progenitors.

CBFbeta-SMMHC slows the G1 to S cell cycle transition in hematopoietic cells, but the mechanism of this effect is uncertain. We have sought to determine whether inhibition of CBF-mediated trans-activation is sufficient to slow proliferation. We demonstrate that activation of KRAB-AML1-ER, a protein containing the AML1 DNA-binding domain, the KRAB repression domain, and the Estrogen receptor ligand binding domain, also slows G1, if its DNA-binding domain is intact. Also, exogenous AML1 overcame CBFbeta-SMMHC-induced inhibition of proliferation. Representational difference analysis (RDA) identified cdk4 RNA expression as an early target of KRAB-AML1 activation. Inhibition of CBF activities by KRAB-AML1-ER or CBFbeta-SMMHC rapidly reduced endogenous cdk4 mRNA levels, even in cells proliferating at or near control rates as a result of exogenous cdk4 expression. Over-expression of cdk4, especially a variant which cannot bind p16INK4a, overcame cell cycle inhibition resulting from activation of KRAB-AML1-ER, although cdk4 did not accelerate proliferation when expressed alone. These findings indicate that mutations which alter the expression of G1 regulatory proteins can overcome inhibition of proliferation by CBF oncoproteins.

In vitro studies have shown that STAT proteins are essential for cytokine-regulated processes such as cellular proliferation, differentiation as well as survival. Similarly, various STAT knock-outs have highlighted the role of STATs in myeloid differentiation in vivo. STATs also appear to play an important role in various myeloid malignancies, which are characterized by arrested maturation and cytokine-independent proliferation of myeloid progenitors.

Thus, there is great interest in treatments directed against inappropriately activated cell signaling pathways which stimulate the uncontrolled growth of neoplastic cells. Increasing evidence suggests that the STAT signaling cascade may be one target of these therapies. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are critical in mediating the response of hematopoietic cells to a diverse spectrum of cytokines. Constitutive STAT activation is present in many malignancies and has been especially well characterized in acute and chronic leukemias. While STAT activation is a common characteristic of leukemias, the specific pattern of activated STATs and the manner by which STAT activation occurs vary with each disease. STAT tyrosine phosphorylation can occur through inappropriate Jak activation or by direct activation of an oncoprotein such as Bcr/Abl, and STAT serine phosphorylation may play an important role in leukemias as well. Thus, the STAT signaling pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention, and strategies designed to inhibit STAT activation and STAT mediated gene transcription may play an important role in the next generation of anti-leukemia therapies.

Allografts consisted of untreated bone from a SPF cat (negative-control group) and bone from 5 FeLV-infected cats that was subjected to sterilization with ethylene oxide (ETO), preservation with glycerol, or no treatment (positive-control group). SAMPLE POPULATION: Bones from the aforementioned groups and twenty 8-week-old SPF cats (5 cats/group) implanted with an allograft from 1 of the aforementioned groups. PROCEDURE: After implantation, blood samples were collected weekly to monitor FeLV p27 antigen and antibody titers. Quantification of FeLV provirus was performed on blood samples at weeks 0, 4, and 8 and donor bone samples at time of implantation. Cats were euthanatized 8 weeks after transplantation, and graft sites were evaluated. RESULTS: All results for negative-control cats were negative. All ETO group cats had negative results for antigen and provirus in blood, whereas 1 cat had a low antibody titer. Although 3 ETO-treated allografts were positive for provirus, the DNA appeared denatured. One cat in the glycerol group had positive results for all tests in blood samples. All glycerol-preserved allografts were positive when tested for provirus. All results for positive-control group cats were positive. Differences in incorporation of bone grafts were not observed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Glycerol preservation of FeLV-infected bone allografts did not eliminate transmission of retrovirus to recipients. In contrast, ETO sterilization appeared to denature DNA and prevent infection.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to reevaluate the expression of KIT on human early haematopoietic cells, and to study the distribution of HHSC among bone marrow mononuclear KIT+ and KIT- cells. First, we found that the detection sensitivity of the KIT expression on human HEL cells as well as CD34+ depends on the type of fluorochrome employed for the immunostaining (Cy5 > PE > FITC). Based on this observation, in our strategy for isolating human HHSC we employed a Cy-5 conjugated alpha-KIT MoAbs, which stained CD34+ cells in our preliminary studies the brightest. Accordingly, we labeled human BMMNC with PE-alpha-CD34 and Cy5-alpha-KIT MoAbs and subsequently sorted various subsets of labeled cells (CD34+KIT+, CD34+KIT- and CD34-KIT-). Cells sorted by FACS were then evaluated for their ability to engraft in the immunodeficient SCID mice model. We report here that only CD34+KIT+ cells, but not CD34+KIT- or CD34-KIT- were able to establish a human-murine haematopoietic chimerism in these animals. We found that SCID mice transplanted with CD34+ KIT+ cells, possessed approximately 5-11% of mononuclear cells, which expressed human CD45 antigen 4-5 weeks after transplantation in their bone marrow and, more importantly, early human haematopoietic progenitors from the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineages. Based on these results we conclude that KIT (CD117) is a very useful marker for identifying HHSC, and that HHSC, at least in our hands, are found in the KIT+ population of CD34+ cells.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA. mariusz@mail.med.upenn.edu']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,"['4P05A 09116/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 HL61796-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these matters is represented by the RT step. The present study shows that differences in complementary DNA (cDNA) preparations purposely containing increasing amounts of retrotranscribed RNA were not disclosed by nonquantitative RT-PCR by two different housekeeping genes, leading to fictitious results when the expression of a given gene was quantitatively assessed. To overcome this problem, the following are proposed: 1) to evaluate the efficiency of RT step through the quantification, by competitive RT-PCR, of the expression levels of the housekeeping gene beta2-microglobulin (beta2M); 2) to normalize each cDNA preparation to be comprised within 1 standard deviation of the mean value of beta2M absolute level (3.14 +/- 1.14 attomoles/microg RNA) found by analyzing 33 cell lines of hematopoietic origin. To validate this strategy in a clinical setting, serial cDNA samples from patients were checked by conventional and quantitative RT-PCR for beta2M. Again, only a quantitative evaluation of beta2M levels was allowed to unveil significant differences, otherwise undetected, in the efficiency of RT reactions among these cDNA samples. Normalization of samples to obtain cDNA preparations containing comparable beta2M levels, eventually led to an increased sensitivity in the detection of PML-RARalpha fusion transcripts. This approach seems of great value for the monitoring of minimal residual disease in serial patient samples when a tumor-specific marker is available.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano, Italy.']","['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the evolution can take years to occur, we used DNAs extracted from archival samples. These samples were analyzed with 79 microsatellite markers, which mapped to each of the autosomal arms except the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes. Loss of heterozygosity on at least one locus was observed in 18 of the 24 cases (75%) as the disease progressed. Frequent allelic loss in >20% of the informative cases was observed on chromosome arms 6q (31%), 7p (23%), 10p (31%), 11q (27%), 14q (25%), and 20q (23%). Although cytogenetic information was available for many of our cases with allelic loss on 6q, 7p, 10p, 11q, 14q, and 20q, no deletions were observed on these arms. Fractional allelic loss, calculated for each sample as the total number of chromosomal arms lost per total number of arms with information, showed a median value of 0.06 and a mean of 0.15 (range, 0-0.59). No microsatellite instability at more than one marker was found in any of the samples. These results suggest that tumor suppressor genes exist on 6q, 7p, 10p, 11q, 14q, and 20q that have an important role in the evolution of MDS to AML when they are mutated.","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty adult patients who had advanced B-cell malignancies (25 NHL and 5 CLL) had progressed despite standard therapy; 12 patients entered the trial with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of equal to or greater than 60. Patients were treated with a series of intravenous doses of 131I-Lym-1 with a goal of reaching a cumulative dose in each patient of at least 300 mCi. All patients were Lym-1 reactive. Clinical responses and immediate toxicity were evaluable in all 30 patients and delayed toxicity in 26. RESULTS: Toxicity to Lym-1 antibody occurred with 28% of the 176 doses and was transient. Human antimouse antibodies (HAMA) were generated in 30% after a mean of 4 doses, but interrupted therapy in only 10% of the patients. Thrombocytopenia was dose-limiting; there were no deaths due to toxicity. Tumor regression occurred in 25 (83%) of the patients and was great enough, and durable enough, in 17 (57%) to qualify them as responders; 13 NHL patients and 4 CLL patients. Advanced disease often interrupted therapy prematurely. However, 18 patients received at least 180 mCi of 131I-Lym-1; 17 (94%) of these responded to the therapy.

A well developed stromal cell layer supported production of DC in numbers suitable for experimentation. Cells had obvious membrane pseudopodia and could be collected from culture every 2-3 days. Large cells produced in LTC stained with fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibodies specific for DC such as 33D1, and M1/70 which is specific for DC and myeloid cells. These staining patterns confirmed the presence of DC within the LTC population. LTC-DC were tested and shown capable of migration in vivo in B10.A(2R) mice following footpad inoculation. Most cells entered the spleen and a small number entered popliteal lymph node. LTC-DC have migratory capacity comparable with control spleen lymphocytes. LTC-DC were tested for capacity to induce an anti-tumour immune response after exposing cells to tumour cell membranes. LTC-DC pulsed with BL/VL3 tumour antigens were able to induce a BL/VL3-specific primary cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response detectable in popliteal lymph nodes and spleen of C57BL/6J mice within 6 days of priming. BL/VL3 tumour cells grew in sublethally irradiated C57BL/6J mice giving 100% mortality. Adoptive transfer of spleen cells from mice given BL/VL3 antigen-pulsed LTC-DC, two weeks previously, significantly slowed the growth of BL/VL3 tumour cells in mice. DC produced in LTC can function as antigen presenting cells (APC) when adoptively transferred into animals. Their capacity to migrate effectively, to induce a CTL response and to reduce tumour load suggests that DC grown using this in vitro system may have valuable clinical potential in humans.","['Division of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, School of Life Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra ACT, Australia.

M. Seidlin and a celebrated patient at Montefiore Hospital in New York City are a number of findings that bear significantly on the contemporary practice of medicine relating to targeted radioisotope therapy. In 1943, Seidlin administered radioiodine to this patient, who was hyperthyroid although previously thyroidectomized, but who had several metastases from adenocarcinoma of the thyroid which localized the radioisotope. Seidlin recognized early that some thyroid metastases would take up radioiodine (i.e., function), but only after the normal thyroid gland was ablated, an essential preliminary procedure before radioiodine therapy should be administered, the clinical practice followed to this day. He held that removing the normal thyroid increased TSH production and eliminated the gland's competition for radioiodine, inducing the metastases to function. From 1942 until his death in 1955, Seidlin and his group followed many patients having metastatic thyroid carcinoma, conducting fruitful investigations concerned with the induction of function, dosimetry, and the occurrence of leukemia in some massively treated patients.","['Department of Radiology, University of California, San Francisco, USA.']","['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radioactive Tracers)', '0 (Thyroid Hormones)', '5Y5F15120W (Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)']",,,['Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 1999 Apr;14(2):65-6.

From 1990 to 1999, 229 women with HRBC underwent ASCT. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow (BM) cells was performed 12-59 months after ASCT in 60 consecutive women uniformly treated with six courses of FAC/FEC followed by HDCT and ASCT. With a median follow-up of 36 months after ASCT, there were no cases of MDS/AML among the 229 patients. In the selected cohort of 60 patients, three (5%) showed clonal chromosomal abnormalities (two single trisomy X and one t(1;6)), whereas two additional patients showed non-clonal reciprocal translocations. Two of the patients with clonal aberrations had blood cytopenias as well as subtle dysplastic pictures in BM which were not classifiable as MDS according to the FAB criteria. Similar dysplastic features were also observed in four patients with normal karyotypes. All cytogenetic aberrations were transient and disappeared, except a +X detected by FISH in a residual cell population in one of the patients. Retrospective cytogenetic and FISH studies of samples obtained after six cycles of FAC/FEC and before transplant demonstrated no chromosomal abnormalities in any of the five patients with post-ASCT karyotypic changes. Early changes in karyotype detected in breast cancer patients following ASCT are transient and do not correlate with or predict development of MDS/AML. As these aberrations were not present before ASCT, they may be related to the HDCT regimen or transplant procedure rather than to the prior adjuvant therapy.

With increasing numbers of cancer survivors, there is interest in the ongoing assessment of therapy-related complications. A medical record validation of patient-reported complications following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed using a self-administered questionnaire. The study population consisted of 100 patients who had undergone BMT at the City of Hope. The following self-reported complications were validated using medical records: ocular, endocrine, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, graft-versus-host disease, and subsequent cancers. Using information from medical records as the standard, sensitivities ranged from 52.9% for subsequent cancers to 100% for avascular necrosis and hypothyroidism. Specificities ranged from 75.4% for ocular complications to 100% for avascular necrosis. There was intermediate to excellent agreement (kappa = 0. 4-1.0) for all complications evaluated. Thus, the agreement between self-reporting and medical records was good for complications with clear diagnostic criteria that are easily communicated to the patient, but was diminished for complications with non-established diagnostic criteria (xerophthalmia) or a fluctuating course (peripheral neuropathies and hypertension). Overall these results suggest that cancer survivors can self-report serious complications with an acceptable level of accuracy in epidemiological research.","['Divisions of Pediatrics, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010-3000, USA.']",,,,,"['CA 30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Spearman's rank statistics were used to examine the correlation between WBC, MNC, HPC and CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood and final CD34+ cell yield for 112 samples of peripheral blood and matching apheresis collections from 66 patients and donors. The results indicate that WBC and MNC in the peripheral blood were poor predictors of CD34 content, while HPC gave a correlation coefficient of 0.62.

Bcr-Abl is coupled to many of the same signaling pathways normally regulated by hematopoietic cytokines. Recent work shows that Hck, a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family with myeloid-restricted expression, associates with and is activated by Bcr-Abl. Here we investigated the mechanism of Hck interaction with Bcr-Abl and the requirement for Hck activation in Bcr-Abl transformation signaling. Binding studies demonstrated that the Hck SH3 and SH2 domains are sufficient for interaction with Bcr-Abl in vitro. Hck binding localizes to the Abl SH2, SH3, and kinase domains as well as the distal portion of the C-terminal tail. To address the requirement for endogenous Src family kinase activation in Bcr-Abl signaling, a kinase-defective mutant of Hck was stably expressed in the cytokine-dependent myeloid leukemia cell line DAGM. Kinase-defective Hck dramatically suppressed Bcr-Abl-induced outgrowth of these cells in the absence of cytokine compared with a control cell line expressing beta-galactosidase. In contrast, kinase-defective Hck did not affect cell proliferation in response to interleukin-3, suggesting that the effect is specific for Bcr-Abl. These data show that Hck interacts with Bcr-Abl through a complex mechanism involving kinase-dependent and -independent components and that interaction with Hck or other Src family members is essential for transformation signaling by Bcr-Abl.","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",,,,['CA81398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Costimulation resulted in a prolonged and sustained phosphorylation and membrane localization of Vav1 in comparison to T-cell receptor activation alone. T-cell stimulation induced the recruitment of Vav1 to an inducible multiprotein T-cell activation signaling complex at the plasma membrane. Vav1 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases JNK and p38. The Vav1-mediated activation of JNK employed a pathway involving Rac, HPK1, MLK3, and MKK7. The costimulation-induced activation of p38 was inhibited by dominant negative forms of Vav1, Rac, and MKK6. Here we show that Vav1 also induces transcription factors that bind to the CD28RE/AP element contained in the interleukin-2 promoter. A detailed mutational analysis of Vav1 revealed a series of constitutively active and nonfunctional forms of Vav1. Almost all inactive versions were mutated in their Dbl homology domain and behaved as dominant negative mutants that impaired costimulation-induced activation of JNK, p38, and CD28RE/AP-dependent transcription. In contrast to NF-AT-dependent transcription, Vav1-mediated transcriptional induction of the CD28RE/AP element in the interleukin-2 promoter could only partially be inhibited by cyclosporin A, suggesting a dual role of Vav1 for controlling Ca(2+)-dependent and -independent events.","['German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Department of Immunochemistry, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']","['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore refer to Noda as B-lineage DC. Although human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) exhibit substantial cellular tropism, the roles of DC in HTLV-I infection remain unknown. To further clarify the characteristics of Noda cells, we performed infection experiments using a concentrated HTLV-I fraction from the adult T-cell leukemia cell line, HPB-ATL-2. Noda, as well as other cell lines examined, were sensitive to HTLV-I infection as detected by proviral DNA using polymerase chain reaction, but most infected Noda cells underwent necrosis within 7 days. The most striking feature of Noda cells was the abundant expression of viral antigen (p19) on the cell surface following infection (approximately day 4), probably due to strong viral adsorption. In cocultivation experiments using Noda cells at day 1 of post-infection and peripheral blood activated T cells, we detected a few (1.3%) viral antigen expressing T cells after 5 days of coculture by flow cytometry. These results suggest that B-lineage DC such as Noda cells play a role in the establishment of HTLV-I infection at an early phase.","['Department of Pathology, First Unit, Shimane Medical University, Izumo, Shimane, Japan. makoto-n@sx.miracle.ne.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the induction of adrenomedullin gene expression in THP-1 acute monocytic leukemia cells during differentiation into macrophage-like cells by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and identified a cis-regulatory region of the human adrenomedullin gene responsible for TPA-induced adrenomedullin expression.

Actinomycin D abolished the TPA-induced adrenomedullin expression, indicating that the induction of ADM gene expression by TPA was regulated at the transcriptional level. Transient transfection assay revealed that a cis-acting region (positions -70 to -30) of human adrenomedullin gene was necessary for TPA-induced reporter gene expression. This region contains multiple copies of activator protein 2 (AP-2) binding sites, which are bound by purified AP-2 protein, as judged by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The binding activity to this region was undetectable in nuclear extracts prepared from untreated THP-1 cells, but was increased in extracts prepared from TPA-treated cells. The protein binding was abolished by unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the AP-2 consensus sequence. These results indicate that the region (-70 to -30) of the human ADM gene containing multiple AP-2 binding sites is responsible for TPA-induced adrenomedullin expression in THP-1 cells.","['Department of Molecular Biology and Applied Physiology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148498-78-6 (Adrenomedullin)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: This patient developed multiple tumors of the scalp over the period of a 1 year which were histologically proven to be microcystic adnexal carcinoma. All tumors were noncontiguous and presented on the scalp. During the histologic analysis of the last tumor removed by Mohs micrographic surgery a lymph node was resected which revealed infiltrative microcystic adnexal carcinoma.

In the current study, we have demonstrated that resveratrol inhibits the growth of THP-1 human monocytic leukaemia cells in a dose-dependent manner with a median effective dose of 12 microM. It did not induce differentiation of THP-1 cells and had no toxic effect on THP-1 cells that had been induced to differentiate into monocytes/macrophages by phorbol myristate acetate. A significant fraction of resveratrol-treated cells underwent apoptosis as judged by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, DNA fragmentation and caspase-specific cleavage of poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase. Resveratrol treatment had no effect on the expression of Fas receptor or Fas ligand (FasL) in THP-1 cells, nor did it induce clustering of Fas receptors. In addition, THP-1 cells were resistant to activating anti-Fas antibody, and neutralizing anti-Fas and/or anti-FasL antibodies had no protective effect against resveratrol-induced inhibition of THP-1 cell growth. The effect of resveratrol on THP-1 cells was reversible after its removal from the culture medium. These results suggest that (1) resveratrol inhibits the growth of THP-1 cells, at least in part, by inducing apoptosis, (2) resveratrol-induced apoptosis of THP-1 cells is independent of the Fas/FasL signalling pathway and (3) resveratrol does not induce differentation of THP-1 cells and has no toxic effect on differentiated THP-1 cells. Thus, resveratrol may be a potential chemotherapeutic agent for the control of acute monocytic leukaemia.","['Research and Medical Services, Stratton VA Medical Center, Albany, NY 12208, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytochemical staining was strongly positive with alpha-naphthylbutyrate acetate esterase, particulate positive with Sudan black and weakly positive for myeloperoxidase. Cells were positive for CD13, CD15, CD18, CD23, CD33, CD38, CD45, CD68 and myeloperoxidase. CD14 expression was 3-15%. SigM5 constitutively secreted interleukin (IL)-2, IL-8, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, ferritin, lysozyme, N-elastase and neopterin upon stimulation with interferon (IFN)-gamma. Cells expressed the proinflammatory mediator macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). All NADPH oxidase subunits were constitutively present, but nitroblue tetrazolium reduction was only detectable upon activation with IFN-gamma. SigM5 monoblasts were sensitive to arsenic trioxide (As2O3) previously not described to induce apoptosis in monoblastic cells. Differing considerably in morphology, immunophenotype and sensitivity to arsenics from the widely used cell lines U937, HL-60 and THP-1, SigM5 is a new monoblastic cell line useful for studying leukaemogenesis, monocyte differentiation and tumour cell susceptibility to arsenic compounds.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Haematology, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed at increasing the antileukaemic potential of high-dose AraC by raising intracellular levels of AraC triphosphate (AraCTP), which is the mediator of cytotoxicity, via biochemical modulation by inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) or haematopoietic growth factors (HGFs). Blasts from patients with de novo AML were analysed for their formation of AraCTP under high-dose AraC conditions (20 microM over 3 h) without prior modulation (n = 47) after a 2-h pre-exposure with fludarabine (50 microg/ml) (n = 40) or gemcitabine (30 ng/ml) (n = 40) and after a 48-h pre-exposure to granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor (G-CSF; 100 ng/ml) (n = 27) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating-factor (GM-CSF; 100 U/ml) (n = 28). Unmodulated formation of AraCTP (median 239.8 ng/107 cells) could not be increased via modulation by gemcitabine (232.4 ng/107 cells) or fludarabine (247.8 ng/107 cells). The lack of effect of RR inhibitors was also observed for all other known metabolites of AraC [Ara-cytosine monophosphate (CMP), Ara-cytosine diphosphate (CDP), AraCDP-choline, Ara-uridine monophosphate (UMP), Ara-uridine diphosphate (UDP) and Ara-uridine triphosphate (UTP)]. In contrast, pre-exposure to HGFs led to significant increases in AraCTP formation (G-CSF 556.0 ng/107 cells, 2.31-fold increase, P < 0.001; GM-CSF 447.9 ng/107 cells, 1.87-fold increase, P < 0.0001). To establish the mechanism responsible for these effects, the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of AraC metabolism, deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), was investigated (n = 33). In vivo exposure to GM-CSF led to increases in dCK activity from unmodulated values at 0 h (29.8 pmol/min/mg protein) to 34.3 pmol/min/mg protein at 24 h (1.15-fold increase) and 54.5 pmol/min/mg protein at 48 h (1. 83-fold increase).

However, its target(s) remain(s) unknown. One possibility is that there is a differing sensitivity of the leukaemic from the normal colony-forming cell (CFC) compartments to IFN-alpha. Co-cultures of progenitors with stromal cells provide a valuable tool to dissect direct and indirect activities of IFN-alpha. In this study, we have used endothelial cells (EC) as a source of stromal cells. In co-cultures of normal progenitors with EC, IFN-alpha increased the generation of clonogenic cells, mainly via an increased production of flt3 ligand (FL) by EC. In contrast, in co-cultures of CML progenitors with EC, IFN-alpha inhibited the generation of clonogenic cells, mainly by direct inhibition on the progenitors, the up-regulation of FL production by stromal cells being unable to compensate for the direct inhibitory effects of IFN-alpha. These data provide evidence for a differential effect of IFN-alpha on the growth of CML and normal CFC cells in a stromal context and suggest that an alteration in the response of CML progenitor cells to FL is important in the explanation of this differential effect.","['FR 60, Biologie des Greffes, Universite de Bordeaux 2, France. anne.solanilla@umr5540.u-bordeaux2.fr']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a double-labelling technique in the present study, we demonstrated that a significantly high number of S-phase cells were simultaneously apoptotic (signal antonymy; SA) in MDS (mean +/- s.e.m. 53.5 +/- 6.7%, n = 24, P < 0.001). In contrast, SA was negligible in all other specimens studied, including normal control BM (n = 13) from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients, BM from patients with de novo acute myelogenous leukaemia (1'AML; n = 5), or secondary AML that had transformed from MDS (2'AML; n = 10), or the solid tumours from patients with NHL (n = 9) or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC; n = 10). Subsequently, the expression of a transcription factor, E2F1, was studied in density-separated BM aspirate mononuclear cells from MDS patients (n = 9) and a normal control. Two separate sets of primers were used that recognized the regulatory retinoblastoma (Rb) protein-binding region and the functional DNA-binding region of E2F1. Interestingly, although the latter manifested the expected band (280 bp) in all samples, the Rb-specific primers showed the expected band (380 bp) in the normal and in 4/9 MDS specimens. Two other MDS specimens also showed a smaller band ( approximately 325 bp), whereas 3/9 MDS patients showed exclusively the smaller band. The levels of SA were significantly higher in those MDS cases that showed the smaller Rb-specific band either alone or in addition to the expected band (median 19.5%, n = 4, P = 0.037) than in those showing exclusively the expected band (median 0.4%, n = 3).

By confocal microscopy, fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 immunostainings were co-localized with fibronectin in the adherent layer of long-term BM cultures. In cell adhesion assays using recombinant proteins, mouse fibulin-2 adhered to human erythroid-megakaryocytic leukaemia cell line HEL. This adhesion was mediated by beta3 integrins. However, HEL cells did not adhere to human fibulin-2. We therefore studied a possible species-specific cell-adhesive activity of mouse fibulin-2 by using mouse megakaryocytes, obtained by culture of BM cells in the presence of thrombopoietin. These megakaryocytes did not adhere to mouse fibulin-2. Our findings suggested that the functional role of fibulin-1 and fibulin-2 in BM stroma is related to binding to the major cell adhesion protein fibronectin, whereas adhesion of mouse fibulin-2 to human cells containing the integrin beta3 chain is not related to an apparent physiological function of the protein.","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']","['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (fibulin)', '0 (fibulin 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have searched for factors with the potential to regulate the differentiation of monocytes to DCs and macrophages. When CD14+ monocytes are cultured with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL) 4, the CD14+CD1a- population, which consists of macrophages, was found in the serum-containing cultures but not in the serum-free cultures. Addition of IL-6 receptor-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) or gp130-neutralizing mAb to the serum-containing cultures resulted in a decreased population of CD14+CD1a- cells. An increase in the CD14+CD1a- population with reduction in CD14-CD1a+ DCs was observed with the addition of IL-6 to cultures, whereas IL-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M or macrophage colony-stimulating factor did not affect the differentiation of monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF plus IL-4. This effect of IL-6 was blocked by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IL-1beta, CD40 ligand (CD40L) and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1). Among these factors, TNF-alpha was most potent in interfering with the action of IL-6. These results suggest that IL-6 inhibits the differentiation of monocytes to DCs by promoting their differentiation toward macrophages, which is modulated by factors such as TNF-alpha, LPS, IL-1beta, CD40L and TGF-beta1.","['The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']","['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This quantity is defined as the probability that a patient is alive and in remission at a given time after transplant. We discuss two statistical methods for estimating CLFS.

To determine whether relapse after unmanipulated PCT could be ascribed to donor T and/or NK cell loss or tolerization, we evaluated the chimeric status of 81 patients with haematological malignancies who were receiving allogeneic unmanipulated PCT. The incidence of mixed chimaerism (MC) in unfractionated mononuclear leucocyte samples decreased rapidly after transplant, and was not detectable 4 months after PCT, even in patients who subsequently relapsed. The chimeric status of immune effector cell subsets was then evaluated in 15 patients at the time of relapse. All adults demonstrated complete donor haematopoiesis (CDH) for all cell lineages, whereas T- and NK-cell MC was only found in patients younger than age 13 years (P = 0.004). MC was not found in T nor NK cells of a control group consisting of age-matched paediatric patients in remission after allogeneic PCT. Thus, in adults, T and NK cell MC disappears early after unmanipulated allogeneic PCT and is absent at the time of relapse. However, the identification of donor T and NK cell loss in the paediatric relapsed but not remission patients suggests a distinct mechanism of relapse.","['Division of Hematology-Immunology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, Department of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Corticosensitivity is used in numerous therapeutic trials as a prognostic factor for treatment choice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of cell cycle regulatory protein expression before and during the first 48 h of corticotherapy for predicting corticosensitivity. Fifty-two children presenting with ALL were studied at diagnosis and during the first 48 h of treatment for cell proliferation and apoptosis level by measurement of DNA content, and for expression of several cell proliferation regulatory proteins by means of Western blot. Glucocorticoids induced a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in S-phase and in CDK1, CDK4 and CDK6 expression and an increase in the percentage of cells in subG1 peak. Two criteria for corticosensitivity were used: (i) the number of blast cells after 7 d of treatment with a threshold at 1 x 109/l (usual criterion), (ii) the J8/J1 blast cell ratio, which is independent from initial leucocytosis. Bcl-2 expression at diagnosis was the best predictive variable for the usual corticosensitivity criterion in B- and T-cell ALL. For the second criterion, in B-cell ALL, p21waf1 expression at diagnosis was the sole (albeit poorly) predictive variable, whereas bcl-2 remained of high interest in T-cell ALL. Interestingly, these proteins, bcl-2 and p21waf1, are associated with prolonged cell lifespan and their increased expression is often linked to poor response to cytotoxic drugs. Such preliminary results call for subsequent studies on large independent sets of T-cell and B-cell lineage ALL in order to confirm the J8/J1 blast cell ratio value as well as the role of bcl-2 and p21waf1 expression in predicting corticosensitivity.","['Laboratoire de Cytologie Analytique, Universite Claude Bernard, MESRT JE 1879, Lyon, France.']","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most frequently, abnormal blood cells displayed a CD19+CD5-CD23+/- immunophenotype different from that of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, except in two cases with a CD19+CD5+CD23+ phenotype. Interestingly, a coexistent serum monoclonal IgM and/or surface IgMG+ with identical light chain was identified in 10 patients, whereas in the remaining six patients only IgG expression was determined. VH gene analysis was performed in eight patients to investigate the clonal origins of tumour cells. All cases utilized the VH3 family, with evidence of extensive somatic mutations and intraclonal homogeneity in all cases. VH gene analysis indicated a clonal relationship between cells expressing IgM and IgG, with one case being biclonal. Cytogenetic evaluation showed a high incidence of trisomy 12 (60%) and 13q14 deletion (40%). In conclusion, we have described an unusual subset of low-grade lymphoma with high-serum IgG and frequent lymphoplasmacytoid features in which tumour cells derive from post-follicular memory B cells undergoing isotype switching with some cases arrested at both the IgM and IgG stage and others as IgG-positive cells only.","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Institut de Biologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Nantes, France. richard.garand@chu-nantes.fr""]",['0 (Immunoglobulin G)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently encountered two such cases and present our findings. One patient with B-cell lymphoma and another with myeloid leukemia developed cutaneous eruptions after chemotherapy displaying highly atypical perivascular lymphoid cells on histology that mimicked recurrent disease. In both cases, the lymphocytes were CD30+ T cells by immunohistochemistry. The skin lesions spontaneously resolved and have not recurred. Because one case was initially misinterpreted as recurrent leukemia, we conclude that close clinical correlation and immunophenotypic confirmation should be done for atypical cutaneous lymphoid infiltrates in patients with primary hematologic malignancies. We discuss the differential diagnosis of atypical CD30+ infiltrates in this setting, which include recurrent lymphoma or myeloid leukemia, primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), carbamazepine-induced CD30+ pseudolymphoma, viral infection and an atypical eruption of lymphocyte recovery.","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Hospitals, Ann Arbor 48109-0602, USA.']","['0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '33CM23913M (Carbamazepine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the first week after BDL, the two groups were compared with respect to routine liver injury tests, liver histology, BEC and hepatocyte DNA synthesis, together with the expression of mRNA and protein of IL-6 as well as related growth factors, and their receptors. RESULTS: During the first week after BDL, there was marked upregulation of IL-6 mRNA and protein in the IL-6+/+ mice only in the vicinity of the biliary tree; whereas, biliary/peri-biliary IL-6R, HGF and met mRNA and protein increased in both groups. IL-6, HGF mRNA and protein localized to periductal inflammatory cells and stellate cells, while met and IL-6R protein were upregulated in the BEC and, to a lesser extent, in hepatocytes. This occurred during maximal proliferation of the BEC. Despite the absence of IL-6 in the IL-6-/- mice, there were only mildly phenotypic differences between the two groups, and no differences in mortality. Compared to IL-6+/+ controls, IL-6-/- mice showed slightly less BEC proliferation, a trend toward more liver injury, and significantly higher total serum bilirubin (TB) levels, suggestive of impaired biliary tree integrity. These changes were associated with slightly less HGF mRNA and protein expression in the IL-6-/- mice, but the differences were not significant. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), another gp-130 ligand, also showed marked peri-biliary upregulation after BDL in both groups, and also induced BEC DNA synthesis, in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The mild phenotypical differences between IL-6+/+ and IL-6-/- mice in the acute response to BDL is most likely attributable to the redundancy of the gp-130 signaling system. However, the long-term response to BDL results in a distinct phenotype in the IL-6-/- mice, marked by a relentless rise in serum total bilirubin and an inability to maintain compensatory increase in liver mass.","['Thomas E Starzl Transplantation Institute, Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA 15213, USA.']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42013-48-9 (2-phenyl-5,5-dimethyltetrahydro-1,4-oxazine)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some cases have an absolute monocytosis but can be distinguished from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) by the presence of a higher percentage (> 15%) of circulating immature granulocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a series of 11 patients with a diagnosis of aCML according to the FAB proposals we have analyzed the most relevant clinical, hematological and cytogenetic characteristics. RESULTS: The median age was 65 years (16-84). All but one case showed, at time of diagnosis, leukocytosis (median WBC was 36 x 10(9)/l), 55% had moderate anemia and 36% had thrombocytopenia. Most cases had marked dysplasia, particularly in the granulocytic lineage (82% of the cases), and all cases showed bone marrow red hypoplasia. Cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 9 out of the 11 patients. Trisomy 8 was observed in three cases and other clonal chromosomal abnormalities included deletions of 5q, 13q, 17p, 12q, and 11q as well as a t(6;8)(p23;q22) translocation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies failed to demonstrate ETV-6 gene involvement. The median survival time from diagnosis was only 14 months (range 3-56 months). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that aCML is a rare disease which is characterized by leukocytosis, with dysgranulopoiesis, BM erythroid hypoplasia, chromosomal, though not recurrent, abnormalities and poor prognosis.","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario and Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Spain. jmhernandezr@aehh.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a case of ATL treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). The allo-BMT successfully induced complete remission in the patient. Currently, at 24 months post BMT, there has been no evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the T-cell receptor gamma chain gene. By contrast, PCR analysis demonstrated the reappearance of the cells harboring the integrations of the HTLV-1 proviral DNA 9 months after the BMT. These findings may imply a reversion to the carrier state rather than the recurrence of the leukemia from the MRD.

Median age at the time of the study was 36 years, and median interval after transplantation was 35.3 months. Of 383 patients surveyed, 282 (73.6%) responded to the questionnaire. One hundred and ninety-two patients were treated with an allogeneic-related transplantation, 52 with allogeneic-unrelated, and 38 with an autologous transplantation. Our data revealed that the length of time since transplantation and the diagnosis of chronic GVHD were associated with QOL. When unrelated and related transplantation recipients were compared, ratings on relief from pain, stability in weight, and confidence in dealing with daily life were lower among unrelated transplantation patients.","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Hamamatsu Medical Center, Shizuoka, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the timing to initiate antifungal chemotherapy, we performed the CAND-TEC assay serially in each patient. When the patients revealed febrile neutropenia after antileukemic chemotherapy and the Candida antigen titer was increased compared to that measured before the antileukemic chemotherapy (even if the increased titer was at a lower level, e.g., from negative to 1:1 positive or from 1:1 to 1:2), azole antifungal agents (fluconazole or miconazole) were administered intravenously. In 9 (81.8%) of the 11 evaluable cases, the antifungal chemotherapy was effective and the titers decreased to less than or equal to the previous titers in all cases. In 2 cases, the antifungal chemotherapy was not effective, and the titers did not decrease. These results suggest that serial Candida antigen detection provides a useful method in the early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis in febrile neutropenia and in determining the timing of the initiation of early antifungal chemotherapy. This method might also be useful in preventing the excess use of antifungal agents; thus preventing the proliferation of azole-resistant Candida infection.","['Division of Transfusion Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Matsuoka, Japan.']","['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antigens, Fungal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the possibility that the cell cycle data after starting induction chemotherapy are more important than the pretreatment data, we used 3-color flow cytometry to examine the cell cycle (G0, G1, S, and G2/M phases) of AML cells on days 0, 5, and 9 of the first induction chemotherapy in 20 patients. Cell cycle data at these 3 time points were compared in the patients who achieved CR (CR cases) and in the patients who had persistent leukemia (non-CR cases) after the induction chemotherapy. In the CR cases, there was a tendency for the percentages of G0-phase AML cells on days 5 and 9 to be smaller than that on day 0, while the opposite tendency was observed in the non-CR cases. When cell cycle data were compared between the CR and non-CR cases, the percentage of G0-phase AML cells on day 9 differed significantly (CR cases 6.9% +/- 10.9%, non-CR cases 50.1% +/- 38.4%; P = .0024). This significance remained when the patients' AML subtype was taken into consideration. None of the other cell cycle data at each time point or the hematologic parameters, which may be related to CR achievement, showed differences between the CR and non-CR cases. We emphasize the importance of cell cycle analysis after initiating therapy and suggest that such analysis can identify refractory AML subjects.

It was suggested that intensive chemotherapy was effective for selected elderly AML patients who were relatively younger and had good performance status, although the number of such patients was limited in our study.","['Department of Medicine, Fujita Health University School of Medicine.']","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a significantly higher incidence of preceding myelodysplastic syndromes in the elderly patients. They also had a significantly higher incidence of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities (loss or partial deletion of chromosome 5 or 7) and a significantly lower incidence of favorable cytogenetic abnormalities, such as t(15:17), t(8:21), or inv(16). With regard to FAB subtypes in de novo AML, the incidence of M3 subtype was significantly lower in the elderly group. Myeloperoxidase positivity of AML cells in the elderly group was lower than that in the younger group. Laboratory data at presentation disclosed a lower peripheral leukemic cell count, a higher fibrinogen level, a lower serum protein level, and a higher serum creatinine level in the elderly group. They also had poorer performance status and more frequent concomitant diseases at presentation, including liver diseases, heart diseases, or documented infections.

Specific molecular markers were identified in 15/75 patients: Four with ALL (three with clonotypic IgG rearrangements and one with BCR/ABL) and 11 with AML (nine with the PML/RAR alpha fusion protein--M3 AML-, and two with the AML1/ETO fusion protein--M2 AML-). During follow-up periods ranging from 1 to 60 months, seven patients cleared the residual disease assessed by PCR (RD-PCR), whereas eight patients had either persistence of RD-PCR or a molecular relapse. For patients without or with RD-PCR, the 30-month survival (SV) was 86% and 14%, respectively, whereas median SV was > 60 and two months, also respectively (p < 0.01). Six of eight patients with detectable RD-PCR died, all of them within three months after the detection of the RD-PCR, whereas two of the patients that relapsed were rescued with treatment and entered a second molecular remission. Two of the three molecular relapses were detected without an overt morphological relapse.

We have previously shown that this sequence exerts a profound inhibitory effect on the fusion activity of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-MuLV chimeric Env proteins which contain the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the SIV Env protein. Recent studies have shown that SIV can utilize several alternative cellular coreceptors for its fusion and entry into the cell. We have investigated the fusion activity of SIV and SIV-MuLV chimeric Env proteins using cells that express different coreceptors. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmid constructs that carry the SIV or SIV-MuLV chimeric Env protein genes and were overlaid with either CEMx174 cells or Ghost Gpr15 cells, which express the Gpr15 coreceptor for SIV, or Ghost CCR5 cells, which express CCR5, an alternate coreceptor for SIV. The R-peptide sequence in the SIV-MuLV chimeric proteins was found to inhibit the fusion with CEMx174 cells or Ghost Gpr15 cells. However, a significant level of fusion was still observed when HeLa cells expressing the chimeric Env proteins were cocultivated with Ghost CCR5 cells. These results show that the R-peptide sequence exerts differential effects on the fusion activity of SIV Env proteins using target cells that express alternative coreceptors.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']","['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (GPR15 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CCR5)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,"['AI 47018/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC112125,,,,,,,,,,,

Suzuki, Jpn. J. Exp. Med. 45:473-478, 1975). However, the resistance caused by Fv-4 is recessive in nude mice, which suggests that immunological effects play important roles in this resistance in vivo (K. Higo, Y. Kubo, Y. Iwatani, T. Ono, M. Maeda, H. Hiai, T. Masuda, K. Kuribayashi, F. Zhang, T. Lamin, A. Adachi, and A. Ishimoto, J. Virol. 71:750-754, 1997). To determine the immunological effect on the resistance in vivo, we infected immunologically immature newborn mice homozygous (Fv-4(r/r)) and heterozygous (Fv-4(r/-)) for Fv-4. Although the Fv-4(r/r) mice showed complete resistance to F-MuLV whether infected neonatally or as adolescents, the Fv-4(r/-) mice showed high sensitivity to viral proliferation and disease induction when infected as newborns but complete resistance when infected as adolescent mice. To confirm the immunological effect on the resistance in adolescent mice with the Fv-4(r/r) and Fv-4(r/-) genotypes, we examined the effect of an immunosuppressant drug, FK506, on the resistance. The mice with the Fv-4(r/r) genotype treated with FK506 still showed resistance, but the mice with the Fv-4(r/-) genotype became highly sensitive to F-MuLV infection. Flow cytometric analysis to detect the Fv-4 gene product showed that the Fv-4 gene product was expressed on the cells from newborn and adolescent mice. The Fv-4 gene product was also detected on the cells from the FK506-treated mice as well as on those from untreated mice. However, a quantitative difference in the gene product between the cells with the Fv-4(r/r) and Fv-4(r/-) genotypes was detected by indirect staining for flow cytometry. These results show that the resistance to F-MuLV infection conferred by the Fv-4 gene is originally recessive, but it looks dominant in adolescent mice mainly because of the effect of the immune system.","['Department of Viral Oncology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']","['0 (Fv4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",,,,,PMC112120,,,,,,,,,,,

Viral detection in the central nervous system (CNS) of TSP/HAM patients demonstrates the ability of HTLV-1 to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To investigate viral entry into the CNS, rat brain capillary endothelial cells were exposed to human lymphocytes chronically infected by HTLV-1 (MT2), to lymphocytes isolated from a seropositive patient, or to a control lymphoblastoid cell line (CEM). An enhanced adhesion to and migration through brain endothelial cells in vitro was observed with HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes. HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes also induced a twofold increase in the paracellular permeability of the endothelial monolayer. These effects were associated with an increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha by HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes in the presence of brain endothelial cells. Ultrastructural analysis showed that contact between endothelial cells and HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes resulted in a massive and rapid budding of virions from lymphocytes, followed by their internalization into vesicles by brain endothelial cells and apparent release onto the basolateral side, suggesting that viral particles may cross the BBB using the transcytotic pathway. Our study also demonstrates that cell-cell fusion occurs between HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes and brain endothelial cells, with the latter being susceptible to transient HTLV-1 infection. These aspects may help us to understand the pathogenic mechanisms associated with neurological diseases induced by HTLV-1 infection.","['CNRS UPR 0415, Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, 75014 Paris, France. i.romero@open.ac.uk']","['0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,PMC112099,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it was reported that vif expression in nonpermissive cells dramatically increases infectivity not only of HIV-1 but also of other enveloped viruses, including murine leukemia viruses (MLVs). This was surprising in part because MLVs and other murine retroviruses lack vif genes yet replicate efficiently in T lymphocytes. To investigate these issues, we first developed improved methods for producing substantial quantities of HIV-1 virions with vif deletions from healthy H9 cells. These virions had approximately the same amounts of major core proteins and envelope glycoproteins as the control wild-type virions but were only approximately 1% as infectious. We then produced H9 cells that contained wild-type or vif deletion HIV-gpt proviruses, which lack a functional env gene. After superinfection with either xenotropic or amphotropic MLVs, these cells released HIV-gpt virions pseudotyped with an MLV envelope plus replication-competent MLV. Interestingly, the pseudotyped HIV-gpt (vif deletion) virions were noninfectious, whereas the MLV virions simultaneously released from the same H9 cells were fully infectious. These results strongly suggest that the Vif protein functions in a manner that is both cell specific and at least substantially specific for HIV-1 and related lentiviruses. In addition, these results confirm that vif deletion HIV-1 virions from nonpermissive cells are blocked at a postpenetration stage of the infection pathway.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098, USA.']","['0 (Gene Products, vif)', '0 (vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",,,,"['R01 CA067358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 CA067358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA67358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC112094,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent studies with a closely related subgroup A molecular clone, FRA, we demonstrated high pathogenicity and a strong propensity to undergo recombination with endogenous FeLV (enFeLV), leading to a high frequency of transition from subgroup A to A/B. The present study was undertaken to identify mechanisms of FeLV pathogenesis that might become evident by comparing the two closely related molecular clones. F6A was shown to have an infectivity similar to that of FRA when delivered as a provirus. Virus load and antibody responses were also similar, although F6A-infected cats consistently carried higher virus loads than FRA-infected cats. However, F6A-infected cats were slower to undergo de novo recombination with enFeLV and showed slower progression to disease than FRA-infected cats. Tumors collected from nine pF6A- or pFRA-inoculated cats expressed lymphocyte markers for T cells (seven tumors) and B cells (one tumor), and non-T/B cells (one tumor). One cat with an A-to-A/C conversion developed erythrocyte hypoplasia. Genomic mapping of recombinants from pF6A- and pFRA-inoculated cats revealed similar crossover sites, suggesting that the genomic makeup of the recombinants did not contribute to increased progression to neoplastic disease. From these studies, the mechanism most likely to account for the pathologic differences between F6A and FRA is the lower propensity for F6A to undergo de novo recombination with enFeLV in vivo. A lower recombination rate is predicted to slow the transition from subgroup A to A/B and slow the progression to disease.","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA.']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA051485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC112073,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that T-cell-tropic, cytopathic, and syncytium-inducing viruses evolve in cats infected with a relatively avirulent, transmissible form of FeLV, 61E. The envelope gene of an 81T variant, which encoded scattered single-amino-acid changes throughout the envelope as well as a 4-amino-acid insertion in the C-terminal half of the surface unit (SU) of envelope, was sufficient to confer the T-cell-tropic, cytopathic phenotype (J. L. Rohn, M. S. Moser, S. R. Gwynn, D. N. Baldwin, and J. Overbaugh, J. Virol. 72:2686-2696, 1998). In the present study, we examined the role of the 4-amino-acid insertion in determining viral replication and tropism of FeLV-81T. The 4-amino-acid insertion was found to be functionally equivalent to a 6-amino-acid insertion at an identical location in the 61C variant. However, viruses expressing a chimeric 61E/81T SU, containing the insertion together with the N terminus of 61E SU, were found to be replication defective and were impaired in the processing of the envelope precursor into the functional SU and transmembrane (TM) proteins. In approximately 10% of cultured feline T cells (3201) transfected with the 61E/81T envelope chimeras and maintained over time, replication-competent tissue culture-adapted variants were isolated. Compensatory mutations in the SU of the tissue culture-adapted viruses were identified at positions 7 and 375, and each was shown to restore envelope protein processing when combined with the C-terminal 81T insertion. Unexpectedly, these viruses displayed different phenotypes in feline T cells: the virus with a change from glutamine to proline at position 7 acquired a T-cell-tropic, cytopathic phenotype, whereas the virus with a change from valine to leucine at position 375 had slower replication kinetics and caused no cytopathic effects. Given the differences in the replication properties of these viruses, it is noteworthy that the insertion as well as the two single-amino-acid changes all occur outside of predicted FeLV receptor-binding domains.","['Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Washington, Seattle 98109-1024, USA.']","['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (feline leukemia virus protein p15E)', '0 (feline leukemia virus receptor)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, Feline leukemia virus)']",,,,"['R01 CA051080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 RR007019/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5 T32 RR07019/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC112068,,,,,,,,,,,

To compare strategies for T-cell-depleted alternative donor transplants and to compare T-cell depleted with non-T-cell-depleted transplants, we studied 870 patients with leukemia who received T-cell-depleted transplants from unrelated or HLA-mismatched related donors from 1982 to 1994.

We compared LFS using different strategies for T-cell-depleted transplantation considering T-cell depletion technique, intensity of pretransplant conditioning, and posttransplant immune suppression using proportional hazards regression to adjust for other prognostic variables. Five categories of T-cell depletion techniques were considered: narrow-specificity antibodies, broad-specificity antibodies, Campath antibodies, elutriation, and lectins. Strategies resulting in similar LFS were pooled to compare T-cell-depleted with non-T-cell-depleted transplants. Recipients of transplants T-cell depleted by narrow-specificity antibodies had lower treatment failure risk (higher LFS) than recipients of transplants T-cell depleted by other techniques. Compared with non-T-cell-depleted transplants (5-year probability +/- 95% confidence interval [CI] of LFS, 31% +/- 4%), 5-year LFS was 29% +/- 5% (P = NS) after transplants T-cell depleted by narrow-specificity antibodies and 16% +/- 4% (P <.0001) after transplants T-cell depleted by other techniques. After alternative donor transplantation, T-cell depletion of donor marrow by narrow-specificity antibodies resulted in LFS rates that were higher than those for transplants T-cell depleted using other techniques but similar to those for non-T-cell-depleted transplants.

Furthermore, the effect of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) for the treatment of relapse in 18 of the 19 patients was analyzed. All BMT recipients had irregular spectratypes in the first 3- to -6 months after transplant. These evolved to more normal patterns by 12 months after transplant and continued to improve thereafter. In approximately a third of the patients, it took 2 to 3 years for all spectratypes to normalize, whereas in the other two thirds, some abnormal spectratypes persisted even after several years. In 9 patients, there was no immediate change in the CDR3 size profiles after DLI. In 3 patients, spectratypes improved slightly after DLI, whereas in 6 patients, spectratypes became more restricted and irregular. Overall, T-cell spectratypes in BMT patients were characterized by instability over time and in patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), this was even more exaggerated.

Upon receptor activation, the ligand-restricted SMADs(1-35) are phosphorylated in the C-terminal MH2 domain and recruit the common subunit SMAD4/DPC-4 gene to the nucleus to mediate target gene expression. Frequent inactivating mutations of SMAD4, or less common somatic mutations of SMAD2 seen in solid tumors, suggest that these genes have a suppressor function. However, there have been no identified mutations of SMAD5, although the gene localizes to the critical region of loss in chromosome 5q31.1 (chromosome 5, long arm, region 3, band 1, subband 1) in myelodysplasia (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). A ubiquitously expressed novel isoform, SMAD5beta, encodes a 351 amino acid protein with a truncated MH2 domain and a unique C-terminal tail of 18 amino acids, which may be the functional equivalent of inactivating mutations. The levels of SMAD5beta transcripts are higher in the undifferentiated CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells than in the terminally differentiated peripheral blood leukocytes, thereby implicating the beta form in stem cell homeostasis. Yeast 2-hybrid interaction assays reveal the lack of physical interactions between SMAD5beta and SMAD5 or SMAD4. The expression of SMAD5beta may represent a novel mechanism to protect pluripotent stem cells and malignant cells from the growth inhibitory and differentiation signals of BMPs.

Thus, the functional impairment of p53 is essential to maintain the viral-induced proliferation of CD4+ mature T cells. However, in the CD4+ leukemic cells of patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), the viral transactivator does not appear to be expressed, and p53 mutations have been found only in a fraction of patients. We sought to investigate whether p53 function is impaired, in ex vivo samples from patients with ATLL, in the absence of genetic mutations. Here we demonstrate that the p53 protein is stabilized also in ex vivo ATLL samples (10 of 10 studied) and that at least in 2 patients p53 stabilization was not associated with genetic mutation. Furthermore, the assessment of p53 function after ionizing radiation of ATLL cells indicated an abnormal induction of the p53-responsive genes GADD45 and p21(WAF1) in 7 of 7 patients. In 2 of 2 patients, p53 regulation of cell-cycle progression appeared to be impaired as well. Because p53 is part of a regulatory loop that also involves MDM2 and p14(ARF), the status of the latter proteins was also assessed in cultured or fresh ATLL cells. The p97 MDM2 protein was not detected by Western blot analysis in established HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines or ex vivo ATLL cell lysates. However, the MDM2 protein could be easily detected after treatment of cells with the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, suggesting a normal regulation of the p53-MDM2 regulating loop. Similarly, p14(ARF) did not appear to be aberrantly expressed in ex vivo ATLL cells nor in any of the established HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines studied. Thus, p53 stabilization in HTLV-I infection occurs in the absence of genetic mutation and alteration of the physiologic degradation pathway of p53.

We tested the hypothesis that down-regulation of Bcl-2 alone by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (Bcl-2-AS) induces apoptosis, even in the presence of other antiapoptotic genes. We tested Bcl-2-AS in myeloid leukemic HL-60 cells, in Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) overexpressing HL-60-DOX cells, and in primary AML samples. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 by Bcl-2-AS reduced the viability of HL-60 cells and, less effectively, HL-60-DOX cells and increased ara-C cytotoxicity in both cell lines. Incubation of primary AML blasts with Bcl-2-AS decreased Bcl-2 expression in CD34(+) blast cells after induction of apoptosis and enhancement of ara-C cytotoxicity in 11 of 19 primary AML samples. In 8 samples in which Bcl-2-AS did not induce apoptosis, baseline Bcl-2 levels were found to be strikingly high. The expression of other antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-X(L), Bag-1, A1, and Mcl-1) did not prevent Bcl-2-AS-induced apoptosis. Bcl-2-AS also inhibited colony formation of AML progenitor cells. Low concentrations of Bcl-2-AS induced significant increases in S-phase cells (P =.04). Results establish Bcl-2 as a critical target for AS strategies in AML in which the baseline levels predict response to Bcl-2-AS. Bcl-2 exerts both antiapoptotic and antiproliferative functions in AML. Because early normal hematopoietic stem cells do not express Bcl-2, Bcl-2-AS therapy should be highly selective for AML cells.

This study examined the status of the oncogenic transcription factor AP-1 in leukemic cells freshly isolated from patients with ATL. Leukemic cells from peripheral blood of all patients with ATL exhibited constitutive AP-1 DNA binding activity, whereas mononuclear cells from normal individuals did not. In agreement with previous studies, HTLV-I transforming protein, Tax, was found to stimulate the DNA binding activity of AP-1 in a T-cell line. However, HTLV-I genes, including Tax, were not significantly expressed in leukemic cells freshly obtained from patients with ATL. Moreover, all T-cell lines derived from leukemic cells of patients with ATL also displayed constitutive AP-1 DNA binding activity, but expressed little Tax protein. Thus, leukemic cells of patients with ATL appear to have Tax-independent mechanisms that induce AP-1 activity, both in vivo and in vitro. In antibody supershift experiments, AP-1 in fresh leukemic cells and ATL-derived cell lines were found to contain JunD. Consistently, all primary ATL cells and ATL-derived cell lines expressed high levels of JunD messenger RNA. Our results suggest that AP-1 is activated in leukemic cells of patients with ATL through a Tax-independent mechanism and this may play a role in the deregulated phenotypes of ATL leukemic cells.

This fusion gene encodes a TEL-JAK2 chimeric protein in which the 336 amino-terminal residues of TEL, including its specific self-association domain, are fused to the kinase domain of JAK2. TEL-JAK2 exhibits constitutive activation of its tyrosine kinase activity which, in turn, confers growth factor-independent proliferation to the interleukin-3-dependent Ba/F3 hematopoietic cell line. To elucidate the properties of TEL-JAK2 in primary cells and to create an animal model for TEL-JAK2-induced leukemia, we generated transgenic mice in which the TEL-JAK2 complementary DNA was placed under the transcriptional control of the EmuSRalpha enhancer/promoter. TEL-JAK2 founder mice and their transgenic progeny developed fatal leukemia at 4 to 22 weeks of age. Selective amplification of CD8-positive T cells was observed in blood, lymph nodes, thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. Expression of a tyrosine-phosphorylated TEL-JAK2 protein and activation of STAT1 and STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) were detected in leukemic tissues. TEL-JAK2 diseased mice also displayed invasion of nonhematopoietic organs, including liver, brain, lung, and kidney, by leukemic T cells. Leukemic organs of founder and transgenic progeny contained a monoclonal/oligoclonal T-cell population as analyzed by the rearrangement of the TCRbeta locus. Transplantation of TEL-JAK2 leukemic cells in nude mice confirmed their invasive nature. We conclude that the TEL-JAK2 fusion is an oncogene in vivo and that its expression in lymphoid cells results in the preferential expansion of CD8-positive T cells.

Resting or CD40-activated CLL cells were found to be equally sensitive to class I-restricted CTL-mediated killing. Despite expressing CD95, the CD40-activated CLL target cells were found to be resistant to apoptosis induced by CH11, an IgM CD95 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Consistent with this, inhibitors of caspases, which are involved in the Fas-induced apoptotic pathway (eg, N-carbobenzoxy-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone [z-VAD-fmk]), were unable to block destruction of CLL target cells by CTL. In addition, preincubation of the effector T cells with the anti-Fas ligand mAb NOK-2 failed to inhibit their subsequent ability to kill CLL target cells. On the other hand, CTL activity was blocked by inhibitors of the granule exocytosis pathway such as ethylene-glyco-tetra-acetic acid or concanamycin A.

The constitutive IL-6 expression was associated with elevated levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) and SOCS-3 mRNA expression, which were not down-regulated by anti-IL-6. These data indicate that the constitutive Stat3 activation in the investigated AML blasts is caused by high IL-6 secretion levels, thus stimulating the Jak/Stat pathway in an autocrine manner, a paracrine manner, or both.

Initial reporter gene transfection assays indicated that the first 89 base pairs of the LF promoter are capable of directing myeloid-specific LF gene expression. The presence of a C/EBP site flanked by 2 Sp1 sites within this segment of the LF promoter prompted us to investigate the possible role of these sites in LF expression. Cotransfection studies of LF-89luc plasmid with increasing concentrations of a C/EBPalpha expression vector in myeloid cells resulted in a linear transactivation of luciferase reporter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays found that the C/EBP site is recognized by C/EBPalpha and that both LF Sp1 binding sites bind the Sp1 transcription factor specifically in myeloid cells. Mutation of either Sp1 site markedly reduced activity of the LF-89luc plasmid in myeloid cells, and neither Sp1 mutant plasmid was transactivated by a C/EBPalpha expression plasmid to the same extent as wild-type LF-89luc. We also transfected LF-89luc into Drosophila Schneider cells, which do not express endogenous Sp1, and demonstrated up-regulation of luciferase activity in response to a cotransfected Sp1 expression plasmid, as well as to a C/EBPalpha expression plasmid. Furthermore, cotransfection of LF-89luc plasmid simultaneously with C/EBPalpha and Sp1 expression plasmids resulted in an increase in luciferase activity greater than that induced by either factor alone. Taken together, these observations indicate a functional interaction between C/EBP and Sp1 in mediating LF expression.

No transplants were T-cell depleted. Median follow-up was 12 months, and analyses focused on 1-year outcomes. Recipients of blood stem cell transplants had more rapid recovery of neutrophils to at least 0.5 x 10(9)/L (median time to recovery, 14 days, compared with 19 days for marrow transplants; P <.001) and of platelets to at least 20 x 10(9)/L (median time, 18 days, compared with 25 days for marrow transplants; P <.001). There was no significant difference in the incidence of grades II to IV acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). The incidence of chronic GVHD was significantly higher after blood stem cell transplantation (1-year probability [95% confidence interval], 65% [56%-72%] compared with 53% [47%-59%]; P =.02) Relapse incidence in the 2 transplant groups did not differ significantly.

The median time from transplantation to hospital discharge was 23 days after blood stem cell transplantation and 28 days after bone marrow transplantation (P =.003).

SPS developed in 31 patients a median of 10 months after transplantation (range, 3 to 187 months). The infection was fatal in 7 patients. The probability of SPS developing at 5 and 10 years was 4% and 6%, respectively. Age, sex, diagnosis, and graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis did not influence the development of SPS. Allogeneic transplantation (10-year probability, 7% vs 3% for nonallogeneic transplants; P =.03) and chronic GVHD (10-year probability, 14% vs 4%; P =.002) were associated with significantly higher risk for SPS. All the episodes of SPS were seen in patients who had undergone allograft or total body irradiation (TBI) (31 of 1202 vs 0 of 127; P =.07). Eight patients were taking regular penicillin prophylaxis at the time of SPS, whereas 23 were not taking any prophylaxis. None of the 7 patients with fatal infections was taking prophylaxis for Pneumococcus. Pneumococcal bacteremia was associated with higher incidences of mortality (6 of 15 vs 1 of 16; P =.04). We conclude that there is a significant long-term risk for pneumococcal infection in patients who have undergone allograft transplantation, especially those with chronic GVHD. Patients who have undergone autograft transplantation after TBI-containing regimens also appear to be at increased risk. These patients should receive lifelong pneumococcus prophylaxis. Consistent with increasing resistance to penicillin, penicillin prophylaxis does not universally prevent SPS, though it may protect against fatal infections. Further studies are required to determine the optimum prophylactic strategy in patients at risk.

As a result, alphaIIbbeta(3) cannot be activated and cannot bind to fibrinogen, leading to a loss of platelet aggregation. Thrombasthenia is clinically characterized by mucocutaneous hemorrhage with episodes of intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeding. To develop methods for gene therapy of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-derived vector, -889Pl(A2)beta(3), was transduced into peripheral blood CD34(+) cells from 2 patients with thrombasthenia with defects in the beta(3) gene. The human alphaIIb promoter was used in this vector to drive megakaryocyte-targeted expression of the wild-type beta(3) subunit. Proviral DNA and alphaIIbbeta(3) biosynthesis were detected after in vitro differentiation of transduced thrombasthenic CD34(+) cells with megakaryocyte growth and development factor. Flow cytometric analysis of transduced patient samples indicated that 19% of megakaryocyte progeny expressed alphaIIbbeta(3) on the surface at 34% of normal receptor levels. Treatment of transduced megakaryocytes with a combination of agonists including epinephrine and the thrombin receptor-activating peptide induced the alphaIIbbeta(3) complex to form an activated conformation capable of binding fibrinogen as measured by PAC-1 antibody binding. Transduced cells retracted a fibrin clot in vitro similar to megakaryocytes derived from a normal nonthrombasthenic individual. These results demonstrate ex vivo phenotypic correction of Glanzmann thrombasthenia and support the potential use of hematopoietic CD34(+) cells as targets for alphaIIb promoter-driven MuLV vectors for gene therapy of platelet disorders.

Using a newly established erythroleukemia cell line HB60-5, which proliferates in response to erythropoietin (Epo) and stem cell factor (SCF) and differentiates when stimulated with Epo alone, we characterized several events associated with the cell cycle during erythroid differentiation. Forty-eight h after SCF withdrawal and Epo stimulation, there was strong inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4 and cdk6 activities, associated with an increase in the binding of p27 and p15 to cdk6. A significant increase in the binding of p27 to cyclin E- and cyclin A-associated cdk2 correlated with the inhibition of these kinases. In addition, the expression of c-Myc and its downstream transcriptional target Cdc25A were found to be down-regulated during Epo-induced terminal differentiation of HB60-5 cells. The loss of Cdc25A was associated with an increase in the phosphotyrosylation of cyclin E-associated cdk2, which may contribute to cell cycle arrest during differentiation. Although overexpression of p27 in HB60-5 cells caused G1 arrest, it did not promote terminal erythroid differentiation. Thus, the cell cycle arrest that involves p27 is part of a broader molecular program during HB60-5 erythroid differentiation. Moreover, we suggest that SCF stimulation of erythroblasts, in addition to inhibiting erythroid differentiation, activates parallel or sequential signals responsible for maintaining cyclin/cdk activity.","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Cancer Biology Research, Sunnybrook, Ontario, Canada.']","['0 (Ccnd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccnd3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccng1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin G)', '0 (Cyclin G1)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Cdc25a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies demonstrate that CDDO treatment results in apoptosis of U-937 and HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. Similar to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), another agent that inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of these cells, CDDO induced the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3. Overexpression of Bcl-X(L) blocked cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis in ara-C-treated cells. By contrast, CDDO-induced release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-3 were diminished only in part by Bcl-X(L). In concert with these findings, we demonstrate that CDDO, but not ara-C, activates caspase-8 and thereby caspase-3 by a cytochrome c-independent mechanism. The results also show that CDDO-induced cytochrome c release is mediated by caspase-8-dependent cleavage of Bid. These findings demonstrate that CDDO induces apoptosis of myeloid leukemia cells and that this novel agent activates an apoptotic signaling cascade distinct from that induced by the cytotoxic agent ara-C.","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']","['0 (2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,"['CA-29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This disorder is thus called HMB-EBV-NK disease and has been reported in Orientals, mostly from Japan. We investigated the profile of cytokine production and the expression of both types of NK inhibitory receptors, i.e. CD94 lectin-like dimers and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, in NK leukaemic cells from three patients with HMB-EBV-NK disease. It was found that freshly isolated NK leukaemic cells expressed mRNA for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and additionally produced IL-10 upon stimulation with IL-2, indicating that the NK cells were of NK1 type. More than 98% of NK cells from the patients bore CD94 at a higher level than did normal NK cells, whereas p70 or NKAT2, belonging to immunoglobulin-like receptor, was not expressed in those NK cells. Freshly isolated leukaemic NK cells transcribed mRNA for CD94-associated molecule NKG2C at an abnormally high level, and upon stimulation with IL-2 and/or IL-12 they expressed NKG2A as well. The disordered expression of these inhibitory receptors not only provides some insights into the pathogenesis of HMB-EBV-NK disease but also can be used as phenotypic markers for the diagnosis of this type of NK cell leukaemia.","['Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan. seo445@hama-med.ac.jp']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRC2 protein, human)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,PMC1905558,,,,,,,,,,,

The approximately 6.5-kb mRNA has a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 587 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 650 kDa. Like kelch and KLHL2, the KLHL3 protein contains a poxvirus and zinc finger domain at the N-terminus and six tandem repeats (kelch repeats) at the C-terminus. At least three isoforms, which differ in the length of the N-terminus, are produced and may be the result of alternative promoter usage. We also identified alternative polyadenylation sites and alternative splicing; thus, as many as 12 mRNA variants and six putative protein isoforms could be produced.

We are using the expressed sequence tag (EST) resource as our primary approach to identifying novel candidate genes for the 5q- syndrome. Seventeen ESTs were identified from the Human Gene Map at the National Center for Biotechnology Information that had no significant homology to any known genes and were assigned between DNA markers D5S413 and D5S487, flanking the critical region of the 5q- syndrome at 5q31-q32. Eleven of the 17 cDNAs from which the ESTs were derived (65%) were shown to map to the critical region of the 5q- syndrome by gene dosage analysis and were then sublocalized by PCR screening to a YAC contig encompassing the critical region. Eight of the 11 cDNA clones, upon full sequencing, had no significant homology to any known genes. Each of the 8 cDNA clones was shown to be expressed in human bone marrow. The complete coding sequence was obtained for 2 of the novel genes, termed C5orf3 and C5orf4. The 2.6-kb transcript of C5orf3 encodes a putative 505-amino-acid protein and contains an ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P loop), suggesting that this novel gene encodes an ATP- or a GTP-binding protein. The novel gene C5orf4 has a transcript of 3.1 kb, encoding a putative 144-amino-acid protein. We describe the cloning of 2 novel human genes and the sequencing, expression patterns, and mapping to the critical region of the 5q- syndrome of a further 6 novel cDNA clones. Genomic localization and expression patterns would suggest that the 8 novel cDNAs described in this report represent potential candidate genes for the 5q- syndrome.","['Leukaemia Research Fund Molecular Haematology Unit, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, 0X3 9DU, United Kingdom. jboultwo@enterprise.molbiol']","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF156165', 'GENBANK/AF157115', 'GENBANK/AF157116', 'GENBANK/AF159165', 'GENBANK/AF159700']",,,,,,,

The recombinant hpRNase1-hIL-2 inhibited protein synthesis in HTLV-1-infected, malignant T cells, which hyperproduce high affinity IL-2 receptors, with an IC(50)of 2x10(-8) M, whereas no inhibition was detectable in control cells with lower affinity receptors. HpRNase1 alone had an IC(50)of almost 10(-3) M. A molar excess of hIL-2 blocked the protein synthesis inhibition dose-dependently. In a human mixed lymphocyte culture, hpRNase1-hIL-2 inhibited the proliferation of responder cells with potency comparable to that of cyclosporine, while non-effective doses of FK506 importantly improved its potency. Despite its short half-life in animals, hpRNase1-hIL-2 rapidly enters cells in a few minutes and arrests the protein translation in less than 10 h. Thus, hpRNase1-hIL-2 may be useful to selectively eliminate activated lymphocytes hyperproducing high affinity IL-2 receptors, as in allograft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, autoimmune disorders, adult T cell leukaemia and other lymphoproliferative or retroviral malignancies including HIV infection, without inducing general immunosuppression.

We examined the combined effect of IFN-gamma and various HGF inducers on HGF production in human skin fibroblasts. IFN-gamma synergistically enhanced HGF production stimulated by 8-bromo-cAMP, one of the most effective inducers of HGF: HGF secreted from cells incubated with 1 mM of 8-bromo-cAMP, 1000 U/ml of IFN-gamma and both of these was approximately 8, 1.5 and 24 times, respectively, that secreted from untreated cells. The effect of IFN-gamma was dose-dependent and was nullified by an anti-IFN-gamma antibody. Neither IFN-alpha nor IFN-beta had such an enhancing effect, but both these IFNs inhibited the synergistic effect of IFN-gamma and 8-bromo-cAMP. IFN-gamma also synergistically augmented HGF production induced by interleukin-1beta and cAMP-increasing agents cholera toxin, forskolin and prostaglandin E(2). HGF gene expression upregulated by cholera toxin, forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP was markedly enhanced by IFN-gamma, which was detected as early as 3 h after its addition. The synergy between HGF inducers and IFN-gamma is not common to all HGF inducers, because HGF production stimulated by epidermal growth factor and protein-kinase-C-activating phorbol esters was significantly inhibited by IFN-gamma. These results indicate that IFN-gamma synergistically stimulates cAMP-induced HGF production and inhibits HGF production induced by growth factors and protein kinase C activators in human skin fibroblasts.","['Department of Immunochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Tsushima-naka, Okayama, 700-8530, Japan. gohda@pheasant.pharm.okayama-u.ac.jp']","['23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore examined the ability of recombinant mOSM to stimulate osteoclast formation and activity using cocultures of murine calvaria and bone marrow cells, and compared the responses to other members of the interleukin 6 family of cytokines including mouse leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) and IL-6. Mouse OSM, LIF and CT-1 strongly induced the formation of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase positive (TRAP(+)) multinucleated cells (MNC) in a dose-dependent fashion. OSM, LIF or CT-1 also elevated the number and size of resorptive pits when cocultures were added to smooth cortical bone slices, indicating enhancement of osteoclast activity. The activity of OSM was reduced by indomethacin (10(-8)-10(-6) M), whereas addition of dexamethasone (DEX) at 10(-7)-10(-5) M synergistically enhanced OSM-induced numbers of TRAP(+)MNC. DEX (10(-7) M) costimulation also synergistically enhanced TRAP(+)cell numbers of LIF, and CT-1 treated cocultures. IL-6 had no activity alone, but further enhanced TRAP(+)cell formation in mOSM or DEX (10(-7) M) treated cocultures. When added to mouse calvarial osteoblast cultures, mOSM induced secretion of IL-6 protein and elevation of mRNA whereas LIF or CT-1 did not. IL-6 mRNA levels and protein secretion were reduced in osteoblasts by costimulation with DEX. These results show that mouse OSM, LIF and CT-1 induce osteoclast differentiation and activation, that DEX synergizes with each in this activity, and that mouse OSM induces responses in osteoblasts that are not shown by LIF or CT-1. Collectively these data suggest an important role of these cytokines in osteoporosis caused by high levels of corticosteroid.","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We compared the histories of selected allergic disorders (asthma, hay fever, food or drug allergies, eczema, and hives) of 1842 cases of ALL with those of 1986 individually matched controls. The histories of the allergic disorders among siblings of cases and controls were also compared. RESULTS: The combined history of any one or more of the five allergic disorders evaluated was associated with a significant reduced risk of ALL (adjusted OR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.8), as were histories of four specific allergic disorders (asthma, hay fever, food or drug allergies, and eczema). The combined history of any one or more of the five allergic disorders among any of the siblings of the study subjects also revealed a significantly inverse association (adjusted OR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.8-1.0).

Tbdn-1 is also downregulated in M1 myeloid leukemia cells after differentiation in response to LIF in vitro. Tbdn-1 is homologous to the yeast NAT-1 N-terminal acetyltransferases and encodes a novel protein of approximately 69 kDa associated with an acetyltransferase activity. Levels and distribution of tbdn-1 expression are regulated in both endothelial and hematopoietic cells during development in tissues such as the yolk sac blood islands, heart, and liver blood vessels. In the adult, tbdn-1 expression is low or undetected in most organs examined with the exception of the atrial endocardium, the endothelial and myeloid compartments of bone marrow, and the remodeling vascular bed of atretic ovarian follicles.

To investigate the role of Mg availability in the modulation of TopoII in whole cells, we studied enzyme activity and expression in HL-60 cells grown in the presence of decreasing amounts of extracellular Mg (0.5, 0.03, and 0.01 mM MgSO(4)). In comparison to cells grown in 0.5 mM Mg, cells grown in 0.03 mM Mg exhibited a decrease in TopoII activity, as evidenced by reduced induction of DNA/TopoII cleavable complexes and apoptosis by etoposide and teniposide. Enzyme activity was restored by the readdition of Mg (0.5 and 1.5 mM) in the incubation medium, confirming that this effect was indeed modulated by extracellular Mg. Restriction of Mg to 0.01 mM was associated with a dramatic decrease in TopoII activity resembling that observed in HL-60 cells differentiated by dimethyl sulfoxide treatment. The restriction of Mg, while decreasing enzyme activity, was found to upregulate TopoII protein expression, determined by Western blot analysis. The increase of TopoII protein levels was correlative with the degree of Mg deprivation. Collectively, these results indicate that extracellular levels of Mg may control availability of intracellular Mg, thus affecting the regulation of TopoII activity/expression and downstream processes of cell proliferation and/or differentiation.","['Institute of General Pathology and ""Giovanni XXIII"" Cancer Research Center, Catholic University of Sacred Heart, 00168 Rome, Italy.']","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"['CA35531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74939/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to establish which growth factors have a role in human muscle regeneration due to potential clinical therapeutic applications. As there is limited information concerning LIF expression in human muscle, we investigated the relative levels of LIF messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in human muscle injury. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase followed by polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify LIF message. We found that although LIF mRNA is expressed in low levels in control muscle, a sevenfold increase occurred after orthopedic muscle trauma and a marked 19-fold increase in dystrophic muscle (P < 0.002).

They are mostly treated with intensive chemotherapy and craniospinal irradiation. In most treatment schedules, irradiation is given early after induction treatment. Because craniospinal irradiation affects a large portion of hematopoietic bone marrow systemically, treatment is often delayed owing to aplasias. Also, dose reductions are frequently needed. Children receiving simultaneously irradiation and chemotherapy are prone to (often severe) neurotoxicity. This study reports on children with a first isolated CNS relapse of their ALL receiving chemotherapy for 40 weeks. Treatment ends with the administration of irradiation given after cessation of chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: Fourteen children, with blasts and >5 cells/mm(3) in two consecutive samples of cerebrospinal fluid and a blast percentage <5% in their bone marrow were treated according to an intensive systemic and site-specific chemotherapy. Craniospinal irradiation was administered after cessation chemotherapy. RESULTS: Event-free-survival was 57% (confidence interval 35-89%), freedom from relapse was 61.5%; follow-up ranges from 2.0 to 15.1 years (median 11.7 years). One child died from septicemia during induction. Five children experienced a second relapse and died from their malignancy. Two children [with a t(9;22) or a rearranged MLL gene] relapsed prior to radiotherapy. Outcome was related to duration of first remission, age at relapse, and identification as a high-risk patient at initial diagnosis. No neurologic complications were noted during and after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed irradiation for isolated CNS relapse in children with ALL gives favorable survival rates, without significant toxicity. Neurotoxicity was absent.","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children Hospital AMC, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. h.vandenberg@amc.uva.nl']",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NF-E2 was expressed in the J2E erythroid cell line, but the levels increased only marginally during erythropoietin-induced differentiation. In contrast, rare myeloid variants of J2E cells did not express NF-E2. Although NF-E2 was present in M1 monoblastoid cells, it was undetectable as these cells matured into macrophages. Compared with erythroid cells, transcription of the NF-E2 gene was reduced, and the half-life of the mRNA was significantly shorter in monocytoid cells. Ectopic expression of NF-E2 had a profound impact upon the J2E cells; morphologically mature erythroid cells spontaneously emerged in culture, but the cells failed to synthesize hemoglobin, even in the presence of erythropoietin. Although proliferation and viability increased in the NF-E2-transfected J2E cells, their responsiveness to erythropoietin was severely diminished. Strikingly, increasing the expression of NF-E2 in M1 cells produced sublines that contained erythroid or immature megakaryocytic cells. Finally, overexpression of NF-E2 in primary hemopoietic progenitors from fetal liver increased erythroid colony formation in the absence of erythropoietin. These data demonstrate that elevated NF-E2 (i) had a dominant effect on the phenotype and maturation of J2E erythroid cells, (ii) was able to reprogram the M1 monocytoid line, and (iii) promoted the development of erythroid colonies by normal progenitors.","['Laboratory for Cancer Medicine, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia.']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the expression of these genes in the mouse telencephalon and found that Meis1 and Meis2 display region-specific patterns of expression from embryonic day (E)10.5 until birth, defining distinct subterritories in the developing telencephalon. The expression of the Meis genes and their proteins is highest in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and mantle regions of the ventral telencephalon.

METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records, CT scans, and BMT database statistics was performed on all pediatric BMT recipients from January 1992 through December 1997. Fifty-four pre-BMT CT scans were performed on 51 children, aged from 2 months to 17 years. Sinus disease was staged according to criteria established by Lund and Kennedy [V.J. Lund, D.W. Kennedy, Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. S167 (1995) 17-21.]. RESULTS: The average age of BMT recipients was 6.8 years. Most common oncologic diagnoses included acute myelogenous leukemia (37%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (17%), and stage IV neuroblastoma (13%). Screening sinus CT scans were routinely performed 1-3 months prior to BMT. On pre-BMT CT scans 48% of the patients had no evidence of sinus disease, 25.9% mild disease, 9.3% moderate disease, and 16.7% severe disease. Two-thirds (66.7%) of patients with severe sinus disease on pre-BMT CT scans experienced clinical sinusitis post-BMT. In contrast, sinus symptoms were much less common (21.4%) in those with mild disease on CT scan. Overall, 39.3% of patients with sinus abnormalities on pre-BMT CT scans had clinical sinusitis during their post-BMT course, compared to 23.1% of those with normal CT scans pre-BMT. In addition, those patients demonstrating sinus disease on their pre-BMT CT scan were more likely to have radiographic sinusitis post-BMT (25.0%) than those with no disease (7.7%). Seventy-eight percent of those with severe sinusitis had died by 2-year follow up, compared to 69.2% of patients with normal CT scans pre-BMT. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of radiographic sinus disease on pre-BMT CT scans was noted to correlate with clinical and radiographic sinusitis later in the post-BMT course, and was associated with a trend toward decreased survival. Pre-BMT CT scans may be useful in determining which children need early and more aggressive intervention for clinical sinusitis post-BMT.","[""Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Children's Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA. kbilli@mednet.swmed.edu""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we examined the effect of histamine and the histamine-receptor antagonists cimetidine and diphenhydramine on the production of neopterin after stimulation with IFN-gamma in the myelomonocytoma cell line THP-1. Increasing concentrations of histamine markedly suppressed IFN-gamma induced neopterin formation. Simultaneous preincubation of THP-1 cells with histamine, IFN-gamma and different concentrations of the H(2)-receptor antagonist cimetidine showed a clear antagonizing effect on neopterin formation. In contrast, the H(1)-receptor antagonist diphenhydramine was not able to abrogate the suppressive effect of histamine on neopterin production. Our results suggest, that histamine may be a potent inhibitor of effects or mechanisms induced by IFN-gamma in monocytes/macrophages. Cimetidine, and possibly other H(2)-receptor antagonists, may reverse down-regulatory actions of endogenously formed histamine on activated monocytic cells.","['Institute for Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Innsbruck, and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for AIDS Research, Fritz-Pregl-Str. 3, A-6020, Innsbruck, Austria.']","['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '670-65-5 (Neopterin)', '80061L1WGD (Cimetidine)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '8GTS82S83M (Diphenhydramine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dose delivered in particle therapy can be described as the integral of fluence times the total mass stopping power over the particle energy distributions. We employed Monte Carlo simulations to explore the influence on the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the energy and the energy spread of the proton beam incident on a range modulator system. Using different beams, the conditions of beam delivery were adjusted so that similar spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) doses were delivered to a simulated water phantom. We calculated the RBE for inactivation of three different cell lines using the track structure model. The RBE depends on the details of the dose deposition and the biological characteristics of the irradiated tissue. Our calculations show that, for differing beam conditions, the corresponding differences in the total mass stopping power distributions are reflected in differences in the RBE. However, these differences are remarkable only at the very distal edge of the SOBP, for low doses, and/or for large differences in beam setup.","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA. paganetti@hadron.mgh.harvard.edu']",['0 (Protons)'],,,,['CA21239/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In normal bone marrow samples the median seeding efficiency was 119 colonies and clusters per 10(5) cells and thiorphan caused slight stimulation of the clonal growth in concentrations above 10(-9) M. In the leukemic samples, the median seeding efficiency varied from 10 to 366 colonies and clusters per 10(5) seeded cells. Meaningful alterations of the clonal growth were noted in 32 out of 83 thiorphan-treated cultures (39%). In those 32 cultures the stimulatory effects outnumbered the inhibitory effects (24 versus 8). Thus, thiorphan stimulated the progenitor cell proliferation in bone marrow samples from the normal donor and from the patients with acute leukemia in remission.

The only major difference between the WHO- and the REAL-classification is the consideration of prolymphocytic leukaemia as a single disease entity in the former system. All the above-mentioned lymphomas arise from B cells of varying stages of differentiation and, therefore, often demonstrate architectural, cytological and immunophenotypic characteristics of their normal physiological counterparts. Consideration of tumour cell growth pattern, -cytology, -immunophenotype and -growth fraction, together with the presence and consistency of the reactive cell infiltrate, usually leads to categorisation of a lymphoma in the majority of cases. The molecular biological characteristics of follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma are the best defined of the small cell B-cell lymphomas. Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes and the bcl-2 gene or Cyclin D1 gene, respectively, probably belong to the initial changes in a cell, which, together with several subsequent unidentified genetic alterations, lead to the development of these tumours. Although nodal small cell B-cell lymphomas are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease, the progression of the disease--with the exception of mantle cell lymphomas--is often indolent. As a result, the small cell B-cell lymphomas were previously considered as ""low-grade"" Non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the Kiel classification. However, since the progress of a lymphoma subtype can be heterogeneous and since mantle cell lymphomas cannot really be considered as ""low-grade"" tumours, ""umbrella grading"" of lymphomas has been discarded in the WHO classification, with emphasis being placed on grading within a lymphoma disease entity. In the following pages, the characteristics important for the diagnosis and categorisation of the small cell B-cell lymphomas will be summarised.

Our focus is two ongoing clinical studies with transgeneic (genetically altered) cellular therapy; one uses allogeneic (from another person) lymphocytes to treat leukemia, and the second uses xenogeneic (from another species) fibroblast cells genetically altered to contain a toxin-producing suicide gene to treat ovarian cancer. Allogeneic donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are known to induce remission of hematologic malignancies. However, the toxicity associated with DLI is related to graft-versus-host-disease, which is due to donor lymphocytes attacking normal tissue in the recipient. Therefore, we have taken the approach of infusing DLI that have been modified to contain a latent suicide gene to treat leukemia. To treat ovarian cancer, we used xenogeneic nonimmune fibroblast-derived cells to deliver a tumor-directed cytotoxic gene to carcinoma cells. These cells release HStk transgene retroviruses that in turn transduce replicating tumor cells but not quiescent epithelium, rendering the tumor selectively susceptible to ganciclovir-mediated killing. These initial trials summarize the early stage of allogeneic/xenogeneic adoptive cellular therapy for cancer, and although the data are limited, it is encouraging to see some patients with evidence of antitumor responses. Advances in our understanding of the basic science of these treatments, together with improvements in the technology of vector design, will be required to streamline these methodologies into broader application.","['Northwestern University School of Medicine and The Robert H.

However, native AML cells usually show some morphological signs of differentiation that allow a classification into different subsets, and further differentiation may be induced by exposure to various soluble mediators, for example, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and several cytokines. Combination therapy with ATRA and chemotherapy should now be regarded as the standard treatment of the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) variant of AML. Although several agents can also induce leukemic cell differentiation for other AML subgroups, in vitro studies as well as clinical data have demonstrated that these agents often have heterogeneous effects on the leukemic progenitors. This makes the clinical impact of differentiation induction therapy for individual patients difficult to predict. However, differentiation induction should be regarded as a promising therapeutic approach, especially as a part of immunotherapy or in combination with intensive chemotherapy to increase the susceptibility of AML blasts to drug-induced apoptosis. Although the morphology-based French-American-British classification was used to identify APL as an AML subset that required a special treatment, it seems unlikely that this classification alone can be used to identify new subsets of AML patients with special therapeutic requirements. Future studies on differentiation induction in AML should therefore focus on A) the identification of therapeutic agents with more predictable effects; B) the use of clinical and laboratory parameters to define new subsets of AML patients in which differentiation induction has a predictable and beneficial effect, and C) the characterization of how AML blast sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis is altered by differentiation induction.","['Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital.']",,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MRP subfamily consists of at least six members, and here we report the functional characterization of human MRP5. We found resistance against the thiopurine anticancer drugs, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and thioguanine, and the anti-HIV drug 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) in MRP5-transfected cells. This resistance is due to an increased extrusion of PMEA and 6-thioinosine monophosphate from the cells that overproduce MRP5. In polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells transfected with an MRP5 cDNA construct, MRP5 is routed to the basolateral membrane and these cells transport S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione and glutathione preferentially toward the basal compartment. Inhibitors of organic anion transport inhibit transport mediated by MRP5. We speculate that MRP5 might play a role in some cases of unexplained resistance to thiopurines in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and/or to antiretroviral nucleoside analogs in HIV-infected patients.","['Division of Molecular Biology and Center for Biomedical Genetics, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleotides)']",,,,,PMC16570,,,,['GENBANK/U83661'],,,,,,,

This reduction is followed by a slower decline that primarily results from the presence of viral reservoirs such as CD4+ memory cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. For this reason, we evaluated a new drug combination therapy that includes a lympholytic drug: (2-fluoro-ara-AMP, fludarabine) to eliminate cells already infected and an antiviral drug (azidothymidine [AZT]) to protect cells not yet infected. We used C57BL/6 mice infected with the retroviral complex LP-BM5, which developed severe immunodeficiency (i.e., murine AIDS), to select the most effective fludarabine regimen to inhibit disease progression, and then to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the fludarabine and AZT combinations. The results obtained show that intraperitoneal administration of fludarabine at 3 mg/mouse twice a day for 4 weeks is the most effective regimen in reducing splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hypergammaglobulinemia, and proviral DNA content in spleen and lymph nodes and in restoring the architecture of lymph nodes. Subsequently, we evaluated the combined or sequential administration of fludarabine and AZT. The data reported in this paper show that the sequential administration of the two drugs provides additive antiviral effects that reduce spleen and lymph node weights to normal values and proviral DNA content by approximately 95% in all infected organs; the phenotypes of blood T and B cells moved toward control values, although the number of B cells was significantly reduced by fludarabine treatment. Finally, we evaluated the outcome of the disease after suspension or continuation of different treatment regimens. In all treatment groups, the disease progressed and increased proviral DNA content was found in infected organs, but animals receiving the sequential administration of fludarabine and AZT were less affected than those receiving only fludarabine or the simultaneous administration of both. The results obtained suggest that fludarabine could be part of a new therapeutic approach aiming at eradicating HIV from those cells that have been already infected and that are not protected by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).","['Giorgio Fornaini Institute of Biologic Chemistry, University of Urbino, Italy.']","['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the dose-dependent effect of etoposide on apoptosis using chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells treated with low (5 microM) or high (100 microM) concentrations of the drug. At a low concentration, etoposide induced little apoptosis at 24 h, while about 20% of the cells showed apoptosis morphologically at a high concentration. Processing of caspase-3 was slightly detected from 12 h and became obvious at 24 h with 100 microM etoposide. Caspase-3-like protease activity was detected at 24 h with a high concentration. Moreover, these changes were accompanied by cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Changes of the mRNA levels of most apoptosis-regulating genes were not prominent at both concentrations, except for the rapid induction of c-IAP-2/HIAP-1 and the down-regulation of Bcl-X(L) by 100 microM etoposide. The downregulation of Bcl-X(L) protein occurred from 6 h, while Bax protein conversely showed a slight increase from 6 h.

We are presenting the employment of a new method which was introduced into the photodynamic therapy, namely enhancement of synthesis of the photosensitizing compound, protoporphyrin IX, in cancer cells, following application of its metabolic precursor, 5-aminolevulinic acid, for the specific destruction of leukemic cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: By determining cell viability using tetrazolium salt reduction (MTT), by flow cytometrypropidium iodide assay and by determining cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine incorporation we studied the effect of photodynamic therapy based on the application of 5-aminolevulinic acid on the cells of leukemic cell lines HL60 (human promyelocytic leukemia), HEL (erythroleukemia), DAUDI (B-cell leukemia), JURKAT (T-cell lymphoma), blast cells of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia as well as on normal lymphocytes and normal human bone marrow progenitors. In in vitro experiments photodynamic therapy based on an administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (1 mM, 4 h, 18 J/cm2) lowered the number of viable leukemic cells by over 2 orders (with the exception of HEL cells) and eliminated blast cells in mononuclear cell preparations of six out of seven patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. On the other hand the viability of normal resting lymphocytes was little affected by photodynamic therapy (number of necrotic cells increased from 6 to 11%) and also the clonogenic activity of the progenitor cells of normal bone marrows did not decrease substantially (CFU-GM to 60% and BFU-E to 55% of the original activity). CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy based on the application of 5-aminolevulinic acid is a perspective method for the specific destruction of leukemic cells in autologous transplants.","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha.']","['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)']",,,,,,Selektivni fotodynamicka destrukce leukemickych bunek.,,,,,,,,,,

Most interestingly, CIK cells have been shown to eradicate established human lymphoma cells in a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse xenograft model in vivo. The current study was aimed at increasing the sensitivity of leukemia and lymphoma cells to CIK cells. In particular, the authors wanted to target CIK cells to leukemia and lymphoma cells via reverse antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Binding of an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody to CIK cell cultures derived from patients with lymphoma was shown using flow cytometric analysis. For the target side, several B-cell lines were found to express CD19 on the cell surface. There was an impressive increase in sensitivity to CIK-mediated lysis of various lymphoma and leukemia cell lines by preincubation of the targets with a monoclonal antibody against CD3. This increase could be partially blocked by preincubation with anti-CD16 (Fc receptor III) and anti-CD32 (Fc receptor II) antibodies. These data suggest that the increase in cytotoxic activity is caused by Fc receptor-mediated antibody binding. Cytotoxic activity could be further increased by adding an anti-CD28 antibody in addition to anti-CD3. Finally, there was a further increase in sensitivity to CIK-mediated lysis of CD19+ malignant cells using the bispecific OKT3xHD37 antibody with specificity against CD3 and CD19. Interestingly, preincubation of malignant cells with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody followed by addition of the bispecific OKT3xHD37 antibody led to a further increase of cytotoxic sensitivity compared with the addition of the bispecific antibody alone. In conclusion, these data suggest that cytotoxic activity of immunologic effector cells can be increased not only by using the bispecific antibody OKT3xHD37 in vitro but also by preincubation of CD19+ leukemia and lymphoma cells with a monoclonal antibody against CD3. In addition, the immunostimulatory effect of the bispecific antibody OKT3xHD37 can be further increased by adding a monoclonal antibody against CD3.","['Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universitat, Bonn, Germany.']","['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction of this cytokine to the therapeutic modalities for secondary cutaneous B-CLL would hopefully change the poor outcome of this entity, or at least could produce a better quality of life. Loss of histidine decarboxylase activity in the infiltrating cells - in contrast to circulating lymphocytes - may be associated with the transformation of B-CLL to a more aggressive infiltrative form, offering a possible explanation for tissue invasiveness.

In the regenerating muscle of mice possessing FGF6 mutation, fiber remodeling was delayed. Although myostatin and FGF6 may be important for the maintenance, regeneration and/or hypertrophy of muscle, little work has been done on the possible role of these proteins in adult muscle in vivo. Using Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis, we investigated, in rats, the distribution of myostatin, FGF6 and LIF proteins between slow- and fast-type muscles, and the adaptive response of these proteins in mechanically overloaded muscles, in regenerating muscles following bupivacaine injection and in denervated muscles after section of the sciatic nerve. The amounts of myostatin and LIF protein were markedly greater in normal slow-type muscles. In the soleus muscle, myostatin and LIF proteins were detected at the site of the myonucleus in both slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers. In contrast, FGF6 protein was selectively expressed in normal fast-type muscles. Mechanical overloading rapidly enhanced the myostatin and LIF but not FGF6 protein level. In the regenerating muscles, marked diminution of myostatin and FGF6 was observed besides enhancement of LIF. Denervation of fast-type muscles rapidly increased the LIF, but decreased the FGF6 expression. Therefore, the increased expressions of myostatin and LIF play an important role in muscle hypertrophy following mechanical overloading. The marked reduction of FGF6 in the hypertrophied and regenerating muscle would imply that FGF6 regulates muscle differentiation but not proliferation of satellite cells and/or myoblasts.","['Department of Physiology, Institute for Developmental Research, Aichi Human Service Center, Kamiya-cho, Kasugai, Aichi, Japan. sakuma@inst-hsc.pref.aichi.jp']","['0 (Fgf6 protein, rat)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 6)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Mstn protein, mouse)', '0 (Mstn protein, rat)', '0 (Myostatin)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The low bioavailability of these drugs combined with the bone marrow toxicity of AZT (3'-azido, 3'-deoxythymidine, Zidovudine), resulting in anemia and leukopenia, pancreatitis with ddI (2',3'-dideoxyinosine, Didanosine) and painful peripheral neuropathy in case of ddC (2',3-dideoxycytosine, Zalcitabine) are the limiting factors in their use. In addition, the emergence of strains of HIV resistant to AZT, the most commonly used drug, further restricts its use. Thus the control of AIDS and its complications, needs special therapeutic approaches to combat the disease. In order to overcome these limitations, AZT and ddI have been synthesized as ester-linked ceramide- and phosphatidylcholine-linked prodrugs possessing therapeutic attributes lacking in the parent compounds. There is greater uptake and longer retention of these prodrugs in NIH/3T3 cells in vitro. Pretreatment with our prodrugs blocked infection of these cells by Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) for an extended period, which the parent drugs failed to do. When human CD4+ HeLa cells were continuously exposed to the AZT prodrug, subsequent infection of these cells by HIV was blocked. Similar results were obtained with NIH/3T3 cells exposed to M-MuLV. AE(6)C, a prodrug of AZT linked to ceramide via a cleavable ester bond and a six carbon linker, was less toxic to both mouse and human bone marrow progenitor cells than free AZT.

This survival protein has the BCL-2 homology (BH) domains 1, 2, and 3 and a C-terminal transmembrane region. We identified a short splicing variant of the MCL-1 mRNA in the human placenta encoding a protein, termed MCL-1 short (MCL-1S), with an altered C terminus as compared with the full-length MCL-1 long (MCL-1L), leading to the loss of BH1, BH2, and the transmembrane domains. Analysis of the human MCL-1 gene indicated that MCL-1S results from the splicing out of exon 2 during mRNA processing. MCL-1S, unlike MCL-1L, does not interact with diverse proapoptotic BCL-2-related proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system. In contrast, MCL-1S dimerizes with MCL-1L in the yeast assay and coprecipitates with MCL-1L in transfected mammalian cells. Overexpression of MCL-1S induces apoptosis in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the MCL-1S action was antagonized by the antiapoptotic MCL-1L. Thus, the naturally occurring MCL-1S variant represents a new proapoptotic BH3 domain-only protein capable of dimerizing with the antiapoptotic MCL-1L. The fate of MCL-1-expressing cells could be regulated through alternative splicing mechanisms and interactions of the resulting anti- and proapoptotic gene products.","['Division of Reproductive Biology, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305-5317, USA.']","['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,['HD-31566/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['GENBANK/AF162676', 'GENBANK/AF162677', 'GENBANK/AF203373']",,,,,,,

However, the signaling events triggered by p38 that result in caspase-3 activation are still unknown. In human leukemia cells, two reactive oxygen species, singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), selectively stimulated the phosphorylation of p38. Preincubation of cells with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38, dose dependently inhibited DNA fragmentation induced by singlet oxygen but not by H(2)O(2). Protection from apoptosis by SB203580 correlated with inhibition of caspase-3, and several events that are associated with caspase-3 activation, including Bid cleavage, decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, whereas caspase-8 cleavage was not affected by this inhibitor. In contrast, blockade of caspase-8 with Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone is sufficient to prevent formation of DNA fragments and to inhibit all the above signaling events, with exception of p38 phosphorylation, in both singlet oxygen- and H(2)O(2)-treated cells. These data suggest that caspase-3 activation is regulated through redundant signaling pathways that involve p38 and caspase-8 acting upstream of Bid during singlet oxygen-induced apoptosis, whereas the activation of caspase-3 by H(2)O(2) is only governed by a caspase-8-mediated apoptotic pathway.","['Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.']","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,['GM 30955/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This wavelength of light is chosen because it is absorbed by TPPS2, but not by HIDC. The photodynamic system studied may be useful as a model for antineoplastic therapy. A subline of K562 leukemia (K562/DOX), expressing the multidrug-resistance (MDR) phenotype, is found to accumulate smaller amounts of HIDC than the parent cell line and thus has less photoprotection. In the absence of added HIDC, the K562/DOX cell line is more resistant to photodynamic cytotoxicity than the K562 cell line. The resistance of the K562/DOX cell line is not due to a smaller accumulation of TPPS2 than the K562 cell line. However, when both cell lines are incubated with HIDC and TPPS2, and then exposed to light, the K562/DOX cell line becomes more sensitive to photodynamic cell damage than the K562 cell line.

Laboratory examination revealed decrease in the number of lymphocytes and CD4-positive lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and CD4/CD8 ratio was consistently low, indicating the presence of cellular immunodeficiency state. Serum anti-HTLV-I antibody was markedly increased but he did not have HTLV-I associated myelopathy (HAM).

While few centres in India use this modality of therapy, the worldwide experience is encouraging. We, therefore, analysed the results of our initial experience with this therapeutic modality. METHODS: Forty-two patients [multiple myeloma (17), Hodgkin's disease (4), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (3), chronic myeloid leukaemia (2), acute myeloid leukaemia (2), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (2), epithelial ovarian cancer (6), breast cancer (4), primitive neuroectodermal tumour and testicular germ cell tumour (1 each)] underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by either autologous bone marrow transplant (n = 9), peripheral blood stem cell transplant (n = 30) or both (n = 3). The indications for transplant included either advanced stage at diagnosis, other adverse prognostic indicators during the course of their disease, or relapse. The data were analysed retrospectively in December 1998 using hospital records. Follow up data of all the patients were available. RESULTS: Thirty-four of the 42 patients (81%) showed stable engraftment. Eight patients (19%) died in the early post-transplant period (day 5 to day 52 post-transplant). Seven patients died due to neutropenic infections and one due to acute renal failure. Of the 34 surviving patients, 20 were alive at the time of analysis and 14 had died. All but one death in this group were due to progressive primary malignancy. The median overall survival for all patients was 17 months and for the 34 engrafted patients it was 27 months. An analysis of factors affecting survival revealed that patients with chemosensitive disease had a longer overall survival (20.9 v. 6.1 months, p = 0.04) compared to those with chemoresistant disease.

The expression of members of the abdominal b (Abdb) Hox gene complex, as well as genes encoding bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps), is altered in the developing limb of Zfp145-/- mice. Plzf regulates the expression of these genes in the absence of aberrant polarizing activity and independently of known patterning genes. Zfp145-/- mice also exhibit anterior-directed homeotic transformation throughout the axial skeleton with associated alterations in Hox gene expression. Plzf is therefore a mediator of anterior-to-posterior (AP) patterning in both the axial and appendicular skeleton and acts as a regulator of Hox gene expression.","['Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Sloan-Kettering Division, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, New York, New York, USA.']","['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",,,,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of CLL that, after 3 years of slowly progressive disease and treatment with single-agent chemotherapy (fludarabine phosphate), underwent a composite prolymphocytoid and classic Hodgkin lymphoma transformation. The diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma was based on the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells with typical morphologic structure and immunophenotype (CD15(+), CD30(+), CD45(-), CD20(-)) associated with the characteristic polymorphous inflammatory background consisting of numerous eosinophils, plasma cells, and reactive T lymphocytes. The remainder of the lymph node and the peripheral blood showed increased numbers of prolymphocytes admixed with typical small CLL cells. Recognition of such a transformation is of the utmost importance, since histologically similar Reed-Sternberg-like cells may be seen in Richter transformation. In contrast to prolymphocytoid transformation of CLL, Richter syndrome is rapidly fatal, with a median survival of 4 to 5 months.

To elucidate its mechanism of action, we have established and characterized TAS-103-resistant cells, derived from mouse leukemia (P388), human colon cancer (DLD-1), and human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cell lines, by exposure to stepwisely increasing concentrations of TAS-103 in the culture medium. P388 / TAS cells showed only cross-resistance to VP-16 and adriamycin (ADR). The Topo II activity in these cells was decreased to below one-fourth of that in the parental cells, while the Topo I activity remained unchanged. DLD / TAS cells appeared to be cross-resistant to VP-16, ADR, camptothecin (CPT), SN-38 and vincristine (VCR). The enzymatic activities of both Topo I and Topo II in these cells were decreased to one-fourth of that observed in the parental cells. Furthermore, the decreased activities were accompanied by lower expression at the mRNA and protein levels. A549 / TAS cells acquired cross-resistance to VP-16, ADR and VCR, though the Topo activities were virtually unchanged.

GATA-binding sites are consistently found in promoters or enhancers of genes expressed selectively in erythroid cells. To discover novel GATA-1-regulated genes, we searched for GATA-1-activated transcripts in G1E cells, an erythroid line derived from GATA-1(-) embryonic stem cells. By subtractive analysis, we identified a new ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that is strongly and rapidly induced by GATA-1. This protein, named ABC-me (for ABC-mitochondrial erythroid), localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and is expressed at particularly high levels in erythroid tissues of embryos and adults. ABC-me is induced during erythroid maturation in cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells, and its overexpression enhances hemoglobin synthesis in erythroleukemia cells. The ABC proteins participate in diverse physiological processes by coupling ATP hydrolysis to the transport of a variety of substrates across cell membranes. We speculate that ABC-me, a newly identified erythroid-expressed ABC superfamily member, may mediate critical mitochondrial transport functions related to heme biosynthesis.","[""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]","['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Abcb10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gata1 protein, rat)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)']",,,,,PMC212759,,,,['GENBANK/AF266284'],,,,,,,

DESIGN: Population study. SUBJECTS: Guthrie card samples from babies born in 1997-8. Samples were linked to data on mother's age and ethnic status and parents' country of birth and then anonymised. SETTING: North Thames Regional Health Authority. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of antibodies against HTLV in eluates tested by gelatin particle agglutination assay and results confirmed by immunoblot. RESULTS: Of 126 010 samples tested, 67 had confirmed antibodies to HTLV (59 HTLV-I, 2 HTLV-II, 6 untyped) and six had indeterminate results. Seroprevalence was 17.0 per 1000 (95% confidence interval 9.2 to 28.3) in infants whose mothers were born in the Caribbean, 3.2/1000 (1.5 to 5.9) with mothers born in west and central Africa, and 6.8/1000 (3.1 to 12.9) in infants of black Caribbean mothers born in non-endemic regions. In infants with no known risk (both parents born in non-endemic regions and mother not black Caribbean) seroprevalence was 0.06-0.12 per 1000. Mother's country of birth, father's country of birth, and mother's ethnic status were all independently associated with neonatal seroprevalence. An estimated 223 (95% confidence interval 110 to 350) of the 720 000 pregnant women each year in the United Kingdom are infected with HTLV. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HTLV and HIV infections in pregnant women in the United Kingdom are comparable. The cost effectiveness of antenatal HTLV screening should be evaluated, and screening of blood donations should be considered.","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Institute of Child Health, London WC1N 1EH. a.ades@ich.ucl.ac.uk']",['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)'],,,,,PMC27390,,,,,,,,,,,

Because retrovirally mediated infection is depending on the cell cycle, we first optimized the conditions for activating T cells in the presence of immobilized CD3 monoclonal antibodies and recombinant interleukin 2. Cell cycle analysis indicated that CD8+ and total T cells reach a maximum of cycling within 4 days whereas CD4+ T cells attain their maximum of cycling only by day 6. Taking into account these data, CD4+, CD8+, and total T cells were preactivated for 5 and 3 days, respectively, and then infected for 24 hr with supernatant containing retrovirus pseudotyped with gibbon-ape leukemia virus envelope, using a cell centrifugation protocol. Results show that approximately 95% of CD4+, CD8+, and total T cells can be transduced, this transduction efficiency being significantly higher than that obtained with amphotropic retrovirus vectors. Furthermore, under permanent growth stimulation, transduced T cells can be expanded approximately 1,000-fold in 4 weeks of culture with maintenance of transgene expression. However, Immunoscope analysis revealed alterations of T cell repertoire diversity after 2-3 weeks in culture that was not due to retroviral transduction per se. Overall, these data provide evidence that T cells can be transduced at levels that may alleviate the need for both further selection of transduced cells and in vitro expansion, thereby preserving the repertoire diversity of the transduced T cells to be reinfused.","['Biologie et Therapeutique des Pathologies Immunitaires, ESA CNRS 7087 CERVI, CHU Pitie Salpetriere, Paris, France.']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Galactosides)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'V595OG374W (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-galactoside)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the expression of this antigen on the monocytes of ten patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and compared the results with 67 patients suffering from other MDS syndromes and with 18 healthy individuals. We chose this series as it plays an important role in MDS patients where in most cases the neutrophils are defective. We also examined the following antigens as indicative of activation and adhesion of the monocytes in these patients: CD11b, CD18, CD35, CD38, CD44, CD69. We found decreased expression of CD43 on the monocytes of the RA, RAS, RAEB, and RAEB-t patients compared with the CMML and controls. The other activation molecules studied were found to be upregulated, suggesting the existence of activated monocytes in these patients.

Currently, different RNA isolation methods are used in the diagnostic laboratories. No data are available on their suitability for sensitive detection of breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) gene transcripts. We have extracted RNA from mononuclear cell (MNC) fractions and from lysed blood samples of 4 patients (1 with leukocytosis, 1 with chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML) under interferon treatment, and 2 CML patients after bone marrow transplantation) with 3 RNA isolation reagents (TRIzol, RNAzol, FastTube reagent). RNA yield was slightly higher with RNAzol than with TRIzol as indicated by agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric measurement at 260 nm. The FastTube reagent was unsuitable for RNA isolation from MNC, and was not evaluated for lysed blood. Quantitative competitive RT-PCR amplification of the ABL gene showed comparable results for RNA isolated with RNAzol and TRIzol. In RNA samples extracted from lysed whole blood, the presence of amplifiable RNA/cDNA was confirmed by amplification of 4 selected reference genes (porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), ABL, the gene spanning the BCR on chromosome 22 and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA)) in a multiplex PCR. High quality, DNA-free RNA was obtained with RNAzol, and 1 BCR-ABL-positive (specific for translocation t [9; 221) cell among 2x10(4) normal cells was successfully detectable by single step RT-PCR.

Secondly, an active member of this series was used to assess the PEG-camptothecin conjugate's efficacy against a battery of solid tumor types. PEG-camptothecin is a novel water soluble transport form (macromolecular prodrug) of the naturally derived antitumor drug, 20-(S)-camptothecin (CPT). Rates of hydrolysis were studied in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the plasma of both rats and humans. In vivo efficacy screens were performed against P388/0 murine leukemia and LS174T human colon solid tumor xenograft models. The results showed that while all the derivatives had considerable stability in PBS, their rates of hydrolysis varied in both rat and human plasma according to the amino acid spacer employed. Not surprisingly, changing the amino acid also affected in vivo toxicity and efficacy in the treatment of ascites and solid tumors. A representative of this amino acid series, PEG-alanine-CPT, which showed moderate activity in the solid tumor screen, was chosen for evaluation of efficacy across a wide range of solid tumor types and demonstrated significant antitumor activity (% T/C < 30%) in all tested xenograft models (colon, ovarian, mammary, lung, pancreatic and prostate). Therefore, this study showed that the use of specific amino acid spacers affected both the PEG-camptothecin conjugates' breakdown and biological activity. We anticipate that using these insights, this soluble macromolecular transport technology could be successfully employed with a number of antitumor drugs.","['Camptothecin delivery systems: the utility of amino acid Research and Development, Enzon Inc., Piscataway, NJ 08854-3969, USA.']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Solvents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concentration needed for growth inhibition of SSCC-1 cells was 10(-8) M, which was lower than those of gamabufotalin and ouabain. When SSCC-1 cells were treated with 10(-8) M bufalin for 16 h, the DNA synthesis of SSCC-1 cells decreased, but there was no change in their survival ratio. The results suggest that growth inhibitory effect of buffalin is not only a cytotoxic effect. Bufalin increased the production of cornified envelopes and the expression of Keratin K10/11 and involurcin. These findings indicate that bufalin has both growth inhibitory and differentiation inducing effects on SSCC-1 cells.","['Department of Dermatology, Showa University School of Medicine.']","['0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (Cardiac Glycosides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many parameters may be measured simultaneously at high speed, objectively and with good statistics. The method has been increasingly used in the context of medical diagnosis and prognosis over the last ten years. Clinical-chemical departments are major users of flow cytometry for differential cell counts of leukocyte populations in blood by light scatter measurements. For immunophenotyping of acute leukaemias, flow cytometry is used routinely in all university hospitals in Norway. The method is also used to classify chronic lymphoproliferative disease, and for quantification of CD34-positive stem cells by high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support. Flow cytometry is routinely used for classifying non-malignant haematological disease like congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies. In diagnostic pathology, DNA flow cytometry is used for analysis of DNA ploidy and S-phase fractions in malignant tumours. DNA aneuploidy is a strong prognostic factor in some childhood tumours and in gynaecological malignant tumours, and flow cytometry is used in tumour biology for measurements of growth and apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, the method is an important research tool in many areas of biomedical research for detection of structural and functional cellular features.","['Institutt for patologi, Universitetet i Oslo.']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",20,,,,,Vaeskestromscytometri--anvendelse i cellebiologi og nytte i klinisk medisin.,,,,,,,,,,

We found that maintenance of cell volume depends on the concentration of serum in the culture medium. In isotonic medium containing 20% serum, HCD57 cells maintain their steady-state volume. In contrast, the cells shrink progressively as medium serum content is reduced. In serum-free medium, raising external K to 75 mm prevents cell shrinkage and a further increase in K to 145 mm results in swelling, revealing a role for K permeability in the regulation of cell volume. Of particular interest has been a serendipitous finding with furosemide. Below an external K concentration of 2.1 +/- 0.3 mm in medium containing 2% serum, furosemide inhibits K uptake, probably stemming from its well known inhibitory action on KCl cotransport. However, above that K concentration, furosemide stimulates K uptake in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, furosemide potentiates cell shrinkage induced by serum withdrawal. These findings suggest that the transport machinery mediating cellular shrinkage, once primed by serum depletion, becomes receptive to a second stimulus.","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Missouri, M517B Medical Sciences Building, One Hospital Center Dr., Columbia, MO 65212, USA.']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (potassium-chloride symporters)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '7LXU5N7ZO5 (Furosemide)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",,,,['DE07389/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown here that transformation of the hematopoietic cell lines Ba/F3, 32Dcl3, and MO7e with BCR/ABL results in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with quiescent, untransformed cells. The increase in ROS was directly due to BCR/ABL because it was blocked by the ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571. Oxidative stress through ROS is believed to have many biochemical effects, including the potential ability to inhibit protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). To understand the significance of increased production of ROS, a model system was established in which hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was added to untransformed cells to mimic the increase in ROS induced constitutively by BCR/ABL. H(2)O(2) substantially reduced total cellular PTPase activity to a degree approximately equivalent to that of pervanadate, a well known PTPase inhibitor. Further, stimulation of untransformed cells with H(2)O(2) or pervanadate increased tyrosine phosphorylation of each of the most prominent known substrates of BCR/ABL, including c-ABL, c-CBL, SHC, and SHP-2. Treatment of the BCR/ABL-expressing cell line MO7/p210 with the reducing agents pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or N-acetylcysteine reduced the accumulation of ROS and also decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Further, treatment of MO7e cells with H(2)O(2) or pervanadate increased the tyrosine kinase activity of c-ABL. Drugs that alter ROS metabolism or reactivate PTPases may antagonize BCR/ABL transformation.","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Adult Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. martin_sattler@dfci.harvard.edu']","['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (pervanadate)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,"['CA75348-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Erythroleukemia K562 and neuroblastoma CHP100 cells were used, because they showed high basal activity of lipoxygenase. The hydroperoxides generated by 5-, 12-, or 15-lipoxygenases from linoleate, linolenate, or arachidonate, and the corresponding hydroxides, were able to induce PCD in both cell types, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. After 24 h, K562 and CHP100 cells showed 2.5- to 3.5-fold more apoptotic bodies than the untreated controls. PCD elicited by lipoxygenase products was independent of intracellular glutathione concentration, and did not require mRNA transcription or protein synthesis. On the other hand, lipoxygenase products evoked an immediate and sustained rise in cytoplasmic calcium (within seconds), followed by mitochondrial uncoupling (within hours). Unlike the hydro(pero)xides, the terminal products of the arachidonate cascade (i.e., leukotrienes, prostaglandins and thromboxane) were not cytotoxic.","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, IDI-IRCCS Biochemistry Laboratory, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy.']","['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Uncoupling Agents)', '0RBV727H71 (alpha-Linolenic Acid)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '54397-85-2 (Thromboxane B2)', '9KJL21T0QJ (Linoleic Acid)', 'EC 1.13.11.12 (Lipoxygenase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the relative expression of the mRNAs encoding LIF and IL-6, as well as the LIF-binding subunit (LIFR-beta) of the LIF receptor and, as a potential downstream cytokine-responsive gene, beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m), in porcine peri-implantation conceptuses, and in placenta and endometrium during early and mid-pregnancy. Peri-implantation spherical and filamentous conceptuses expressed LIFR-beta and beta(2)m mRNAs with no LIF mRNA present. Rapid development in days 11/12 spherical conceptuses to the filamentous stage was accompanied by transiently increased IL-6 gene expression. The corresponding endometrium, in contrast, expressed LIF in addition to these other mRNAs. LIFR-beta, IL-6 and beta(2)m, but not LIF mRNAs, were expressed in the Jag-1 cell line, an in vitro model for porcine day 14 trophoblast. The greatest steady-state amounts of LIF, LIFR-beta and IL-6 mRNAs in both the endometrium and placenta were evident at the post-implantation stages (days 30 and 60>day 18 of pregnancy). Treatment of porcine endometrial explants with human recombinant (hr)LIF or hrIL-6 resulted in no change in, or diminished, the presence of endometrial beta(2)m mRNA, respectively. Addition of LIF to peri-implantation conceptus explant cultures, in contrast, induced beta(2)m mRNA synthesis. These results highlight the potential importance of both the endometrium and placenta as sources, as well as targets, of these cytokines throughout pregnancy. Cytokine modulation of beta(2)m, a known in vitro mitogen, may constitute one mechanism for local control of trophoblast and endometrial proliferation.","['Department of Physiological Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 32611-0920, USA.']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",,['Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,"['R01 HD021961/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD21961/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['GENBANK/U97364'],,,,,,,
