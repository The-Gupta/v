However, the mechanism underlying the development of multiple symptoms has not been established. METHODS: To explore the role of inflammatory cytokines in the development of treatment-related symptoms, we studied dynamic changes in symptoms and in serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 [sTNF-R1], IL-1 receptor antagonist, and IL-12p40p70) from pretherapy throughout the first 30 days of allo-HSCT in 30 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. We measured multiple symptoms repeatedly using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory. Mixed-effects modeling was used to analyze longitudinal data. RESULTS: In response to conditioning and stem-cell infusion, serum levels of IL-6 and the severity of multiple symptoms increased rapidly and peaked at nadir. From baseline to nadir (approximately Day 8 post-transplantation), increase in IL-6 was significantly associated with worsening of the most severe symptoms (fatigue, poor appetite, pain, drowsiness, dry mouth, and disturbed sleep; P< .01). During the first 30 days after transplantation, increases in IL-6 (P< .001) and sTNF-R1 (P< .05) significantly predicted the increasing severity of these symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that release of systemic inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-6, corresponds to an increase in treatment-related multiple-symptom burden during the nadir period of allo-HSCT.",['(c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],"['Wang, Xin Shelley', 'Shi, Qiuling', 'Williams, Lori A', 'Cleeland, Charles S', 'Mobley, Gary M', 'Reuben, James M', 'Lee, Bang-Ning', 'Giralt, Sergio A']","['Wang XS', 'Shi Q', 'Williams LA', 'Cleeland CS', 'Mobley GM', 'Reuben JM', 'Lee BN', 'Giralt SA']","['Department of Symptom Research, The University of Texas M.

Free oscillation rheometry (FOR) is a technique that offers information on coagulation, based on contributions of all blood components, by measurement of clotting time and changes in clot elasticity. This is the first study that evaluates FOR parameters in subjects likely to represent hypercoagulability (pregnant women) and hypocoagulability (thrombocytopenic patients). Clotting time and blood clot elasticity were measured by FOR in blood samples obtained from women in different pregnancy trimesters (n = 58), in thrombocytopenic patients before and after a platelet transfusion (n = 20) and in healthy blood donors (n = 60). The clotting time was shorter and the clot elasticity higher in pregnant women compared to the non-pregnant female blood donors. The elasticity was higher in late pregnancy compared to early pregnancy. Compared to the blood donors, the thrombocytopenic patients had lower elasticity, which was increased by a platelet transfusion, but there was no difference in clotting time.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the changes of PAC-1 binding and CD62P expression, with or without agonists in patients after transfusions. Twenty-eight whole blood samples were obtained from 24 patients admitted to the department of Hematology & Oncology and transfused with platelets; these samples were compared to 30 healthy controls. Whole blood samples, either with or without agonists, such as 20 microM adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or 100 microM thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP), were stained with the fluorescein conjugated monoclonal antibodies PAC-1 or CD62P. Then, the percent expression for each marker was analysed using flow cytometry. ADP and TRAP induced an increased percentage of CD62P expression and PAC-1 binding after platelet transfusions compared to the samples studied before transfusion, and these findings were lower than those of the healthy controls. However, the expression of platelets without the agonists was not significantly changed, despite the transfusions.

The objective of the present investigation is to report a novel technology to load two anti-leukaemic drugs of choice simultaneously inside the PAMAM dendrimer. Under optimized conditions of pH and dialysis time, one molecule of PAMAM dendrimer was found to be capable of entrapping 27.02 +/- 0.51 and 8.00 +/- 0.46 molecules of Methotrexate and all-trans Retinoic acid (ATRA), respectively. The simultaneous in-vitro release profiling of the loaded drugs was studied at pH 4, 7.4 and 10. The release kinetics was found to be governed by degree of dendrimer protonation, with more sustained and controlled behaviour at pH 7.4. Terminal loading of dendrimer with less haemolytic bioactive (ATRA) reduced the haemolytic toxicity of the dendrimer formulation. A cytotoxicity study was performed on HeLa cell lines by MTT assay, wherein after 72 h, the dual-drug loaded dendrimer was found to be more efficient (IC(50) 0.5 microM) as compared to that of the free drug combination (IC(50) 0.75 microM).",,"['Tekade, Rakesh Kumar', 'Dutta, Tathagata', 'Gajbhiye, Virendra', 'Jain, Narendra Kumar']","['Tekade RK', 'Dutta T', 'Gajbhiye V', 'Jain NK']","['Pharmaceutics Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dr Hari Singh Gour University, Sagar, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Microencapsul,Journal of microencapsulation,8500513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dendrimers)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (PAMAM Starburst)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dendrimers/*chemistry', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology']",,,2008/09/16 09:00,2011/05/19 06:00,['2008/09/16 09:00'],"['2008/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['902427985 [pii]', '10.1080/02652040802312572 [doi]']",ppublish,J Microencapsul. 2009 Jun;26(4):287-96. doi: 10.1080/02652040802312572.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that proteolytic cleavage dictates different cellular localization and functions of p12(I). The removal of a noncanonical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention/retrieval signal within the amino terminus of p12(I) is necessary for trafficking to the Golgi apparatus and generation of a completely cleaved 8-kDa protein. The 8-kDa protein in turn traffics to the cell surface, is recruited to the immunologic synapse following T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation, and down-regulates TCR proximal signaling.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 605 patients with essential thrombocythemia (follow-up 4596 person-years) with the aim of defining prognostic factors for thrombosis, myelofibrosis, and leukemia during follow-up. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (11%) developed thrombosis with a 10-year risk of 14%. Age >60 years (p<0.001) and a history of thrombosis (p=0.03) were independent risk factors for thrombosis. Progression to myelofibrosis occurred in 17 patients (2.8%) with a 10-year risk of 3.9%. Anemia at diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia was significantly correlated (p<0.001) with progression to myelofibrosis. Leukemia occurred in 14 patients (2.3%) at a median time of 11 years after the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia; the risk was 2.6% at 10 years. Age >60 years (p=0.02) was significantly correlated with the development of leukemia. Cytotoxic treatment did not imply a higher risk of leukemia. At the time of the analysis, 64 of the 605 patients (10.6%) had died. The 10-year probability of survival was 88%, with a median survival of 22.3 years. Age >60 years (p<0.001) and history of thrombosis (p=0.001) were independent risk factors for survival. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study on a large series of patients treated according to current clinical practice provide reassurance that essential thrombocythemia is an indolent disorder and affected patients have a long survival.

Diagnostics can be used to identify outlying or influential samples, and also to evaluate model fit and explore model expansion. RESULTS: We demonstrate this methodology on an adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) dataset, using GSEA based on chromosome-band mapping of genes. Individual residuals, grouped or aggregated by chromosomal loci, indicate problematic samples and potential data-entry errors, and help identify hyperdiploidy as a factor playing a key role in expression for this dataset. Subsequent analysis pinpoints suspected DNA copy number abnormalities of specific samples and chromosomes (most prevalent are chromosomes X, 21 and 14), and also reveals significant expression differences between the hyperdiploid and diploid groups on other chromosomes (most prominently 19, 22, 3 and 13)--differences which are apparently not associated with copy number.

The DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacytidine and decitabine have shown significant clinical benefits in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but their precise mode of action remains to be established. Both drugs have been shown the ability to deplete DNA methyltransferase enzymes and to induce DNA demethylation and epigenetic reprogramming in vitro. However, drug-induced methylation changes have remained poorly characterized in patients and therapy-related models. We have now analyzed azacytidine-induced demethylation responses in myeloid leukemia cell lines. These cells showed remarkable differences in the drug-induced depletion of DNA methyltransferases that coincided with their demethylation responses. In agreement with these data, DNA methylation analysis of blood and bone marrow samples from MDS patients undergoing azacytidine therapy also revealed substantial differences in the epigenetic responses of individual patients. Significant, transient demethylation could be observed in 3 of 6 patients and affected many hypermethylated loci in a complex pattern.

Studies have shown that elevation of ceramide species plays a role in 4-HPR cytotoxicity. To determine 4-HPR activity in a multidrug-resistant cancer cell line as well as to study ceramide metabolism, MCF-7/AdrR cells (redesignated NCI/ADR-RES) were treated with 4-HPR and sphingolipids were analyzed. TLC analysis of cells radiolabeled with [3H]palmitic acid showed that 4-HPR elicited a dose-responsive increase in radioactivity migrating in the ceramide region of the chromatogram and a decrease in cell viability. Results from liquid chromatography/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry revealed large elevations in dihydroceramides (N-acylsphinganines), but not desaturated ceramides, and large increases in complex dihydrosphingolipids (dihydrosphingomyelins, monohexosyldihydroceramides), sphinganine, and sphinganine 1-phosphate. To test the hypothesis that elevation of sphinganine participates in the cytotoxicity of 4-HPR, cells were treated with the sphingosine kinase inhibitor d-erythro-N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), with and without 4-HPR. After 24 h, the 4-HPR/DMS combination caused a 9-fold increase in sphinganine that was sustained through +48 hours, decreased sphinganine 1-phosphate, and increased cytotoxicity. Increased dihydrosphingolipids and sphinganine were also found in HL-60 leukemia cells and HT-29 colon cancer cells treated with 4-HPR. The 4-HPR/DMS combination elicited increased apoptosis in all three cell lines. We propose that a mechanism of 4-HPR-induced cytotoxicity involves increases in dihydrosphingolipids, and that the synergy between 4-HPR and DMS is associated with large increases in cellular sphinganine. These studies suggest that enhanced clinical efficacy of 4-HPR may be realized through regimens containing agents that modulate sphingoid base metabolism.",,"['Wang, Hongtao', 'Maurer, Barry J', 'Liu, Yong-Yu', 'Wang, Elaine', 'Allegood, Jeremy C', 'Kelly, Samuel', 'Symolon, Holly', 'Liu, Ying', 'Merrill, Alfred H Jr', 'Gouaze-Andersson, Valerie', 'Yu, Jing Yuan', 'Giuliano, Armando E', 'Cabot, Myles C']","['Wang H', 'Maurer BJ', 'Liu YY', 'Wang E', 'Allegood JC', 'Kelly S', 'Symolon H', 'Liu Y', 'Merrill AH Jr', 'Gouaze-Andersson V', 'Yu JY', 'Giuliano AE', 'Cabot MC']","['Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM69338/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 GM069338/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM77391/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (dihydroceramide)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', 'L9QRA71834 (N,N-dimethylsphingosine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Sphingolipids/analysis', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,,2008/09/16 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/09/16 09:00'],"['2008/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/9/2967 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0549 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 Sep;7(9):2967-76. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0549.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ST1926 and CD437 are prototypic RRMs, with the former currently undergoing phase I clinical trials. We show here that ST1926, CD437, and active congeners cause DNA damage. Cellular and subcellular COMET assays, H2AX phosphorylation (gamma-H2AX), and scoring of chromosome aberrations indicate that active RRMs produce DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and chromosomal lesions in NB4, an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line characterized by high sensitivity to RRMs. There is a direct quantitative correlation between the levels of DSBs and the cytotoxic/antiproliferative effects induced by RRMs. NB4.437r blasts, which are selectively resistant to RRMs, do not show any sign of DNA damage after treatment with ST1926, CD437, and analogues. DNA damage is the major mechanism underlying the antileukemic activity of RRMs in NB4 and other AML cell lines. In accordance with the S-phase specificity of the cytotoxic and antiproliferative responses of AML cells to RRMs, increases in DSBs are maximal during the S phase of the cell cycle. Induction of DSBs precedes inhibition of DNA replication and is associated with rapid activation of ataxia telangectasia mutated, ataxia telangectasia RAD3-related, and DNA-dependent protein kinases with subsequent stimulation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.

CD64 is therefore a prime target for the specific delivery of cytotoxic agents. A promising toxin candidate is granzyme B, a human serine protease originating from cytotoxic granules of CD8+ T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. After evaluating the sensitivity of the AML-related cell line U937 toward cytosolic granzyme B, we genetically fused granzyme B to H22, a humanized single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) specific for CD64, to obtain Gb-H22(scFv), a fusion protein lacking the immunogenic properties of nonhuman immunofusions. Gb-H22(scFv) was successfully expressed in human 293T cells, secreted, and purified from cell culture supernatants. The purified protein bound specifically to CD64+ U937 cells. Despite linkage to the binding domain, the proteolytic activity of functional Gb-H22(scFv) was identical to that of free granzyme B. Target cell-specific cytotoxicity was observed with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) between 1.7 and 17 nmol/L. In addition, the induction of apoptosis in U937 cells was confirmed by Annexin A5 staining and the detection of activated caspase-3 in the cytosol. Finally, apoptosis was observed in primary CD64+ AML cells, whereas CD64(-) AML cells were unaffected.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade downstream from Ras and KSRs includes Raf-1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 kinases, known to enhance survival potential of a range of cell types. Because the molecular events that increase survival of HL60 cells induced to differentiate toward monocytic phenotype by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] are not known, we investigated if KSR proteins provide a survival function in these cells. We found that whereas kinase suppressor of Ras-1 had no detectable effect on cell survival in the system studied here, 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced up-regulation of hKSR-2 enhanced the resistance of HL60 cells to arabinocytosine. Knockdown of hKSR-2 by either small interfering RNA or antisense oligonucleotides increased arabinocytosine-induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by reduced Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-2/Bad ratios, and increased caspase-3 activating cleavage. In contrast, up-regulation of Mcl-1 was not abrogated by anti-sense (AS) AS-hKSR-2, pointing to a specific role of Bcl-2 in control of 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced increased cell survival. These findings are consistent with the previously shown lack of fully differentiated monocytic cells in HL60 cultures exposed to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in which hKSR-2 was knocked down, suggesting that optimal differentiation of these cells requires enhanced antiapoptotic mechanisms provided, at least in part, by hKSR-2.

Here, we show that xanthohumol has in vitro activity against Bcr-Abl+ cells and clinical samples and retained its cytotoxicity when imatinib mesylate-resistant K562 cells were examined. Xanthohumol inhibition of K562 cell viability was associated with induction of apoptosis, increased p21 and p53 expression, and decreased survivin levels. We show that xanthohumol strongly inhibited Bcr-Abl expression at both mRNA and protein levels and show that xanthohumol caused elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine blunted xanthohumol-induced events. Further, we observed that xanthohumol inhibits leukemia cell invasion, metalloprotease production, and adhesion to endothelial cells, potentially preventing in vivo life-threatening complications of leukostasis and tissue infiltration by leukemic cells.

During latent infection, EBV continuously expresses a number of viral genes which are essential for cell transformation and maintenance of the malignant phenotype of EBV-related tumors. There has been no previous link between EBV and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), a distinctive form of leukemia derived from T-cells at an intermediate stage of differentiation between a cortical thymocyte and a mature peripheral blood T-cell. OBJECTIVE: To determine if EBV was present in the T-PLL cells collected. STUDY DESIGN: T-PLL cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of a patient diagnosed with T-PLL and continuously cultured for about 1 year. The existence of EBV in these cells was detected using multiple strategies including PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescent assay and flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: The EBV genome was present in these T-PLL cells by PCR analysis across multiple sites in the viral genome. In addition, these T-PLL cells expressed a number of EBV latent antigens. The EBV oncoproteins LMP1, EBNA1 and EBNA3C were expressed in the majority of the infected cells.

Further analysis demonstrated the involvement of activation of caspase cascade, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, and release of Cytochrome C, in TA-induced apoptosis. These effects were probably associated with the increase of intracellular superoxide in mitochondrial signaling pathway which attributed to the down-regulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Notably, a low dose of TA is sufficient to aggravate arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3))-induced cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells.

While innate immunity reconstitutes quickly, adaptive B- and especially T-cell lymphopoeisis may be compromised for years following transplantation. In large part, these immune system deficits are due to the decrease, or even absence, of thymopoiesis following transplantation. Thereby, T-cell reconstitution initially relies upon expansion of mature donor T cells; a proliferation driven by high cytokine levels and the presence of allo-reactive antigens. This peripheral mechanism of T-cell generation may have important clinical consequences. By expanding tumouricidal T cells, it may provide a venue to enhance T-cellular immunotherapy following transplantation.

The functional characteristics of NK cells are dictated by the strength of inhibitory receptor signalling. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-specific inhibitory receptor acquisition occurs sequentially during NK cell development, and is determined by the nature of immunological reconstitution after allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation. Polymorphisms of inhibitory receptors [killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs)] and their ligands (MHC) contribute to interindividual variability. As a result, the functional NK cell repertoire of individual donors has variable potential for graft-vs-leukaemia reactions.

Further improvements in exploiting the GvL effect to prevent relapse in high-risk leukaemias while minimizing toxicity have focused on the use of targeted anti-leukaemic immunotherapy. These strategies include the use of vaccines against minor histocompatibility antigens (HA-1, HA-2 and H-Y) and leukaemia-specific antigens (proteinase 3, Wilms' tumour 1 and BCR-ABL), and the adoptive transfer of leukaemia-specific T cells.

One possible mechanism involves local upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This study was done to define the mechanism by which OxLDL increases secretion of VEGF in macrophages. The murine leukemia-derived RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line as well as mouse peritoneal macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages were used in these studies. Cells were exposed to native low-density lipoprotein (LDL), acetylated LDL, and LDL that had been modified by oxidation with copper or ferrous ions or by exposure to auto-oxidation products of arachidonic acid for 16h, and VEGF was then assayed in medium. Pharmacological inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or PKCzeta blocked VEGF secretion by OxLDL. Inhibitors of other protein kinase C (PKC) subtypes had no effect, and neither did inhibitors of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK). We found that LDL with oxidative modification of either its lipid or protein component can induce VEGF expression. Higher degrees of oxidation of LDL conferred higher potency to induce VEGF. Macrophages from mice lacking both scavenger receptors A (SR-A) and CD36 were fully responsive to OxLDL with regard to VEGF secretion.

Docetaxel has proved to be a first line treatment choice. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) could potently inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro and its combination with various anticancer agents results in increased cytotoxicity. Based on these data, our aim was to examine the synergistic/additive cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of combination of docetaxel and ATRA, in hormone- and drug refractory human DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we have searched for the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis by demonstrating apoptosis-related genes. METHODS: XTT cell proliferation assay was used for showing cytotoxicity. For verifying apoptosis, both DNA Fragmentation by ELISA assay and caspase 3/7 activity measurement were used. For detecting the mechanism of apoptosis induced by docetaxel-ATRA combination, OligoGeArray which consists of 112 apoptosis related genes was used. RESULTS: Our results revealed that docetaxel and ATRA were synergistically cytotoxic and apoptotic in DU-145 cells, in a dose- and time dependent manner. It was also shown by our studies that apoptosis was induced in DU-145 prostate carcinoma cells with significant cytotoxicity, no matter which agent applied first. We have found out that docetaxel-ATRA combination significantly downregulates survivin (BIRC5), myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) and lymphotoxin beta-receptor (LTbetaR) genes, which all three have pivotal roles in regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle progression. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we strongly suggest that docetaxel and ATRA combination is a good candidate for this challenging era of daily oncologic practice. Also, the combination of docetaxel and ATRA might allow a reduction in docetaxel doses and by this way may diminish docetaxel adverse effects while maintaining the therapeutic effect in patients with HRPC.",,"['Kucukzeybek, Yuksel', 'Gul, Mustafa K', 'Cengiz, Ercument', 'Erten, Cigdem', 'Karaca, Burcak', 'Gorumlu, Gurbuz', 'Atmaca, Harika', 'Uzunoglu, Selim', 'Karabulut, Bulent', 'Sanli, Ulus A', 'Uslu, Ruchan']","['Kucukzeybek Y', 'Gul MK', 'Cengiz E', 'Erten C', 'Karaca B', 'Gorumlu G', 'Atmaca H', 'Uzunoglu S', 'Karabulut B', 'Sanli UA', 'Uslu R']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Tulay Aktas Oncology Hospital, School of Medicine, Ege University, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey. yuksel.kucukzeybek@ege.edu.tr']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Lymphotoxin beta Receptor)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use/*toxicity', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Docetaxel', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Lymphotoxin beta Receptor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Taxoids/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use/*toxicity']",PMC2553060,,2008/09/16 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1756-9966-27-37 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-27-37 [doi]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Sep 12;27:37. doi: 10.1186/1756-9966-27-37.,20080912,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advancements in vector development now allows the generation of target cell-selected AAV capsid mutants. METHODS: To determine its suitability, the method was applied on a chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) cell line (K562) to obtain a CML-targeted vector and the resulting vectors tested on leukaemia, non-leukaemia, primary human CML and CD34+ peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC); standard AAV2 and a random capsid mutant vector served as controls. RESULTS: Transduction of CML (BV173, EM3, K562 and Lama84) and AML (HL60 and KG1a) cell lines with the capsid mutants resulted in an up to 36-fold increase in CML transduction efficiency (K562: 2-fold, 60% +/- 2% green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ cells; BV173: 9-fold, 37% +/- 2% GFP+ cells; Lama84: 36-fold, 29% +/- 2% GFP+ cells) compared to controls. For AML (KG1a, HL60) and one CML cell line (EM3), no significant transduction (<1% GFP+ cells) was observed for any vector. Although the capsid mutant clone was established on a cell line, proof-of-principle experiments using primary human cells were performed. For CML (3.2-fold, mutant: 1.75% +/- 0.45% GFP+ cells, p = 0.03) and PBPC (3.5-fold, mutant: 4.21% +/- 3.40% GFP+ cells) a moderate increase in gene transfer of the capsid mutant compared to control vectors was observed. CONCLUSION: Using an AAV random peptide library on a CML cell line, we were able to generate a capsid mutant, which transduced CML cell lines and primary human haematopoietic progenitor cells with higher efficiency than standard recombinant AAV vectors.",,"['Stiefelhagen, Marius', 'Sellner, Leopold', 'Kleinschmidt, Jurgen A', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Laufs, Stephanie', 'Wenz, Frederik', 'Zeller, W Jens', 'Fruehauf, Stefan', 'Veldwijk, Marlon R']","['Stiefelhagen M', 'Sellner L', 'Kleinschmidt JA', 'Jauch A', 'Laufs S', 'Wenz F', 'Zeller WJ', 'Fruehauf S', 'Veldwijk MR']","['Department G402, Pharmacology of Cancer Treatment, German Cancer Research Center, INF 280, D-69120, Heidelberg, Germany. mstiefelhagen@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Genet Vaccines Ther,Genetic vaccines and therapy,101178414,,,,PMC2553401,,2008/09/16 09:00,2008/09/16 09:01,['2008/09/16 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:01 [medline]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1479-0556-6-12 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-0556-6-12 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Vaccines Ther. 2008 Sep 12;6:12. doi: 10.1186/1479-0556-6-12.,20080912,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Staurosporine and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) are the therapeutic agents that inhibit tumor cell growth by inducing cell death. Staurosporine induces apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway, while TNFalpha trigger the cell death via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. We have previously demonstrated that the cell cycle regulatory protein, cyclin A1 played an important role in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and cyclin A1 expression correlated with disease characteristics and patient outcome in leukemia. However, it remains unknown how cyclin A1 expression is regulated in leukemic cells treated with the therapeutic agents. Here, we demonstrate that cyclin A1 protein is regulated by proteasome-mediated ubiquitination and degradation in untreated U-937 cells. Interestingly, ubiquitination- and proteasomal-mediated degradation of cyclin A1 is prevented in cells treated with staurosporine or TNFalpha. Induction of apoptosis in U-937 cells by staurosporine or TNFalpha resulted in an increase in cyclin A1 protein expression, which correlated well with cyclin A1 protein modification and the activation of caspase-3. Blocking caspases activity by Z-VAD-FMK had no effect on the increased cyclin A1 expression, suggesting that cyclin A1 might be regulated by caspase-3 independent pathways. We further propose that CDC25C may be associated with cyclin A1 protein modification in response to staurosporine or TNFalpha treatment. Our results suggest that cyclin A1 protein is stabilized via post-transcriptional modification in response to apoptosis induced by staurosporine or TNFalpha.",,"['Ekberg, Jenny', 'Persson, Jenny Liao']","['Ekberg J', 'Persson JL']","['Division of Pathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Malmo University Hospital, 205 02 Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (CCNA1 protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclin A1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Staurosporine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitination', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/metabolism']",,,2008/09/13 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2008/09/13 09:00'],"['2008/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-008-9913-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2009 Jan;320(1-2):115-24. doi: 10.1007/s11010-008-9913-3.

Myeloid/NK cell acute leukemia is a very rare subtype of leukemia. Although its NK-cell nature is debatable, it represents a variant of leukemia with distinct morphological and immunophenotypical features. The first case is a de novo myeloid/NK-cell acute leukemia with a striking clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic resemblance to acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but which could be distinguished by its CD11a, CD18, CD117 and CD9 expression. This case illustrates the importance of utilizing the APL surrogate surface phenotype of HLA-DR(low), CD11a(low) and CD18(low) by flow cytometric study to rule in/out APL immunophenotypically. In the second case, we show that myeloid/NK-cell blasts can present as a variant of blasts in a preleukemic disease as refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1), where the blasts were negative for CD34, CD117 and HLA-DR.

The disease most often terminates in acute myeloid leukemia which is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. The defining cytogenetic abnormality, a translocation at the 8p11 locus, always involves the fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGFR1) gene. To date, eight partner genes have been identified in association with FGFR1 rearrangements. The most frequent FGFR1 translocation partner is the zinc finger gene ZNF198 located at 13q11. The t(8;13)(p11;q11) disrupts intron 8 of the FGFR1 gene and fuses proline-rich and zinc finger domains of the ZNF198 gene with the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1. Oligomerization of the fusion protein occurs, with subsequent activation of downstream signal transduction pathways, culminating in neoplastic cell transformation.

However, it is a cryptic rearrangement and often difficult to recognize in conventional cytogenetics (CC). Trisomy 22 is an uncommon karyotypic aberration in AML and is often associated with inv(16)(p13q22). The aim of this study was to explore the value of trisomy 22 in the diagnosis of AML with inv(16). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dual-color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed in 19 AML cases with trisomy 22 abnormality shown by R-banding CC. The probe was a two-color break-apart probe for CBFbeta on the centromeric side and the telomeric side. RESULTS: R-banding CC did not reveal inv(16) in any of the 19 AML with trisomy 22, but FISH analysis showed inv(16) in 11 cases and del(16)(q22) in 1 case. Among the 11 cases with inv(16), 9 showed trisomy 22 as the sole abnormality, 1 was complicated by trisomy 8, and 1 was del(16)(q22). CONCLUSION: This study further confirmed that trisomy 22 as the sole abnormality can be regarded as an important marker for inv(16) in AML.","['Copyright 2008 S.

Their applicability, however, is frustrated by the limited viability of transformed cells and/or by risks linked to selection of oncogene-mutated clones. The reasons for these drawbacks are not yet completely understood. In this study, we show that LXSN-NeoR gene/interleukin-7-engineered mesenchymal stromal cells exhibited a marked enhancement of reactive oxygen species production compared with untransfected cells. This effect resulted to be independent on the product of the gene carried by the retroviral vehicle as it was reproducible in cells transfected with the empty vector alone. Stable transfection of mesenchymal stromal cells with the different retroviral vectors pBabe-puro and PINCO-puro and the lentiviral vector pSico PGK-puro caused similar redox imbalance, unveiling a phenomenon of more general impact. The enhanced production of reactive oxygen species over the basal level was attributable to mitochondrial dysfunction and brought back to altered activity of the NADH-CoQ oxidoreductase (complex I) of the respiratory chain. The oxidative stress in transfected mesenchymal stem cells was completely reversed by treatment with a cAMP analog, thus pointing to alteration in the protein kinase A-dependent signaling pathway of the host cell. Transfection of mesenchymal stromal cells with a PINCO-parental vector harboring the green fluorescent protein gene as selection marker in place of the puromycin-resistance gene resulted in no alteration of the redox phenotype.

Dasatinib exhibited extensive lacteal secretion in Sprague-Dawley rats following a single p.o. dose of [14C]dasatinib (10 mg/kg, 300 microCi/kg). Radioactivity was detected through 72 h postdose, with a milk/plasma area under concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC(0-inf)) ratio of approximately 25.

After a single dose of [14C]dasatinib to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats at gestation day 18, radioactivity was extensively distributed in maternal tissues. The radioactivity detected by tissue excision or quantitative whole-body autoradiography was highest in adrenal gland, mammary tissue, lungs, kidneys, liver, and placenta. Compared with maternal tissues, a relatively low level of radioactivity was detected in fetal tissues. The concentrations of dasatinib-equivalents in fetal liver and kidneys were <13% of the respective maternal organs. The C(max) of dasatinib-equivalents in fetal blood was approximately 39% of that in maternal blood; however, the AUC values were comparable.

However, lentiviruses have evolved mechanisms to specifically evade host APOBEC3. Likewise, murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) exclude mouse APOBEC3 from the virions and cleave virion-incorporated APOBEC3. Although the betaretrovirus mouse mammary tumor virus has been shown to be susceptible to mouse APOBEC3, it is not known if APOBEC3 has a physiological role in restricting more widely distributed and long-coevolved mouse gammaretroviruses. The pathogenicity of Friend MuLV (F-MuLV) is influenced by several host genes: some directly restrict the cell entry or integration of the virus, while others influence the host immune responses. Among the latter, the Rfv3 gene has been mapped to chromosome 15 in the vicinity of the APOBEC3 locus. Here we have shown that polymorphisms at the mouse APOBEC3 locus indeed influence F-MuLV replication and pathogenesis: the APOBEC3 alleles of F-MuLV-resistant C57BL/6 and -susceptible BALB/c mice differ in their sequences and expression levels in the hematopoietic tissues and in their abilities to restrict F-MuLV replication both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, upon infection with the pathogenic Friend virus complex, (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F(1) mice displayed an exacerbated erythroid cell proliferation when the mice carried a targeted disruption of the C57BL/6-derived APOBEC3 allele. These results indicate, for the first time, that mouse APOBEC3 is a physiologically functioning restriction factor to mouse gammaretroviruses.",,"['Takeda, Eri', 'Tsuji-Kawahara, Sachiyo', 'Sakamoto, Mayumi', 'Langlois, Marc-Andre', 'Neuberger, Michael S', 'Rada, Cristina', 'Miyazawa, Masaaki']","['Takeda E', 'Tsuji-Kawahara S', 'Sakamoto M', 'Langlois MA', 'Neuberger MS', 'Rada C', 'Miyazawa M']","['Department of Immunology, Kinki University School of Medicine, 377-2 Ohno-Higashi, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka 589-8511, Japan. masaaki@med.kindai.ac.jp']",['eng'],['MC_U105178806/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics/*immunology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology', 'Virus Replication/immunology']",PMC2573259,,2008/09/13 09:00,2008/11/11 09:00,['2008/09/13 09:00'],"['2008/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01311-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01311-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Nov;82(22):10998-1008. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01311-08.

Targeted TBI using helical tomotherapy results in reduced doses to normal organs, which predicts for reduced toxicities compared with standard TBI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen patients with multiple myeloma were treated in an autologous tandem transplantation Phase I trial with high-dose melphalan, followed 6 weeks later by total-marrow irradiation (TMI) to skeletal bone. Dose levels were 10, 12, 14, and 16 Gy at 2 Gy daily/twice daily. In a separate allogeneic HCT trial, 8 patients (5 with acute myelogenous leukemia, 1 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma) were treated with TMI plus total lymphoid irradiation plus splenic radiotherapy to 12 Gy (1.5 Gy twice daily) combined with fludarabine/melphalan. RESULTS: For the 13 patients in the tandem autologous HCT trial, median age was 54 years (range, 42-66 years). Median organ doses were 15-65% that of the gross target volume dose. Primarily Grades 1-2 acute toxicities were observed. Six patients reported no vomiting; 9 patients, no mucositis; 6 patients, no fatigue; and 8 patients, no diarrhea. For the 8 patients in the allogeneic HCT trial, median age was 52 years (range, 24-61 years). Grades 2-3 nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea were observed. In both trials, no Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity was observed, and all patients underwent successful engraftment. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that TMI using helical tomotherapy is clinically feasible. The reduced acute toxicities observed compare favorably with those seen with standard TBI. Initial results are encouraging and warrant further evaluation as a method to dose escalate with acceptable toxicity or to offer TBI-containing regimens to patients unable to tolerate standard approaches.",,"['Wong, Jeffrey Y C', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Liu, An', 'Schultheiss, Timothy', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Somlo, George']","['Wong JY', 'Rosenthal J', 'Liu A', 'Schultheiss T', 'Forman S', 'Somlo G']","['Division of Radiation Oncology and Radiation Research, City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '43904/PHS HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adult', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Conformal/*methods', 'Therapy, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods']",PMC3896447,['NIHMS83694'],2008/09/13 09:00,2009/01/31 09:00,['2008/09/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(08)00817-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.04.071 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Jan 1;73(1):273-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.04.071.

Thirteen complementation groups have been identified and the genes for all of these are known (FANCA, B, C, D1/BRCA2, D2, E, F, G, I, J/BRIP1, L, M and N/PALB2). Previous studies of cancer incidence in relatives of Fanconi anemia cases have produced conflicting results. A study of British FA families was therefore carried out to investigate this question, since increases in cancer risk in FA heterozygotes would have implications for counselling FA family members, and possibly also for the implementation of preventative screening measures in FA heterozygotes. METHODS: Thirty-six families took part and data was collected on 575 individuals (276 males, 299 females), representing 18,136 person years. In this cohort, 25 males and 30 females were reported with cancer under the age of 85 years, and 36 cancers (65%) could be confirmed from death certificates, cancer registries or clinical records. RESULTS: A total of 55 cancers were reported in the FA families compared to an estimated incidence of 56.95 in a comparable general population cohort, and the relative risk of cancer was 0.97 (95% C.I. = 0.71-1.23, p = 0.62) for FA family members. Analysis of relative risk for individual cancer types in each carrier probability group did not reveal any significant differences with the possible exception of prostate cancer (RR = 3.089 (95% C.I. = 1.09 - 8.78; Chi2 = 4.767, p = 0.029).

However, the feasibility of this dose for small Japanese adults has not been clarified. We prospectively investigated the toxicity and efficacy of this dose in adult Japanese patients. Among the 89 evaluable patients with a median body weight of 62.8 kg, imatinib therapy was held in 40 subjects (45%), due to Grade 3-4 toxicities in 30 patients (75%) and Grade 2 toxicities at the discretion of the attending physician in 10 patients (25%). However, treatment was resumed and the dose was gradually increased until 62 of the 89 patients tolerated a maintenance dose of 400 mg. Older age and lower body weight were significant independent risk factors for discontinuation of imatinib. After a median follow-up period of 31 months, 84 patients were alive without progression. The complete cytogenetic response rate was 60 and 90% at 6 months and 1 year after starting imatinib, respectively. Older patients and those with a lower body weight were less likely to achieve a complete cytogenetic response. These findings suggest that the body weight has a significant influence on the toxicity and efficacy of imatinib in patients with a small body size, although dose reduction in proportion to weight may result in an inadequate response to imatinib.","['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Kizaki, Masahiro', 'Inokuchi, Koiti', 'Yabe, Mariko', 'Yokoyama, Kenji', 'Ito, Yoshikazu', 'Kimura, Yukihiko', 'Higashihara, Masaaki', 'Bessho, Masami', 'Ando, Kiyoshi', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Oshimi, Kazuo', 'Dan, Kazuo', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma', 'Ikeda, Yasuo']","['Kanda Y', 'Okamoto S', 'Tauchi T', 'Kizaki M', 'Inokuchi K', 'Yabe M', 'Yokoyama K', 'Ito Y', 'Kimura Y', 'Higashihara M', 'Bessho M', 'Ando K', 'Chiba S', 'Kurokawa M', 'Oshimi K', 'Dan K', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan. ycanda-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', '*Body Weight', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",,,2008/09/13 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/13 09:00'],"['2008/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.21274 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2008 Nov;83(11):835-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21274.,,,,,,,['Tokyo STI Study Group (TSSG)'],,,,,,,,,

U937 cells expressing FPR and rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells expressing FPRL1 were tested together in a ""duplex"" format. The U937 cells were color coded with red-fluorescent dye allowing their distinction during analysis. Compounds, cells, and fluorescent ligand were sequentially combined (no wash) in 15 microl assay volumes in 384-well plates. Throughput averaged approximately 11 min per plate to analyze approximately 4,000 cells ( approximately 2,000/receptor) in a 2 microl aspirate from each well. In primary single concentration HTS of 24,304 NIH Small Molecule Repository compounds, 253 resulted in inhibition >30% (181 for FPR, 72 for FPRL1) of which 40 had selective binding inhibition constants (K(i)) < or = 4 microM (34 for FPR and 6 for FPRL1). An additional 1,446 candidate compounds were selected by structure-activity-relationship analysis of the hits and screened to identify novel ligands for FPR (3570-0208, K(i) = 95 +/- 10 nM) and FPRL1 (BB-V-115, K(i) = 270 +/- 51 nM). Each was a selective antagonist in calcium response assays and the most potent small molecule antagonist reported for its respective receptor to date. The duplex assay format reduced assay time, minimized reagent requirements, and provided selectivity information at every screening stage, thus proving to be an efficient means to screen for selective receptor ligand probes.",['2008 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.'],"['Young, Susan M', 'Bologa, Cristian M', 'Fara, Dan', 'Bryant, Bj K', 'Strouse, Juan Jacob', 'Arterburn, Jeffrey B', 'Ye, Richard D', 'Oprea, Tudor I', 'Prossnitz, Eric R', 'Sklar, Larry A', 'Edwards, Bruce S']","['Young SM', 'Bologa CM', 'Fara D', 'Bryant BK', 'Strouse JJ', 'Arterburn JB', 'Ye RD', 'Oprea TI', 'Prossnitz ER', 'Sklar LA', 'Edwards BS']","['University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['R03 MH076381/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 MH076381-01/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 MH074425/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 MH074425-01/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Ras functions as a 'molecular switch' in transduction of signals from the membrane receptors of many growth factors, cytokines, and other second messengers to the cell nucleus. Numerous studies have shown that in multiple malignant tumors and hematopoietic malignancies, faulty signal transduction via the Ras pathway plays a key role in tumorigenesis. In this work, a non-radioactive assay was used to quantify Ras activity in hematologic malignancies. Ras activation was measured in six different cell lines and 24 patient samples, and sequence analysis of N- and K-ras was performed. The 24 patient samples comprised of seven acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) samples, five acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) samples, four myeloproliferative disease (MPD) samples, four lymphoma samples, four juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) samples, and WBC from a healthy donor. The purpose of this study was to compare Ras activity determined by percentage of Ras-GTP with the mutational status of the Ras gene in the hematopoietic cells of the patients. Mutation analysis revealed ras mutations in two of the seven AML samples, one in codon 12 and one in codon 61; ras mutations were also found in two of the four JMML samples, and in one of the four lymphoma samples (codon 12). We found a mean Ras activation of 23.1% in cell lines with known constitutively activating ras mutations, which was significantly different from cell lines with ras wildtype sequence (Ras activation of 4.8%). Two of the five activating ras mutations in the patient samples correlated with increased Ras activation. In the other three samples, Ras was probably activated through ""upstream"" or ""downstream"" mechanisms.",,"['Raepple, D', 'von Lintig, F', 'Zemojtel, T', 'Duchniewicz, M', 'Jung, A', 'Lubbert, M', 'Boss, G R', 'Scheele, J S']","['Raepple D', 'von Lintig F', 'Zemojtel T', 'Duchniewicz M', 'Jung A', 'Lubbert M', 'Boss GR', 'Scheele JS']","['Department of Medicine I, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Hugstetter Str. 55, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Guanosine Diphosphate/analysis', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemistry/etiology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile', 'Lymphoma', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders', 'Oncogenes', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ras Proteins/*analysis/*genetics']",PMC2755762,,2008/09/12 09:00,2009/04/02 09:00,['2008/09/12 09:00'],"['2008/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0593-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Apr;88(4):319-24. doi: 10.1007/s00277-008-0593-6.

Blood lipoprotein particles are either pro- or antiapoptotic. High-density lipoprotein particles are antiapoptotic through sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3-mediated activation of the PI-3-K/Akt pathway. Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4)-very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) increase apoptosis, but the apoE2-VLDL and apoE3-VLDL isoforms do not. As increased B-cell apoptosis favors longer survival of CLL patients, we hypothesized that APOE4 genotype would beneficially influence the clinical course of CLL. We report here that women (but not men) with an APOE4 genotype had markedly longer survival than non-APOE4 patients. VLDL is metabolized to low-density lipoprotein through lipoprotein lipase. Higher levels of lipoprotein lipase mRNA in these CLL patients correlated with shorter survival. The beneficial effect of APOE4 in CLL survival is likely mediated through APOE4 allele-specific regulation of leukemia cell apoptosis. The APOE allele and genotype distribution in these CLL patients is the same as in unaffected control populations, suggesting that although APOE genotype influences CLL outcome and response to therapy, it does not alter susceptibility to developing this disease.",,"['Weinberg, J B', 'Volkheimer, A D', 'Mihovilovic, M', 'Jiang, N', 'Chen, Y', 'Bond, K', 'Moore, J O', 'Gockerman, J P', 'Diehl, L F', 'de Castro, C M', 'Rizzieri, D A', 'Levesque, M C', 'Dekroon, R', 'Strittmatter, W J']","['Weinberg JB', 'Volkheimer AD', 'Mihovilovic M', 'Jiang N', 'Chen Y', 'Bond K', 'Moore JO', 'Gockerman JP', 'Diehl LF', 'de Castro CM', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Levesque MC', 'Dekroon R', 'Strittmatter WJ']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University and VA Medical Centers, Durham, NC 27705, USA. brice@duke.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apolipoprotein E4)', '0 (Cholesterol, VLDL)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Apolipoprotein E4/*genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cholesterol, VLDL/blood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*mortality', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2008/09/12 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2008/09/12 09:00'],"['2008/09/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008241 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.241 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Dec;22(12):2184-92. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.241.

In contrast to the more common oncogenic ABL1 fusion BCR-ABL1, NUP214-ABL1 localizes to the nuclear pore complexes and has attenuated transforming properties in hematopoietic cells and in mouse bone marrow transplant models. We have performed a thorough biochemical comparative analysis of NUP214-ABL1 and BCR-ABL1 and show that, despite their common tyrosine kinase domain, the two fusion proteins differ in many critical catalytic properties. NUP214-ABL1 has lower in vitro tyrosine kinase activity, which is in agreement with the absence of phosphorylation on its activation loop. NUP214-ABL1 was more sensitive to imatinib (Glivec) than BCR-ABL1 in vitro and in cells, indicating a different activation state and conformation of the two ABL1 fusion kinases. Using a peptide array, we identified differences in the spectrum and efficiency of substrate peptide phosphorylation and a differential involvement of Src kinases in downstream signaling. These results clearly indicate that different fusion partners of the same kinase can determine not only localization, but also critical functional properties of the enzyme such as inhibitor sensitivity and substrate preference, with subsequent differences in downstream signaling effectors and likely consequences in disease pathogenesis.",,"['De Keersmaecker, K', 'Versele, M', 'Cools, J', 'Superti-Furga, G', 'Hantschel, O']","['De Keersmaecker K', 'Versele M', 'Cools J', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Hantschel O']","['Department of Molecular and Developmental Genetics, VIB, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (NUP214-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",,,2008/09/12 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2008/09/12 09:00'],"['2008/09/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008242 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.242 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Dec;22(12):2208-16. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.242.

CREB has been demonstrated to be upregulated in the majority of childhood leukemias contributing to disease progression, whereas ICER, its endogenous repressor, was found to be downregulated. Our research focus has been the function of restored ICER expression. ICER exogenously expressed in cell lines decreases CREB protein level and induces a lowered clonogenic potential in vitro. It decreases the ability of HL60 to invade the extramedullary sites and to promote bone marrow angiogenesis in nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient mice, demonstrating its potential effects on tumor progression. ICER represses the majority of 96 target genes upregulated by CREB. It binds CRE promoters and controls gene expression restoring the normal regulation of major cellular pathways. ICER is subjected to degradation through a constitutively active form of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, which drives it to the proteasome. We propose that ICER is downregulated in HL60 to preserve CREB overexpression, which disrupts normal myelopoiesis and promotes blast proliferation. These findings define the function of ICER as a tumor suppressor in leukemia. Unbalanced CREB/ICER expression needs to be considered a pathogenetic feature in leukemogenesis.

However, most patients relapse after an initial clinical response, indicating that drug resistance is a major problem in patients on imatinib. It is a serious problem that effective treatment choices to T315I, in the ABL kinase domain that shows a strong tolerance in imatinib do not exist clinically. In this study, we propose a new therapeutic approach to Ph(+)ALL with the T315I. Here, we report that the serine/threonine kinase mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor, rapamycin, inhibits the growth of not only the Bcr-Abl-positive lymphoid leukemic cell line, SU-Ph2, established from Ph(+)ALL patients, but also the imatinib-resistant cell line, SU/SR, that has acquired T315I. Rapamycin significantly inhibits cell growth in both these cell lines, and easily induces apoptosis at the same dose, thereby acting as an immunosuppressive agent. Our result suggested that the mTOR-signaling pathway has become an important therapeutic target for Ph-positive leukemias in the future, and at the same time, it is also becoming a very effective tool for the treatment of Ph(+)ALL with T315I.",,"['Hirase, Chikara', 'Maeda, Yasuhiro', 'Takai, Shunsuke', 'Kanamaru, Akihisa']","['Hirase C', 'Maeda Y', 'Takai S', 'Kanamaru A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Protein Kinases', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",,,2008/09/12 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2008/09/12 09:00'],"['2008/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00351-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.07.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Mar;33(3):450-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.07.023.

Recurrent defects including chromosomal translocations, aneuploidies, and gene-specific alterations generate molecular subgroups of B- and T-ALL with differing clinical courses and distinct responses to therapy. Recent discoveries arising from genome-wide surveys and adoptive transfer of leukemia-initiating cells have uncovered multiple gene copy number aberrations and have yielded new insight into at least one type of ALL-originating cell. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of ALL has benefited from genetically modified mouse models that recapitulate cellular transformation at specific developmental stages of lymphoid lineage cells.

We have previously shown that a morpholine derivative of doxorubicin (DOXM) appeared to be a more efficient inducer of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells than the parent drug [Czyz, M., Szulawska, A., Bednarek, A.K., Duchler, M., 2005.

In the current study we used this compound in combination with STI571, a front-line drug in therapy of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), to evaluate possible benefits of the combined treatment on the cellular level. Using K562 cells, we analyzed the response of CML cells to low concentrations of DOXM when Bcr-Abl activity was reduced to various levels by its specific inhibitor, STI571. Differentiation was significantly enhanced with the combination of 150 nM STI571 and 100 nM DOXM as compared to the levels obtained with either drug alone. A higher concentration of STI571 was required to diminish Bcr-Abl activity to the level which was sufficient to stimulate apoptotic cell death pathway in K562. Apoptosis induced by 250 nM STI571 was markedly enhanced by DOXM in the combined treatment. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential dissipation and translocation of phosphatydylserine to the outer plasma membrane were increased by 50%. Our results clearly indicate that differentiation and apoptosis, both reducing cellular proliferation, could be substantially enhanced by the combined treatment. We provide experimental evidence implicating that the diversification of cellular effects obtained in the combined treatment employing non-toxic approaches to enhance efficacy of STI571 might be considered as an alternative therapeutic strategy against CML, especially for apoptosis-reluctant cells.",,"['Jakubowska, Justyna', 'Wasowska-Lukawska, Malgorzata', 'Czyz, Malgorzata']","['Jakubowska J', 'Wasowska-Lukawska M', 'Czyz M']","['Department of Molecular Biology of Cancer, Medical University of Lodz, 6/8 Mazowiecka Street, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis']",,,2008/09/11 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/09/11 09:00'],"['2008/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(08)00896-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.08.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2008 Oct 31;596(1-3):41-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.08.021.

METHODS: The activations of NF-kappaB in K562 and K562/A02 cells and the effects of 1 micromol/L Tet on NF-kappaB expression were determined by immunocytochemistry and Western blot assay. RESULTS: Tet had no effect on NF-kappaB expression in K562 cells after 6- and 12-hour treatment (P>0.05), and K562/A02 cells displayed higher level of NF-kappaB protein expression than their parental K562 cells (P<0.01).

CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) like carbamazepine, phenytoin, and oxcarbazepine--as well as non-EIAEDs like valproic acid, levetiracetam, and lamotrigine--are frequently used in patients with GBM. Since CYP3A4 is the major isozyme involved in the metabolism of imatinib, we investigated the influence of EIAEDs on imatinib pharmacokinetics (pk). METHODS: GBM patients received 600 mg imatinib p.o./o.d. in combination with 1.0 g HU p.o./o.d..together with either EIAEDs, non-EIAEDs, or no antiepileptic drug (non-AEDs) comedication. Trough plasma levels of imatinib and its active main metabolite N-desmethyl-imatinib (CGP74588) were determined biweekly in these patients, total 543 samples being collected from 224 patients (up to 6 times / patient). All three groups were compared to each other and with historical pharmacokinetic data obtained from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). RESULTS: Mean imatinib trough levels in patients not receiving AEDs ( 1404 ng/ml, CV 64%) and on non-EIAEDs (1374 ng/ml, CV 46%) were comparable with mean imatinib trough levels of the historical control group of CML patients (1400 ng/ml, CV 50%). Mean trough levels of imatinib were reduced up to 2.9-fold (477 ng/ml, CV 70%) in patients treated with EIAEDs. Only slight, but although significant differences were observed in the mean trough level of the metabolite CGP74588 between EIAED-, non-EIAED and no-AED patients, 240 ng/ml (CV 57%), 351 ng/ml (CV 34%) and 356 ng/ml (CV 52%), respectively. The corresponding mean level for CML patients was 300 ng/ml (CV 50%). CONCLUSION: Significant decreases of imatinib and CGP74588 trough levels were observed for patients receiving EIAEDs. The EIAED-induced reduction in trough imatinib levels can be avoided by switching to non-EIAEDs comedication or compensated by administering higher imatinib doses. In addition these data demonstrate that there is no significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of imatinib between patients with glioblastoma and CML.",,"['Pursche, Stefan', 'Schleyer, Eberhard', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Said, Samir Mustafa', 'Prondzinsky, Roland', 'Illmer, Thomas', 'Wang, Yanfeng', 'Hosius, Christian', 'Nikolova, Zariana', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Dresemann, Gregor']","['Pursche S', 'Schleyer E', 'von Bonin M', 'Ehninger G', 'Said SM', 'Prondzinsky R', 'Illmer T', 'Wang Y', 'Hosius C', 'Nikolova Z', 'Bornhauser M', 'Dresemann G']","['Carl Gustav Carus University, Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United Arab Emirates,Curr Clin Pharmacol,Current clinical pharmacology,101273158,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CGP 74588)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*biosynthesis', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma/complications/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/blood', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/blood', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/blood', 'Seizures/etiology/prevention & control', 'Young Adult']",PMC2748699,,2008/09/11 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/11 09:00'],"['2008/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/157488408785747656 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Clin Pharmacol. 2008 Sep;3(3):198-203. doi: 10.2174/157488408785747656.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In their method, a new feature is added into the current selected feature subset if it will bring in the most extra information. This information is measured by using the distance between the new feature vector and the column space spanned by current feature subset. The incremental forward feature selection scheme can exclude highly linear correlated features that provide redundant information and might degrade the efficiency of learning algorithms. The method is compared with the weight score approach and the 1-norm support vector machine on two well-known microarray gene expression data sets, the acute leukemia and colon cancer data sets. These two data sets have a very few observations but huge number of genes. The linear smooth support vector machine was applied to the feature subsets selected by these three schemes respectively and obtained a slightly better classification results in the 1-norm support vector machine and incremental forward feature selection. Finally, the authors claim that the rest of genes still contain some useful information. The previous selected features are iteratively removed from the data sets and the feature selection and classification steps are repeated for four rounds. The results show that there are many distinct feature subsets that can provide enough information for classification tasks in these two microarray gene expression data sets.",,"['Lee, Yuh-Jye', 'Chang, Chien-Chung', 'Chao, Chia-Huang']","['Lee YJ', 'Chang CC', 'Chao CH']","['Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan. yuh-jye@mail.ntust.edu.tw']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Biopharm Stat,Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics,9200436,,IM,"['Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods']",,,2008/09/11 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/11 09:00'],"['2008/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['902364046 [pii]', '10.1080/10543400802277868 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biopharm Stat. 2008;18(5):827-40. doi: 10.1080/10543400802277868.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A case-control study that included 824 cases and 752 hospital controls aged 18-75 years was conducted. Cases were newly diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's or Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or lymphoproliferative syndrome (LPS). Controls were matched with the cases by gender, age, and center. RESULTS: Overall, smoking was not related to LN. However, average tobacco consumption tended to be inversely related to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), LPS, and the hairy cell leukemia (HCL) subtype, with a significant negative trend for the latter (OR of 0.4, 0.2, 0.1 for consumptions of <or=10, 11-20, >20 cig/day). An inverse association between 'ever drinking' and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL: OR = 0.5 [0.3-0.8]) and NHL (OR = 0.7 [0.5-1.0]) was evidenced and restricted to the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtype, with significant negative trends. The controls' smoking and drinking habits were similar to those of French population. The results remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors and when smoking and drinking were both included in the models. CONCLUSION: Results are consistent with those of several previous studies and suggest a direct or indirect protective effect of smoking with respect to HCL although based on small numbers.

METHODS: CvL cytotoxicity was evaluated in mammalian tumor cells and in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes by the MTT assay using the same range of concentrations (1-150 microg ml(-1)). The mechanisms involved in K562 cell death were investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and immunoblot. RESULTS: CvL inhibited the growth of human leukemia cells, with IC(50) values of 70 and 100 microg ml(-1) for K562 and JURKAT cells, respectively, but it was ineffective on blood lymphocytes and solid tumor cell lines. K562 cell death occurred 72 h after exposure to the lectin and with signs of apoptosis, as analyzed by DAPI and annexin V/PI staining. Investigation of the possible mediators of this process showed that cell death occurred via a caspase-independent pathway. Confocal fluorescence microscopy indicated a pivotal role for the lysosomal protease cathepsin B in mediating cell death. Accordingly, pre-incubation of K562 cells with the cathepsin inhibitor L-trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64) abolished CvL cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, we found upregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and down-modulation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) expression in CvL-treated cells. These effects were accompanied by increased levels of p21 and reduced expression of pRb, suggesting that CvL can induce cell cycle arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings indicate an antileukemic effect for CvL and suggest that cathepsin B acts as a death mediator in CvL-induced cytotoxicity possibly in an uncharacterized connection with the membrane death receptor pathway.",,"['Queiroz, Alexandre F S', 'Silva, Rodrigo A', 'Moura, Raniere M', 'Dreyfuss, Juliana L', 'Paredes-Gamero, Edgar J', 'Souza, Ana C S', 'Tersariol, Ivarne L S', 'Santos, Elizeu A', 'Nader, Helena B', 'Justo, Giselle Z', 'de Sales, Mauricio P']","['Queiroz AF', 'Silva RA', 'Moura RM', 'Dreyfuss JL', 'Paredes-Gamero EJ', 'Souza AC', 'Tersariol IL', 'Santos EA', 'Nader HB', 'Justo GZ', 'de Sales MP']","['Departamento de Biofisica e Farmacologia, Centro de Biociencias, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, CEP 59072-970, Natal, RN, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lectins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clione/*chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Lectins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects']",,,2008/09/11 09:00,2009/04/18 09:00,['2008/09/11 09:00'],"['2008/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-008-0825-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2009 May;63(6):1023-33. doi: 10.1007/s00280-008-0825-4.

Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are at a risk of developing blastic crisis (BC) even after the emergence of imatinib mesylate. In this study, to determine the relevance of BMI-1 to BC, we investigated the expression of BMI-1 in CD34(+) cells at each of the chronic phase (CP), the accelerated phase (AP), and BC by flow cytometry. Interestingly, the level of BMI-1 expression was significantly higher in CP than in controls and was further increased during the course of the disease progression (control--5.66%; CP--36.93%; AP and BC--76.41%). Curiously, mRNA levels for BMI-1 were almost consistent during the disease progression from CP to BC (control--2.21; CP--9.77; AP and BC--9.70 (BMI-1/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ratio)). Since we further found that overexpression of BCR-ABL in human embryonic kidney-293 cells enhanced BMI-1 expression and that BMI-1 expression was increased in K562 cells, derived from patients with BC, in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors, BMI-1 was presumed to be positively regulated by BCR-ABL and further by posttranscriptional modification in the course of the disease progression.

The aim of this study was to investigate this region to gain insight into the role of 1q genes in intracranial paediatric ependymoma. To address this issue we generated profiles of eleven ependymoma, including two relapse pairs and seven primary tumours, using comparative genome hybridisation and serial analysis of gene expression. Analysis of 656 SAGE tags mapping to 1q identified CHI3L1 and S100A10 as the most upregulated genes in the relapse pair with de novo 1q gain upon recurrence. Moreover, three more members of the S100 family had distinct gene expression profiles in ependymoma. Candidates (CHI3L1, S100A10, S100A4, S100A6 and S100A2) were validated using immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray of 74 paediatric ependymoma. In necrotic cases, CHI3L1 demonstrated a distinct staining pattern in tumour cells adjacent to the areas of necrosis. S100A6 significantly correlated with supratentorial tumours (P<0.001) and S100A4 with patients under the age of 3 years at diagnosis (P=0.038). In conclusion, this study provides evidence that S100A6 and S100A4 are differentially expressed in clinically relevant subgroups, and also demonstrates a link between CHI3L1 protein expression and necrosis in intracranial paediatric ependymoma.",,"['Rand, V', 'Prebble, E', 'Ridley, L', 'Howard, M', 'Wei, W', 'Brundler, M-A', 'Fee, B E', 'Riggins, G J', 'Coyle, B', 'Grundy, R G']","['Rand V', 'Prebble E', 'Ridley L', 'Howard M', 'Wei W', 'Brundler MA', 'Fee BE', 'Riggins GJ', 'Coyle B', 'Grundy RG']","[""Children's Brain Tumour Research Centre, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2UH, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (S100 Proteins)']",IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Ependymoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'S100 Proteins/*genetics']",PMC2567087,,2008/09/11 09:00,2008/10/17 09:00,['2008/09/11 09:00'],"['2008/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['6604651 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6604651 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2008 Oct 7;99(7):1136-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604651.

It is important that accurate assessments of renal function are carried out consistently across clinical centres, a view supported by recently published British Nuclear Medicine Society (BNMS) guidelines for measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These guidelines recommend the use of a radioisotope method for GFR determination, with between two and five blood samples taken starting 2 h after radioisotope injection and application of the Brochner-Mortensen (BM) correction factor. To study the likely impact of these guidelines, we have investigated current practices of measuring GFR in all 21 Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) paediatric oncology centres in the United Kingdom. This information was used to evaluate the potential impact on renal function-based carboplatin dosing using raw 51Cr-EDTA clearance data from 337 GFR tests carried out in children with cancer. A questionnaire survey revealed that between two and four samples were taken after isotope administration, with BM and Chantler corrections used in 38% (8/21) and 28% (6/21) of centres, respectively. A change from Chantler to BM correction, based on the BNMS guidelines, would result in a > 10% decrease in carboplatin dose in at least 15% of patients and a > 25% decrease in 2% of patients. A greater proportion of patients would have an alteration in carboplatin dose when centres not using any correction factor implement the BM correction. The increase in estimated 51Cr-EDTA half-life observed by omitting the I h sample decreases carboplatin dose by > 10% in 23-52% of patients and by > 25% in 3% of patients. This study highlights current variations in renal function measurement between clinical centres and the potential impact on carboplatin dosing.

Negative outcomes place the parent and child at risk for experiencing anxiety years after the illness is treated.

METHODS: We used period analysis to assess trends in 5- and 10-year survival in US patients younger than 15 years of age at diagnosis with four hematologic malignancies--acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma--over three recent 5-year intervals, 1990-1994, 1995-1999, and 2000-2004, using data on a total of 6957 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Expected survival for 2005-2009 was estimated by modeling from trends in the preceding intervals. RESULTS: Major improvements in 5- and 10-year relative survival between 1990-1994 and 2000-2004 were seen for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (from 80.2% to 87.5% and from 73.4% to 83.8%, respectively), acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (from 41.9% to 59.9% and from 38.7% to 59.1%, respectively), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (from 76.6% to 87.7% and from 73.0% to 86.9%, respectively). For those diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, 5- and 10-year survival rates for the 1990-1994 period were 96.1% and 94.4%, respectively, and these rates did not change substantially in the later time periods. Projected 10-year survival rates for children diagnosed in the 2005-2009 period were 88.0% for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 63.9% for acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia, 90.6% for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 94.3% for Hodgkin lymphoma.

In this study, we identified functional and physical interaction of GATA-1 with components of the positive transcriptional elongation factor P-TEFb, a complex containing cyclin T1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9). Megakaryocytic induction was associated with dynamic changes in endogenous P-TEFb composition, including recruitment of GATA-1 and dissociation of HEXIM1, a Cdk9 inhibitor. shRNA knockdowns and pharmacologic inhibition both confirmed contribution of Cdk9 activity to megakaryocytic differentiation. In mice with megakaryocytic GATA-1 deficiency, Cdk9 inhibition produced a fulminant but reversible megakaryoblastic disorder reminiscent of the transient myeloproliferative disorder of Down syndrome.

We observed that it is occasionally up-regulated during treatment. To understand the impact of this on the potential effectiveness of anti-CD20 immunotherapy, we studied 237 CD10(+) pediatric BCP-ALL patients with Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-type therapy. We analyzed CD20 expression changes from diagnosis to end-induction, focusing on sample pairs with more than or equal to 0.1% residual leukemic blasts, and assessed complement-induced cytotoxicity by CD20-targeting with rituximab in vitro. CD20-positivity significantly increased from 45% in initial samples to 81% at end-induction (day 15, 71%). The levels of expression also increased; 52% of cases at end-induction had at least 90% CD20(pos) leukemic cells, as opposed to 5% at diagnosis (day 15, 20%). CD20 up-regulation was frequent in high-risk patients, patients with high minimal residual disease at end-induction, and patients who suffered later from relapse, but not in TEL/AML1 cases. Notably, up-regulation occurred in viable cells sustaining chemotherapy. In vitro, CD20 up-regulation significantly enhanced rituximab cytotoxicity and could be elicited on prednisolone incubation. In conclusion, CD20 up-regulation is frequently induced in BCP-ALL during induction, and this translates into an acquired state of higher sensitivity to rituximab.

However, the molecular pathways downstream of BLNK are currently unclear. Utilizing pre-B leukemia cell lines (BKO84 and others) derived from BLNK-deficient mice as in vitro models of the pre-B cell differentiation, we have demonstrated that reconstitution of BLNK as well as an active form of protein kinase C (PKC)eta induces the differentiation events, such as pre-BCR down-regulation and kappa gene rearrangement. Here we show that the same events are induced by cross-linking of pre-BCR with anti-mu antibody in these pre-B cell lines, as well as in ex vivo pre-B cells from BLNK-deficient mice, suggesting a function of BLNK as an internal cross-linker of pre-BCR. Anti-mu treatment of BKO84 cells up-regulated membrane recruitment of PKC eta and the expression of IRF-4, a transcription factor known to promote light chain gene rearrangements. Anti-mu induction of surface kappa chain on BKO84 cells was blocked by reagents that inhibit phospholipase C or PKC. Enforced expression of the active PKC eta in BKO84 cells resulted in up-regulation of IRF-4 expression. Conversely, siRNA-mediated silencing of PKC eta expression strikingly attenuated the anti-mu-induced IRF-4 expression and kappa gene rearrangement, which were restored by PKC eta reconstitution. Finally, enforced expression of IRF-4, but not of BLNK, in the PKC eta-silenced BKO84 cells resulted in kappa gene rearrangement. These results indicate that PKC eta directs the induction of IRF-4 expression downstream of BLNK in the pre-BCR signaling pathway promoting kappa gene rearrangement.",,"['Oda, Akihisa', 'Ono, Tomohiro', 'Yamamoto, Mutsumi', 'Goitsuka, Ryo', 'Kitamura, Daisuke']","['Oda A', 'Ono T', 'Yamamoto M', 'Goitsuka R', 'Kitamura D']","['Division of Molecular Biology, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-0022, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (protein kinase C eta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/metabolism', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', '*Transcriptional Activation/immunology']",,,2008/09/11 09:00,2009/08/06 09:00,['2008/09/11 09:00'],"['2008/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['dxn101 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxn101 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2008 Nov;20(11):1417-26. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxn101.

The patients were diagnosed according to WHO criteria from 1989 until 2006. The aim was to check how well fared the patients, the majority of whom was not included into clinical trials, in real life. Of 140 evaluable patients, 97 (69.3%) attained complete remission (CR). The projected overall survival (OS) 4 years after diagnosis was 58.9%, and 55.3% at 6 years. In 8 patients (6.0%), no antileukemic therapy at all was given (either they died shortly after admission to the ward or therapy was not feasible due to their clinical status). Of 125 patients with documented commencement of some kind of therapy, 96 (76.8%) achieved CR. Of 102 patients with induction treatment with a combination of anthracycline and tretinoin (ATRA), 84 individuals (82.4%) attained CR (typically, this cohort might have been subjected to clinical trials). This result was better than that of patients treated by chemotherapy only (n = 15; CR 46.7%; P = 0.003) or by ATRA monotherapy (n = 13; CR 62.5%; P = 0.17). Another parameter with a significant impact on attaining CR was the leukocyte (WBC) count at diagnosis: its median values in patients achieving and not achieving CR were 2.1 and 24.0 x 10(9)/l, respectively (P < 0.0001). The WBC counts affected OS as well (P = 0.0001). However, when only patients after attaining CR were evaluated, the initial WBC counts no longer affected OS (P = 0.18). Achieving CR was also influenced by the performance status (PS) 0-1 (P = 0.005), which was in turn closely correlated to WBC counts (P = 0.0006). Additional factors (most likely connected with leukocytosis) influenced attaining CR with borderline statistical significance: e.g. FAB M3v morphology, LDH serum level, fibrinogen level, presence of internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FLT3 gene (which was strongly associated with leukocytosis and also with the short PML/RARalpha transcript resulting from the bcr3 break in the PML gene). It may be speculated that FLT3-ITD is just one of the possible factors that lead to leukocytosis. The platelet counts at diagnosis had no impact on entering CR. Thus, we have not validated the current PETHEMA risk stratification in distinguishing intertermediate and low risk patients. Our study points to a significant difference of the results obtained in real life and of the results that could be achieved in patients who were fit to enter clinical trials. Among the prognostic factors, the most important one was the WBC count, the PS (which is highly affected by the WBC count), and feasibility of administration of the most potent induction therapy with anthracyclines and ATRA.",,"['Schwarz, J', 'Koristek, Z', 'Stary, J', 'Zak, P', 'Kozak, T', 'Markova, J', 'Michalova, K', 'Dvorakova, D', 'Mayer, J', 'Cetkovsky, P']","['Schwarz J', 'Koristek Z', 'Stary J', 'Zak P', 'Kozak T', 'Markova J', 'Michalova K', 'Dvorakova D', 'Mayer J', 'Cetkovsky P']",['Klinicky usek Ustavu hematologie a krevni transfuze Praha. jiri.schwarz@uhkt.cz'],['cze'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",,,2008/09/11 09:00,2008/10/03 09:00,['2008/09/11 09:00'],"['2008/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2008 Jul-Aug;54(7-8):757-70.,,,,Lecba akutni promyelorytarni leukemie v Cesku: vysledky a analyza prognostickych faktoru.,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are still many patients with progressive disease with leukocytosis at presentation. These are at greater risk of early death due to bleeding (often intracranial), or, less frequently, due to thrombotic complications. In Czechia, we have, in some instances, noted an unacceptably long time from the first symptoms to diagnosis and to administration of the highly specific differentiation therapy with tretinoin (ATRA) along with anthracycline chemotherapy. This combination is highly efficient--cures are seen in some 70% of patients. Therefore, we present a diagnostic minimum for each and every internist, and even better for every general practician, to get acquainted with. All cases of pancytopenia and consumption coagulopathy should be suspected of APL and referred to a specialized hematologist without any delay. In the following more detailed review of diagnostic measures, much attention is given to APL morphology, which is the first clue leading to diagnosis. The finding of the typical hypergranular FAB M3 morphology and of cells with bundles of Auer rods (""faggot cells""), along with the HLA-DR, CD33+ immunophenotype, is highly (but not absolutely) specific for APL. In cases of the micro-/hypo-granular variant FAB M3v Form, and whenever APL cannot be ruled out with certainty, a test to prove the presence of the PML/RARalpha fusion gene is indicated, using either RT-PCR or, eventually, immunological demonstration of the specific distribution of the PML protein in the cell nucleus. Given that morphology of APL cases, as defined according to WHO criteria (95% of which carry the PML/RARalpha fusion gene), admits extremely divergent morphological pictures ofthe variant forms, we recommend these investigations to be performed in every case of de novo acute myeloid leukemia.

Starting 1972, heparin was introduced into a treatment of coagulopathy and the intensity of substitutional transfusion therapy was remarkably enhanced. The main breakthrough was the initiation of differentiation therapy using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The first clinical study which brought information about the effect of ATRA in APL started in China in 1986. A number of the most important subsequent studies focused on pathogenesis and therapy of APL are analyzed and reviewed. The additional considerable finding was the discovery of arsenic trioxide (ATO) therapeutic efficacy in APL and ATO is now in particular used for a therapy of relapsed APL.

However, it is uneasy to identify with certainty the cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) among the historical descriptions ofchloroma since 1823. In part, this is due to confusion produced by the historical cytological nomenclature--in practice, the leukemic promyelocytes were regarded, quite inaccurately, as a subtype of paramyeloblasts until early 1960's. The term promyelocytic leukemia first appeared in Naegeli's text-book in 1931. However, no clinical associations of the morphological description were then given. As a clinico-pathological entity, APLwas defined by Hillestad in Norway in 1957 and on a more detailed level, by Bernard et al in France in 1959. However, the descriptions of chloroma by Butterfield in 1909 and of leukemia with panmyelophthisis and defibrination by Risak in 1935 in the German-written literature and the case of chloroma described by Libansky in Czech in 1939 were cases of APL with high probability. Further on, experimental studies leading to the postulation of possible differentiation-inducing therapy of leukemia are reviewed--the importance of introducing of clonal culture of hematopoietic cells in the 1960's and the proof of the possibility of bypassing the maturation block in the works of Sachs's group in Rehovot, Israel, is stressed, as well as the later experiments with differentiation inducers in the cell line models in the 1970's and 1980's. The first trials with retinoids in therapy of APL are mentioned, along with the interesting background of the French-Chinese collaboration (under the auspices of professors Degos and Wang) in the introduction of retinoids into practice in the second half of the 1980's. It is discussed how the success of the clinical trials led to enormous progression in the field of molecular genetics of APL, which, in turn, led to development of a new generation of remedies, i.e. to the renaissance of arsenic in the treatment of APL in the 1990's, among others thanks to the current Chinese minister of health, Chen Zhu.",,"['Schwarz, J']",['Schwarz J'],['Klinicky isek Ostavu hematologie a krevnitransfuze Praha. jiri.schwarz@uhkt.cz'],['cze'],,"['English Abstract', 'Historical Article', 'Introductory Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,,IM,"['History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*history/therapy', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/*history/therapy']",,,2008/09/11 09:00,2008/10/03 09:00,['2008/09/11 09:00'],"['2008/09/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2008 Jul-Aug;54(7-8):686-700.,,,,Od chloromu k akutni promyelocytarni leukemil--pohledy do historie.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib was first approved by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) in January 2002 with the recommendation that its use be audited. The cost of the drug has major financial implications for health resources. METHODS: All imatinib usage since its first prescription in Scotland in September 2000 to July 2003 was audited through pharmacy records and through the Scotland Leukaemia Registry (SLR), an existing national registry of patients with CML. RESULTS: One hundred and four patients in Chronic Phase (CP), 36 in Accelerated Phase (AP) and five in Blast Phase (BP) received imatinib. The median duration of therapy was not reached for CFP 17 months for AFP and two months for BP patients. Major (complete) cytogenetic response rates were 74% (63%) and 38% (24%) respectively for CP and APR Overall survival for all CP patients from the start of imatinib therapy was 94% at one year, 91% at two years and 83% at three years. An audit of the effectiveness of the SLR as an auditing agency, showed complete registration in 95% of cases.

Experimental approaches of immunotherapy aiming at induction of systemic T-cell responses have been developed. Trioma cells provide a potent vaccine derived from malignant B cells that allows multiple antigens (Ags) from the parental tumor to be ingested by Ag-presenting cells. Like other strategies using modified whole tumor cells, this approach induces polyvalent responses. Using trioma cell-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) for T-cell activation in vitro, we asked whether specific Ags overexpressed by CLL can be identified as target structures of such responses and what is the nature of these Ags. Expression levels of several genes in CLL samples were quantitated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. T lymphocytes were polyvalently stimulated by trioma-pulsed DCs and specificities were tested by determining cytokine secretion in the presence of target cells transfected with RNA coding for those Ags that were found to be overexpressed. We demonstrate that DCs pulsed with the modified tumor cells efficiently activate T lymphocytes against CLL and that overexpressed Ags related to leukemogenesis, such as BCL-2, MDM2, and ETV5, serve as targets for those T cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Included are 268 patients (age <or= 18 years) with AML in second complete remission (n = 142), relapse (n = 90), or primary induction failure (n = 36) at transplantation. All patients received bone marrow grafts from an unrelated donor and a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Cox regression models were constructed to identify risk factors that influence outcome after transplantation. RESULTS: In this analysis, the only risk factor that predicted leukemia recurrence and overall and leukemia-free survival was disease status at transplantation. The 5-year probabilities of leukemia-free survival were 45%, 20%, and 12% for patients who underwent transplantation at second complete remission, relapse, and primary induction failure, respectively. As expected, risk of acute but not chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was lower with T-cell-depleted bone marrow grafts; T-cell-depleted grafts were not associated with higher risks of leukemia recurrence. We observed similar risks of leukemia relapse in patients with and without acute and chronic GVHD. CONCLUSION: Children who underwent transplantation in remission had a superior outcome compared with children who underwent transplantation during relapse or persistent disease. Nevertheless, 20% of children who underwent transplantation in relapse are long-term survivors, suggesting that unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation is an effective therapy in a significant proportion of children with recurrent or primary refractory AML.",,"['Bunin, Nancy J', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Camitta, Bruce M', 'DeSantes, Kenneth B', 'Goyal, Rakesh K', 'Kapoor, Neena', 'Kernan, Nancy A', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Eapen, Mary']","['Bunin NJ', 'Davies SM', 'Aplenc R', 'Camitta BM', 'DeSantes KB', 'Goyal RK', 'Kapoor N', 'Kernan NA', 'Rosenthal J', 'Smith FO', 'Eapen M']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, USA.""]",['eng'],"['U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Donors']",PMC2653120,,2008/09/10 09:00,2008/09/23 09:00,['2008/09/10 09:00'],"['2008/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/26/4326 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.16.4442 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Sep 10;26(26):4326-32. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.16.4442.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent studies demonstrated that PV, ET, and PMF are clonal disorders of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. In 2005, a somatic activating mutation in the JAK2 nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (JAK2V617F) was identified in most patients with PV and in a significant proportion of patients with ET and PMF. Subsequent studies identified additional mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway in some patients with JAK2V617F(-) MPD, suggesting that constitutive activation of this signaling pathway is a unifying feature of these disorders. Although the discovery of mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway is important from a pathogenetic and diagnostic perspective, important questions remain regarding the role of this single disease allele in 3 related but clinically distinct disorders, and the role of additional genetic events in MPD disease pathogenesis. In addition, these observations provide a foundation for development of small molecule inhibitors of JAK2 that are currently being tested in clinical trials. This review will discuss our understanding of the pathogenesis of PV, ET, and PMF, the potential role of JAK2-targeted therapy, and the important unanswered questions that need to be addressed to improve clinical outcome.",,"['Levine, Ross L', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Levine RL', 'Gilliland DG']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA. leviner@mskcc.org']",['eng'],['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/*etiology/genetics/history', 'Polycythemia Vera', 'Primary Myelofibrosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytosis']",PMC2962533,,2008/09/10 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/09/10 09:00'],"['2008/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59840-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-077966 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 15;112(6):2190-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-03-077966.,,100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, partitioning overall variability into interoccasion variability (IOV) and interindividual variability (IIV) allows a better assessment of the clinical importance of exposure variability. The IOV characterizes the dose-to-dose variability in exposure within a subject and is likely to be less clinically relevant than IIV for chronically administered drugs as the effect of IOV averages out over repeated dosing. The main aims of this model-based analysis were (1) to characterize the IOV and IIV of dasatinib, a novel, orally administered, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases that is indicated for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and (2) to demonstrate using simulated data that it is possible to estimate IIV and IOV in relative bioavailability (F(R)) of an orally administered drug, given an adequate sampling scheme. Variability in dasatinib exposure was estimated to be mainly due to IOV in F(R) (44% coefficient of variation [CV]) and, to a lesser extent, due to IIV in F(R) and IIV in clearance (32% and 25% CV, respectively). The IIV is expected to be more clinically relevant than IOV for chronically administered oral drugs such as dasatinib, as the overall variability in cumulative exposure will be mainly due to IIV. The analysis of simulated data demonstrated that models ignoring either IIV or IOV in F(R) resulted in upwardly biased estimates of interindividual or residual variability. Thus, it may be important to account for both IIV and IOV in F(R), particularly for orally administered agents that exhibit absorption-related variability in exposure.",,"['Dai, Guowei', 'Pfister, Marc', 'Blackwood-Chirchir, Anne', 'Roy, Amit']","['Dai G', 'Pfister M', 'Blackwood-Chirchir A', 'Roy A']","['Strategic Modeling & Simulation Group, Discovery Medicine & Clinical Pharmacology, Route 206 & Province Line Rd, Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D, Princeton, NJ 08543, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Dasatinib', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,,2008/09/10 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/10 09:00'],"['2008/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['0091270008320604 [pii]', '10.1177/0091270008320604 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2008 Nov;48(11):1254-69. doi: 10.1177/0091270008320604.

Benzene can be bioactivated to toxic metabolites such as 1,4 benzoquinone (BQ), which can alter signaling pathways and affect chromosomal integrity. BQ has been shown to increase the activity of c-Myb, which is an important transcription factor involved in hematopoiesis, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. The c-Myb protein has also been shown to increase topoisomerase IIalpha (Topo IIalpha) promoter activity specifically in cell lines with hematopoietic origin. Topo IIalpha is a critical nuclear enzyme that removes torsional strain by cleaving, untangling and religating double-stranded DNA. Since Topo IIalpha mediates DNA strand breaks, aberrant Topo IIalpha activity or increased protein levels may increase the formation of DNA strand breaks, leaving the cell susceptible to mutational events. We hypothesized that BQ can increase c-Myb activity, which in turn increases Topo IIalpha promoter activity resulting in increased DNA strand breaks. Using luciferase reporter assays in K-562 cells we demonstrated that BQ (25 and 37microM) exposure caused an increase in c-Myb activity after 24h. Contradictory to previous findings, overexpression of exogenous c-Myb or a polypeptide consisting of c-Myb's DNA binding domain (DBD), which competitively inhibits the binding of endogenous c-Myb to DNA, did not affect Topo IIalpha promoter activity. However, BQ (37microM for 24h) exposure caused a significant increase in Topo IIalpha promoter activity, which could be blocked by the overexpression of the DBD polypeptide, suggesting that BQ exposure increases Topo IIalpha promoter activity through the c-Myb signaling pathway.",,"['Singh, Roopam', 'Winn, Louise M']","['Singh R', 'Winn LM']","[""Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Benzoquinones/*toxicity', 'DNA Breaks/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Environmental Pollutants/toxicity', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, myb/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,,2008/09/10 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/09/10 09:00'],"['2008/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0027-5107(08)00181-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2008.08.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2008 Oct 14;645(1-2):33-8. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2008.08.007.

At maturity, three lymphocyte subsets: CD3(-) CD56(+), CD3(+) CD56(-) and CD3(+) CD56(+), constitute the bulk of the CIK cell culture. The CD3(-) CD56(+) subset behaves like classical natural killer (NK) cells where cytotoxicity is potentiated by blocking the human leucocyte antigen Class I molecules in the AML targets. Both the CD3(+) CD56(+) and CD3(+) CD56(-) subsets, though known to kill autologous and allogeneic targets to a comparable degree and therefore non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted, nevertheless require the presence of the MHC molecule on the target, which interacts with their CD3-T-cell receptor complex. Although CIK cells are often termed 'NK-like' T cells, we have demonstrated that the well-characterized NK receptors KIR, NKG2C/E, NKG2D and DNAM-1 are not involved in the process of AML recognition for the CD3(+) CD56(-) and CD3(+) CD56(+) subsets. The CD3(+) CD56(+) and CD3(+) CD56(-) subsets express a polyclonal and comparable TCRVbeta repertoire in a Gaussian distribution. The CD3(+) CD56(+) subset kills AML targets more efficiently than its CD3(+) CD56(-) counterpart because of the presence of a higher proportion of CD8(+) cells. The CD3(+) CD56(+) subset comprise more terminally differentiated late effector T cells that bear the CD27(+) CD28(-) or CD27(-) CD28(-) phenotype, with a higher granzyme A content. In comparison, the phenotype of the CD3(+) CD56(-) subset is consistent with early effector T cells that are CD27(+) CD28(+) and CD62L(+), known to be less cytotoxic but possess greater proliferative potential.",,"['Linn, Yeh C', 'Lau, Siew Kee J', 'Liu, Bee H', 'Ng, Lee H', 'Yong, Hao X', 'Hui, Kam M']","['Linn YC', 'Lau SK', 'Liu BH', 'Ng LH', 'Yong HX', 'Hui KM']","['Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2669823,,2008/09/10 09:00,2009/06/17 09:00,['2008/09/10 09:00'],"['2008/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['IMM2910 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02910.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2009 Mar;126(3):423-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02910.x.

Early treatment initiation in patients with IFIs has a profound impact on mortality rates, but reliable diagnostic measures are lacking. This situation has led to the parallel use of different treatment strategies, e.g. prophylaxis, empirical and pre-emptive treatment, as well as targeted treatment in response to a definite diagnosis of IFI. Identifying high-risk patients is the first step in reducing IFI-related mortality. Patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis comprise (i) those with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) during remission induction chemotherapy; (ii) patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); (iii) recipients of solid organ transplants; and (iv) those with other conditions of severe and prolonged immunosuppression. Patients at high risk of invasive candidiasis are less well defined. Risk factors are diverse and include haematological malignancy, neutropenia, age <1 month or >65 years, and recent abdominal surgery. The individual risk further depends on the presence of a variety of other risk factors, including central venous catheters, use of broad spectrum antibacterials, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay, total parenteral nutrition, mucosal Candida spp. colonization and renal failure.Extensive research has been conducted to facilitate the best possible treatment strategies for these severe infections. Optimal timing and choice of antifungal agents largely remain a matter of controversy. After having reviewed the major clinical trials, we conclude that comparisons between different treatment strategies cannot be made, neither at present nor in the near future. The complexity of the clinical problem leads to an eclectic treatment approach to reduce morbidity and mortality from IFIs without compromising tolerability. We recommend prophylaxis with posaconazole for allogeneic HSCT recipients, patients receiving induction chemotherapy for AML or MDS, and those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy for graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic HSCT. For the empirical treatment of persistently febrile neutropenia, caspofungin is our first- and liposomal amphotericin B deoxycholate (LAmB) our second-line choice. Once a diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis has been established, voriconazole should be the preferred treatment option, with LAmB being an alternative. Fluconazole prophylaxis for invasive candidiasis should remain restricted to high-risk ICU patients. Once a diagnosis has been established, the drug of choice for adequate treatment depends largely on neutrophil count and haemodynamic stability. In non-neutropenic patients, an echinocandin should be considered the first-line treatment option, while patients with susceptible Candida spp. may be switched to fluconazole. In neutropenic patients, caspofungin or micafungin might be preferred to anidulafungin as first-line treatment. LAmB is a second-line treatment option in both settings.Early diagnosis of IFIs is imperative to facilitate treatment success. In all patients at risk for IFIs, blood cultures, galactomannan antigen and diagnostic imaging should be rigorously enforced.",,"['Ruping, Maria J G T', 'Vehreschild, Jorg J', 'Cornely, Oliver A']","['Ruping MJ', 'Vehreschild JJ', 'Cornely OA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Clinical Trials Unit Infectious Diseases II, Hospital of the University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Candidiasis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Critical Care', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Risk']",,,2008/09/10 09:00,2009/01/17 09:00,['2008/09/10 09:00'],"['2008/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['68142 [pii]', '10.2165/00003495-200868140-00002 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2008;68(14):1941-62. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200868140-00002.,,141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PEGylation changes the physical and chemical properties of the biomedical molecule, such as its conformation, electrostatic binding, and hydrophobicity, and results in an improvement in the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug. In general, PEGylation improves drug solubility and decreases immunogenicity. PEGylation also increases drug stability and the retention time of the conjugates in blood, and reduces proteolysis and renal excretion, thereby allowing a reduced dosing frequency. In order to benefit from these favorable pharmacokinetic consequences, a variety of therapeutic proteins, peptides, and antibody fragments, as well as small molecule drugs, have been PEGylated. This paper reviews the chemical procedures and the conditions that have been used thus far to achieve PEGylation of biomedical molecules. It also discusses the importance of structure and size of PEGs, as well as the behavior of linear and branched PEGs. A number of properties of the PEG polymer--e.g. mass, number of linking chains, the molecular site of PEG attachment--have been shown to affect the biological activity and bioavailability of the PEGylated product. Releasable PEGs have been designed to slowly release the native protein from the conjugates into the blood, aiming at avoiding any loss of efficacy that may occur with stable covalent PEGylation. Since the first PEGylated drug was developed in the 1970s, PEGylation of therapeutic proteins has significantly improved the treatment of several chronic diseases, including hepatitis C, leukemia, severe combined immunodeficiency disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn disease.

In this study, we use olfactory bulb neurons as a useful model, which undergo strong neurogenesis throughout adulthood. Our research demonstrated that low level of STAT3 expression facilitates the terminal differentiation of olfactory bulb neurons as well as induces the generation of neurons from neural stem cells, which can be potentially used in future therapies. On the contrary, activation of STAT3 expression is essential to the maintenance of stem-like status in olfactory cells. This activation can be manipulated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of cytosolic tyrosine kinases.

Their involvement in myelomonocytic leukemia, however, is still unclear. Therefore, the expression and function of C/EBPs in myelomonocytic cells with MLL-fusion genes were investigated. Retinoic acid (RA) induced monocytic differentiation in the myelomonocytic cell lines with MLL-fusion genes, THP-1, MOLM-14 and HF-6 cells, accompanied by monocytic differentiation with the upregulation of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPepsilon. Monocytic differentiation by RA treatment was confirmed in primary AML cells using a clonogenic assay. When the activity of C/EBPalpha or C/EBPepsilon was introduced into HF-6 cells, their cellular growth was arrested through differentiation into monocytes with the concomitant marked downregulation of Myc. Cebpe mRNA was upregulated by the induction of C/EBPalpha-ER, but not vice versa, thus suggesting that C/EBPepsilon may have an important function in the differentiation process. Introduction of Myc isoforms into HF-6 cells partially antagonized the C/EBPs effects. These findings suggest that the ectopic expression of C/EBPepsilon, as well as C/EBPalpha, can induce the monocytic differentiation of myelomonocytic leukemic cells with MLL-fusion gene through the downregulation of Myc, thus providing insight into the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",,"['Matsushita, H', 'Nakajima, H', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Tsukamoto, H', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Jin, G', 'Yabe, M', 'Asai, S', 'Ono, R', 'Nosaka, T', 'Sugita, K', 'Morimoto, A', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Hotta, T', 'Ando, K', 'Miyachi, H']","['Matsushita H', 'Nakajima H', 'Nakamura Y', 'Tsukamoto H', 'Tanaka Y', 'Jin G', 'Yabe M', 'Asai S', 'Ono R', 'Nosaka T', 'Sugita K', 'Morimoto A', 'Hayashi Y', 'Hotta T', 'Ando K', 'Miyachi H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan. hmatsu@is.icc.u-tokai.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2008/09/09 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/09 09:00'],"['2008/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008285 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.285 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Dec 4;27(53):6749-60. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.285.

Both processes require the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Expression of AID is largely restricted to GC B cells and B cells that undergo class switch recombination outside the GC. AID is also expressed in many B-cell lymphomas. This study investigates the expression of AID of malignant lymphomas infiltrating the bone marrow. Bone marrow trephines (n=130) with infiltration of Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma of B cell and T-cell type and trephines with reactive lymphoid follicles (n=16) were analyzed immunohistochemically for AID protein. AID is expressed in bone marrow infiltrates of malignant lymphomas. AID was generally detected in lymphomas of GC origin. Tumor cells of hairy cell leukemia are mostly AID. There is apparently no different expression of AID found in bone marrow infiltrates of malignant lymphomas compared with a control group with nodal malignant lymphoma infiltrates (n=105). These results suggest that the expression pattern of AID in lymphoma infiltrates in the bone marrow reflects that of extramedullary lymphoma infiltrates.,,"['Engels, Knut', 'Jungnickel, Berit', 'Tobollik, Stephanie', 'Hansmann, Martin-Leo', 'Kriener, Susanne', 'Willenbrock, Klaus']","['Engels K', 'Jungnickel B', 'Tobollik S', 'Hansmann ML', 'Kriener S', 'Willenbrock K']","['Senckenbergisches Institut fur Pathologie, Klinikum der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. k.engels@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemic Infiltration/enzymology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*enzymology/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Pseudolymphoma/diagnosis/enzymology/*genetics/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology']",,,2008/09/09 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2008/09/09 09:00'],"['2008/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PAI.0b013e3181758ce5 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2008 Dec;16(6):521-9. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0b013e3181758ce5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also has antiproliferative effects on vascular endothelium when used to coat coronary artery stents. We noted an excess of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in a clinical trial, and retrospectively reviewed the records of 488 patients to determine the association between sirolimus and VOD. When used with cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation (Cy/TBI) conditioning, sirolimus is associated with an increased incidence of VOD (OR 2.35, P = .005). The concomitant use of methotrexate further increased this rate (OR 3.23, P < .001), while sirolimus without methotrexate was not associated with an increased risk of VOD (OR 1.55, P = .33). Mortality after VOD diagnosis was unaffected, and overall treatment-related mortality was lowest when sirolimus was used without methotrexate. Similar findings were noted in matched, related, and unrelated as well as mismatched donor subgroups. When used with busulfan-based conditioning, sirolimus use was associated with an even higher rate of VOD (OR 8.8, P = .008). Our findings suggest that sirolimus use is associated with VOD after TBI-based transplantation when used with methotrexate after transplantation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an open-label study, 30 children (11 boys and 19 girls; mean age 13.5 years) who were treated for solid tumors and leukaemia, and developed a painful peripheral neuropathy, were medicated with pregabalin in the daily dose of 150-300 mg for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients completed the 8-week follow-up. A significant and long-lasting pain relief was noted in 86% of these patients.

The development of anti-MDR agents for efficient drug delivery is of great importance in cancer therapy. Recent reports have demonstrated that some anticancer drugs could be readily self-assembled on some biocompatible nanomaterials covalently or non-covalently, which could effectively afford the sustained drug delivery for the target cancer cells and reduce the relevant toxicity towards normal cells and tissues. Thus these biocompatible nanomaterials may play an important role in the relevant biological and biomedical system. In this paper, we have explored the cytotoxic effect of anticancer drug daunorubicin on leukemia cancer cells in the absence and presence of different sized ZnO nanoparticles via fluorescence microscopy, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, electrochemical analysis as well as MTT assay. Meanwhile, the cytotoxicity suppression of daunorubicin together with different sized ZnO nanoparticles in the absence and presence of UV irradiation on leukemia cancer cells were also investigated using MTT assay. The results indicate that the combination of the different sized ZnO nanoparticles and daunorubicin under UV irradiation could have synergistic cytotoxic effect on leukemia cancer cells, indicating the great potential of ZnO nanoparticles in relevant clinical and biomedical applications.",,"['Guo, Dadong', 'Wu, Chunhui', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Li, Qingning', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Chen, Baoan']","['Guo D', 'Wu C', 'Jiang H', 'Li Q', 'Wang X', 'Chen B']","['State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics (Chien-Shiung Wu Laboratory), Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

In addition to monitoring p27 antigen levels measured by ELISA, we evaluated the presence of infectious particles by cell culture assays and quantified viral RNA loads by a quantitative real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction.

In cats with progressive infection, therefore, not only saliva but also faeces and to some extent urine might represent potential FeLV transmission routes. These results should be taken into account when modelling FeLV-host interactions and assessing FeLV transmission risk. Moreover, during early FeLV infection, detection of viral RNA in saliva may be used as an indicator of recent virus exposure, even in cats without detectable antigenaemia/viraemia.

Pro-inflammatory JAK/STAT is another downstream signaling pathway of Angiotensin II, and its status in AF remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize the status of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways in pacing-induced sustained atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: AF was induced by atrial pacing at 600/min in 10 adult pigs (AF group), while 10 sham-operated pigs served as the control group. RESULTS: Significant structural and inflammatory changes were noted in the AF group. Atrial tissue angiotensin II level was elevated and STAT1 and STAT3 were activated in the AF group. Nuclear translocation of activated STAT3 and binding to STAT3 consensus DNA sequence were also increased in the AF group. Rac1, the molecular target of statin, which mediates the activation of STAT3 by angiotensin II, was also activated in the AF group. The tissue levels of interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), which are known to activate STATs through membrane gp130 and JAKs, were not increased in the AF group. Membrane gp130 and JAKs were also not activated in the AF group.

Although intestinal expression of the mdr1a gene and its efflux pump function has been shown to exhibit 24-hour variation, the mechanism of the variations remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that the molecular components of the circadian clock act as regulators to control 24-hour variation in the expression of the mdr1a gene. METHODS: Luciferase reporter assay and gel mobility shift assay were used to study the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the mdr1a gene by clock gene products. The messenger RNA levels and protein abundances in colon 26 cells and mouse intestine were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: Hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) and E4 promoter binding protein-4 (E4BP4) regulated transcription of the mdr1a gene by competing with each other for the same DNA binding site. Molecular and biochemical analyses of HLF- and E4BP4-down-regulated colon 26 cells and the intestinal tract of Clock mutant mice suggested that these 2 proteins consisted of a reciprocating mechanism in which HLF activated the transcription of the mdr1a gene, whereas E4BP4 periodically suppressed transcription at the time of day when E4BP4 was abundant. CONCLUSIONS: The intestinal expression of the mdr1a gene is influenced by the circadian organization of molecular clockwork.

RESULTS: The activity was significantly (P<0.001) higher in the plasma of ALL and AML patients at the diagnosis than in healthy subjects and decreased after therapy or remained unchanged or rose during relapse. By contrast, in CLL patients at the diagnosis, the activity did not differ significantly from the healthy controls.

Well-known ocular side effects are periorbital edema, epiphora, extraocular muscle palsy, and blepharoconjunctivitis. However, optic disc edema has not been reported as a complication of imatinib mesylate. Herein, we describe a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who developed optic disc edema during treatment with imatinib. CASE: A 14-year-old Korean girl was referred to ophthalmology for a 3-week history of photopsia in both eyes. She had started taking imatinib daily 2 months previously for CML. At the initial exam, slit lamp showed optic disc edema in both eyes, even though visual acuity was 20/20 and other optic nerve function evaluations were within normal limits. We recommended to the oncologist discontinuation of the imatinib treatment. OBSERVATIONS: When the patient was followed for 1 week after stopping imatinib treatment, the frequency of photopsia decreased and the optic disc edema improved. Because a second examination 3 weeks after discontinuation of imatinib revealed much improved optic disc edema, she restarted the imatinib treatment. No ocular side effects have been noted so far. CONCLUSIONS: Optic disc edema should be considered one of the complications associated with imatinib.

The purpose of this study is to assess whether tissue and cellular localization of (90)Y-ibritumomab-tiuxetan determined by autoradiography and radioactivity localized to tumor tissue might enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action of radioimmunotherapy. METHODS: Eight eligible patients had CD20+ NHL, a bulky peripheral lymph node, and were scheduled for (90)Y-ibritumomab-tiuxetan treatment. 2-Deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D: -glucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was performed prior to treatment and at 12 weeks after therapy for assessment of response. Bone marrow, lymph node, and blood samples were collected 114 +/- 3 h after 14.8 MBq/kg (90)Y-ibritumomab-tiuxetan and processed for histology, scintillation counting, and microscopic autoradiography. RESULTS: Pericellular membrane localization of (90)Y-ibritumomab-tiuxetan to lymphoma cells was observed by autoradiography in the involved areas of lymph node with absence of significant localization in histologically normal sections of bone marrow. Pericellular radioactivity and the highest quantitative radioactivity were observed in lymph node samples of responding patients.

In this article, a statistical procedure was proposed to identify the DEGs for gene expression data with or without missing observations from microarray experiment with one- or two-treatment factors. An F statistic based on Henderson method III was constructed to test the significance of differential expression for each gene under different treatment(s) levels. The cutoff P value was adjusted to control the experimental-wise false discovery rate. A human acute leukemia dataset corrected from 38 leukemia patients was reanalyzed by the proposed method. In comparison to the results from significant analysis of microarray (SAM) and microarray analysis of variance (MAANOVA), it was indicated that the proposed method has similar performance with MAANOVA for data with one-treatment factor, but MAANOVA cannot directly handle missing data. In addition, a mouse brain dataset collected from six brain regions of two inbred strains (two-treatment factors) was reanalyzed to identify genes with distinct regional-specific expression patterns. The results showed that the proposed method could identify more distinct regional-specific expression patterns than the previous analysis of the same dataset.

The 2004 Surgeon General report found convincing evidence for a direct causal relationship between tobacco use and the following cancers: lung and bronchial, laryngeal, oral cavity and pharyngeal, esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, kidney and renal pelvis, urinary bladder, and cervical cancers and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This report provides state-level cancer incidence data and recent trends for cancers associated with tobacco use. Because information on tobacco use was not available in the databases of the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, cases of cancer included in this report might or might not be in persons who used tobacco; however, the cancer types included in this report are those defined by the U.S. Surgeon General as having a direct causal relationship with tobacco use (i.e., referred to as tobacco-related cancer in this report). These data are important for initiation, monitoring, and evaluation of targeted tobacco prevention and control measures. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 1999--2004. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS: Data were obtained from cancer registries affiliated with CDC's NPCR and the National Cancer Institute's SEER program; combined, these data cover approximately 92% of the U.S. population. Combined data from the NPCR and SEER programs provide the best source of information on population-based cancer incidence for the nation and are the only source of information for 41 states (including the District of Columbia) with cancer surveillance programs that are funded solely by NPCR. This report provides age-adjusted cancer incidence rates by demographic and geographic characteristics, percentage distributions for tumor characteristics, and trends in cancer incidence by sex. RESULTS: Approximately 2.4 million cases of tobacco-related cancer were diagnosed during 1999--2004. Age-adjusted incidence rates ranged from 4.0 per 100,000 persons (for AML) to 69.4 (for lung and bronchial cancer). High rates occurred among men, black and non-Hispanic populations, and older adults. Higher incidence rates of lung and laryngeal cancer occurred in the South compared with other regions, particularly the West, consistent with high smoking patterns in the South. INTERPRETATION: The high rates of tobacco-related cancer observed among men, blacks, non-Hispanics, and older adults reflect overall demographic patterns of cancer incidence in the United States and reflect patterns of tobacco use. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: The findings in this report emphasize the need for ongoing surveillance and reporting to monitor cancer incidence trends, identify populations at greatest risk for developing cancer related to tobacco use, and evaluate the effectiveness of targeted tobacco control programs and policies.",,"['Stewart, Sherri L', 'Cardinez, Cheryll J', 'Richardson, Lisa C', 'Norman, Leslie', 'Kaufmann, Rachel', 'Pechacek, Terry F', 'Thompson, Trevor D', 'Weir, Hannah K', 'Sabatino, Susan A']","['Stewart SL', 'Cardinez CJ', 'Richardson LC', 'Norman L', 'Kaufmann R', 'Pechacek TF', 'Thompson TD', 'Weir HK', 'Sabatino SA']","['Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, USA. sstewart2@cdc.gov']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,MMWR Surveill Summ,"Morbidity and mortality weekly report.

Locally, short-term irradiation, with high deadly dose, caused acute radiation syndrome with reversible disorder function of the individual, most exposed, organs. Frequency of chromosomal aberrations (dicentric), characteristic for direct irradiation, was increased. However, dicentric analyzes did not give expected result for an acute radioactivity illness. Radio dermatitis had begun already after the incident, while changes on the heart began not earlier than six months and gradually have been increased up to two years after the incident. Irradiated parts of the patient skin have been replaced with auto-transplanted skin and appropriate therapy had been taken. More than two decades after the irradiation, system (leukemia) nor solitary tumor on near organs (liver, heart, lungs, bones) have not been appeared. Radiation illness did not happen in spite of very large dose, because impacts had been local and body was unlikely irradiated.

This study compares expression patterns of relevant genes in oral mucosa of omnivores and vegetarians. METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was applied for analysis of mRNA levels from carnitine transporter OCTN2, hepatic CPT1A and nonhepatic CPT1B isoforms of carnitine palmitoyltransferase and collagen (CCOL2A1) in oral mucosa. RESULTS: Compared with volunteers with traditional eating habits, carbohydrate consumption was significantly higher (+22%) in vegetarians. This was associated with a significant stimulation of CPT1A (+50%) and OCTN2 (+10%) and a lowered collagen synthesis (-10%). CONCLUSION: These novel findings provide further insight into the association of a changed fat metabolism and reduced collagen synthesis in vegetarians, which could also play a role in the aging process.","['Copyright 2008 S.

METHODS: RT-PCR was used to detect BRD7 expression in patients with AL and normal bone marrow subjects. Single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analysis were also used to identify BRD7 mutation or SNP to investigate the relation between BRD7 and AL. RESULTS: BRD7 mRNA in BMNCs from 52 patients with AL and 30 control subjects was expressed. The mRNA relative expression of BRD7 in patients with AL was higher than that of the control group (P=0.001). Three SNPs (C657A,C495T and A737G) in BRD7 gene coding region (447 approximately 844 bp) were found, and A737G was coupled with C495T . The allele frequencies of SNP C657A were not significantly different between AL and the control group. The genotype and the allele frequencies of the 2 coupled SNPs were significantly different (P<0.01). But there was no significant discrepancy among the mRNA expression levels of AA, AG, and GG genotypes in the leukemia group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Expression of BRD7 gene is up-regulated in AL cells.

The anti-CD20 antibody rituximab is active in CLL and represents a rational agent to combine with lenalidomide. We therefore examined whether lenalidomide combined with rituximab enhances direct apoptosis and ADCC in CLL cells. In contrast to previous reports using CD20-positive lymphoma cell lines, lenalidomide down-regulated CD20 surface antigen expression in CLL patient cells via enhanced internalization, without influencing transcription. The CD20 surface antigen internalization enhanced delivery of an oligonucleotide incorporated into anti-CD20 immunoliposomes. In addition, CD20 surface antigen down-modulation by lenalidomide in CLL was accompanied by diminished rituximab-mediated apoptosis and ADCC. These observations suggest a need for alternative sequencing strategies to avoid antagonism between lenalidomide and rituximab therapy in CLL. In addition, they suggest that lenalidomide therapy might be useful to enhance targeted delivery of RNAi-based therapies using CD20 immunoliposomes in B-cell malignancies.",,"['Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Yu, Bo', 'Triantafillou, Georgia', 'Liu, Qing', 'Butchar, Jonathan P', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Ramanunni, Asha', 'Smith, Lisa L', 'Blum, William', 'Andritsos, Leslie', 'Wang, Da-Sheng', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Chen, Ching-Shih', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Lee, Robert J', 'Lee, L James', 'Tridandapani, Susheela', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Byrd, John C']","['Lapalombella R', 'Yu B', 'Triantafillou G', 'Liu Q', 'Butchar JP', 'Lozanski G', 'Ramanunni A', 'Smith LL', 'Blum W', 'Andritsos L', 'Wang DS', 'Lehman A', 'Chen CS', 'Johnson AJ', 'Marcucci G', 'Lee RJ', 'Lee LJ', 'Tridandapani S', 'Muthusamy N', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025755/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Liposomes)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Antigens, CD20/*drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2597613,,2008/09/06 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/09/06 09:00'],"['2008/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51759-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-133108 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Dec 15;112(13):5180-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-133108.

The present study examined the inhibitory effects of Am80 on HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells. Am80 had negligible growth inhibition of peripheral blood mononuclear cells but marked growth inhibition of both HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells. Am80 arrested cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and induced apoptosis in HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines. It inhibited also the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and NF-kappaB-DNA binding, in conjunction with reduction of expression of proteins involved in the G1/S cell cycle transition and apoptosis. Am80 also inhibited the expression of JunD, resulting in suppression of AP-1-DNA binding. Furthermore, severe combined immunodeficient mice with tumors induced by subcutaneous inoculation of HTLV-I-infected T cells, responded to Am80 treatment with partial regression of tumors and no side-effects.

In this study, we analyzed the impact of in vivo primary tumor gene expression of PLZF on the long-term survival of malignant melanoma patients. PLZF expression was assessed by using DNA microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of 41 primary malignant melanomas from patients with a defined histology and a close to 20-year clinical follow-up, of 29 melanoma metastases, and of 6 different melanoma cell lines. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, log-rank statistics and Cox regression analysis were employed to identify the impact of PLZF expression on long-term survival. We detected PLZF expression in 92% of primary melanoma tumors in vivo but not in melanoma cell lines in vitro. By univariate analysis, we identified: (1) PLZF mRNA expression < or = 10,000 mRNA copies/mug total tumor RNA, (2) Breslow tumor thickness >4 mm, and (3) American Joint Committee on Cancer stages IIC, IIIB, IIIC, and IV as statistically significant pretreatment risk factors. We defined a continuous prognostic index (i.e., risk score) for primary melanoma patients based on the regression coefficient of PLZF mRNA expression. Applying a cutpoint to the prognostic index at - 1.65, patients were assigned to one of two risk groups: low-risk patients (n = 28) with a median overall survival of 79 months (5-year survival of 61%) and high-risk patients (n = 13) with a median overall survival of 32 months (5-year survival of 23%) (p < 0.05).

First, high expression levels of c-Abl and D40 were observed not only in proliferating somatic cells, such as tumors, but also in healthy human testis. The increased expression levels of c-Abl and D40 protein in spermatocytes and acrosome of spermatids indicate their role in meiosis and spermatogenesis. Second, both proteins interact with specific regions of chromatin and are involved in the regulation of cell growth and division. Third, ABL and D40 (AF15q14) genes are involved in chromosomal translocations that subsequently form chimeric oncoproteins BCR-ABL, TEL-ABL and MLL-AF15q14 in human leukaemia.

The incubation period was very short but dose-dependent. Chickens died in 4 to 12 days, embryos in 7 to 14 days, after inoculation. Embryo-passaged attenuated JMV (JMV-A) caused the same lesions in embryos as virulent JMV. The dose-response relationship depended on the route of inoculation and on the quality of the tumour cell preparation. Intramuscular (i.m.) inoculation of leukaemic blood or embryo lymphoblasts provided the most satisfactory response. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation and lymphoblastic chicken spleens as a source of JMV were definitely less suitable. The dose-response curves obtained in yolk sac-inoculated embryos were similar to the curves obtained by i.m. inoculation of chickens. Only 4 to 10 lymphoblasts were needed per lethal dose (50%) in chickens and 50 to 80 in embryos. The pathogenicity and antigenicity of JMV and JMV-A were strictly cell-associated. No Marek's disease (MD) virus or any other avian virus could be detected, either by various virus isolation procedures, or by serological methods. Contact transmission of JMV to other chickens did not occur. Antibodies against surface antigens on JMV lymphoblasts were detected in JMV and JMV-A chicken hyperimmune sera. These sera reacted against MD lymphoblastoid cell lines (HPRS-1 & 2, MSB-1) as well as MSB-1 anti-serum, but all sera reacted also against thymus lymphocytes from normal chickens. The results of absorption tests suggested that the surface antigens of JMV lymphoblasts and of the tested cell lines were not identical.

The JMV and JMV-A preparations were free of MDV, leukosis and reticuloendotheliosis viruses. Vaccination of chickens with attenuated MDV or with HVT provided good protection against both JMV lymphoblastosis and Marek's disease (MD). In one experiment HVT (cell-free) caused a better resistance to JMV than to MD. Inoculation of JMV-A always resulted in a 100% resistance to virulent JMV. However, JMV-A did not induce any appreciable resistance to MD, even when the birds were challenged with MDV by contact exposure. Control experiments revealed that high doses of normal lymphocytes from uninfected chickens also had a protective effect against JMV. The 50% protective dose varied from 10(7) to 10(8) lymphocytes. JMV tumour cells inactivated by glutaraldehyde were used in different experiments but rarely caused a clear-cut protection against virulent JMV. The results of this study suggested that a one-way relationship exists in vivo between HVT or MDV and JMV lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Recently, an infectious gammaretrovirus designated XMRV has been identified in prostate cancer patients. The similarity between the MLV and XMRV genomes suggests a possibility that the two viruses may interact when present in the same cell. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We tested the ability of XMRV to complement replication-deficient MLV vectors upon co-infection of cultured human cells. We observed that XMRV can facilitate the spread of these vectors from infected to uninfected cells. This functional complementation occurred without any gross rearrangements in the vector structure, and the co-infected cells produced as many as 10(4) infectious vector particles per milliliter of culture medium. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The possibility of encountering a helper virus when delivering MLV-based vectors to human cells in vitro and in vivo needs to be considered to ensure the safety of such procedures.",,"['Dong, Beihua', 'Silverman, Robert H', 'Kandel, Eugene S']","['Dong B', 'Silverman RH', 'Kandel ES']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['CA103943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA103943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA098176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA116060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA116060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA098176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Culture Media)'],IM,"['Culture Media/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Statistical', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/virology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Assembly/genetics']",PMC2519784,,2008/09/05 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/05 09:00'],"['2008/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0003144 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 Sep 4;3(9):e3144. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0003144.,20080904,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During disease progression, immunodeficiency develops; however, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we study the regulatory T cell (Treg) function and the expression of FOXP3 in SS. We demonstrate that malignant T cells in 8 of 15 patients stain positive with an anti-FOXP3 antibody. Western blotting analysis shows expression of two low molecular splice forms of FOXP3, but not of wild-type (wt) FOXP3. The malignant T cells produce interleukin-10 and TGF-beta and suppress the growth of non-malignant T cells. The Treg phenotype and the production of suppressive cytokines are driven by aberrant activation of Jak3 independent of the FOXP3 splice forms. In contrast to wt FOXP3, the low molecular splice forms of FOXP3 have no inhibitory effect on nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity in reporter assays which is in keeping with a constitutive NF-kappaB activity in the malignant T cells. In conclusion, we show that the malignant T cells express low molecular splice forms of FOXP3 and function as Tregs.

Patients without disease progression continued for up to eight cycles. VMDT effect on bone remodeling was evaluated by measuring osteoclast regulators (soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand/osteoprotegerin ratio, osteopontin, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha), dickkopf-1 protein, bone resorption and formation markers, whereas its effect on angiogenesis was assessed by measuring serum vascular endothelial growth factor, angiogenin, angiopoietin-2 and basic fibroblast growth factor, after four cycles and at the study end. A total of 62 patients were enrolled. The overall response rate was 66%: CR 13%, vgPR 27% and PR 26%. Median time to response was 35 days and median time to progression was 9.3 months. Common adverse events included cytopenias, peripheral neuropathy and infections. No patient experienced deep-vein thrombosis.

For the very rare PV patients who do not harbor the JAK2 V617F mutation, exon 12 JAK2 mutants were discovered also to result in activated forms of JAK2. A minority of ET and PMF patients harbor mutations that constitutively activate the thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR).

Cell lines MB-02, MUTZ-8, SET-2 and UKE-1 carry JAK2V617F and derive from patients with MPD/MDS histories. Challenging the consensus that expression of JAK2V617F is the sole precondition for cytokine independence in class I cytokine receptor-positive cells, two of four of the JAK2mu cell lines were growth factor-dependent. These cell lines resembled JAK2wt cells regarding JAK2/STAT5 activation: cytokine deprivation effected dephosphorylation, whereas erythropoetin or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT5. Cytokine independence correlated with low expression and cytokine dependence with high expression of the JAK/STAT pathway inhibitor suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) suggesting a two-step mechanism for cytokine independence of MPD cells: (i) activation of the oncogene JAK2V617F and (ii) inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene SOCS2. Confirming that SOCS2 operates as a negative JAK2V617F regulator, SOCS2 knockdown induced constitutive STAT5 phosphorylation in JAK2mu cells.

AML cells also constitutively express SDF-1-dependent elastase, which regulates their migration and proliferation. To study the molecular events and genes regulated by the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and elastase in AML cells, we examined gene expression profiles of the AML cell line, U937, under treatment with a neutralizing anti-CXCR4 antibody or elastase inhibitor, as compared with non-treated cells, using DNA microarray technology. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated similar gene expression profiles of anti-CXCR4 antibody or elastase inhibitor-treated cells, as compared with control. Pathway and functional analysis showed a greater tendency toward differentiation in cells under either one of both treatment modalities. Thus given, we further analyzed the effects of CXCR4 inhibition on AML cell growth and differentiation using the antagonist AMD3100. AMD3100 arrested proliferation in AML cell lines and triggered changes that mimicked differentiation, including morphological changes and the expression of myeloid differentiation antigens.

Autophagic triggers upregulate Beclin 1, which in turn binds to PI3KC3 or Bcl-X(L) to form complexes of Beclin 1-PI3KC3 or Beclin 1-Bcl-X(L) that are physically and functionally independent from each other. Contrary to the previous observations that Beclin 1 binding to Bcl-2 family members is apoptotic and antiautophagic, we found that autophagic trigger-induced Beclin 1-binding to Bcl-X(L) is antiapoptotic and has no effect on autophagy, suggesting a convertible role of the Beclin 1-Bcl-X(L) complex in response to autophagy stimuli. Both autophagy and differentiation cascades require upregulation of Beclin 1. While the basal Beclin 1 level does not cause autophagy or differentiation, depletion of Beclin 1 cripples both autophagy and differentiation capabilities, but activates apoptosis.

Although it is well established that many malignancies can be transplanted, there is little evidence to demonstrate that a premalignant disease entity, such as MDS or colonic polyps, can be transplanted and subsequently undergo malignant transformation in vivo. Using mice that express a NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) transgene in hematopoietic tissues, we show that a MDS can be transplanted to WT recipients. Recipients of the MDS bone marrow displayed all of the critical features of MDS, including peripheral blood cytopenias, dysplasia, and transformation to AML. Even when transplanted with a 10-fold excess of WT cells, the NHD13 cells outcompeted the WT cells over a 38-week period. Limiting-dilution experiments demonstrated that the frequency of the cell that could transmit the disease was approximately 1/6,000-1/16,000 and that the MDS was also transferable to secondary recipients as a premalignant condition. Transformation to AML in primary transplant recipients was generally delayed (46-49 weeks after transplant); however, 6 of 10 secondary transplant recipients developed AML.

METHODS: We examined the association between traffic density and childhood leukemia risk for three time periods: birth, time of diagnosis, and lifetime average, based on complete residential history in a case-control study. Cases were rapidly ascertained from participating hospitals in northern and central California between 1995 and 2002. Controls were selected from birth records, individually matched on age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. Traffic density was calculated by estimating total vehicle miles traveled per square mile within a 500-foot (152 meter) radius area around each address. We used conditional logistic regression analyses to account for matching factors and to adjust for household income. RESULTS: We included 310 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALL) and 396 controls in our analysis. The odds ratio for ALL and residential traffic density above the 75th percentile, compared with subjects with zero traffic density, was 1.17 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.76-1.81] for residence at diagnosis and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.70-1.78) for the residence at birth. For average lifetime traffic density, the odds ratio was 1.24 (95% CI, 0.74-2.08) for the highest exposure category.

Giardia lamblia differentiates into infectious cysts to survive outside of the host. During encystation, genes encoding cyst wall proteins (CWPs) are coordinately induced. We have identified an encystation-induced Myb2 protein, which binds to the promoter regions of the cwp genes and myb2 itself in vitro. To elucidate the role of Myb2 in G. lamblia, we tested the hypothesis that Myb2 can activate encystation-induced genes. We found that overexpression of Myb2 resulted in an increase of expression of CWP1 at both protein and mRNA levels. Interestingly, the Myb2-overexpressing trophozoites had increased capability to differentiate into cysts. In cotransfection assays, Myb2 was able to transactivate the cwp promoters and its own promoter in vivo, suggesting that its gene can be positively autoregulated. Moreover, deletion of the N- or C-terminal domain resulted in a decrease of transactivation and autoregulation function of Myb2. We also found that the promoter of a newly identified encystation-induced gene, the giardial myeloid leukemia factor-like gene, has the Myb2 binding sites and that its mRNA levels were increased by Myb2 overexpression.

We sought to determine whether donor type is a prognostic factor in elderly patients in the era of high-resolution DNA-based HLA typing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed univariate and multivariate analyses of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients older than 50 years with standard- or high-risk AML who had received an allogeneic HCT between 1995 and 2005. Available DNA from donors and recipients of unrelated HCT was retyped so that the HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 alleles could be characterized in detail. Unrelated donors (UDs) were classified as matched (8/8), possibly matched (matched, but incomplete information), partially matched (one mismatch), or poorly matched (two or more mismatches) according to the final typing results. RESULTS: Data from 368 patients with a median age of 57 years (range, 50 to 73 years) were included. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that patients' disease status at HCT (P < .001) and the cytogenetic risk (P < .001) highly significantly predicted EFS and OS. Compared with patients with matched sibling donors, the adjusted relative risk of EFS was 0.7 (95% CI, 0.4 to 1.1) for patients with matched UDs and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.7 to 1.6) for patients with partially matched UDs.

Mutations in the CEBPA gene are found in subsets of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, three families were reported in whom several family members had germline CEBPA mutations and subsequently developed AML. Whereas familial AML is considered a rare event, the frequency of CEBPA germline mutations in AML is not known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we screened 187 consecutive AML patients for CEBPA mutations at diagnosis. We detected 18 patients (9.6%) with CEBPA mutations. We then analyzed remission samples and constitutive DNA from these patients. RESULTS: We found that two (11.1%) of 18 AML patients with CEBPA mutations carried a germline N-terminal frameshift CEBPA mutation. Interestingly, additional members in the families of both of these patients have been affected by AML, and the germline CEBPA mutations were also observed in these patients. Additional somatic mutations in AML patients with germline CEBPA mutations in the two families comprised in-frame C-terminal CEBPA mutations in two patients, two nonsilent CEBPA point mutations in one patient, and monosomy 7 in one patient. CONCLUSION: This study shows, for the first time to our knowledge, that germline CEBPA mutations are frequently observed among AML patients with CEBPA mutations. Including the families with germline CEBPA mutations reported previously, additional somatic CEBPA mutations represent a frequent second event in AML with germline CEBPA mutations.

Because healthy persons show (oligo)clonal expansions of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV)-specific TCRVbeta(+)/CD4(+)/cytotoxic/memory T cells, we investigate the potential involvement of hCMV in the origin and/or expansion of monoclonal CD4(+) T-LGL. Peripheral blood samples from patients with monoclonal TCR-alphabeta(+)/CD4(+) T-LGL lymphocytosis and other T-chronic lymphoproliferative disorders were evaluated for the specific functional response against hCMV and hEBV whole lysates as well as the ""MQLIPDDYSNTHSTRYVTVK"" hCMV peptide, which is specifically loaded in HLA-DRB1*0701 molecules. A detailed characterization of those genes that underwent changes in T-LGL cells responding to hCMV was performed by microarray gene expression profile analysis. Patients with TCR-alphabeta(+)/CD4(+) T-LGL displayed a strong and characteristic hCMV-specific functional response, reproduced by the hCMV peptide in a subset of HLA-DRB1*0701(+) patients bearing TCRVbeta13.1(+) clonal T cells. Gene expression profile showed that the hCMV-induced response affects genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses, cell cycle progression, resistance to apoptosis, and genetic instability.

In B-CLL cells, Lyn is overexpressed, anomalously present in the cytosol, and displays a high constitutive activity, compared with normal B lymphocytes. The aim of this work was to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these aberrant properties of Lyn, which have already been demonstrated to be related to defective apoptosis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. Herein, Lyn is described to be in an active conformation as integral component of an aberrant cytosolic 600-kDa multiprotein complex in B-CLL cells, associated with several proteins, such as Hsp90 through its catalytic domain, and HS1 and SHP-1L through its SH3 domain. In particular, Hsp90 appears tightly bound to cytosolic Lyn (CL), thus stabilizing the aberrant complex and converting individual transient interactions into stable ones. We also demonstrate that treatment of B-CLL cells with geldanamycin, an Hsp90 inhibitor already reported to induce cell death, is capable of dissociating the CL complex in the early phases of apoptosis and thus inactivating CL itself.

To comprehensively characterize the molecular evolution of relapsed childhood B-precursor ALL, we used human 500K single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to identify somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) in 20 diagnosis/relapse pairs relative to germ line. We identified 758 CNAs, 66.4% of which were less than 1 Mb, and deletions outnumbered amplifications by approximately 2.5:1. Although CNAs persisting from diagnosis to relapse were observed in all 20 cases, 17 patients exhibited differential CNA patterns from diagnosis to relapse. Of the 396 CNAs observed in 20 relapse samples, only 69 (17.4%) were novel (absent in the matched diagnosis samples). EBF1 and IKZF1 deletions were particularly frequent in this relapsed ALL cohort (25.0% and 35.0%, respectively), suggesting their role in disease recurrence. In addition, we noted concordance in global gene expression and DNA copy number changes (P = 2.2 x 10(-16)). Finally, relapse-specific focal deletion of MSH6 and, consequently, reduced gene expression were found in 2 of 20 cases.

The comparison of rates of apoptosis and of the expression of antiapoptotic proteins in different human granulocyte types revealed that basophils have a considerably longer spontaneous life span than neutrophils and eosinophils consistent with high levels of constitutive Bcl-2 expression. Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is the only ligand that efficiently protects basophils from apoptosis as evidenced by screening a large number of stimuli. IL-3 up-regulates the expression of the antiapoptotic proteins cIAP2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-X(L) and induces a rapid and sustained de novo expression of the serine/threonine kinase Pim1 that closely correlates with cytokine-enhanced survival. Inhibitor studies and protein transduction of primary basophils using wild-type and kinase-dead Pim1-Tat fusion-proteins demonstrate the functional importance of Pim1 induction in the IL-3-enhanced survival. Our data further indicate that the antiapoptotic Pim1-mediated pathway operates independently of PI3-kinase but involves the activation of p38 MAPK.

The successful identification of a range of leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs) that drive the GVL response in recent years has stimulated research in the development of vaccines to treat hematological malignancies. Here, we review the current experience with the PR1 vaccine. PR1 is a nine amino acid, HLA-A(*)0201-restricted peptide, shared by two myeloid LAAs, proteinase (PR)3 and neutrophil elastase (NE). PR3 and NE are found in the primary (azurophil) granule proteins of normal granulocytes and are overexpressed in myeloid leukemia cells. PR1 induces powerful HLA-A(*)0201-restricted CD8+ T-cell responses that selectively kill myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. The detection of low frequencies of PR1-specific CD8+ T cells in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and at higher frequencies in patients entering molecular remission after allogeneic stem cell transplantation supports the concept that there is natural immunity to PR1, which can be boosted further by vaccination to enhance immunity to leukemia. Preliminary reports indicate that PR1 peptide vaccination induces significant increases in PR1-specific CD8+ T cells, with rapid and durable remissions in some patients with myeloid leukemia. These promising early results point the way to optimizing the administration of peptide vaccines to improve the treatment of otherwise refractory myeloid leukemias.",,"['Rezvani, Katayoun']",['Rezvani K'],"['Haematology Department, Imperial College, London, UK. k.rezvani@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Vaccines,Expert review of vaccines,101155475,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)']",IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Vaccines, Subunit/immunology']",,,2008/09/05 09:00,2008/10/24 09:00,['2008/09/05 09:00'],"['2008/09/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1586/14760584.7.7.867 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Vaccines. 2008 Sep;7(7):867-75. doi: 10.1586/14760584.7.7.867.,,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have shown that the fusion alone is insufficient for the initiation of leukemia; additional genetic changes are required. Genomic profiling identified copy number alterations at high frequencies in these patients. Focal deletions of TBL1XR1 were observed in 15% of cases; 3 patients exhibited deletions distal to the gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed these deletions and quantitative RT-PCR showed that the TBL1XR1 gene was significantly under-expressed. TBL1XR1 is a key component of the SMRT and N-CoR compressor complexes, which control hormone-receptor mediated gene expression. Differential expression of the retinoic acid target genes, RARB, CRABP1, and CRABP2, indicated that deletion of TBL1XR1 compromised the function of SMRT/N-CoR in the appropriate control of gene expression. This study identifies deletions of TBL1XR1 as a recurrent abnormality in ETV6-RUNX1 positive ALL.

CML progression is frequently associated with cytogenetic evidence of clonal evolution, defined as additional chromosomal aberrations. We here report a CML resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors that rapidly progressed to blastic phase. At this time, array CGH performed on CD34(+) cells revealed cryptic partial deletions of both PRDM16 and RUNX1 and duplication of the der(21) chromosome. These genomic rearrangements were confirmed by FISH with probes targeting the deletion on chromosome 21 (24 kb), and with BAC probes flanking the deletion on 1p36 (220 kb). However, no cryptic t(1;21)(p36;q22) and/or RUNX1-PRDM16 were detected, suggesting that these deletions are the residual hallmarks of a more complex mechanism of chromosomal rearrangement, as indicated by the additional inversion of the region bounded by 1p36.32 and 1p36.12 breaks. At the molecular level, these abnormalities lead to the overexpression of the PR-domain negative oncogenic isoform of PRDM16, associated with two deleted copies within the runt domain of C-teminal aberrant RUNX1.

Combination chemotherapy that reduces the neurotoxicity without compromising the efficacy of vincristine would improve patient outcomes. We performed in vitro studies using a combination of microtubule-binding antimitotics, noscapine and vincristine. In cell cultures containing neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, vincristine caused demyelination as shown by transmission electron microscopy. A combination of vincristine and noscapine protected against demyelination. Human acute lymphoblastic and acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines CCRF-CEM and HL-60, respectively, were used to determine the antiproliferative effect of this novel drug combination.

Because of their size, these constructs may differ from cognate peptides in their ability to induce T cell activation. We here analysed signalling outcomes upon synapse formation between human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CTL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells through targeted complexes (TC) containing anti-CD20 single-chain variable fragment and biotinylated major histocompatibility complex class I molecules presenting peptides from CMVpp65. TC coated CLL cells were effectively lysed by CMVpp65-specific CTL but induced less interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production than peptide loaded targets. Confocal microscopy revealed that TC induced a redistribution of TCR/CD3 but not CD2 towards the immunological synapse. Furthermore, morphological examination of immunological synapses showed smaller and 'patchy' interactions between TC coated B cells and CTL as compared with peptide coated targets. Finally, pre-incubation of CTL with CD2 antibodies led to an Fc-dependent redistribution of CD2 into TC-induced synapses and restored IFN-gamma production by CMV-specific CTL. Thus, redistribution of CD2 towards the immunological synapse appears to be essential for full T cell activation. However, CD2 triggering is not required for efficient lysis of tumor cells, demonstrating that CTL require only minimal stimulation to release their cytotoxic content.",,"['Mous, Rogier', 'Savage, Philip', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Teeling, Peter', 'van Oers, Marinus Hj', 'van Lier, Rene Aw']","['Mous R', 'Savage P', 'Eldering E', 'Teeling P', 'van Oers MH', 'van Lier RA']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. r.mous@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'CD2 Antigens/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Communication/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Peptide Fragments/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins']",,,2008/09/04 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/09/04 09:00'],"['2008/09/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['902122187 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802195430 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Aug;49(8):1592-602. doi: 10.1080/10428190802195430.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between 1970 and 1999, 174 patients underwent surgery for chronic pancreatitis and were followed until December 2006. They were divided in four groups: (1) resection 62; (2) drainage 82; (3) external drainage 7; (4) non-pancreas-directed surgery 23. A second procedure was required by 25 patients and a third by four: group 1 = 6 + 0, group 2 = 10 + 2, group 3 = 3 + 1, group 4 = 6 + 1. RESULTS: Hospital mortality was four of 174 (2.3%). Fifty-seven patients are alive; 49 of 170 developed cancer, and 38 died: lung (22), oral, pharynx, larynx (eight), esophagus, kidney, pancreas, colon, liver (two each), breast, stomach, mediastinum, prostate, melanoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, squamous cancer of the auricle (one each), liver metastasis from unknown primary (two). Fifteen patients died of liver cirrhosis, 13 of myocardial infarction/decompensation, six of vascular problems, five each of acute renal insufficiency or cerebral diseases, four each of acute pancreatitis, accidental trauma, complications of diabetes, bronchopneumonia, and 19 of other causes. The overall 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-year survival rate was 84.7, 65.6, 51.6, 38.0, 28.1, and 23.5. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of pancreatic cancer was 1.2%.

Here, we report a new mechanism for activation of SRC coactivators. We demonstrate regulated tyrosine phosphorylation of AIB1/SRC-3 at a C-terminal tyrosine residue (Y1357) that is phosphorylated after insulin-like growth factor 1, epidermal growth factor, or estrogen treatment of breast cancer cells. Phosphorylated Y1357 is increased in HER2/neu (v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) mammary tumor epithelia and is required to modulate AIB1/SRC-3 coactivation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor B, NF-kappaB, and AP-1-dependent promoters. c-Abl (v-Abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1) tyrosine kinase directly phosphorylates AIB1/SRC-3 at Y1357 and modulates the association of AIB1 with c-Abl, ERalpha, the transcriptional cofactor p300, and the methyltransferase coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1, CARM1. AIB1/SRC-3-dependent transcription and phenotypic changes, such as cell growth and focus formation, can be reversed by an Abl kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Thus, the phosphorylation state of Y1357 can function as a molecular on/off switch and facilitates the cross talk between hormone, growth factor, and intracellular kinase signaling pathways in cancer.",,"['Oh, Annabell S', 'Lahusen, John T', 'Chien, Christopher D', 'Fereshteh, Mark P', 'Zhang, Xiaolong', 'Dakshanamurthy, Sivanesan', 'Xu, Jianming', 'Kagan, Benjamin L', 'Wellstein, Anton', 'Riegel, Anna T']","['Oh AS', 'Lahusen JT', 'Chien CD', 'Fereshteh MP', 'Zhang X', 'Dakshanamurthy S', 'Xu J', 'Kagan BL', 'Wellstein A', 'Riegel AT']","['Department of Oncology, Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA113477/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009686/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA113477/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (NCOA3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Ncoa3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 3', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC2573238,,2008/09/04 09:00,2008/11/08 09:00,['2008/09/04 09:00'],"['2008/09/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00118-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00118-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Nov;28(21):6580-93. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00118-08.

We therefore conducted a phase I dose escalation study to assess the maximum tolerated dose, toxicities, and activity of bexarotene in patients with non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We enrolled patients with active non-M3 AML who had either relapsed or refractory disease or were not eligible for standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cohorts of three to six patients received escalating doses of daily oral bexarotene ranging from 100 to 400 mg/m(2) until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable adverse events occurred. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients, with median age of 69 years (range, 51-82 years), were treated. Twenty-four (89%) patients had undergone prior chemotherapy. At the highest dose level tested (400 mg/m(2)), three of six patients had to reduce their dose of bexarotene due to grade 3 adverse events. The maximum tolerable dose of bexarotene was determined to be 300 mg/m(2). Clinical activity was manifested by 4 (15%) patients with reduction in bone marrow blasts to <or=5%, 11 (41%) patients with improved platelet counts, and 7 (26%) patients with improved neutrophil counts. Three patients with relapsed AML survived >1 year while taking bexarotene. Leukemic blast differentiation was suggested by the presence of the leukemic cytogenetic abnormality in mature circulating granulocytes and the occurrence of differentiation syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended dose of bexarotene for future studies is 300 mg/m(2)/d.

We hypothesized that GO might be safe and effective as part of a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen as salvage therapy of CD33+ acute myeloid leukemia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-one patients with acute myeloid leukemia which relapsed following conventional therapy (n=15), autologous (n=3), or allogeneic (n=13) HCT were included in a prospective phase I/II trial. The preparative regimen contained 6 and 3 mg/m(2) of GO on days -21 and -14 before transplantation, leading to a reduction of marrow blasts in 18 patients (58%). Eight patients received further cytoreductive chemotherapy before conditioning therapy was initiated. Fludarabine-based reduced-intensity (n=11) or nonmyelablative (n=16) conditioning and peripheral blood stem cell infusion from related (n=6) or unrelated (n=21) donors could be done in 27 patients during cytopenia. RESULTS: Primary engraftment occurred in all evaluable patients. Only one case of reversible hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was documented. Non-relapse mortality until day 100 was 22% (n=6).

Using microarray and reverse transcription-PCR analysis, we found matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 to be extensively up-regulated in renal cell carcinomas and expressed in a broad variety of malignant cells. MMP-7 can promote cancer invasion and angiogenesis by proteolytic cleavage of extracellular matrix and basement membrane proteins, thus making it a promising target in the context of immunotherapies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To analyze the possible use of MMP-7 as a tumor-associated antigen, specific CTLs were induced using monocyte-derived dendritic cells electroporated with MMP-7-mRNA. In addition, to better characterize the fine specificity of these CTLs, MMP-7 MHC class I ligands were isolated and characterized in renal cell carcinoma tissue, which overexpressed MMP-7, by mass spectrometry-based peptide sequencing. Using this approach, we identified a novel HLA-A3-binding antigenic MMP-7 peptide. CTLs generated from healthy donors by in vitro priming with dendritic cells, pulsed with the novel peptide, were used as effectors in (51)Cr-release assays. RESULTS: The induced CTLs elicited an antigen-specific and HLA-restricted cytolytic activity against tumor cells endogenously expressing the MMP-7 protein. Furthermore, we were able to induce MMP-7-specific CTLs using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia capable of recognizing the autologous leukemic blasts while sparing nonmalignant cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the identification of a novel broadly expressed T-cell epitope derived from the MMP-7 protein that represents an interesting candidate to be applied in immunotherapies of human malignancies targeting both tumor cells and neovascularization.",,"['Yokoyama, Yuko', 'Grunebach, Frank', 'Schmidt, Susanne M', 'Heine, Annkristin', 'Hantschel, Maik', 'Stevanovic, Stefan', 'Rammensee, Hans-Georg', 'Brossart, Peter']","['Yokoyama Y', 'Grunebach F', 'Schmidt SM', 'Heine A', 'Hantschel M', 'Stevanovic S', 'Rammensee HG', 'Brossart P']","['Department Of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology And Pulmology, University Of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A3 Antigen)', 'EC 3.4.24.23 (MMP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.23 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 7)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*isolation & purification', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electroporation', 'Epitopes', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'HLA-A3 Antigen/immunology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 7/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2008/09/04 09:00,2008/10/04 09:00,['2008/09/04 09:00'],"['2008/09/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/17/5503 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4041 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Sep 1;14(17):5503-11. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4041.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The FDA approval of the efficacy and safety of nilotinib was based on the results of an ongoing single-arm, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial. The primary end point for CML-CP was unconfirmed major cytogenetic response. The efficacy end point for CML-AP was confirmed hematologic response. RESULTS: The major cytogenetic response rate in 232 evaluable CP patients was 40% (95% confidence interval, 33%, 46%). The hematologic response rate in 105 evaluable AP patients was 26% (95% confidence interval, 18%, 35%). The median duration of response has not been reached for both CML-CP and CML-AP responding patients. In CML-CP patients, the common serious drug-related adverse reactions were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. In CML-AP patients, the common serious drug-related adverse reactions were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, intracranial hemorrhage, elevated lipase, and pyrexia. Nilotinib prolongs the QT interval and sudden deaths have been reported; these risks and appropriate risk minimization strategies are described in a boxed warning on the labeling.

They develop from circulating monocytes. In case of an infection, monocytes attach to the endothelial cells of the blood vessels, migrate along the endothelial cells, leave the circulatory system to enter the inflammatory tissue, and differentiate into macrophages. Cell migration is induced frequently by chemokines that act through G-protein-coupled receptors. Only a few cytokines signaling through single-transmembrane domain receptors have been shown to induce cell migration. Often, this potential depends on the induction of classical chemokines and is not a direct cellular effect. Here, we discovered IL-6 as a potent stimulant for monocytic cell migration. Furthermore, we present data about IL-6-induced integrin activation, cell attachment, actin polymerization, fibronectin-dependent migration, and transmigration through a layer of endothelial cells.

Follow-up of 21 788 CD patients first hospitalized during the years 1964-2004 identified 1424 cancer cases. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated by comparing cancers in CD patients with subjects without CD. RESULTS: In addition to the known sites, many additional sites were in excess in CD patients. These included liver, pancreatic, lung, prostate, testicular, kidney and skin (squamous cell) cancers; nonthyroid endocrine tumors and leukemia. The previously established sites showed the highest SIRs; however, SIRs >2.0 were noted for the novel sites of the liver, testis and kidney. For testicular cancer, the SIR of seminoma was 2.74.

METHODS: This study investigated the activity of Wnt signalling in peripheral blood chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) lymphocytes, and the methylation status of seven soluble Wnt antagonist genes, including WIF1, DKK3, APC, SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4 and SFRP5, by using methylation-specific PCR in the peripheral blood CLL lymphocytes and bone marrow samples of patients with CLL at diagnosis. RESULTS: In the peripheral blood CLL lymphocytes, constitutive activation of Wnt signalling was detected, associated with hypermethylation of the soluble Wnt inhibitor genes. In the diagnostic CLL marrow samples, methylation of the seven genes was detected in up to 36.4% of samples. Moreover, 23 (52.3%) patients had methylation of at least one of the seven genes, of whom 14 (60.8%) had methylation of two or more Wnt inhibitor genes. Apart from an association of advanced age with DKK3 methylation, there was no association of gene hypermethylation with either clinical characteristics (including age, gender, lymphocyte count at diagnosis, Rai stage and poor-risk karyotype) or survival. CONCLUSION: Wnt signalling is constitutively activated in CLL B lymphocytes in association with methylation of multiple soluble Wnt antagonist genes. Methylation of these soluble Wnt antagonist genes, occasionally multiple genes, in primary CLL marrow samples suggests an important role in CLL pathogenesis.

The taxonomy distinguishes among the role of the attendee (puppet and robot, critic and actor), the attention process (stimulus orienting vs. response control), and the attention operation (activation vs. inhibition vs. adjustment), and identifies cognitive phenotypes by which attention is overtly expressed. We apply the taxonomy to four childhood attention disorders: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, spina bifida meningomyelocele, traumatic brain injury, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Variations in attention are related to specific brain regions that support normal attention processes when intact, and produce disordered attention when impaired. The taxonomy explains group differences in behavioral inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness, as well as medication response. We also discuss issues relevant to theories of the cognitive and neural architecture of attention: functional dissociations within and between automatic and controlled attention; the relative importance of type of brain damage and developmental timing to attention profile; cognitive-energetic models of attention and white matter damage; temporal processing deficits, attention deficits and cerebellar damage; and the issue of cognitive phenotypes as candidate endophenotypes.",,"['Dennis, Maureen', 'Sinopoli, Katia J', 'Fletcher, Jack M', 'Schachar, Russell']","['Dennis M', 'Sinopoli KJ', 'Fletcher JM', 'Schachar R']","['Program in Neurosciences and Mental Health, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. maureen.dennis@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['P01 HD035946-09/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HD35946/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS021889/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HD035946/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '2R011NS 21889-16/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Int Neuropsychol Soc,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,9503760,,IM,"['Attention/*physiology', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity', 'Attention Deficit and Disruptive Behavior Disorders/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Brain/physiopathology', 'Brain Injuries/pathology/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Classification', 'Developmental Disabilities/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Meningomyelocele/pathology/physiopathology', 'Models, Psychological', 'Neurobiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/physiopathology']",PMC2593155,['NIHMS79981'],2008/09/04 09:00,2009/04/09 09:00,['2008/09/04 09:00'],"['2008/09/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1355617708080983 [pii]', '10.1017/S1355617708080983 [doi]']",ppublish,J Int Neuropsychol Soc. 2008 Sep;14(5):673-90. doi: 10.1017/S1355617708080983.,,222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficacy of vaccination was evaluated by the titer of antibodies to HBs-Ag (HBs-Ab) 1 month after each injection of the vaccine. The control group consisted of 36 patients. Follow-up was 6 months to 10 years. RESULTS: Vaccine prophylaxis of VHB in AL remission resulted in appearance of the protective antibody titer after the forth vaccine injection in 50% patients. Out of 30 vaccinated patients 2 (6.7%) got infected with HBV 3 and 5 years after onset of the disease. Markers of HBV replication were detected in 8 (22%) of 36 patients.

Previous work has established its key role in yolk sac erythropoiesis and adult hematopoiesis, and it is also necessary for regulating angiogenesis. It has been demonstrated that this gene encodes a protein of 158 amino acids, consisting of two tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains, but the detailed mechanism of its transcriptional regulation remains to be elucidated. To further investigate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of Lmo2, we combined SMART PCR technology with 5'RACE and found a novel post-transcriptional splicing form of Lmo2 in adult human kidney. This alternative transcript contains only two exons, encoding a smaller protein of 151 amino acids. Interestingly, it shares the same reading frame as the original Lmo2, but differs in 7 amino acids at the N-terminus. A genomic DNA fragment (from -294 nts to +180 nts) containing the putative promoter region has been inserted into the luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3-basic and showed stable promoter activity when transfected into COS7.

The survival rate of lethally irradiated mice was increased to 72% through AIMH before irradiation. Both apoptosis and necrosis of human fetal bone marrow CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells cultured under MH were significantly decreased as detected by MTT and flow cytometry, with three-color labeled by PE-CD(34) (+)/ FITC-AnnexinV /7AAD. The survival and proliferation of mouse bone marrow MNC treated with MH after irradiation were also increased. The MH exerted similar protective effects on the leukemia cell lines A20, HL60, K562 to the normal bone marrow cells, but it enhanced the radiation sensitivity of leukemia cell line FBL3 and mouse melanoma B16F10. No effects have been found on the radiation sensitivity of those cells treated with MH before irradiation. The results also showed that MH mediated the effects on radiation sensitivity, in addition to increasing the oxygen tension. These results show different effects of MH on different cells: (i) AIMH exerts a protective effect on the normal hematopoietic stem cells, some leukemia cell lines A20, HL60, K562, and some neoplasma 3LL, LOVO. And MH exhibits a synthetic effect with anesthetic. (ii) MH enhances the radiation sensitivity of another leukemia and neoplasma cell lines FBL3, B16F10 and CT26.

In this study, the effects of inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway on human bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells (MNCs) obtained from 10 normal persons and 8 leukemia patients were examined. The results showed that the responses obviously varied individually. Among them, BM MNCs in 3 cases of leukemic patients were extremely sensitive, demonstrated by that > 90% cells were induced to undergo apoptosis within 24 h, but MNCs in 10 cases of normal persons showed resistance to the inhibition and no apoptosis was observed. Furthermore, Western blots revealed that the Bcl-2 expression was relatively high in the sensitive primary leukemia cells, and especially the cleavage of 26 ku Bcl-2 into a 22 ku fragment occurred during the induction of apoptosis. In contrast, the Bcl-2 expression was either undetectable or detectable but no cleavage of that above was observed in the cells insensitive to the inhibition of the pathway (including BM MNCs in normal persons). Together with the observations on the leukemic cell lines, these findings suggested the correlation of the specific cleavage of Bcl-2 into a shortened fragment with the sensitivity of cells to the inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which provides clues to the further understanding of the mechanisms of that dramatically different responses existing in different kinds of cells to the inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.",,"['Lan, Yu', 'Zhang, Xuemin', 'Yang, Pingdi', 'Hu, Meiru', 'Yu, Ming', 'Yang, Yi', 'Shen, Beifen']","['Lan Y', 'Zhang X', 'Yang P', 'Hu M', 'Yu M', 'Yang Y', 'Shen B']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Sci China C Life Sci,"Science in China.

DISC1 is located in several subcellular domains, such as the centrosome and the nucleus, and interacts with various proteins, including NudE-like (NUDEL/NDEL1) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)/CREB2. Nevertheless, a role for DISC1 in vivo remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we have generated a Drosophila model for examining normal functions of DISC1 in living organisms. DISC1 transgenic flies with preferential accumulation of exogenous human DISC1 in the nucleus display disturbance in sleep homeostasis, which has been reportedly associated with CREB signaling/CRE-mediated gene transcription.

Accumulating evidence indicates that the natural product gossypol and its derivatives can kill tumor cells by targeting antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members in such a manner as to trigger MOMP. However, due to the inherent complexity of the cellular apoptotic network, the precise mechanisms by which interactions between gossypol and individual BCL-2 family members lead to MOMP remain poorly understood. Here, we used simplified systems bearing physiological relevance to examine the impact of gossypol on the function of MCL-1, a key determinant for survival of various human malignancies that has become a highly attractive target for anticancer drug design. First, using a reconstituted liposomal system that recapitulates basic aspects of the BCL-2-regulated MOMP pathway, we demonstrate that MCL-1 inhibits BAX permeabilizing function via a ""dual-interaction"" mechanism, while submicromolar concentrations of gossypol reverse MCL-1-mediated inhibition of functional BAX activation. Solution-based studies showed that gossypol competes with BAX/BID BH3 ligands for binding to MCL-1 hydrophobic groove, thereby providing with a mechanistic explanation for how gossypol restores BAX permeabilizing function in the presence of MCL-1. By contrast, no evidence was found indicating that gossypol transforms MCL-1 into a BAX-like pore-forming molecule. Altogether, our findings validate MCL-1 as a direct target of gossypol, and highlight that making this antiapoptotic protein unable to inhibit BAX-driven MOMP may represent one important mechanism by which gossypol exerts its cytotoxic effect in selected cancer cells.",,"['Etxebarria, Aitor', 'Landeta, Olatz', 'Antonsson, Bruno', 'Basanez, Gorka']","['Etxebarria A', 'Landeta O', 'Antonsson B', 'Basanez G']","['Unidad de Biofisica (CSIC-UPV/EHU), Universidad del Pais Vasco/Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (UPV/EHU), P.O.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of oral mucositis in 169 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients treated according to different chemotherapeutic trials at the Darcy Vargas Children's Hospital from 1994 to 2005. Demographic data, clinical history, chemotherapeutic treatment and patients' follow-up were recorded. The association of oral mucositis with age, gender, leucocyte counts at diagnosis and treatment was assessed by the chi-squared test and multivariate regression analysis. Seventy-seven ALL patients (46%) developed oral mucositis during the treatment. Patient age (P = 0.33), gender (P = 0.08) and leucocyte counts at diagnosis (P = 0.34) showed no correlation with the occurrence of oral mucositis. Multivariate regression analysis showed a significant risk for oral mucositis (P = 0.009) for ALL patients treated according to the ALL-BFM-95 protocol. These results strongly suggest the greater stomatotoxic effect of the ALL-BFM-95 trial when compared with Brazilian trials.

CXC chemokines MIG, IP-10, and I-TAC act by binding to CXCR3 receptor on T-lymphocytes. We investigated the role of these chemokines and their receptor in patients with UC, CD, and normal controls (NC). METHODS: Chemokine expression and serum levels were examined in colonic biopsies from patients and NC using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HT-29 and Caco2 colonic epithelial cells were studied following in vitro stimulation with proinflammatory (Th1) and Th2-derived cytokines. CXCR3 receptor expression was assessed in CD3+ peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients and NC and in stimulated Jurkat leukaemia cells, using RT-PCR and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Full size CXCR3 mRNA (FS) expression was found in CD3+ PBL from controls and UC, but not from CD patients. In contrast, CD3+ PBL from CD patients showed a marked mRNA expression of the spliced variant CXCR3 (TV). This finding explains the high expression of CXCR3 on CD3+ PBL from CD patients in flow cytometry. Increased chemokine expression and production was found in colonic biopsies and serum from CD compared to UC patients and controls. Stimulation of epithelial cells with proinflammatory cytokines significantly induced chemokine production. The addition of Th2 cytokines had an inhibitory effect. Stimulation of Jurkat cells with cytokines and supernatant conditioned media from epithelial cells induced CXCR3TV expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that PBL from CD patients express a spliced variant of the CXCR3 receptor and suggest a role for the colonic epithelial cells in T-lymphocyte migration in intestinal inflammation.",,"['Manousou, Pinelopi', 'Kolios, George', 'Drygiannakis, Ioannis', 'Pyrovolaki, Katerina', 'Bourikas, Leonidas', 'Papadaki, Helen A', 'Kouroumalis, Elias']","['Manousou P', 'Kolios G', 'Drygiannakis I', 'Pyrovolaki K', 'Bourikas L', 'Papadaki HA', 'Kouroumalis E']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Faculty of medicine, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Australia,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,8607909,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Colon/*immunology/pathology', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn Disease/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*immunology/pathology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR3/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,2008/09/03 09:00,2009/04/10 09:00,['2008/09/03 09:00'],"['2008/09/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JGH5486 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1746.2008.05486.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2008 Dec;23(12):1823-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2008.05486.x.

Six weeks previously, an infected left mandibular cheek tooth was removed by oral extraction. On physical examination the patient was cachectic, lethargic, and weak. Abnormalities on the CBC included neutropenia, thrombocytosis, and severe nonregenerative, macrocytic, hypochromic anemia. Dysplastic nucleated erythrocytes and micromegakaryocytes were observed on the peripheral blood smear. Neutrophils, bands, and metamyelocytes appeared markedly toxic. Numerous blasts containing variable numbers of fine azurophilic granules were also observed. Based on their morphology, the cells were interpreted to be progranulocytes and myeloblasts, and a presumptive diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was made. The blast cells accounted for 60% of the nucleated cell population on bone marrow aspirates, further supporting a diagnosis of AML with multilineage dysplasia. Post mortem examination showed infiltration of the neoplastic cells into spleen, liver, kidney, and lymph nodes. Based on histologic findings, the morphologic diagnoses were disseminated myeloid neoplasia, chronic regionally extensive tooth root abscess, and membranous glomerulonephritis. The neoplastic cells were CD172a-positive on flow cytometry, chloroacetate esterase-positive by cytochemistry, and myeloperoxidase-positive by immunohistochemistry, confirming myeloid origin.

In this study we raised the question whether roscovitine (ROSC), an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) with increased selectivity towards CDK2, could be able to affect human leukemia HL-60 cells in which the p53 gene is inactivated and whether ROSC-induced effects could be additionally modulated by compounds of natural origin, especially by polyphenols e.g. RES. Exposure of HL-60 cells to ROSC for 24 h inhibited their proliferation. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that unlike MCF-7 cells, HL-60 cells were arrested in G(1) upon ROSC treatment. Furthermore, ROSC also induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. After treatment with 40 microM ROSC for 24 h the frequency of hypoploid cells representing cells undergoing apoptosis reached approximately 50%. In the next step the action of RES alone or in combination with ROSC was examined. Interestingly, synergistic effects were observed after combined treatment for 24 h and sequential post-incubation for 48 h in the presence of RES. Such combined treatment resulted in a marked reduction of the frequency of the S- and G(2)/M-phase cells and simultaneously increased the G(1) cell population up to 80% at a fourfold lower ROSC dose. Further analyses revealed that the combined treatment strongly activated caspase-3.

In almost all APL patients, the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha) gene on chromosome 17 is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) on chromosome 15, denoted as t(15;17)(q22;q12). All patients have the PML/RAR-alpha fusion transcript. Identification of this fusion transcript is important for both diagnosis and for detection of minimal residual disease. Overall, more than 80% of APL patients are curable using current strategies.

Among the regulators of hematopoiesis are two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, neurokinin-1 (NK1) and NK2, which partly encompass the communication between the neural and hematopoietic systems. This communication also involves a complex network of cytokines, and crosstalk between NK1 and NK2. Excessive activation of NK1 has been linked to leukemia. NK2 exerts negative effects on NK1. Previous studies with the hematopoietic progenitor cell line, K562 have identified activated p53 as a mediator of NK2 transcription, which correlated with cell proliferation. This study investigated the mechanism of NK-A mediated inhibition of cell proliferation. K562 was stimulated with 10 nM of NK-A, and the nuclear extracts were analyzed by Westernblots for cell cycle regulators. The studies showed decreases in the cell cycling activators, Cdk2 and Cyclin A, which correlated with increases in p21 and p53. The differentiation protein p19 was unchanged, suggesting that NK-A maintains K562 at cell cycle checkpoints, but does not have roles in differentiation. NK-A appears to regulate TGF-beta 1 production at the level of translation. Despite the production of TGF-beta 1, the activation of Smad 4 occurs by NK-A, via a non-canonical pathway, as indicated by an inhibitor of TGF-beta receptor activators, SB431542. TGF-beta 1 was needed to prevent exacerbated decrease in Cyclin A, but not Cdk2, indicating that it was its role might be limited to balancing the negative regulation of TGF-beta 1. In summary, NK-A enhances translation of TGF-beta 1 in K562 cells. NK-A suppressed cell cycle activators, and activated Smad 4 via a non-canonical pathway, independent of TGF-beta receptor. These findings are significant in the negative regulation of progenitor proliferation, with implications for hematopoiesis and its associated dysfunctions.",,"['Ricardo, Michael', 'Trzaska, Katarzyna A', 'Rameshwar, Pranela']","['Ricardo M', 'Trzaska KA', 'Rameshwar P']","['Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences-UMDNJ, NJ 07103, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Neuroimmunol,Journal of neuroimmunology,8109498,"['0 (4-(5-benzo(1,3)dioxol-5-yl-4-pyridin-2-yl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)benzamide)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Dioxoles)', '0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '0 (SMAD4 protein, human)', '0 (Smad4 Protein)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '86933-74-6 (Neurokinin A)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dioxoles/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Neurokinin A/*pharmacology', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/*pharmacology', 'Smad4 Protein/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/biosynthesis']",,,2008/09/02 09:00,2009/04/10 09:00,['2008/09/02 09:00'],"['2008/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-5728(08)00301-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jneuroim.2008.07.013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroimmunol. 2008 Nov 15;204(1-2):85-91. doi: 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2008.07.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined their anticancer activity and addressed the cellular mechanisms involved. Heterocyclic organobismuth compounds showed anticancer activities in various human cancer cell lines. These compounds have particularly potent anticancer activities against leukemia cell lines. One of them, bi-chlorodibenzo [c,f][1,5] thiabismocine (compound 3), inhibited the growth of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 at a concentration of 0.22 microM. Low concentrations of compound 3 (0.22-0.44 microM) induced apoptosis, whereas at a higher concentration (>1.1 microM) it causes acute necrosis. During the apoptosis, caspase-3, -8, and -9 were activated but caspase-12 was not. A broad caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk), and caspase-3 (z-DEVD-fmk) and caspase-9 (z-LEHD-fmk) inhibitors suppressed the compound 3-induced apoptosis, but a caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk) was less effective, suggesting that the caspase-8 activity only partially participates in the apoptosis. In the apoptotic cells, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria to cytosol and a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) was detected. Compound 3-induced apoptosis was associated with enhanced generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pretreatment of the cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine or catalase suppressed the apoptosis. On the other hand, buthionine sulfoximine enhanced the compound 3-induced collapse of DeltaPsi(m) and apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that compound 3 is a potent inducer of apoptosis, triggering a caspase-3-mediated mechanism via the generation of ROS and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, suggesting a potential mechanism for the anticancer activity of compound 3.",,"['Iuchi, Katsuya', 'Hatano, Yukichi', 'Yagura, Tatsuo']","['Iuchi K', 'Hatano Y', 'Yagura T']","['Department of Bioscience, Faculty of Science and Technology, Kwansei Gakuin University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bismuth/*pharmacology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacology']",,,2008/09/02 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/09/02 09:00'],"['2008/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(08)00528-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.07.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Oct 15;76(8):974-86. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.07.038.

Recent investigations into the biology of minimal residual disease indicate that many early relapses derive from residual cells present at first diagnosis, but some late relapses might represent new mutations in leukaemic cells not eliminated by conventional therapy. Treatment of marrow relapse involves higher doses and more intensive schedules of the drugs used for initial therapy with or without haemopoietic stem cell transplantation. In most reports, transplantation is better than continuation chemotherapy in early marrow relapse, but its role in later relapse is less clear. Current therapy cures 10% of patients with early marrow relapses and 50% of those with late relapses, but outcomes have changed little in the past two decades.

It has become evident that there is a role of donor-derived 'alloreactive' NK cells in eradicating acute myeloid (and now also lymphoid) leukemias in the T-cell-depleted haploidentical hemopoietic stem cell transplantation setting. The key role played also in preventing graft rejection and graft versus host disease renders alloreactive NK cells an ideal tool for successful haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",,"['Moretta, Alessandro', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Moretta, Lorenzo']","['Moretta A', 'Locatelli F', 'Moretta L']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genova, Genova, Italy. alemoret@unige.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft Rejection/immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Isoantigens/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, KIR/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2008/09/02 09:00,2008/11/04 09:00,['2008/09/02 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['IMR651 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00651.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2008 Aug;224:58-69. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00651.x.,,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We focus on the setting of data from a single clinical trial. In this article, we consider a framework in which the surrogate must occur before the true endpoint. This suggests viewing the surrogate and true endpoints as semicompeting risks data; this approach is new to the literature on surrogate endpoints and leads to an asymmetrical treatment of the surrogate and true endpoints. However, such a data structure also conceptually complicates many of the previously considered measures of surrogacy in the literature. We propose novel estimation and inferential procedures for the relative effect and adjusted association quantities proposed by Buyse and Molenberghs (1998, Biometrics 54, 1014-1029). The proposed methodology is illustrated with application to simulated data, as well as to data from a leukemia study.",,"['Ghosh, Debashis']",['Ghosh D'],"['Departments of Statistics and Public Health Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA. ghoshd@psu.edu']",['eng'],"['P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129102-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 CA46592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Biometry/*methods', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Computer Simulation', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', '*Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Models, Statistical', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC2752047,['NIHMS131748'],2008/09/02 09:00,2009/09/03 06:00,['2008/09/02 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['BIOM1109 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1541-0420.2008.01109.x [doi]']",ppublish,Biometrics. 2009 Jun;65(2):521-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2008.01109.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten responses were obtained after GOCYT induction, including complete remission (CR) or CR without complete recovery of platelets (CRp) in six patients (35%).

The resulting fusion gene product, BCR-ABL, was shown to be the causative agent of the disease. CML has an incidence of around 1-2 cases per 100,000; in Australia, there are probably more than 200 new cases per year and more than 1300 prevalent cases. Treatment of CML with imatinib has been a powerful vindication of the concept of rational, gene-targeted drug design. Five-year published experience with imatinib at 400 mg orally daily demonstrates 89% overall survival and an estimated 93% freedom from disease progression. Adverse effects are mostly mild and transient. Higher doses of imatinib may be more efficacious and will be studied in upcoming clinical trials in Australia; however, imatinib is almost certainly not curative. Up to 28% of patients may have to stop imatinib because of intolerance or disease resistance, mostly due to point mutations of BCR-ABL. In this situation, many patients will respond to second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Management of CML patients should involve close monitoring, especially in the first 2 years, with regular cytogenetics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to optimise response and identify suboptimal responders as early as possible.

However, primary and secondary resistance have frequently been reported, particularly in patients with advanced-stage disease. Point mutations within the Abl kinase domain that interfere with imatinib binding are the most critical cause of imatinib resistance. In order to override this resistance, several second generation ATP-competitive Abl TKIs including dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and INNO-406 have been developed. Despite promising clinical results from these novel Abl TKIs for most mutations, the frequently observed mutant T315I is not effectively targeted by any of these agents. Thus, identification of novel agents and the development of new strategies for the effective treatment of CML patients with the T315I mutation are important and challenging tasks. In this review, the current status of novel agents for CML treatment is overviewed as follows: pathogenesis and features of CML; imatinib and second-generation Abl TKIs; why Abl TKIs are not effective against T315I; and novel agents that may override the T315I mutation.",,"['Tanaka, Ruriko', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Tanaka R', 'Kimura S']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine & Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawahara Sakyo-ku Kyoto 606-8507, Japan. ruri@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",,,2008/09/02 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/02 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1586/14737140.8.9.1387 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2008 Sep;8(9):1387-98. doi: 10.1586/14737140.8.9.1387.,,105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although missing a DNA-binding domain, SHP heterodimerizes with the ligand-binding domains of other nuclear receptors to repress their abilities to induce or inhibit gene expression. 3-Cl-AHPC analogues having the 1-adamantyl and phenolic hydroxyl pharmacophoric elements replaced with isosteric groups were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their inhibition of proliferation and induction of human cancer cell apoptosis.

Recent data have shown that a PKC inhibitor, enzastaurin, has antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in a large panel of human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs). In order to further characterise the effect of enzastaurin in MM, we performed gene expression profiling of enzastaurin-treated KMS-26 cell line. We identified 62 upregulated and 32 downregulated genes that are mainly involved in cellular adhesion (CXCL12, CXCR4), apoptosis (CTSB, TRAF5, BCL2L1), cell proliferation (IGF1, GADD45A, BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), CDC20), transcription regulation (MYC, MX11, IRF4), immune and defence responses. Subsequent validation by Western blotting of selected genes in four enzastaurin-treated HMCLs was consistent with our microarray analysis. Our data indicate that enzastaurin may affect important processes involved in the proliferation and survival of malignant plasma cells as well as in their interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment and provide a preclinical rationale for the potential role of this drug in the treatment of MM.","['Copyright 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Verdelli, Donata', 'Nobili, Lucia', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Intini, Daniela', 'Cosenza, Maria', 'Civallero, Monica', 'Bertacchini, Jessika', 'Deliliers, Giorgio Lambertenghi', 'Sacchi, Stefano', 'Lombardi, Luigia', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Verdelli D', 'Nobili L', 'Todoerti K', 'Intini D', 'Cosenza M', 'Civallero M', 'Bertacchini J', 'Deliliers GL', 'Sacchi S', 'Lombardi L', 'Neri A']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Leukemia Study Center, University of Milano, and O.U.

However, the discovery of biologic predictors of a high risk of disease progression, together with the development of newer, more targeted therapies, could change this paradigm. In this phase 2 study, the authors tested the safety and efficacy of early treatment for patients with high-risk CLL using alemtuzumab and rituximab. METHODS: Patients were eligible for treatment if they were 1) previously untreated, 2) had no National Cancer Institute-Working Group 1996 criteria for treatment, and 3) had at least 1 marker of high-risk disease 17p13-, 11q22-, or a combination of unmutated IgVH and CD38+/ZAP70+). Treatment consisted of subcutaneous alemtuzumab (initial dose escalation followed by 30 mg on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 4 weeks) and intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m(2) per week x4 doses). All patients received Pneumocystis pneumonia and herpes virus prophylaxis and were monitored for cytomegalovirus reactivation. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 30 patients (90%) responded to therapy with 11 (37%) complete responses (CRs). Five patients (17%) patients who had a CR had no detectable minimal residual disease. The median response duration was 14.4 months, and only 9 patients required retreatment for progressive disease at the time of the current report (median follow-up, 17.6 months). Study patients had a significantly longer time from diagnosis to first treatment for CLL according to conventional indications than a comparison cohort with similar biologic risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The therapy regimen used was safe and effective for early treatment of patients with high-risk CLL. Further studies will be required to determine whether this early treatment strategy decreases morbidity and mortality for high-risk CLL.",['(c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],"['Zent, Clive S', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Tschumper, Renee C', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Bowen, Deborah A', 'Secreto, Charla R', 'Laplant, Betsy R', 'Kabat, Brian F', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Zent CS', 'Call TG', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Tschumper RC', 'Jelinek DF', 'Bowen DA', 'Secreto CR', 'Laplant BR', 'Kabat BF', 'Kay NE']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. zent.clive@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA95241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk', 'Rituximab', 'Time']",PMC2849723,['NIHMS70712'],2008/09/02 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/09/02 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23824 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Oct 15;113(8):2110-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23824.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using advanced Raman microspectroscopic technique, we selected T Leukemia cells (Jurkat) as the materials and obtained simultaneously conformation information of various biomolecules inside the whole living cells. By comparing the Raman microspectroscopic spectra of single and adhesive cancer cells, we found for the first time that when cells adhered, the conformation of the biomolecules (DNA, protein, carbohydrates and lipids) inside the cells had different changes: (i) the backbone of double-stranded DNA maintained orderly B-form or modified B-form conformation, whereas the groups of its deoxyribose and bases were modified; (ii) the conformational changes of the main chain and the side chain in the protein were obviously variant. The lines intensity belonging to alpha-helix and beta-sheet decreased, while that of beta-turn increased. Tyrosine and tryptophane residues of the protein changed from ""buried state"" to ""exposed state""; the lines intensity of its sulfhydryl group also increased; the conformation of its disulfide bond changed from two kinds to three kinds. These facts suggest that the cells adhesion causes changes in H-bonds organization of the main chain and environment of the side chain in the protein; (iii) the groups of the carbohydrates were also modified simultaneously; (iv) the conformation of the lipids bilayers of the membranes changed obviously; the order parameter for lateral interaction between chains decreased gradually with the increase of number of the adhesive cells.

Low-dose interleukin (IL) 2/IL-15 and TKD increase the expression density of activatory (NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, CD94/NKG2C) and inhibitory (CD94/NKG2A) receptors on NK cells. Concomitantly, IL-2/TKD treatment enhances the cytotoxicity of NK cells (as reflected by their secretion of granzyme B) against Hsp70 membrane-positive and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-E membrane-negative (Hsp70(+)/HLA-E(-)) CX(+) and K562 cells. However, it had no effect on the responsiveness to Hsp70(-)/HLA-E(-) CX(-) cells over that induced by IL-2 alone. The cytotoxicity of IL-2/TKD-activated, purified NK cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells against Hsp70(+)/HLA-E(+) leukemic blasts was weaker than that against Hsp70(+)/HLA-E(-) K562 cells. Hsp70-blocking and HLA-E transfection experiments confirmed membrane-bound Hsp70 as being a recognition/activatory ligand for NK cells, as cytotoxicity was reduced by the presence of the anti-Hsp70 monoclonal antibody cmHsp70.2 and by inhibiting Hsp70 synthesis using short interference ribonucleic acid. HLA-E was confirmed as an inhibitory ligand, as the extent of NK cell-mediated lysis of K562 cell populations that had been transfected with HLA-E(R) or HLA-E(G) alleles was dependent on the proportion of HLA-E-expressing cells. These findings indicate that Hsp70 (as an activatory molecule) and HLA-E (as an inhibitory ligand) expression influence the susceptibility of leukemic cells to the cytolytic activities of cytokine/TKD-activated NK cells.",,"['Stangl, Stefan', 'Gross, Catharina', 'Pockley, Alan G', 'Asea, Alexzander A', 'Multhoff, Gabriele']","['Stangl S', 'Gross C', 'Pockley AG', 'Asea AA', 'Multhoff G']","['Department of Radiotherapy/ Radiooncology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Ismaningerstrasse 22, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-E antigen)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenocarcinoma/immunology/pathology', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'Transfection']",PMC2673894,,2008/09/02 09:00,2009/10/22 06:00,['2008/09/02 09:00'],"['2007/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/22 06:00 [medline]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12192-007-0008-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2008 Summer;13(2):221-30. doi: 10.1007/s12192-007-0008-y.

PTPN11, encoding SHP-2, is the first identified gene for Noonan syndrome and also the first identified proto-oncogene that encodes a tyrosine phosphatase. This somatic mutation has ever been reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Furthermore, the functional analysis of this mutant SHP-2 has shown it to have enhanced phosphatase activity.

Since then, increasing evidence has demonstrated a number of structural and functional differences between Notch3 and both Notch1 and Notch2, which exhibit the highest structural similarity among the four mammalian Notch receptors. Possibly due to its more restricted tissue distribution, targeted deletion of murine Notch3 does not lead to embryonic lethality as is observed with targeted deletion of Notch1 and Notch2. However, genetic mutation, amplification and deregulated expression of Notch3 have been correlated with the disruption of cell differentiation in transgenic mice and to development of diseases in mice and humans.

In this study, we generated a novel murine anti-Tn IgG1 monoclonal antibody, KM3413, by immunization of mucins purified from a culture supernatant of LS180: a human colon cancer cell line. The binding of KM3413 was detected against consecutive Tn-antigens (Tn3 and Tn2), but not against monovalent antigens (Tn1). The affinity (K(D)) of KM3413 was determined to be about 10(-7) M with BIAcore. Cross-reactivity against type-A blood antigen, which shares a sugar residue, alpha-linked GalNAc, with Tn-antigen, was not detected. Next, we generated mouse-human chimeric IgG1 of KM3413 (cKM3413) and evaluated its anti-tumor activities against Jurkat: a human T-lymphoid leukemia cell line. In vitro assay revealed that cKM3413 induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and direct killing activity with cross-link antibody. Furthermore, treatment of cKM3413 (1 or 10 mg/kg) showed significantly better survival of Jurkat-inoculated C.B-17/lcr-scid Jcl mice compared with controls using PBS treatment (p<0.001).

MLC1 is an oligomeric plasma membrane (PM) protein of unknown function expressed mainly in glial cells and neurons. Most disease-causing missense mutations dramatically reduced the total and PM MLC1 expression levels in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. The impaired expression of the mutants was verified in primary cultures of rat astrocytes, as well as human monocytes, cell types that endogenously express MLC1, demonstrating the relevance of the tissue culture models. Using a combination of biochemical, pharmacological and imaging methods, we also demonstrated that increased endoplasmatic reticulum-associated degradation and endo-lysosomal-associated degradation can contribute to the cell surface expression defect of the mutants. Based on these results, we suggest that MLC1 mutations reduce protein levels in vivo. Since the expression defect of the mutants could be rescued by exposing the mutant-protein expressing cells to low temperature and glycerol, a chemical chaperone, we propose that MLC belongs to the class of conformational diseases. Therefore, we suggest the use of pharmacological strategies that improve MLC1 expression to treat MLC patients.",,"['Duarri, Anna', 'Teijido, Oscar', 'Lopez-Hernandez, Tania', 'Scheper, Gert C', 'Barriere, Herve', 'Boor, Ilja', 'Aguado, Fernando', 'Zorzano, Antonio', 'Palacin, Manuel', 'Martinez, Albert', 'Lukacs, Gergely L', 'van der Knaap, Marjo S', 'Nunes, Virginia', 'Estevez, Raul']","['Duarri A', 'Teijido O', 'Lopez-Hernandez T', 'Scheper GC', 'Barriere H', 'Boor I', 'Aguado F', 'Zorzano A', 'Palacin M', 'Martinez A', 'Lukacs GL', 'van der Knaap MS', 'Nunes V', 'Estevez R']","[""CGMM-IDIBELL, l'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (MLC1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'Brain Diseases/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Central Nervous System Cysts/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Protein Folding', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",PMC2581428,,2008/09/02 09:00,2008/12/30 09:00,['2008/09/02 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['ddn269 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddn269 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2008 Dec 1;17(23):3728-39. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddn269.

Here, we report our discovery of a novel CREB3L2-PPARgamma fusion mutation in thyroid carcinoma with t(3;7)(p25;q34), showing that a family of somatic PPARgamma fusion mutations exist in thyroid cancer. The CREB3L2-PPARgamma fusion encodes a CREB3L2-PPARgamma fusion protein that is composed of the transactivation domain of CREB3L2 and all functional domains of PPARgamma1. CREB3L2-PPARgamma was detected in <3% of thyroid follicular carcinomas. Engineered overexpression of CREB3L2-PPARgamma induced proliferation by 40% to 45% in primary human thyroid cells, consistent with a dominant oncogenic mechanism. Wild-type CREB3L2 was expressed in the thyroid as a bZIP transcription factor with a transmembrane domain that has flanking S1P and S2P proteolytic cleavage sites. Native CREB3L2 was cleaved to nuclear CREB3L2 by regulated intramembrane proteolysis in normal thyroid cells that expressed the S1P and S2P proteases. Nuclear CREB3L2 stimulated transcription 8-fold from the EVX1 cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element in the absence of cAMP, whereas CREB3L2-PPARgamma inhibited transcription 6-fold from EVX1 in the same experiments. CREB3L2-PPARgamma also inhibited 4-fold the expression of thyroglobulin, a native cAMP-responsive gene, in primary thyroid cells treated with thyroid-stimulating hormone.

Here, we show that FTKs stimulate the formation of reactive oxygen species and DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) both in hematopoietic cell lines and in CD34(+) leukemic stem/progenitor cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Single-strand annealing (SSA) represents a relatively rare but very unfaithful DSB repair mechanism causing chromosomal aberrations. Using a specific reporter cassette integrated into genomic DNA, we found that BCR/ABL and other FTKs stimulated SSA activity. Imatinib-mediated inhibition of BCR/ABL abrogated this effect, implicating a kinase-dependent mechanism. Y253F, E255K, T315I, and H396P mutants of BCR/ABL that confer imatinib resistance also stimulated SSA. Increased expression of either nonmutated or mutated BCR/ABL kinase, as is typical of blast phase cells and very primitive chronic phase CML cells, was associated with higher SSA activity. BCR/ABL-mediated stimulation of SSA was accompanied by enhanced nuclear colocalization of RAD52 and ERCC1, which play a key role in the repair. Taken together, these findings suggest a role of FTKs in causing disease progression in MPDs by inducing chromosomal instability through the production of DSBs and stimulation of SSA repair.",,"['Cramer, Kimberly', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, Margaret', 'Koptyra, Mateusz', 'Slupianek, Artur', 'Penserga, Emir Tyrone P', 'Eaves, Connie J', 'Aulitzky, Walter', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Cramer K', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Koptyra M', 'Slupianek A', 'Penserga ET', 'Eaves CJ', 'Aulitzky W', 'Skorski T']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA089052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089052-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA89052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 DK059644/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5R25DK059644-05/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 DK059644-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Primers', '*DNA Repair', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC2531069,['NIHMS59486'],2008/09/02 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/09/02 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/17/6884 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1101 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Sep 1;68(17):6884-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sociodemographic data, including education, was reported by the patient at the time of clinical trial accrual. Cox proportional hazards model stratified by treatment arm/study was used to examine the effect of education on survival after adjustment for known prognostic factors. RESULTS: The patient population included 1,177 patients diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; stage III or IV) and 400 patients diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC; extensive or limited). Patients with less than an eighth grade education (13% of patients) were significantly more likely to be male, nonwhite, and older; have a performance status (PS) of 1 or 2; and have chest pain. Significant predictors of poor survival in the final model included male sex, PS of 1 or 2, dyspnea, weight loss, liver or bone metastases, unmarried, presence of adrenal metastases and high alkaline phosphatase levels among patients with NSCLC, and high WBC levels among patients with advanced disease. Education was not predictive of survival. CONCLUSION: The physical condition of patients with low education who enroll onto clinical trials is worse than patients with higher education. Once enrolled onto a clinical trial, education does not affect the survival of patients with SCLC or stage III or IV NSCLC.

However, the influence of body mass index (BMI) on the outcome of patients with established colon cancer remains uncertain. Moreover, the impact of change in body habitus after diagnosis has not been studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study of 1,053 patients who had stage III colon cancer and who were enrolled on a randomized trial of adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients reported on height and weight during and 6 months after adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were observed for cancer recurrence or death. RESULTS: In this cohort of patients with stage III cancer, 35% of patients were overweight (BMI, 25 to 29.9 kg/m(2)), and 34% were obese (BMI >or= 30 kg/m(2)). Increased BMI was not significantly associated with a higher risk of colon cancer recurrence or death (P trend = .54). Compared with normal-weight patients (BMI, 21 to 24.9 kg/m(2)), the multivariate hazard ratio for disease-free survival was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.40) for patients with class I obesity (BMI, 30 to 34.9 kg/m(2)) and 1.24 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.83) for those with class II to III obesity (BMI >or= 35 kg/m(2)) after analysis was adjusted for tumor-related prognostic factors, physical activity, tobacco history, performance status, age, and sex. Similarly, after analysis was controlled for BMI, weight change (either loss or gain) during the time period between ongoing adjuvant therapy and 6 months after completion of therapy did not significantly impact on cancer recurrence and/or mortality.

Recombinant human LN-511 alone was sufficient to enable self-renewal of mouse ES cells for up to 169 days (31 passages). Cells cultured on LN-511 maintained expression of pluripotency markers, such as Oct4, Sox2, Tert, UTF1, and Nanog, during the entire period, and cells cultured for 95 days (17 passages) were used to generate chimeric mice. LN-332 enabled ES cells proliferation but not pluripotency. In contrast, under the same conditions LN-111, Matrigel, and gelatin caused rapid differentiation, whereas LN-411 and poly-d-lysine did not support survival. ES cells formed a thin monolayer on LN-511 that differed strikingly from typical dense cluster ES cell morphology. However, expression of pluripotency markers was not affected by morphological changes. The effect was achieved at low ES cell density (<200 cell/mm(2)). The ability of LN-511 and LN-332 to support ES cell proliferation correlated with increased cell contact area with those adhesive substrata. ES cells interacted with LN-511 via beta1-integrins, mostly alpha6beta1 and alphaVbeta1. This is the first demonstration that certain extracellular matrix molecules can support ES cell self-renewal in the absence of differentiation inhibitors and at low cell density. The results suggest that recombinant laminin isoforms can provide a basis for defined surface coating systems for feeder-free maintenance of undifferentiated mammalian ES cells in vitro.

METHODS: As2O3 was used in a dose of 0.5 micromol/L, 2.0 micromol/L and 5.0 micromol/L, respectively, and BSO was used in a dose of 100 micromol/L in the culture of multidrug-resistant human leukenic K562/ADM cells. The cell proliferation activity was assessed with MTT assay. The cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry using Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) staining. Intracellular GSH content was measured using glutathione assay kit by spectrophotometry. RESULTS: After the GSH contents were reduced by the combination of arsenic in clinic dose (0.5, 2 micromol/L) and BSO (100 micromol/L), respectively, the K562/ADM cell proliferation activity was obviously inhibited and the cell apoptosis-inducing effect was advanced in 24 hours. In 48 and 72 hours, the effect of the combination group (clinic dose arsenic group) was significantly stronger than that of clinic dose arsenic alone group and the high dose arsenic alone group. CONCLUSION: The cell apoptosis-inducing effect of arsenic in combination of BSO on multidrug resistant human leukemia K562/ADM cells is significantly enhanced in comparison with that of arsenic alone. The reduction of intracellular glutathione content is closely correlated with this apoptosis-enhancing effect.",,"['Wang, Tao', 'Ma, Liang-Ming', 'Zhang, Hua-Ping', 'Wang, Hong-Wei', 'Yang, Lin-Hua', 'Qiao, Zhen-Hua']","['Wang T', 'Ma LM', 'Zhang HP', 'Wang HW', 'Yang LH', 'Qiao ZH']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oxides/*pharmacology']",,,2008/09/02 09:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2008/09/02 09:00'],"['2008/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2008/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2008 Mar;30(3):188-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clofarabine is a nucleoside analog with activity in adult AML. Combinations with cytarabine in AML are feasible and effective. Idarubicin is another active AML drug, which has not yet been tested with clofarabine. METHODS: The authors therefore designed a phase I study of clofarabine +/- cytarabine, plus idarubicin. Patients with primary refractory or first-relapse AML were assigned to either clofarabine plus idarubicin (CI) if previously exposed to cytarabine with a response lasting <12 months, or clofarabine and idarubicin plus cytarabine (CIA) for responses > or = 12 months, or if never exposed to cytarabine. A standard ""3 + 3"" phase 1 design was followed to define maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Forty-four patients were treated (23 CI; 21 CIA). RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicities were hyperbilirubinemia and hepatic transaminase elevations for CI-treated patients in addition to mucositis and diarrhea for CIA-treated patients. MTD for CI was clofarabine 22.5 mg/m(2) intravenously daily x 5 and idarubicin 10 mg/m(2) intravenously daily x 3. MTD for CIA was clofarabine 22.5 mg/m(2) intravenously x 5, idarubicin 6 mg/m(2) intravenously x 3, and cytarabine 0.75 g/m(2) intravenously x 5 days.

With intact p19(ARF), only hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can be directly transformed by BCR/ABL expression. In a p19(ARF)-null genetic background expression of the BCR/ABL fusion protein renders functionally defined HSCs, common lymphoid progenitors (CLP), and precursor B-lymphocytes competent to generate leukemia stem cells. Furthermore, we show that leukemias arising from p19(ARF)-null HSC versus pro-B cells differ biologically, including relative response to drug insult. Our observations elucidate a unique mechanism by which heterogeneity arises in tumor populations harboring identical genetic lesions and show that activity of p19(ARF) profoundly influences the nature of tumor-initiating cells during BCR/ABL-mediated leukemogenesis.",,"['Wang, Pin-Yi', 'Young, Fay', 'Chen, Chun-Yu', 'Stevens, Brett M', 'Neering, Sarah J', 'Rossi, Randall M', 'Bushnell, Timothy', 'Kuzin, Igor', 'Heinrich, David', 'Bottaro, Andrea', 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Wang PY', 'Young F', 'Chen CY', 'Stevens BM', 'Neering SJ', 'Rossi RM', 'Bushnell T', 'Kuzin I', 'Heinrich D', 'Bottaro A', 'Jordan CT']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA122206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA107355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA122206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-CA107355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",PMC2581986,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51873-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-02-142190 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Nov 15;112(10):4184-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-02-142190.

This review seeks to identify the extent of the abnormality, its cause, clinical significance and any possible remedy. SOURCES OF DATA: TJH has studied CLL for the past 40 years and has scanned or read every paper he could find published on the topic since 1970 and most of those of historical importance published before that date. He has read around the subject, covering relevant articles on immunology, cell biology, oncology and genetics. Furthermore, he has attended most major meetings dealing with CLL in this time and has written many reviews to update the state of knowledge about the topic. He receives weekly updates of papers published on CLL from PubMed and Science Direct with the keywords 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia'. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The immunodeficiency chiefly manifests as hypogammaglobulinaemia but involves all elements of the immune system. It is caused by the interpolation of tumour cells among immunological cells and mediated by bi-directional cell contact and secretion of cytokines, which both sustain and invigorate the tumour and suppress immunity. CLL treatment generally makes the immunodeficiency worse. Intravenous immunoglobulin is clinically effective but not cost-effective, while prophylactic antibiotics are useful in appropriate circumstances. Vaccination against infectious disease is usually ineffective. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Exactly how the presence of tumour cells in the immune organs renders the patient immunodeficient is controversial as is the clinical significance of minor degrees of immunodeficiency in early or indolent cases. The immunosuppressive effect of most forms of treatment is agreed, but how much this should figure in the choice of treatment is a matter of dispute. GROWING POINTS: The study of tumour-stromal interactions is an area of intense research. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: There has been little done to develop better vaccination strategies in patients with CLL, and although effective antimicrobials have been developed to protect against opportunistic infections, many are both expensive and inconvenient. More work is necessary to define precisely which patients should be offered them and when.",,"['Hamblin, A D', 'Hamblin, T J']","['Hamblin AD', 'Hamblin TJ']","['Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br Med Bull,British medical bulletin,0376542,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinemia/immunology/therapy', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2009/01/09 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['ldn034 [pii]', '10.1093/bmb/ldn034 [doi]']",ppublish,Br Med Bull. 2008;87:49-62. doi: 10.1093/bmb/ldn034.

In CNS leukemia, innovative treatments and alternative delivery techniques are, however, warranted. Outcome in such patients is a reflection of an aggressive systemic and CNS-directed therapy. However, CNS toxicity represents the dose-limiting side effect of treatment. With effective CNS prophylaxis including intrathecal chemotherapy, high-dose systemic administration of certain agents and cranial irradiation, most adults with ALL without CNS disease at diagnosis may remain free of CNS leukemia.

The role of protein phosphatases is less understood in this process, especially concerning the regulatory/targeting subunits involved. It is shown that pretreatment of THP-1 leukemic cells with calyculin-A (CL-A), a cell-permeable phosphatase inhibitor, attenuated daunorubicin (DNR)-induced cell death and resulted in increased pRb phosphorylation and protection against proteolytic degradation. Protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunits (PP1c) dephosphorylated the phosphorylated C-terminal fragment of pRb (pRb-C) slightly, whereas when PP1c was complexed to myosin phosphatase target subunit-1 (MYPT1) in myosin phosphatase (MP) holoenzyme dephosphorylation was stimulated. The pRb-C phosphatase activity of MP was partially inhibited by anti-MYPT1(1-296) implicating MYPT1 in targeting PP1c to pRb. MYPT1 became phosphorylated on both inhibitory sites (Thr695 and Thr850) upon CL-A treatment of THP-1 cells resulting in the inhibition of MP activity. MYPT1 and pRb coprecipitated from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with either anti-MYPT1 or anti-pRb antibodies implying that pRb-MYPT1 interaction occurred at cellular levels. Surface plasmon resonance-based experiments confirmed binding of pRb-C to both PP1c and MYPT1. In control and DNR-treated cells, MYPT1 and pRb were predominantly localized in the nucleus exhibiting partial colocalization as revealed by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. Upon CL-A treatment, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of both MYPT1 and pRb, but not PP1c, was observed. The above data imply that MP, with the targeting role of MYPT1, may regulate the phosphorylation level of pRb, thereby it may be involved in the control of cell cycle progression and in the mediation of chemoresistance of leukemic cells.",,"['Kiss, Andrea', 'Lontay, Beata', 'Becsi, Balint', 'Markasz, Laszlo', 'Olah, Eva', 'Gergely, Pal', 'Erdodi, Ferenc']","['Kiss A', 'Lontay B', 'Becsi B', 'Markasz L', 'Olah E', 'Gergely P', 'Erdodi F']","['Department of Medical Chemistry, University of Debrecen Medical and Health Science Center, Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt. 98, Hungary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Marine Toxins)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '7D07U14TK3 (calyculin A)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.53 (Myosin-Light-Chain Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Marine Toxins', 'Myosin-Light-Chain Phosphatase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oxazoles/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Phosphatase 1/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/drug effects/enzymology', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(08)00224-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.07.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2008 Nov;20(11):2059-70. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.07.018.

Since hIP can utilize G(s) and G(q) proteins for signal transduction and that both G proteins can induce STAT3 phosphorylation and activation via complex signaling networks, we sought to determine if one of them is predominant in mediating the hIP signal. Stimulation of STAT3 Tyr(705) and Ser(727) phosphorylations by the IP-specific agonist, cicaprost, was sensitive to inhibition of protein kinase A, phospholipase Cbeta, protein kinase C, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and Janus kinase 2/3. Unlike Galpha(16)-mediated regulation of STAT3 in the same cells, cicaprost-induced STAT3 Tyr(705) phosphorylation was resistant to inhibition of Src and MEK while STAT3 Ser(727) phosphorylation distinctly required phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. This unique inhibitor-sensitivity pattern of STAT3 phosphorylation was reproduced in HEL cells by stimulating the G(16)-coupled C5a receptor in the presence of dibutyryl-cAMP, suggesting that the change in inhibitor-sensitivity was due to activation of the G(s) pathway. This postulation was confirmed by expressing constitutively active Galpha(16)QL and Galpha(s)QL in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and the inhibitor-sensitivity of Galpha(16)QL-induced STAT3 phosphorylations could be converted by the mere presence of Galpha(s)QL to resemble that obtained with cicaprost in HEL cells. In addition, the restoration of the Galpha(16)-mediated inhibitor-sensitivity upon cicaprost induction in Galpha(s)-knocked down HEL cells again verified the pivotal role of G(s) signal. Taken together, our observations illustrate that co-stimulation of G(s) and G(q) can result in the fine-tuning of STAT3 activation status, and this may provide the basis for cell type-specific responses following activation of hIP.",,"['Lo, Rico K H', 'Liu, Andrew M F', 'Wise, Helen', 'Wong, Yung H']","['Lo RK', 'Liu AM', 'Wise H', 'Wong YH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Neuroscience Center, and Biotechnology Research Institute, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Epoprostenol)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (G protein alpha 16)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'NE94J8CAMD (cicaprost)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Epoprostenol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Epoprostenol/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(08)00228-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2008 Nov;20(11):2095-106. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.08.003.

We have developed a mathematical model of pathogen transmission by a defined insect population to evaluate the importance of mechanical transmission. Based on a series of experiments aimed at demonstrating mechanical transmission of African trypanosomes by tabanids, the main parameters of the model were either quantified (host parasitaemia, mean individual insect burden, initial prevalence of infection) or estimated (unknown parameters). This model allows us to simulate the evolution of pathogen prevalence under various predictive circumstances, including control measures and could be used to assess the risk of mechanical transmission under field conditions. If adjustments of parameters are provided, this model could be generalized to other pathogenic agents present in the blood of their hosts (Bovine Leukemia virus, Anaplasma, etc.) or other biting insects such as biting muscids (stomoxyines) and hippoboscids.",,"['Desquesnes, Marc', 'Biteau-Coroller, Fabienne', 'Bouyer, Jeremy', 'Dia, Mamadou Lamine', 'Foil, Lane']","['Desquesnes M', 'Biteau-Coroller F', 'Bouyer J', 'Dia ML', 'Foil L']","['Cirad, UR Trypanosomes, Montpellier, France. marc.desquesnes@cirad.fr']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Int J Parasitol,International journal for parasitology,0314024,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/epidemiology/parasitology/*transmission', 'Computer Simulation', 'Diptera/*parasitology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Insect Bites and Stings', 'Insect Vectors/parasitology', '*Models, Biological', 'Parasitemia/parasitology/transmission', 'Prevalence', 'Time Factors', 'Trypanosoma congolense/*physiology', 'Trypanosoma vivax/*physiology', 'Trypanosomiasis, African/epidemiology/parasitology/transmission/*veterinary']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2010/04/03 06:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0020-7519(08)00272-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpara.2008.07.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Parasitol. 2009 Feb;39(3):333-46. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpara.2008.07.004.

Recently, we found that cotylenin A and rapamycin effectively inhibited the proliferation of several human breast cancer cell lines including MCF-7. Herein, we demonstrate that cotylenin A and rapamycin rapidly and markedly induced the cyclin G2 gene expression in several cancer cells including MCF-7 cells. The growth arrest of the MCF-7 cells at the G1 phase, induced by the treatment with cotylenin A and rapamycin or the culture in low serum medium, markedly induced the cyclin G2 gene expression. Anticancer drugs including doxorubicin, etoposide and 5-fluorouracil also induced cyclin G2 expression during induction of growth arrest of the MCF-7 cell at the G1 phase or G2/M phase. Ectopically inducible cyclin G2 expression potently inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, cyclin G2 knockdown induced by cyclin G2 small interfering RNA markedly reduced the potency of cotylenin A plus rapamycin to induce growth inhibition.

MOZ associates with AML1 (RUNX1), PU.1, and p53, and cooperatively activates target gene transcription. Gene targeting in mice has revealed that MOZ is essential for the generation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and for the appropriate development of myeloid, erythroid and B-lineage cell progenitors. In AML, MOZ fusion genes lead to repressed differentiation, hyper-proliferation, and self-renewal of myeloid progenitors through deregulation of MOZ-regulated target gene expression.

The present study evaluates the cost effectiveness of posaconazole vs. standard azoles for the prevention of IFIs in neutropenic patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: A decision-tree model was developed using data from a randomized trial that compared posaconazole and standard azole (fluconazole or itraconazole) prophylaxis in neutropenic patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for AML/MDS (Cornely et al., N Engl J Med 2007;356:348-359). Following initiation of prophylaxis, clinical events are modeled with chance nodes reflecting probabilities of IFIs, IFI-related death, and death from other causes. Patients surviving the prophylaxis are assumed to have a life expectancy according to the underlying condition. This allows translation of the trial outcomes to a lifetime horizon. Data on life expectancy, quality of life, medical resource consumption and costs were obtained from the literature. Model outcomes include cost per life year (LY) gained and cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The total cost (treatment of breakthrough IFI + prophylaxis) for posaconazole amounted to 4412 euros (95% uncertainty interval 3403 euros - 5666 euros), which is -183 euros (-1985 euros to 1564 euros) less than costs with standard azoles. Posaconazole prophylaxis resulted in 0.08 (0.02-0.15) QALYs gained in comparison with prophylaxis with standard azoles. Results from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicate that there is a 90% probability that the cost per QALY gained with posaconazole is below 20,000 euros. Additional scenario analyzes with different assumptions confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: Given the underlying data and assumptions, the economic evaluation demonstrated that posaconazole prophylaxis is expected to be cost-effective compared with fluconazole/itraconazole in neutropenic AML/MDS patients after intensive chemotherapy.",,"['Stam, Wiro B', ""O'Sullivan, Amy K"", 'Rijnders, Bart', 'Lugtenburg, Elly', 'Span, Lambert F R', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Jansen, Jeroen P']","['Stam WB', ""O'Sullivan AK"", 'Rijnders B', 'Lugtenburg E', 'Span LF', 'Janssen JJ', 'Jansen JP']","['Mapi Values, Houten, The Netherlands. wiro.stam@mapivalues.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*economics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Econometric', 'Mycoses/*economics/mortality/prevention & control', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*economics/mortality/therapy', 'Netherlands', 'Neutropenia/*economics/mortality/therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/*economics']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/12/24 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1141 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01141.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Dec;81(6):467-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01141.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural killer (NK) activation against tumors in leukemia models is partly based on the recognition of the target through the NKG2D/NKG2D ligands interactions. We analyzed ex vivo SS malignant lymphocytes for the expression of the NKG2D ligands such as the major histocompatibility complex class I-related molecules (MIC) A and B and the UL16 binding proteins (ULBP). The expressions of NKG2D, the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46) and the activating receptor DNAM-1 were simultaneously investigated on circulating patients NK and CD8(+) nonmalignant lymphocytes. Interestingly, although at least one of the NKG2D ligands was expressed on the circulating malignant lymphocytes of 9 out of 10 patients, NKG2D was expressed on effector lymphocytes. We found that soluble MICA in patient's sera was increased, which may constitute a mechanism to escape the immune response. In vitro, SS tumor lymphocytes induced the degranulation of perforin by the NKL cell line. More importantly, NKG2D expressed on SS patients NK cells is functional and capable to induce degranulation.

In addition to these mutations, cytogenetic aberrations are frequently present at diagnosis but their role in the pathogenesis remains unclear. Two models of MPN pathogenesis have recently emerged based on either a single-hit or a multi-hit concept. The first model proposes that the acquisition of JAK2 mutations is the disease-initiating event, causing both the onset of disease phenotype and establishment of clonal hematopoiesis. The second model postulates the existence of 'pre-JAK2' mutations that establish clonal hematopoiesis before acquisition of JAK2 mutations and onset of disease phenotype. In this review, the two models have been critically evaluated in the context of the latest findings. At present, neither of the two models can be universally applied to all MPN patients due to their genetic heterogeneity. It is likely that the disease pathogenesis in some patients follows the first, and in other patients, the second model. Thus, the somatic mutations in MPN do not seem to be acquired in a predetermined order as seen in other malignancies, but occur randomly.

First, we determined whether IL-18BP Tg mice are protected against ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI). Ischemic AKI was induced by bilateral renal pedicle clamping. IL-18BP Tg mice were functionally and histologically protected against ischemic AKI as determined by blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and acute tubular necrosis score. We have demonstrated that the injurious effect of IL-18 in the kidney is independent of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Thus the effect of IL-18 inhibition on renal macrophage infiltration was determined. The number of macrophages was significantly reduced in IL-18BP Tg compared with wild-type kidneys. To determine the cytokines and chemokines that are dependent on IL-18, we performed flow cytometry based assays. Multiple chemokines/cytokines, IL-3, IL-6, IL-15, IL-18, leukemia inhibitory factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were significantly increased in AKI vs. sham kidneys. Only CXCL1 (also known as KC or IL-8) was significantly increased in AKI vs. sham kidneys and significantly reduced in IL-18BP Tg AKI vs. wild-type AKI kidneys. To determine whether macrophages are the source of CXCL1 in the kidney, we depleted macrophages with liposomal encapsulated clodronate. CXCL1 was significantly decreased in macrophage-depleted vs. control AKI mice. In summary, in ischemic AKI in mice, 1) IL-18BP Tg mice are functionally and histologically protected, 2) macrophage infiltration in the kidney and CXCL1 are significantly reduced in IL-18BP Tg mice, and 3) macrophage depletion significantly reduces CXCL1 in the kidney. In conclusion, protection against ischemic AKI in IL-18BP Tg mice is associated with less macrophage infiltration and less production of CXCL1 in the kidney.",,"['He, Zhibin', 'Lu, Lawrence', 'Altmann, Christopher', 'Hoke, Thomas S', 'Ljubanovic, Danica', 'Jani, Alkesh', 'Dinarello, Charles A', 'Faubel, Sarah', 'Edelstein, Charles L']","['He Z', 'Lu L', 'Altmann C', 'Hoke TS', 'Ljubanovic D', 'Jani A', 'Dinarello CA', 'Faubel S', 'Edelstein CL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['F32 DK-079547-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK-0695121/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK-65022/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK-56851/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Glycoprotein (G-protein) cDNA from RABV challenge virus standard-11 (CVS-11) and EBLV-1 and -2 were cloned and co-expressed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag-pol and packageable green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase reporter genes in human cells. The harvested lentiviral (HIV) vector infected over 40% of baby hamster kidney (BHK) target cells, providing high-titre pseudotype stocks. Tests on blinded antibody-positive (n=15) and -negative (n=45) sera, predetermined by the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Office International des Epizooties (OIE), revealed that the CVS-11 pseudotype assay had 100% concordance with FAVN and strongly correlated with neutralization titres (r2=0.89). Cross-neutralization tests using sera from RABV-vaccinated humans and animals on pseudotypes with CVS-11, EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 envelopes showed that the relative neutralization titres correlated broadly with the degree of G-protein diversity. Pseudotypes have three major advantages over live-virus neutralization tests: (i) they can be handled in low-biohazard-level laboratories; (ii) the use of reporter genes such as GFP or beta-galactosidase will allow the assay to be undertaken at low cost in laboratories worldwide; (iii) each assay requires <10 microl serum. This robust microassay will improve our understanding of the protective humoral immunity that current rabies vaccines confer against emerging lyssaviruses, and will be applicable to surveillance studies, thus helping to control the spread of rabies.",,"['Wright, Edward', 'Temperton, Nigel J', 'Marston, Denise A', 'McElhinney, Lorraine M', 'Fooks, Anthony R', 'Weiss, Robin A']","['Wright E', 'Temperton NJ', 'Marston DA', 'McElhinney LM', 'Fooks AR', 'Weiss RA']","['MRC/UCL Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, 46 Cleveland Street, London W1T 4JF, UK.', 'MRC/UCL Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, 46 Cleveland Street, London W1T 4JF, UK.', 'Rabies and Wildlife Zoonoses Group, Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Weybridge), WHO Collaborating Centre for the Characterisation of Rabies and Rabies-related Viruses, New Haw, Addlestone KT15 3NB, UK.', 'Rabies and Wildlife Zoonoses Group, Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Weybridge), WHO Collaborating Centre for the Characterisation of Rabies and Rabies-related Viruses, New Haw, Addlestone KT15 3NB, UK.', 'Rabies and Wildlife Zoonoses Group, Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Weybridge), WHO Collaborating Centre for the Characterisation of Rabies and Rabies-related Viruses, New Haw, Addlestone KT15 3NB, UK.', 'MRC/UCL Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, 46 Cleveland Street, London W1T 4JF, UK.']",['eng'],"['G0600369/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G8712499/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Rabies Vaccines)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Chiroptera/virology', 'Cricetinae', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics/*immunology', 'Lyssavirus/genetics/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Rabies Vaccines/immunology', 'Rabies virus/genetics/immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/immunology']",PMC2886951,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.2008/000349-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2008 Sep;89(Pt 9):2204-2213. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.2008/000349-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Rel proteins in this family are implicated in leukemia/lymphomagenesis, but the mechanism is not completely understood. Previous studies showed that the transcription activation domains (TADs) of the viral oncoprotein v-Rel and its cellular Rel/NF-kappaB homologues c-Rel and RelA are key determinants of their different transforming activities in primary lymphocytes. Substitution of a Rel TAD for that of RelA conferred a strong transforming phenotype upon RelA, which otherwise failed to transform cells. To gain insights into protein interactions that influence cell transformation by the Rel TADs, we identified factors that interact with the TAD of v-Rel, the most oncogenic member of the Rel/NF-kappaB family. We report that the coactivator for transcription factors AP-1 and estrogen receptors, CAPERalpha, interacts with the v-Rel TAD and potently synergizes v-Rel-mediated transactivation. Importantly, coexpression of CAPERalpha markedly reduced and delayed v-Rel's transforming activity in primary lymphocytes, whereas a dominant-negative mutant enhanced the kinetics of v-Rel-mediated transformation. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CAPERalpha in v-Rel-transformed lymphocytes significantly enhanced colony formation in soft agar. Since the potency of Rel-mediated transactivation is an important determinant of lymphocyte transformation, as is Rel's ability to induce transcriptional repression, these data suggest that CAPERalpha's interaction with the Rel TAD could modulate Rel/NF-kappaB's transforming activity by facilitating expression or dampening repression of specific gene subsets important for oncogenesis. Overall, this study identifies CAPERalpha as a new transcriptional coregulator for v-Rel and reveals an important role in modulating Rel's oncogenic activity.",,"['Dutta, Jui', 'Fan, Gaofeng', 'Gelinas, Celine']","['Dutta J', 'Fan G', 'Gelinas C']","['CABM, 679 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854. gelinas@cabm.rutgers.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA054999/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA054999-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA054999/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SARNP protein, human)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Reticuloendotheliosis virus/*physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Viral Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",PMC2573166,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/11/01 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00903-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00903-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Nov;82(21):10792-802. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00903-08.

This feature is substantially different from the one typical to retroviruses and other LTR retrotransposons that all exhibit a tRNA-dependent priming mechanism. Genetic studies have suggested that the self-primer of Tf1 can be generated by a cleavage between the 11th and 12th bases of the Tf1 RNA transcript. The in vitro data presented here show that recombinant Tf1 reverse transcriptase indeed introduces a nick at the end of a duplexed region at the 5' end of Tf1 genomic RNA, substantiating the prediction that this enzyme is responsible for generating this RNA self-primer. The 3' end of the primer, generated in this manner, can then be extended upon the addition of deoxynucleoside triphosphates by the DNA polymerase activity of the same enzyme, synthesizing the negative-sense DNA strand. This functional primer must have been generated by the RNase H activity of Tf1 reverse transcriptase, since a mutant enzyme lacking this activity has lost its ability to generate the self-primer. It was also found here that the reverse transcriptases of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and of murine leukemia virus do not exhibit this specific cleavage activity. In all, it is likely that the observed unique mechanism of self-priming in Tf1 represents an early advantageous form of initiating reverse transcription in LTR retroelements without involving cellular tRNAs.",,"['Hizi, Amnon']",['Hizi A'],"['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv 69978, Israel. ahizy@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Retroelements)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['DNA Primers/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/*biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', '*Retroelements', 'Ribonuclease H/genetics/metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces/*genetics']",PMC2573163,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/11/01 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01370-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01370-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Nov;82(21):10906-10. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01370-08.

Imatinib intolerance is also a concern. Dasatinib is approved for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML or Ph+ ALL and has helped address these concerns. Here, we review the clinical profile of dasatinib and discuss dosing strategies to manage these adverse events. METHODS: References were obtained through literature searches on PubMed as well as from the Proceedings of Annual Meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society of Hematology, and European Hematology Association. RESULTS: Initial studies of dasatinib showed that 70 mg twice-daily resulted in impressive hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with all phases of CML and Ph+ ALL. Aside from hematologic events, the most common drug-related toxicities (mostly grade 1-2) in dasatinib clinical trials were fluid retention (including pleural effusion), diarrhea, skin rash, headache, hemorrhage, fatigue, nausea and dyspnea. A Phase III dose optimization study showed that the safety profile of dasatinib is improved and efficacy maintained when administered on a 100 mg once-daily dosing schedule compared with the 70 mg twice-daily schedule in patients with chronic phase (CP) CML. CONCLUSION: The safety profile of dasatinib is manageable. A 100 mg once-daily dose is now approved for use in patients with CP CML.

During her last admission, the patient presented with an invasive sinus infection diagnosed as a mixed Aspergillus and Mucor etiology. The patient succumbed to this infection five weeks after presentation. Upon investigation it was found that the patient did not self-administer posaconazole as required in the product labeling, which may have led to drug failure in this patient.

Using RNA interference gene silencing technology, we modulated the kinetics of methionine adenosyltransferase-II (MAT-II), which catalyzes SAMe synthesis from ATP and l-Met. Specifically, we silenced the expression of the regulatory MAT-IIbeta subunit in Jurkat cells and accordingly shifted the K(m L-Met) of the enzyme 10-15-fold above the physiologic levels of l-Met, thereby reducing enzyme activity and SAMe pools, inducing excessive apoptosis and diminishing leukemic cell growth in vitro and in vivo. These effects were reversed at unphysiologically high l-Met (>50 microm), indicating that diminished leukemic cell growth at physiologic l-Met levels was a direct result of the increase in MAT-II K(m L-Met) due to MAT-IIbeta ablation and the consequent reduction in SAMe synthesis. In our NOD/Scid IL-2Rgamma(null) humanized mouse model of leukemia, control shRNA-transduced Jurkat cells exhibited heightened engraftment, whereas cells lacking MAT-IIbeta failed to engraft for up to 5 weeks post-transplant. These stark differences in malignant cell survival, effected by MAT-IIbeta ablation, suggest that it may be possible to use this approach to disadvantage leukemic cell survival in vivo with little to no harm to normal cells.",,"['Attia, Ramy R', 'Gardner, Lidia A', 'Mahrous, Engy', 'Taxman, Debra J', 'Legros, Leighton', 'Rowe, Sarah', 'Ting, Jenny P-Y', 'Geller, Arthur', 'Kotb, Malak']","['Attia RR', 'Gardner LA', 'Mahrous E', 'Taxman DJ', 'Legros L', 'Rowe S', 'Ting JP', 'Geller A', 'Kotb M']","['University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA108792/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.5.1.6 (MAT2B protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.6 (Methionine Adenosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics/therapy', 'Methionine/genetics/metabolism', 'Methionine Adenosyltransferase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*RNA Interference', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC2576526,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/12/24 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)64652-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M804159200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Nov 7;283(45):30788-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M804159200.

CCN3 is expressed and secreted by hematopoietic progenitor cells in normal bone marrow. CCN3 acts through the core stem cell signalling pathways including Notch and Bone Morphogenic Protein, connecting CCN3 with the modulation of self-renewal and maturation of a number of cell lineages including hematopoietic, osteogenic and chondrogenic. CCN3 expression is disrupted in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia as a consequence of the BCR-ABL oncogene and allows the leukemic clone to evade growth regulation. In contrast, naive cord blood progenitors undergo enhanced clonal expansion in response to CCN3. Altered CCN3 expression is associated with numerous solid tumors including glioblastoma, melanoma, adrenocortical tumours, prostate cancer and bone malignancies including osteosarcoma. Mature CCN3 protein has five distinct modules and truncated protein variants with altered function are found in many cancers. Regulation by CCN3 is therefore cell type and isoform specific.

Thrombocytopenic or low-normal whole blood samples were spiked with 1 mum latex beads (n = 14) to mimic contaminants under controlled conditions. Optical and impedance measurements of spiked and control samples with the Sysmex XE-2100 were compared with the Advia 120 and the manual counts. The added beads unexpectedly increased the automated optical platelet counts in the Sysmex XE-2100 and, to a lesser extent, the Advia 120 (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, P < 0.05), while the beads were not included in the impedance or the manual microscopic platelet counts.

METHODS: A total of 252 cases (90.3% response) and 637 controls (53.4% response) were enrolled. Controls were matched for cases on age and gender. Information was collected on participants' living habits, including tea consumption. Green tea was used as a standard to estimate the total amount of individual catechin consumption. We stratified individual consumption of catechins into four levels. Conditional logistic regression models were fit to subjects aged 0-15 and 16-29 years to evaluate separate associations between leukemia and catechin consumption. RESULTS: A significant inverse association between green tea consumption and leukemia risk was found in individuals aged 16-29 years, whereas no significant association was found in the younger age groups. For the older group with higher amounts of tea consumption (>550 units of catechins), the adjusted odds ratio (OR) compared with the group without tea consumption was 0.47 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.97]. After we adjusted for smoking status and medical irradiation exposure, the overall OR for all participants was 0.49 (95% CI = 0.27-0.91), indicating an inverse relation between large amounts of catechins and leukemia. CONCLUSION: Drinking sufficient amounts of tea, especially green tea, which contains more catechins than oolong tea and black tea, may reduce the risk of leukemia.",,"['Kuo, Yau-Chang', 'Yu, Chu-Ling', 'Liu, Chen-Yu', 'Wang, Su-Fen', 'Pan, Pi-Chen', 'Wu, Ming-Tsang', 'Ho, Chi-Kung', 'Lo, Yu-Shing', 'Li, Yi', 'Christiani, David C']","['Kuo YC', 'Yu CL', 'Liu CY', 'Wang SF', 'Pan PC', 'Wu MT', 'Ho CK', 'Lo YS', 'Li Y', 'Christiani DC']","['Environmental and Occupational Medicine and Epidemiology Program, Department of Environmental Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA. kuo550221@yahoo.com.tw']",['eng'],"['ES00002/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES000002/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES09723/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009723-05/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009723/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['0 (Tea)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan', '*Tea']",PMC3103781,['NIHMS294655'],2008/08/30 09:00,2009/03/20 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10552-008-9217-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2009 Feb;20(1):57-65. doi: 10.1007/s10552-008-9217-7.

The goal of this study was to determine the rate of familial lymphoproliferative malignancy among consecutive lymphoma patients presenting to a tertiary care center and to enroll families with multiple affected first-degree relatives on a data and tissue collection study. Beginning in 2004 all new patients presenting to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with non-Hodgkin (NHL) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were asked to complete a one-page self-administered family history questionnaire. 55.4% of 1948 evaluable patients reported a first-degree relative with a malignancy, with the highest rate among CLL probands. Lymphoid malignancies were particularly common, with 9.4% of all probands reporting a first-degree relative with a related lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD). This frequency was again highest for CLL, at 13.3% of CLL probands, compared to 8.8% of NHL probands and 5.9% of HL probands (P = 0.002). The prevalence of CLL was significantly increased in parents of CLL probands (P < 0.05), and a greater risk of NHL was seen in fathers of NHL probands than in mothers (P = 0.026).

In particular, studies of oncogenic retroviruses established fundamental principles of modern molecular cancer biology. Studies of avian Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) led to the discovery of the viral oncogene src, and this was followed by the discovery of other viral oncogenes in retroviruses of mammals including rodents, cats, monkeys and so forth. Studies of the viral oncogenes in turn led to the discovery of cellular proto-oncogenes in the host genome; cellular oncogenes have been shown to be activated in a variety of human cancers, including those with no viral involvement. Oncogenic animal retroviruses can be divided into two groups based on their mechanisms of tumourigenesis, acute transforming retroviruses and nonacute retroviruses. Acute transforming retroviruses are typically replication defective and they induce tumours rapidly due to expression of their viral oncogenes. Nonacute retroviruses are replication competent and they induce tumours with longer latencies, by activating cellular proto-oncogenes in the tumour cells; this results from insertion of proviral DNA in the vicinity of the activated proto-oncogene. More recently, human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-I) was discovered as an etiological agent of human cancer (adult T-cell leukaemia [ATL]); this virus also encodes regulatory genes some of which are important for its oncogenic potential. Most recently, the retroviral structural protein Envelope (Env) has been shown to be directly involved in oncogenic transformation for certain retroviruses. Env-induced transformation is a new paradigm for retroviral oncogenesis. In this review, we will summarise research on retrovirus oncogenic transformation over the past 100 years since the first published report of an oncogenic virus with particular attention to Env-induced transformation.",,"['Maeda, Naoyoshi', 'Fan, Hung', 'Yoshikai, Yasunobu']","['Maeda N', 'Fan H', 'Yoshikai Y']","['Division of Host Defense, Research Center for Prevention of Infectious Diseases, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. maeda@bioreg.kyushu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Rev Med Virol,Reviews in medical virology,9112448,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Oncogenic Viruses/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*pathogenicity']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/12/19 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/rmv.592 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Med Virol. 2008 Nov-Dec;18(6):387-405. doi: 10.1002/rmv.592.,,157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosome and FLT3 mutation analyses were also undertaken. Thirty-two distinct types of nucleotide changes (7 known and 25 novel mutations) were identified in 34 cases (13.8%). Three types of polymorphisms were found in 60 cases (24.3%) including a novel nt1401C>T polymorphism. All polymorphisms were located at the C-terminal region whereas the majority of mutations (62.5%) occurred at the N-terminal region. The most common polymorphism was the nt1175_1180dup resulting in the predicted P194_H195 duplication protein in 50 cases. Although CEBPA mutations were predominantly associated with a normal karyotype (76%), 15.7% of patients with an unfavorable risk and 4.3% of patients with a favorable risk also had the mutations. Moreover, CEBPA polymorphisms were similarly found across all cytogenetic risk groups and occurred in all leukemia subtypes. FLT3 mutations were comparably discovered among patients with CEBPA mutations, polymorphisms and wild-type (26-30%). In conclusion, CEBPA polymorphisms occurred more frequently than CEBPA mutations and could be identified across all prognostic risk groups.

Between one-third and one-half of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) relapse, and no standard therapy is recognized for patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML.

Clofarabine inhibits both DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase, leading to impaired DNA synthesis and repair, and directly induces apoptosis. Phase I and II single-agent trials in children have shown that clofarabine is safe and active in both myeloid and lymphoid relapsed/refractory acute leukemias. Clofarabine has been approved by the FDA for pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory ALL after at least 2 prior therapeutic attempts.

In terms of the Joint Council for Clinical Oncology (JCCO) targets, 84% of patients commence treatment within 21 days and 98% of patients complied with the Department of Health target that treatment should follow within 31 days of the decision being agreed with the patient. Only 76% complied with the Department of Health 62-day target from GP referral to first definitive treatment. However, the date of urgent referral by the GP was not submitted for most patients in our survey, leaving a sample of only 84 out of 936 patients (9% of total) suitable for this analysis.

Epigenetic alterations, including histone modifications, have been proposed to play an important role in tumorigenesis. The involvement of two chromatin remodeling genes, retinoblastoma-binding protein 1 (Rbbp1/Arid4a) and Rbbp1-like 1 (Rbbp1l1/Arid4b), in leukemogenesis was not characterized. METHODS: The leukemic phenotype of mice deficient for Arid4a with or without haploinsufficiency for Arid4b was investigated by serially monitoring complete blood counts together with microscopic histologic analysis and flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow and spleen from the Arid4a(-/-) mice or Arid4a(-/-)Arid4b(+/-) mice. Regulation in bone marrow cells of downstream genes important for normal hematopoiesis was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Genotypic effects on histone modifications were examined by western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Young (2-5 months old) Arid4a-deficient mice had ineffective blood cell production in all hematopoietic lineages. Beyond 5 months of age, the Arid4a(-/-) mice manifested monocytosis, accompanied by severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. These sick Arid4a(-/-) mice showed bone marrow failure with myelofibrosis associated with splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Five of 42 Arid4a(-/-) mice and 10 of 12 Arid4a(-/-)Arid4b(+/-) mice progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and had rapid further increases of leukocyte counts. Expression of Hox genes (Hoxb3, Hoxb5, Hoxb6, and Hoxb8) was decreased in Arid4a-deficient bone marrow cells with or without Arid4b haploinsufficiency, and FoxP3 expression was reduced in Arid4a(-/-)Arid4b(+/-) bone marrow. Increases of histone trimethylation of H3K4, H3K9, and H4K20 (fold increases in trimethylation = 32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 27 to 32; 45, 95% CI = 41 to 49; and 2.2, 95% CI = 1.7 to 2.7, respectively) were observed in the bone marrow of Arid4a-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: Arid4a-deficient mice initially display ineffective hematopoiesis, followed by transition to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)-like myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder, and then transformation to AML. The disease processes in the Arid4a-deficient mice are very similar to the course of events in humans with CMML and AML. This mouse model has the potential to furnish additional insights into the role of epigenetic alterations in leukemogenesis, and it may be useful in developing novel pharmacological approaches to treatment of preleukemic and leukemic states.",,"['Wu, Mei-Yi', 'Eldin, Karen W', 'Beaudet, Arthur L']","['Wu MY', 'Eldin KW', 'Beaudet AL']","['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['HD-37283/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Arid4a protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Rbbp1l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC2528019,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['djn253 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djn253 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2008 Sep 3;100(17):1247-59. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djn253.

We recently reported that ATO induces neutrophil apoptosis. The aim of this study was to establish whether or not ATO recruits MAPKs in neutrophils, as well as to further investigate its agonistic properties. We found that ATO activates p38 and that, unlike H2O2, this response was not inhibited by exogenous catalase. Also, we demonstrated that ATO-induced p38 activation occurs before H2O2 generation and without a calcium burst. We next established that ATO recruits c-jun NH2-terminal (JNK) but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (Erk-1/2). Using pharmacological inhibitors, we found that the proapoptotic activity of ATO occurs by a MAPK-independent mechanism. In contrast, the ability of ATO to enhance adhesion, migration, phagocytosis, release, and activity of gelatinase and degranulation of secretory, specific, and gelatinase, but not azurophilic granules, is dependent upon activation of p38 and/or JNK. This is the first study establishing that ATO possesses important agonistic properties in human neutrophils.

Use of supportive coagulation therapy and clinical outcome: the CAPELAL study.,1488-94,10.3324/haematol.12948 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The effects of L-asparaginase on hemostasis during induction chemotherapy are less defined in adults than in children. We, therefore, studied the effects of L-asparaginase in adult patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 214 patients treated with L-asparaginase (7500 IU/m(2) x 6) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma. Between day 1 of the induction course and discharge, clinical events, and biological and therapeutic modifications were reviewed. RESULTS: Antithrombin and fibrinogen levels were lower than 60% and 1 g/L in 71% and 73% of patients, respectively. Twenty thromboses occurred in 9.3% of the patients; these patients had a median antithrombin level of 53% (range, 21-111) at the time of the event. Forty-two episodes of bleeding occurred in 31 patients with a median fibrinogen level of 1.3 g/L. Infusions of L-asparaginase were reduced or delayed in 64% of patients due to low fibrinogen and/or antithrombin levels. Fresh-frozen plasma, antithrombin and fibrinogen were infused in 31%, 41% and 52% of patients, respectively. The mean antithrombin and fibrinogen levels increased from 61% to 88% and from 1 to 1.4 g/L after infusion of antithrombin or fibrinogen respectively, while both levels remained unchanged after the infusion of fresh-frozen plasma. In patients who received antithrombin concentrates L-asparaginase injections were less frequently omitted or delayed (53% vs. 72%, p=0.005), the rate of thrombosis was lower (4.8% vs. 12.2%, p=0.04) and the disease-free survival was also reduced (p=0.05).

Recent studies show that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) contributes to the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells via transcriptional activity-independent mechanisms. We investigated whether all-trans retinoic acid affects HIF-1 alpha protein and whether this has a role in all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation. DESIGN AND METHODS: The acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and U937 were treated with all-trans retinoic acid, and HIF-1 alpha/HIF-1 beta mRNA and proteins were measured respectively by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. To investigate the role of HIF-1 alpha in all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation, NB4 cells, U937 cells, U937 cells in which HIF-1 alpha was induced by the withdrawal of tetracycline and U937 cells with stable expression of specific short hairpin RNA against HIF-1 alpha, Runx1, C/EBP alpha and PU.1, were treated with all-trans retinoic acid and/or the hypoxiamimetic agent cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)). Cellular differentiation was evaluated by morphological criteria and myeloid differentiation antigens. RESULTS: all-trans retinoic acid rapidly increased endogenous and inducible expressed or CoCl(2)-stabilized HIF-1 alpha protein in leukemic cells under normoxia. Importantly, suppression of HIF-1 alpha expression by specific short hairpin RNA partially but significantly inhibited all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation of the U937 cell line. Reciprocally, the differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid was significantly enhanced by conditional HIF-1 alpha induction and HIF-1 alpha-stabilizing CoCl(2) treatment. Furthermore, knock-down of PU.1, Runx1 and C/EBP alpha, three transcriptional factors crucial for normal hematopoiesis, greatly inhibited the differentiation cooperation of all-trans retinoic acid and HIF-1 alpha induction. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides the first demonstration that HIF-1 alpha, a protein rapidly responsive to all-trans retinoic acid, plays a role in all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation of leukemic cells.

However, development of resistance to this drug is a common phenomenon in late stage disease. The Bcr-Abl protein localizes to the cytoplasm in transformed cells but can enter the nucleus upon treatment with imatinib. Using leptomycin B, a nuclear export blocker, it has been shown that reactivated nuclear Bcr-Abl kinase activity can induce cell death, thus presenting an interesting potential treatment option for imatinib resistant disease. Here we show that the combination of imatinib and leptomycin B effectively induces cell death in imatinib-resistant Ba/F3 cells which display Bcr-Abl amplification or signs of clonal evolution. However, no such synergism is observed in imatinib-resistant Ba/F3 cells carrying the T315I mutation of Bcr-Abl or those which have lost Bcr-Abl expression.

Deletions in 9p are seen in about 9% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but their prognostic impact has been controversial. Cytogenetic data from 381 patients diagnosed with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia were reviewed. Chromosomal analysis was successful in 240 cases. Of these cases, 18 (8%) had abnormalities in 9p and they were compared with patients with normal karyotypes and patients with t(9;22)/BCR-ABL.

These proteins signal through a common tripartite receptor composed of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, gp130, and ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha. Binding to ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha occurs through an interaction site located at the C terminus of the cytokine AB loop and alphaD helix, known as site 1. In the present study, we have generated a model of neuropoietin and identified a conserved binding site for the three cytokines interacting with ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha. To identify the counterpart of this site on ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha, its cytokine binding domain was modeled, and the physicochemical properties of its surface were analyzed. This analysis revealed an area displaying properties complementary to the site 1 of ciliary neurotrophic factor, cardiotrophin-like cytokine, and neuropoietin. Based on our computational predictions, residues were selected for their potential involvement in the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha binding epitope, and site-directed mutagenesis was carried out. Biochemical, cell proliferation, and cell signaling analyses showed that Phe(172) and Glu(286) of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha are key interaction residues.

The aim of the study was to determine the optimal threshold that can separate patients into two groups in terms of leukemic residual cells and relapse status after induction and consolidation chemotherapy. METHODS: Five-color MFC and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis were used to determine the optimal threshold. This study analyzed 54 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. RESULTS: LAPs were detected in 51/54 (94%) patients. MRD was evaluated in the bone marrow (BM) in morphologic complete remission from 25 and 22 patients after induction and consolidation, respectively. The threshold discriminating MRD(-) from MRD(+) cases was set at 0.15% residual leukemic cells, a level that allowed optimal sensitivity and specificity for prediction of relapse, both at postinduction (P = 0.05) and postconsolidation (P = 0.009) time points using ROC analysis. MRD level postinduction not only influenced relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.004) but also overall survival (OS) (P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that MRD level postinduction was a powerful independent prognostic factor for both RFS (P = 0.037) and OS (P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Using the ROC analysis, the threshold of 0.15% was defined as the optimal value in discriminating risk categories in AML, and postinduction MRD assessment is able to better predict disease outcome than consolidation. Therefore, MRD analysis by MFC could be used for refining the selection of therapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcome in individual patients.",['2008 Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Al-Mawali, Adhra', 'Gillis, David', 'Lewis, Ian']","['Al-Mawali A', 'Gillis D', 'Lewis I']","['Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

To understand effects of these differences, we studied murine ES (mES) growth, maintenance of stem cell phenotype, and cell energetics over a pO(2) range of 0-285 mmHg, in the presence or absence of differentiation-suppressing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). With LIF, growth rate was sensitive to pO(2) but constant with time, and expression of self-renewal transcription factors decreased at extremes of pO(2). Subtle morphological changes suggested some early differentiation, but cells retained the ability to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers at low pO(2). Without LIF, growth rate decreased with time, and self-renewal transcription factor mRNA decreased further. Gross morphological changes occurred, and overt differentiation occurred at all pO(2). These findings suggested that hypoxia in the presence of LIF promoted limited early differentiation. ES cells survived oxygen starvation with negligible cell death by increasing anaerobic metabolism within 48 h of anoxic exposure. Decreasing pO(2) to 36 mmHg or lower decreased oxygen consumption rate and increased lactate production rate. The fraction of ATP generated aerobically was 60% at or above 142 mmHg and decreased to 0% under anoxia, but the total ATP production rate remained nearly constant at all pO(2). In conclusion, undifferentiated ES cells adapt their energy metabolism to proliferate at all pO(2) between 0 and 285 mmHg. Oxygen has minimal effects on undifferentiated cell growth and phenotype, but may exert more substantial effects under differentiating conditions.",,"['Powers, Daryl E', 'Millman, Jeffrey R', 'Huang, Ryan B', 'Colton, Clark K']","['Powers DE', 'Millman JR', 'Huang RB', 'Colton CK']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Room 66-452, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK063108/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-KD063108 01A/PHS HHS/United States', 'U42PR 16606/PR/OCPHP CDC HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Damage', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Lactic Acid/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oxidative Stress', '*Oxygen Consumption', 'Phenotype', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.21986 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2008 Oct 1;101(2):241-54. doi: 10.1002/bit.21986.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cell culture study.,592-9,10.1002/mnfr.200700474 [doi],"Sonicated arsonoliposomes were prepared using arsonolipid with palmitic acid acyl chain (C16), mixed with phosphatidylcholine (PC)-based or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-based, and cholesterol (Chol) with C16/DSPC/Chol 8:12:10 molar ratio. PEG-lipid (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine conjugated to polyethylenoglycol 2000) containing vesicles (PEGylated-arsonoliposomes; PC-based and DSPC-based) were also prepared. The cytotoxicity of these arsonoliposomes towards different cancer cells (human promyelocytic leukaemia NB4, Prostatic cancer PC3, human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-468, human T-lymphocyte (MT-4) and also towards human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was evaluated by calculating the arsonoliposome-induced growth inhibition of the cells by the MTT assay. IC-50 values were interpolated from cell number/arsonoliposome concentration curves. The results reveal that all types of arsonoliposomes evaluated significantly inhibit the growth of most of the cancer cells studied (PC3, NB4, MT4) with the exception of the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells which were minimally affected by arsonoliposomes; in some cases even less than HUVEC. Nevertheless, for the same cell type the differences between the different types of arsonoliposomes were significant but not proportional to their stability, indicating that the formation of arsonoliposomes with very stable membranes is not a problem for their anticancer activity. Thereby it is concluded that arsonoliposome composition should be adjusted in accordance to their in vivo kinetics and the desired, for each specific application, biodistribution of As and/or encapsulated drug.",,"['Zagana, Paraskevi', 'Haikou, Maria', 'Giannopoulou, Eleftheria', 'Ioannou, Panayiotis V', 'Antimisiaris, Sophia G']","['Zagana P', 'Haikou M', 'Giannopoulou E', 'Ioannou PV', 'Antimisiaris SG']","['Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology, Department of Pharmacy, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Mol Nutr Food Res,Molecular nutrition & food research,101231818,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Liposomes)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenicals/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Lipids/*analysis', 'Liposomes/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2009/07/16 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mnfr.200700474 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Nutr Food Res. 2009 May;53(5):592-9. doi: 10.1002/mnfr.200700474.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 353 patients with invasive aspergillosis of whom 39 patients had IAS. Of the 39 patients, 13 underwent sinus surgery (SS) in addition to the antifungal therapy, and the remaining 26 control patients received antifungal therapy alone. Most patients with IAS had underlying leukemia (85%). Both groups had comparable clinical characteristics such as gender, age, underlying disease, neutropenia at the onset, persistent neutropenia, graft-vs-host-disease, and comparable antifungal therapy. RESULTS: Overall response was 7 (53.2%) in the SS group vs 5 (19.2%) in the control group (p = 0.06).

The recombinant human GM-CSF/MCAF fusion protein could sustain the growth of GMCSF-dependent cell line TF1 and was chemotactic for monocytes. Thein vitro antitumor effect showed that rhGM-CSF/MCAF could activate monocytes to inhibit the growth of several human tumor cell lines, including a promyelocyte leukemia cell line HL-60, a lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, a hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721 and a melanoma cell line Bowes. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of monocytes activated by rhGM-CSF/MCAF against HL-60 and A549 was greater than that activated by GM-CSF or MCAF alone, even greater than that activated by a combination of GM-CSF and MCAF, suggesting that the fusion protein has synergistic or enhanced effects. Thein vivo antitumor effect indicated that rhGM-CSF/MCAF had marked antitumor effect against A549 tumor in nude mice and even completely suppressed tumor formation. rhGM-CSF/MCAF was significantly more effective in inhibiting tumor growth than rhGM-CSF. Histological analysis showed that tumor site injected with rhGM-CSF/MCAF was infiltrated by a large number of monocytes while a sparse infiltration of monocytes was observed at the tumor site injected with rhGM-CSF or normal saline, suggesting that the antitumor effect of rhGM-CSF/MCAF was mediated by the recruitment of a large number of monocytes to the tumor site.",,"['Ye, Q', 'Su, G', 'Zhang, S', 'Huang, C']","['Ye Q', 'Su G', 'Zhang S', 'Huang C']","['Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, 100071, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Sci China C Life Sci,"Science in China.

In this study, we detected typical NPM1 mutations (types A, B, D) in untreated Chinese AML patients using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) followed by sequence analysis. The detection rate of NPM1 mutations in 220 AML patients was 16.4%, including 107 (14.2%) with the French-American-British (FAB) subtype M2, 43 (2.3%) with M3, and 52 (30.8%) with M4/M5. Only one case each with an NPM1 mutation was detected in four M0, seven M1, five M6, and two M7 cases. Eight patients were followed up after treatment, and five patients in hematologic remission continued to test negative for NPM1 mutations within 2-14 months of follow-up. Sequence analysis revealed that all the 36 positive cases were heterozygous for the mutation with 4-bp insertions at nt 959; the 36 cases included 29 (80.6%) cases with type A, four (11.1%) cases with type B, and one rare DD-3 mutation. We also detected two new mutations, namely, CTCG and CAAG insertions, named BJ-01 and BJ-02, respectively. Further, 38.9% (14/36) patients with NPM1 mutations simultaneously exhibited internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 gene, and 66.7% (22/33) patients did not express CD34.

We identified RIL as a frequent methylation target in cancer. In search for factors that influence RIL hypermethylation, we found a 12-bp polymorphic sequence around its transcription start site that creates a long allele. Pyrosequencing of homozygous tumors revealed a 2.1-fold higher methylation for the short alleles (P<0.001). Bisulfite sequencing of cancers heterozygous for RIL showed that the short alleles are 3.1-fold more methylated than the long (P<0.001). The comparison of expression levels between unmethylated long and short EBV-transformed cell lines showed no difference in expression in vivo. Electrophorectic mobility shift assay showed that the inserted region of the long allele binds Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors, a binding that is absent in the short allele. Transient transfection of RIL allele-specific transgenes showed no effects of the additional Sp1 site on transcription early on. However, stable transfection of methylation-seeded constructs showed gradually decreasing transcription levels from the short allele with eventual spreading of de novo methylation. In contrast, the long allele showed stable levels of expression over time as measured by luciferase and approximately 2-3-fold lower levels of methylation by bisulfite sequencing (P<0.001), suggesting that the polymorphic Sp1 site protects against time-dependent silencing.

Studies in the 1960s and 1970s demonstrated that B and T lymphocytes were responsible primarily for the basic functions of antibody production and cell-mediated immune responses, respectively. The decades that followed have witnessed a continuum of unfolding complexities in B-cell development, subsets, and function that could not have been predicted. Some of the landmark discoveries that led to our current understanding of B lymphocytes as the source of protective innate and adaptive antibodies are highlighted in this essay. The phenotypic and functional diversity of B lymphocytes, their regulatory roles independent of antibody production, and the molecular events that make this lineage unique are also considered. Finally, perturbations in B-cell development that give rise to certain types of congenital immunodeficiency, leukemia/lymphoma, and autoimmune disease are discussed in the context of normal B-cell development and selection. Despite the significant advances that have been made at the cellular and molecular levels, there is much more to learn, and cross-disciplinary studies in hematology and immunology will continue to pave the way for new discoveries.",,"['LeBien, Tucker W', 'Tedder, Thomas F']","['LeBien TW', 'Tedder TF']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine/Pathology, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. lebie001@umn.edu']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/history/metabolism', 'Autoimmune Diseases/history/immunology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/history/immunology', 'Leukemia/history/immunology', 'Lymphoma/history/immunology', 'Mice', 'Models, Immunological']",PMC2518873,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49586-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-02-078071 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 1;112(5):1570-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-02-078071.,,109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytologic evaluation of tumor tissue was diagnostic in 11 of 13 cases. Twenty-two of 27 ferrets had anemia, 2 had leukemia, and 5 were neutropenic. Common comorbid disorders were adrenal disease (n = 27) and insulinoma (n = 6).

We performed a retrospective national multicentre analysis of 71 patients receiving a second allogeneic transplant using RIC after disease relapse following an initial allogeneic transplant.

Previous studies suggest that WWP1 promotes cell proliferation and survival; however, the mechanism of WWP1 action is still poorly understood. Here, we showed that WWP1 upregulates and maintains erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2) and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) in multiple cell lines. WWP1 depletion dramatically attenuates the EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation. WWP1 forms a protein complex with RING finger protein 11 (RNF11), a negative regulator of ErbB2 and EGFR. The protein-protein interaction is through the first and third WW domains of WWP1 and the PY motif of RNF11. Although WWP1 is able to ubiquitinate RNF11 in vitro and in vivo, WWP1 neither targets RNF11 for degradation nor changes RNF11's cellular localization. Importantly, inhibition of RNF11 can rescue WWP1 siRNA-induced ErbB2 and EGFR downregulation and growth arrest. Finally, we demonstrated that RNF11 is overexpressed in a panel of prostate and breast cancer cell lines with WWP1 expression. These findings suggest that WWP1 may promote cell proliferation and survival partially through suppressing RNF11-mediated ErbB2 and EGFR downregulation.",,"['Chen, C', 'Zhou, Z', 'Liu, R', 'Li, Y', 'Azmi, P B', 'Seth, A K']","['Chen C', 'Zhou Z', 'Liu R', 'Li Y', 'Azmi PB', 'Seth AK']","['The Center for Cell Biology and Cancer Research, MS355, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY 12208, USA. chenc@mail.amc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNF11 protein, human)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (WWP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/physiology', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, erbB-2', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2009/01/01 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008288 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.288 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Nov 20;27(54):6845-55. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.288.

Therefore, combination therapies with differentiation-enhancing agents at non-toxic concentrations of ATRA may overcome its side effects. Here, we investigated the effect of plant-derived sesquiterpene lactone compounds and their underlying mechanisms in ATRA-induced differentiation of human leukaemia HL-60 cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: HL-60 cells were treated with four sesquiterpene lactones (helenalin, costunolide, parthenolide and sclareolide) and cell differentiation was determined by NBT reduction, Giemsa and cytofluorometric analyses. Signalling pathways were assessed by western blotting, gel-shift assay and kinase activity determinations and intracellular calcium levels were determined using a calcium-specific fluorescent probe. KEY RESULTS: Helenalin, costunolide and parthenolide, but not sclareolide, increased ATRA-induced HL-60 cell differentiation into a granulocytic lineage. Signalling kinases PKC and ERK were involved in the ATRA-induced differentiation enhanced by all of the effective sesquiterpene lactones, but JNK and PI3-K were involved in the ATRA-induced differentiation enhanced by costunolide and parthenolide. Enhancement of cell differentiation closely correlated with inhibition of NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity by all three effective compounds. Importantly, enhancement of differentiation induced by 50 nM ATRA by the sesquiterpene lactones was not accompanied by elevation of basal intracellular calcium concentrations. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results indicate that plant-derived sesquiterpene lactones may enhance ATRA-mediated cell differentiation through distinct pathways.",,"['Kim, S H', 'Danilenko, M', 'Kim, T S']","['Kim SH', 'Danilenko M', 'Kim TS']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Korea. tskim@korea.ac.kr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Lactones)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",PMC2597232,,2008/08/30 09:00,2009/02/21 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjp2008319 [pii]', '10.1038/bjp.2008.319 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2008 Nov;155(6):814-25. doi: 10.1038/bjp.2008.319.

The program, in addition to other health care institutions in Amman, serves approximately 5.6 million Jordanians. Also, we treat several patients per year from neighboring Arab countries. The program at KHCC performs an average of 80 transplants per year. During the past 4 years 320 patients received transplants at KHCC; 26% of them received an autologous graft and 74% allogeneic grafts. Of the allogeneic grafts 91% were taken from matched family members, 6.7% were haploidentical from one of the parents, and 2.3% were from an unrelated donor or umbilical cord blood. The actuarial overall survival among all patients has been around 65%. The most common indication for transplantation at KHCC was leukemia/MDS followed by benign nonmalignant hematological/immune deficiency/metabolic disorders, with thalassemia major being the most common among this group. The cost of SCT is variable and depends on many factors including the type of transplant and the attending post-transplant complications. The average charge for autologous transplant (both adults and pediatrics) is 24,695 JD (one JD equals 1.42 USD), and the average charge for allogeneic transplant (both adults and pediatrics) excluding haploidentical transplant is 46,787 JD.

In 1981, allogeneic BMT was applied in an acute leukemia patient with success. Since then, the number of BMTs has been increasing gradually, especially since the 1990s. More than 2000 stem cell transplants per year have been performed in recent years in more than 50 BMT units in mainland China. A survey of 16 BMT units from 1986 to 2005 indicates that the predominant types of transplantation performed are identical sibling (36%), related mismatched/haploidentical (11.2%), unrelated (7.5%) and autologous (44.5%) and that the distribution of disease entities and prevalent diseases being transplanted are AML (31%), ALL (16.1%), CML (19.1%) and lymphoid malignancy (22.2%). The number of transplants from unrelated donor or related mismatched/haploidentical donor has increased significantly in the past 5 years. BM and G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood are used about equally often as a source of hematopoietic stem cells, or they are used in combination. Umbilical cord blood is used least often. Leukemias for allogeneic and lymphoid malignancies for autologous BMT continue to increase, but the increase in BMT for CML has been slow since 2004. By the end of 2007, HLA data were available on more than 700,000 individuals in the Chinese Marrow Donor Program, and 800 stem cell donations have been carried out from these. Related HLA-mismatched/haploidentical BMT has achieved comparable outcomes in terms of severe acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, relapse, treatment-related mortality, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) with HLA-identical sibling transplantation in the author's two BMT units. Cord blood co-infusion as the third-party cells could significantly reduce the incidence and severity of acute GVHD, steroid-refractory acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD without an increase in leukemia relapse and could improve DFS and OS.",,"['Wu, T', 'Lu, D-P']","['Wu T', 'Lu DP']","['Beijing Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Blood Banks', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'China', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Fetal Blood', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans']",,,2008/09/25 09:00,2008/10/08 09:00,['2008/09/25 09:00'],"['2008/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2008123 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2008.123 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Aug;42 Suppl 1:S73-S75. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2008.123.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As HSCs are able to supply blood cells for the lifespan of the individual, LT-HSCs undergo an aging process. The consequences of aging are an increase in the stem cell pool size, increased self-renewal and production of cells with expression of myeloid-specific genes and genes commonly expressed in myeloid leukemia. The age-related increased incidence of myeloproliferative disorders is therefore not surprising. Marrow cells circulate and migrate to a number of different organs. Previously assumed tissue and organ specificities appear to be less stringent and primitive cells residing in one organ may contribute to the structural and functional regeneration of other organs.

However, Indian data on this malignancy are limited. This study was conducted to determine the clinico-hematological profile of APML in India. Thirty-five patients with APML presenting to Hematology Department, AIIMS, New Delhi, between July 2003 and June 2005 were evaluated for presenting clinical features, hemogram, peripheral smear, bone marrow morphology and cytochemistry. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for PML-RARalpha was done in all cases. Male-to-female ratio was 0.9:1 (males--17 and females--18) with median age 25 years (range 11-57 years). Presenting features included anemia, bleeding, fever, gum hypertrophy and scrotal ulceration. All cases showed hypergranular abnormal promyelocytes. Median hemoglobin was 6.3 g/dL (range - 3.0-9.0 g/dL), total leukocyte count (TLC) was 33.88 x 10(9) /L (range - 1-170 x 10(9) /L). Platelet count was 28 x 10(9) /L (range - 4-170 x 10(9) /L). All cases were positive for myeloperoxidase and sudan black (SB), whereas 60% cases also showed non specific esterase (NSE) positivity with 40% cases being fluoride sensitive. RT-PCR showed PML-RARalpha in 33/35 cases with the bcr3 isoform being present in 24/33 positive cases (72.7%). The two cases negative for PML-RARalpha showed typical morphology and responded to ATRA. On statistical analysis, no correlation was found between bcr isoform and TLC, platelet count, age sex and early death. Unusual features included gum hypertrophy and scrotal ulceration at presentation and high median presenting TLC (33.8 x 10(9) /L). There was, however, no microgranular variant. Another interesting feature was a high incidence of NSE positivity (60%), which was fluoride sensitive in 40%.

We and others have reported a number of functionally significant MDR1 variants, including G1199A and G1199T, that modulate cancer drug resistance and intracellular levels of antivirals. In this report, we describe a novel G571A variant of MDR1 detected in 6.4% of leukemia patients. Because this nucleotide modification gives rise to an amino acid change from Gly to Arg at the 191 amino acid position of Pgp, we have developed and characterized the functional affect of the G571A variant in stable, recombinant cells. Using six chemotherapeutic drugs, doxorubicin HCl, daunorubicin HCl, vinblastine sulfate, vincristine sulfate, taxanes (paclitaxel), and epipodophyllotoxin (etoposide, VP-16), we found that the MDR1(571A) variant selectively reduced the degree of Pgp-mediated resistance in drug-dependent manner. Although there was a minimal effect on doxorubicin and daunorubicin, the MDR1-dependent resistance on vinblastine, vincristine, paclitaxel, and etoposide was reduced by approximately 5-fold. The increased drug sensitivity in MDR1(571A), compared with MDR1(wt), paralleled the intracellular drug levels. These data suggest that individuals with this novel MDR1 variant, the 571A genotype, may be more sensitive to the specific anticancer drugs that are Pgp substrates.",,"['Yang, Ziping', 'Wu, Daniel', 'Bui, Tot', 'Ho, Rodney J Y']","['Yang Z', 'Wu D', 'Bui T', 'Ho RJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7610, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM062883/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI52663/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS039178/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NS048996/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI077390/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NS39178/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052663/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM62883/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Acridines)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'N488540F94 (Elacridar)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology', 'Acridines/pharmacology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biological Transport', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/metabolism']",PMC3477805,['NIHMS413755'],2008/08/30 09:00,2008/11/14 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.108.138313 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.108.138313 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2008 Nov;327(2):474-81. doi: 10.1124/jpet.108.138313.

All subclones within a cancer are phylogenetically related, with the prevalence of each subclone determined by its evolutionary fitness and the timing of its origin relative to other subclones. Recently developed massively parallel sequencing platforms promise the ability to detect rare subclones of genetic variants without a priori knowledge of the mutations involved. We used ultra-deep pyrosequencing to investigate intraclonal diversification at the Ig heavy chain locus in 22 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Analysis of a non-polymorphic control locus revealed artifactual insertions and deletions resulting from sequencing errors and base substitutions caused by polymerase misincorporation during PCR amplification. We developed an algorithm to differentiate genuine haplotypes of somatic hypermutations from such artifacts. This proved capable of detecting multiple rare subclones with frequencies as low as 1 in 5000 copies and allowed the characterization of phylogenetic interrelationships among subclones within each patient.

Recent evidence suggests that genetic contributions have been significantly underestimated. However, single gene defects occur only in a minority of cases, and multigenetic causes of congenital heart diseases have not been fully demonstrated. Here, we show that interactions between alleles of 3 Pbx genes, which encode homeodomain transcription factors, are sufficient to determine the phenotypic presentation of congenital heart diseases in mice. A major role is served by Pbx1, whose inactivation results in persistent truncus arteriosus. Reduction or absence of Pbx2 or Pbx3 leads to Pbx1 haploinsufficiency and specific malformations that resemble tetralogy of Fallot, overriding aorta with ventricular septal defect, and bicuspid aortic valves. Disruption of Meis1, which encodes a Pbx DNA-binding partner, results in cardiac anomalies that resemble those caused by Pbx mutations. Each of the observed cardiac defects represents developmental abnormalities affecting distinct stages of cardiac outflow tract development and corresponds to specific types of human congenital heart disease. Thus, varied deficiencies in the Pbx gene family produce a full spectrum of cardiac defects involving the outflow tract, providing a framework for determining multigenetic causes of congenital heart anomalies.",,"['Stankunas, Kryn', 'Shang, Ching', 'Twu, Karen Y', 'Kao, Shih-Chu', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Sanyal, Mrinmoy', 'Selleri, Licia', 'Cleary, Michael L', 'Chang, Ching-Pin']","['Stankunas K', 'Shang C', 'Twu KY', 'Kao SC', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Sanyal M', 'Selleri L', 'Cleary ML', 'Chang CP']","['Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['R37 CA042971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090735-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL085345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL085345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC2633052,['NIHMS88431'],2008/08/30 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['CIRCRESAHA.108.175489 [pii]', '10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.175489 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2008 Sep 26;103(7):702-9. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.108.175489.

Transplantation was associated with a high incidence of complications including early relapse, failure of engraftment, and posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder.

It has been found that the organic molecule is coordinated to iron via N7 atom of the appropriate adenosine derivative and the products are represented by mixtures of complexes with various iron oxidation (Fe(III)/Fe(II)) and spin states (S=5/2, 4/2, 3/2, 2/2) and geometries (tetrahedral or trigonal bipyramidal). It is caused by the fact that partial redox processes proceed during the reactions due to the presence of a ribose moiety, which is oxidized to the corresponding 5'-ribotic acid, and simultaneously, a portion of Fe(III) cations is reduced to Fe(II) ones. Moreover, a significant effect of crystal water molecules on stereochemistry, and hence, on magnetic and spectral properties of the prepared complexes has been found. The compounds have been tested for their in vitro cytotoxicity against the following human cancer cell lines: malignant melanoma (G-361), osteogenic sarcoma (HOS), chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7).

B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene (Bcl-2) has been described as an inhibitor both in programmed cell death (PCD) and ER dysfunction during apoptosis, and the Bcl-2 family play a key role in regulating the PCD, both locally at the ER and from a distance at the mitochondrial membrane. However, its signal pathways and concrete mechanisms in endoplasmic reticulum-initiated apoptosis remain incompletely understood. We therefore investigate whether ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) causes neuronal apoptosis in part via cross-talk between ER and mitochondria or not, and how the overexpression of Bcl-2 prevents this form of cell death. Here we show that analogous I/R-induced cell death occurs consequent to interactions of ER stress and mitochondrial death pathways. The participation of the mitochondrial pathway was demonstrated by the release of cytochrome C (cyt C) from mitochondrial into cytoplasmic fractions and caspase-9 cleavage. The involvement of ER stress was further supported by the observable increase of glucose-regulated protein 78(GRP78)/BiP expression and caspase-12 activity. Furthermore, prior to these changes, swelling of the ER lumen and dissociation of ribosomes from rough ER were detected by electron microscopy. Bcl-2 overexpression inhibits the release of cyt C and the activation of caspase-9/-8/-3 but not caspase-12 based on the results of Western blot. These suggest that cross-talk between ER and mitochondria participate in neuronal damage after ischemia/reperfusion. Bcl-2 overexpression could suppress I/R-induced neuronal apoptosis via influencing mitochondrial integrity.",,"['Zhang, Hong', 'Li, Qin', 'Li, Zhen', 'Mei, Yuanwu', 'Guo, Yunliang']","['Zhang H', 'Li Q', 'Li Z', 'Mei Y', 'Guo Y']","['Institute of Cerebrovascular Diseases, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Medical College, Qingdao 266003, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Ireland,Neurosci Res,Neuroscience research,8500749,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Cortex/*injuries', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Neurons/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reperfusion Injury/*physiopathology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-0102(08)00201-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neures.2008.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurosci Res. 2008 Oct;62(2):140-6. doi: 10.1016/j.neures.2008.07.002.

Hematotoxicity and cancer-causation as a result of benzene exposure was recognized many years ago, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Aberrant regulation of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) has been linked to both cancer induction and interference with normal hematopoietic development. We have previously suggested that inhibition of GJIC may play a role in benzene toxicity since benzene metabolites were found to block GJIC, the ring-opened trans,trans-muconaldehyde (MUC) being the most potent metabolite. In the present work we have studied the molecular mechanisms underlying the MUC-induced inhibition of gap junctional communication. We show that MUC induces cross-linking of the gap junction protein connexin43 and that this is likely to be responsible for the induced inhibition of GJIC, as well as the loss of connexin43 observed in Western blots. We also show that glutaraldehyde possesses similar effects as MUC, and we compare the effects to that of formaldehyde. The fact that glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde have been associated with induction of leukemia as well as disturbance of hematopoiesis, strengthens the possible link between the effect of MUC on gap junctions, and the toxic effects of benzene.",,"['Rivedal, Edgar', 'Leithe, Edward']","['Rivedal E', 'Leithe E']","['Department of Cancer Prevention, Institute for Cancer Research, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Montebello, N-0310 Oslo, Norway. edgarr@rr-research.no']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Connexin 43)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', '3249-28-3 (muconaldehyde)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'T3C89M417N (Glutaral)']",IM,"['Aldehydes/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/toxicity', 'Cell Communication/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Connexin 43/*metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/*toxicity', 'Formaldehyde/toxicity', 'Gap Junctions/*drug effects/physiology', 'Glutaral/toxicity', 'Rats']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/11/07 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(08)00323-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2008.07.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2008 Nov 1;232(3):463-8. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2008.07.022.

In the present study we determined the frequency of DRB1 and DQB1 alleles in 87 Iranian CLL patients and 100 healthy controls using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. An increased frequency of DRB1*07 (p = 0.04), DQB1*06 (p = 0.01) alleles, and DRB1*13/DQB1*03 haplotype (p = 0.01) and decreased frequency of the DQB1*03 (p = 0.01) allele were observed in our patients compared with healthy controls. Comparison between patients with indolent (n = 42) and progressive (n = 38) disease revealed a significant increase in DRB1*04 and DRB5 alleles in progressive patients. Similarly, a higher frequency of DRB5 (p = 0.01) allele was observed in CD38(+) compared with CD38(-) patients. Classification of the patients into immunoglobulin variable region heavy-chain genes mutated and unmutated subtypes did not reveal significant differences for the expression of any of the HLA alleles or haplotypes between these two subtypes.

The formulation contains amphiphilic block copolymers, Pluronics, that exhibit the unique ability to chemosensitize multidrug resistant (MDR) tumors by inhibiting P-glycoprotein (Pgp) drug efflux system and enhancing pro-apoptotic signaling in cancer cells. This work evaluates whether a representative block copolymer, Pluronic P85 (P85) can also prevent development of Dox-induced MDR in leukemia cells. For in vitro studies murine lymphocytic leukemia cells (P388) were exposed to increasing concentrations of Dox with/without P85. For in vivo studies, BDF1 mice bearing P388 ascite were treated with Dox or Dox/P85. The selected P388 cell sublines and ascitic tumor-derived cells were characterized for Pgp expression and functional activity (RT-PCR, Western Blot, rhodamine 123 accumulation) as well as Dox resistance (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay). The global gene expression was determined by oligonucleotide gene microarrays. We demonstrated that P85 prevented development of MDR1 phenotype in leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo as determined by Pgp expression and functional assays of the selected cells. Cells selected with Dox in the presence of P85 in vitro and in vivo exhibited some increases in IC(50) values compared to parental cells, but these values were much less than IC(50) in respective cells selected with the drug alone. In addition to mdr1, P85 abolished alterations of genes implicated in apoptosis, drug metabolism, stress response, molecular transport and tumorigenesis. In conclusion, Pluronic formulation can prevent development of MDR in leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo.",,"['Sharma, Amit K', 'Zhang, Li', 'Li, Shu', 'Kelly, David L', 'Alakhov, Valery Yu', 'Batrakova, Elena V', 'Kabanov, Alexander V']","['Sharma AK', 'Zhang L', 'Li S', 'Kelly DL', 'Alakhov VY', 'Batrakova EV', 'Kabanov AV']","['Center for Drug Delivery and Nanomedicine, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5830, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA089225/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089225-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089225-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89225/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Micelles)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '0 (pluronic block copolymer p85)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9003-11-6 (Poloxalene)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Genes, MDR', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', '*Micelles', 'Poloxalene/*pharmacology', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Surface-Active Agents/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC2711209,['NIHMS68897'],2008/08/30 09:00,2009/01/22 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-3659(08)00419-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.07.031 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2008 Nov 12;131(3):220-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.07.031.

Inactivation of DJ-1 by RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) in leukemia cell lines K562 and HL60 resulted in inhibition of the proliferation potential and enhancement of the sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic drug etoposide. Further investigation of DJ-1 activity revealed that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), as well as some proliferation and apoptosis-related genes, was regulated by DJ-1.

The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of its anti-cancer effect. MAIN METHODS: To clearly delineate the cell cycle-dependent effects of Tan IIA, we used either synchronized cells or single living cell analysis to conduct our studies. Subcellular fractionation, Western blot analysis, immuno-fluorescence staining and FACS analysis were also employed in our study. KEY FINDINGS: We found that Tan IIA could arrest cancer cells in mitosis by disrupting the mitotic spindle and subsequently triggered cells to enter apoptosis through the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. Thus, Tan IIA could selectively kill mitotic cells over interphase cells. In comparison with other existing anti-cancer drugs that cause mitotic arrest by interfering with the microtubule structure (such as vincristine or taxol), Tan IIA destroyed only the mitotic spindle during the M phase but not the microtubule structure in interphase cells. Furthermore, Tan IIA could trigger the mitotic arrested cells to enter apoptosis faster than vincristine or taxol. SIGNIFICANCE: Since Tan IIA can selectively induce cancer cells to enter apoptosis through mitotic arrest, it has the potential to be developed into an anti-cancer drug.",,"['Zhou, Lingli', 'Chan, W K', 'Xu, Naihan', 'Xiao, Kang', 'Luo, Houwei', 'Luo, Kathy Qian', 'Chang, Donald C']","['Zhou L', 'Chan WK', 'Xu N', 'Xiao K', 'Luo H', 'Luo KQ', 'Chang DC']","['Department of Biology, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Abietanes', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Mitochondria, Muscle/drug effects', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phenanthrenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Salvia miltiorrhiza/*chemistry', 'Subcellular Fractions/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/11/15 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2007/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0024-3205(08)00304-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2008.07.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2008 Sep 12;83(11-12):394-403. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2008.07.011.

Cord blood (CB) is rich in NK cell progenitors with similar properties of proliferation and cytotoxicity as adult blood NK cells. Hence, it is attractive to expand and potentially utilize these cells for adoptive immunotherapy. In this study, CB mononuclear cells were CD3-depleted by immunomagnetic microbead selection to remove T cells. This CD3(dep) CB-MNC fraction was then plated for ex vivo expansion, with or without a feeder layer of irradiated umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC), with or without cytokines that have been shown to be critical for NK expansion: IL-2, IL-15, IL-3, and FLT-3L. At an average of 2 weeks of culture, there was significantly higher expansion (64.7 +/- 8.4-fold) of CD56(+)/CD3(-) NK cells in the presence of the UC-MSC feeder layer and cytokines compared to controls (no increase with feeder layer only and 6.4 +/- 1.5-fold increase with cytokines only, P < .05). Contact between CD3(dep) CB-MNC cells and UC-MSC augmented NK expansion. The combination of all 4 cytokines was superior to IL-2 alone or 2 cytokines combinations: mean 64.7 +/- 8.4-fold expansion with 4 cytokines combination versus IL-2 alone, IL-2 + FLT-3L, IL-2 + IL-15 or IL-2 + IL-3 (12.2 +/- 2.0, 14.4 +/- 2.4, 10.4 +/- 4.1, 25.2 +/- 8.1 respectively).

Cytotoxicity of expanded NK cells was compared with NK cells from fresh and overnight IL-2 activated CD3(dep) CB-MNC. Whereas fresh cells displayed no discernible killing, strong cytotoxicity against K562, Raji, REH, and SUP-B15 cells lines was noted after overnight activation in IL-2. Cytotoxicity of expanded NK cells against Raji, REH, and SUP-B15 was lower, which, however, correlated with a predominant expansion of CD56(+)/CD16(-) cells known to have less cytolytic activity than CD56(+)/CD16(+). To test the transfection efficiency in NK cells, fresh or expanded CD3(dep) CB-MNC cells were electroporated with either DNA or mRNA constructs for GFP. DNA had a low transfection efficiency (<10%), whereas the one for mRNA reached 52%, but at the cost of significant cell death. Our results suggest that CB NK cell progenitors can be expanded to obtain large numbers by using an irradiated feeder of UC-MSC. They maintain an elevated cytotoxic profile, and may be genetically manipulated-all characteristics that make them suitable for cellular therapies.",,"['Boissel, Laurent', 'Tuncer, Hande H', 'Betancur, Monica', 'Wolfberg, Adam', 'Klingemann, Hans']","['Boissel L', 'Tuncer HH', 'Betancur M', 'Wolfberg A', 'Klingemann H']","['Tufts Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Tufts Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Tufts Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Tufts Medical Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Tufts Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston, Massachusetts.

The information about gonadal function (steroido- and spermatogenesis) after the treatment in prepubertal period are ambiguous. THE AIM OF STUDY: was to evaluate testicular function in young men (Tanner puberty stages IV and V) treated in prepubertal period for childhood malignancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In thirty-two pubertal and postpubertal male survivors of childhood cancer (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL - 14, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL - 6, Hodgkin lymphoma, HL and solid tumors - 4) testicular volume and serum FSH, LH, testosterone, inhibin B and calculated quotient inhibin B:FSH were measured. Controls were 15 healthy boys matched by age and Tanner stage. RESULTS: In the whole studied group the mean values of FSH, LH and testosterone did not differ from control, while inhibin B was lower (87.5+/-96.3 vs. 196.5+/-66.8 ng/l; p<0,0003). The lowest values of inhibin B were found in HL (46,15+/-35,12 ng/l) and after ALL treatment (71,1+/-39,8 ng/l). We did not observe differences in hormonal parameters after NHL treatment. The inhibin B-to-FSH ratio was lower, especially after treatment for HL. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibin B is a sensitive marker of gonadal damage.

Among these patients, invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most frequently observed form of IFI, as opposed to high risk intensive care unit (ICU) patients in whom an increased incidence of invasive candidiasis (IC) can be observed. In both groups, initiation of early treatment has a profound impact on mortality rates, but adequate diagnostic tools are lacking. These circumstances have led to the parallel use of different treatment strategies, e.g. prophylaxis, empiric, pre-emptive and targeted treatment of IFI. The optimum treatment strategies for these severe infections are a matter of extensive research and discussion. A review of major clinical trials on the issue reveals that comparisons between different treatment strategies cannot be made. Considering the complexity of the issue, we advocate an eclectic treatment approach that reduces morbidity and mortality from IFI without compromising tolerability. In allogeneic HSCT recipients, patients receiving induction chemotherapy for AML or MDS and those under immunosuppressive medication for graft vs. host disease after allogeneic HSCT, we recommend prophylaxis with posaconazole. For empiric treatment of persistently febrile neutropenic patients, we opt for caspofungin as first and liposomal amphotericin B deoxycholate (L-AmB) as second line choice. If the diagnosis of IA can be established, voriconazole should be favoured over the alternative, liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB). While high risk ICU patients benefit from fluconazole prophylaxis for IC, the choice of an optimal agent for targeted therapy depends largely on the neutrophil count. In non-neutropenic patients, we recommend an echinocandin as the first line treatment option. Patients with susceptible Candida spp. may be switched to fluconazole. Caspofungin or micafungin might be preferred to anidulafungin in the neutropenic patient. L-AmB is a valuable second line treatment option for both groups of patients.",,"['Ruping, Maria J G T', 'Vehreschild, Jorg J', 'Cornely, Oliver A']","['Ruping MJ', 'Vehreschild JJ', 'Cornely OA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Clinical Trials Unit Infectious Diseases II, Hospital of University of Cologne, Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Candidiasis/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Cross Infection/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Mycoses/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/complications']",,,2008/09/09 09:00,2009/09/17 06:00,['2008/09/09 09:00'],"['2008/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/17 06:00 [medline]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['MYC1572 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1439-0507.2008.01572.x [doi]']",ppublish,Mycoses. 2008 Sep;51 Suppl 2:46-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1439-0507.2008.01572.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite cure rates approaching 80%, resistance to treatment and disease relapse remain a significant clinical problem. Identification of the genes and biological pathways responsible for chemoresistance is therefore crucial for the design of novel therapeutic approaches aiming to improve patient survival. Mutations in the membrane transporter P-glycoprotein genes, genetic variations in drug-metabolising enzymes and defects in apoptotic pathways are mechanisms of chemoresistance common to a wide spectrum of cancers and also play a role in paediatric ALL. In addition, several recent microarray studies have identified transcriptional profiles specifically associated with chemoresistance and pointed to a number of potentially novel therapeutic targets. These microarray studies have shown that genes discriminating between clinically responsive and resistant leukaemias tend to be involved in cellular processes such as regulation of cell cycle, proliferation, and DNA repair. Here we review the outcomes of these microarray studies and also present our own investigations into apoptotic resistance to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in paediatric ALL. We present stratification of paediatric ALL by the profile of DNA damage response following ionising radiation (IR) in vitro. This approach allows classification of ALL tumours at presentation into IR-apoptotic sensitive and IR-apoptotic resistant. Furthermore, apoptotic resistant leukaemias exhibit abnormal response of NFkB pathway following irradiation and inhibition of this pathway can sensitise leukaemic cells to IR-induced DSBs.",,"['Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Marston, Eliot']","['Stankovic T', 'Marston E']","['CR-UK Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. t.stankovic@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,,IM,"['Child', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics']",,,2008/08/30 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/08/30 09:00'],"['2008/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2298/sarh0804187s [doi]'],ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2008 Mar-Apr;136(3-4):187-92. doi: 10.2298/sarh0804187s.,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many patients will either not respond or will have only limited and/or brief responses to single-agent therapy. Eventually, 30% of patients with MDS will progress and develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML). New strategies are needed for these patients. METHODS: 5-Azacytidine (AZA) and thalidomide were administered to 40 patients with MDS or AML. AZA was given at a dose of 75 mg/m2 subcutaneously for 5 of 28 days together with thalidomide starting at a dose of 50 mg per day and increasing to 100 mg per. Six patients had refractory anemia (RA), 2 patients had RA with ringed sideroblasts, 10 patients had RA with excess blasts (RAEB), 1 patient had RAEB in transformation, 4 patients had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 1 patient had chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, and 16 patients had AML. Thirty-six patients were evaluable for outcome. RESULTS: A hematologic improvement (HI) was observed in 15 of 36 patients (42%), stable disease was observed in 5 of 36 patients (14%), and 10 of 36 patients (28%) had disease progression. Six patients experienced complete remission (CR), 2 patients experienced an erythroid HI (HI-E), 1 patient experience an absolute neutrophil count HI (HI-ANC), 5 patients experienced a platelet HI (HI-P), and 7 patients had bilineage HI (HI-P and HI-ANC or an HI-E and HI-ANC). It was noteworthy that 9 of 14 patients with AML had a history of prior MDS, 2 of 9 patients achieved a CR, 4 of 9 patients had HI (HI-E and bilineage HI), and 1 patient had stable disease and was continuing treatment. DNA microarray analysis of 8 responders and 4 nonresponders revealed that the genes associated with cellular proliferation had higher expression levels in nonresponders.

METHODS: The objectives of the current study were to define the causes of death in older patients (aged > or = 60 years) with ALL during induction and consolidation-maintenance with a dose-intensive regimen of alternating 8 courses of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) with high doses of methotrexate and cytarabine followed by maintenance with 6-mercaptopurine, vincristine, methotrexate, and prednisone and to compare their outcomes with the outcomes of older patients who received earlier, less intensive regimens and younger patients who received hyper-CVAD. One hundred twenty-two older patients who received hyper-CVAD were compared with 34 older patients who received less intensive regimens and with 409 younger patients who received hyper-CVAD. RESULTS: The complete response (CR) rates in older patients receiving hyper-CVAD, older patients receiving other regimens, and younger patients receiving hyper-CVAD were 84%, 59%, and 92%, respectively (P < .001); and the respective induction mortality rates were 10%, 12%, and 2% (P not significant in older patients). The incidence of disease resistance during induction was 5%, 27%, and 2%, respectively (P < .001). The majority of deaths were related to infections. Among patients who achieved a CR, death in CR was noted in 34%, 15%, and 7% of older patients receiving hyper-CVAD, older patients receiving other regimens, and younger patients, respectively (P < .001); and the respective rates of recurrence were 40%, 80%, and 48% (P = .004). The estimated 5-year survival rates were 20%, 9%, and 48%, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggested that intensifying the chemotherapy in older patients with ALL reduced the incidence of leukemia resistance but increased the incidence of death in CR from myelosuppression-associated infections. The overall benefit:risk ratio was favorable.

However, current reporter gene strategies may be limited by the immunogenicity of foreign reporter proteins, endogenous expression, or unwanted biological activity. We have developed a reporter gene based on carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a human protein with limited normal tissue expression. METHODS: To construct a CEA reporter gene for PET, a CEA minigene (N-A3) was fused to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the human Fc gamma RIIb receptor. The NA3-Fc gamma RIIb recombinant gene, driven by a CMV promoter, was transfected in Jurkat (human T cell leukemia) cells. Expression was analyzed by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and microPET imaging. RESULTS: Flow cytometry identified Jurkat clones stably expressing NA3-Fc gamma RIIb at low, medium, and high levels. High and medium NA3-Fc gamma RIIb expression could also be detected by Western blot. Reporter gene positive and negative Jurkat cells were used to establish xenografts in athymic mice. IHC showed staining of the tumor with high reporter gene expression; medium and low N-A3 expression was not detected. MicroPET imaging, using an anti-CEA (124)I-labeled single-chain Fv-Fc antibody fragment, demonstrated that only high N-A3 expression could be detected. Specific accumulation of activity was visualized at the N-A3 positive tumor as early as 4 h. MicroPET image quantitation showed tumor activity of 1.8 +/- 0.2, 15.2 +/- 1.3, and 4.6 +/- 1.2 percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at 4, 20, and 48 h, respectively. Biodistribution at 48 h demonstrated tumor uptake of 4.8 +/- 0.8%ID/g.

It is assumed that these deletions indicate loss of tumor suppressor genes on these chromosomes and until these tumor suppressor genes are identified, the functional consequences of these deletions and the molecular basis of these myeloid disorders cannot be completely understood. We evaluated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 44 patients (18 MDS and 26 AML, diagnosed according to WHO classification criteria) at diagnosis, using a four-microsatellite marker panel: an intragenic marker on the 7th intron of gene IRF-1 of the 5q31.1 region and three markers located inside the 7q31.1 region and correlated the LOH with karyotype abnormalities. The microsatellites chosen corresponded to chromosome regions frequently deleted in MDS/AML. The samples with Q (peak area) less than or equal to 0.50 were indicative of LOH. The percent of informative samples (i.e., heterozygous) for the intragenic microsatellite in gene IRF-1 and in loci D7S486, D7S515 and D7S522 were 66.6, 73.7, 75.5, and 48.8%, respectively. Cytogenetic abnormalities by G-banding were found in 36% (16/44) of the patients (2 of 18 MDS and 14 of 26 AML patients). We found a significantly positive association of the occurrence of LOH with abnormal karyotype (P < 0.05; chi-square test) and there were cases with LOH but the karyotype was normal (by G-banding).

To date only a few factors are known to function in SSCs to provide this regulation. Octamer-4 (OCT4) plays a critical role in pluripotency and cell survival of embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cells; however, it is not known whether it plays a similar function in SSCs. Here, we show that OCT4 is required for SSC maintenance in culture and for colonization activity following cell transplantation, using lentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNA expression to knock down OCT4 in an in vitro model for SSCs (""germline stem"" [GS] cells). Expression of promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF), a factor known to be required for SSC self-renewal, was not affected by OCT4 knockdown, suggesting that OCT4 does not function upstream of PLZF. In addition to developing a method to test specific gene function in GS cells, we demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) triggers GS cells to shift to a differentiated, premeiotic state lacking OCT4 and PLZF expression and colonization activity. Our data support a model in which OCT4 and PLZF maintain SSCs in an undifferentiated state and RA triggers spermatogonial differentiation through the direct or indirect downregulation of OCT4 and PLZF. The current study has important implications for the future use of GS cells as an in vitro model for spermatogonial stem cell biology or as a source of embryonic stem-like cells.

We investigated the robustness, precision, and reproducibility of microarray technology. METHODS: One hundred sixty individual patient samples representing 11 subtypes of acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, and nonleukemia as a control group were centrally collected and diagnosed as part of the daily routine in the Munich Leukemia Laboratory. The custom AmpliChip Leukemia research microarray was used for technical analyses of quadruplicate mononuclear cell lysates in 4 different laboratories in Germany (D), Austria (A), and Switzerland (CH) (the DACH study). RESULTS: Total-RNA preparations were successfully performed in 637 (99.5%) of 640 cases. Mean differences between pairs of laboratories in the total-RNA yield from the same sample ranged from 0.02 mug to 1.03 mug. Further processing produced 622 successful in vitro transcription reactions (97.6%); the mean differences between laboratories in the cRNA yield from the same sample ranged from 0.40 mug to 6.18 mug. After hybridization to microarrays, a mean of 47.6%, 46.5%, 46.2%, and 46.4% of probe sets were detected as present for the 4 laboratories, with mean signal-intensity scaling factors of 3.1, 3.7, 4.0, and 4.2, respectively. In unsupervised hierarchical cluster and principal component analyses, replicates from the same patient always clustered closely together, with no indications of any association between gene expression profiles due to different operators or laboratories.

We hypothesized that the antiapoptotic effects of gastrin may be implicated and have therefore investigated the role of antiapoptotic members of the bcl-2 family of proteins. AGS-G(R) human gastric carcinoma cells stably transfected with the CCK-2 receptor were used to assess changes in the expression of bcl-2 family members following gastrin treatment and the function of mcl-1 during apoptosis was investigated by use of small-interfering RNA (siRNA). Treatment of AGS-G(R) cells with 10 nM gastrin for 6 h caused maximally increased mcl-1 protein abundance. Gastrin-induced mcl-1 expression was inhibited by the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Downstream signaling of mcl-1 expression occurred via the CCK-2 receptor, protein kinase C, and MAP kinase pathways, but not via PI 3-kinase. Transfection with mcl-1 siRNA significantly suppressed mcl-1 protein expression and abolished the antiapoptotic effects of gastrin on serum starvation-induced apoptosis. Mcl-1 protein expression was also specifically increased in the type I enterochromaffin-like cell carcinoid tumors of 10 patients with autoimmune atrophic gastritis and hypergastrinemia. Gastrin therefore signals via the CCK-2 receptor, protein kinase C, and MAP kinase to induce expression of antiapoptotic mcl-1 in AGS-G(R) cells, and mcl-1 expression is also increased in human hypergastrinemia-associated type I gastric carcinoid tumors. Gastrin-induced mcl-1 expression may therefore be an important mechanism contributing toward type I gastric carcinoid development.",,"['Pritchard, D M', 'Berry, D', 'Przemeck, S M C', 'Campbell, F', 'Edwards, S W', 'Varro, A']","['Pritchard DM', 'Berry D', 'Przemeck SM', 'Campbell F', 'Edwards SW', 'Varro A']","['Division of Gastroenterology, School of Clinical Sciences, Univ. of Liverpool, The Henry Wellcome Laboratory, Nuffield Bldg., Crown St., Liverpool, L69 3GA UK. mark.pritchard@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['066446/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G9900432/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,American journal of physiology.

The joinpoint regression model was used to describe changes in trends. RESULTS: For all cancers combined, the mortality rate during 2000-2006 was 2.20 per 100,000 population for boys and 1.89 for girls. Mortality for all cancers combined decreased since 1970s in Japan. A stable trend was observed in recent 5 years for girls. For leukemia, a declining trend was observed in the whole period for girls and in 1976-2006 for boys. Mortality rates for childhood central nervous system tumors have remained stable at a low level during 1980-2006.

Thus, to elucidate the apoptotic mechanism of DMNQ-S17, this study was performed in myeloid leukemia U937 cells by 2,3-bis [2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay, eletrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, and Western blotting. In the present study, DMNQ-S17 inhibited constitutive NF kappaB activation and its transcriptional activity in U937 cells. In addition, DMNQ-S17 induced apoptotic features such as apoptotic bodies, cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation in U937 cells. Consistently, flow cytometric analysis showed that DMNQ-S17 increased sub-G1 portion and TUNEL positive cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, DMNQ-S17 effectively attenuated mitochondrial membrane potential, released cytochrome C, activated caspase-3 expression, and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Reversely, caspase-3 and -9 inhibitors also blocked the DMNQ-S17 induced caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in U937 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that DMNQ-S17 can be a potent anticancer candidate for myeloid leukemias by the suppression of NF-kappaB activation leading to the activation of caspase-3 in human myeloid leukemia U937 cells.",,"['Park, Min-Jong', 'Kwon, Hee-Young', 'Lee, Eun-Ok', 'Lee, Hyo-Jung', 'Ahn, Kwang Seok', 'Kim, Myung Ok', 'Kim, Cheol-Ho', 'Ahn, Kyoo-Seok', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon']","['Park MJ', 'Kwon HY', 'Lee EO', 'Lee HJ', 'Ahn KS', 'Kim MO', 'Kim CH', 'Ahn KS', 'Kim SH']","['Cancer Preventive Material Development Research Center & Institute, College of Oriental Medicine, Kyunghee University, 1, Hoekidong, Dongdaemungu, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (6-(1-oxobutyl)-5,8-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*biosynthesis', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/*biosynthesis', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'U937 Cells']",,,2008/08/23 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0024-3205(08)00302-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2008.07.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2008 Sep 26;83(13-14):460-7. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2008.07.010.

Genes essential for blood and endothelial development contain functional ETS binding sites, and binding and expression data implicate the transcription factor, friend leukaemia integration 1 (Fli1) [5-10]. However, loss-of-function phenotypes in mice, although suffering both blood and endothelial defects, have thus far precluded the conclusion that Fli1 is essential for these two lineages [11, 12]. By using Xenopus and zebrafish embryos, we show that loss of Fli1 function results in a substantial reduction or absence of hemangioblasts, revealing an absolute requirement. TUNEL assays show that the cells are eventually lost by apoptosis, but only after the regulatory circuit has been disrupted by loss of Fli1. In addition, a constitutively active form of Fli1 is sufficient to induce expression of key hemangioblast genes, such as Scl/Tal1, Lmo2, Gata2, Etsrp, and Flk1. Epistasis assays show that Fli1 expression is induced by Bmp signaling or Cloche, depending on the hemangioblast population, and in both cases Fli1 acts upstream of Gata2, Scl, Lmo2, and Etsrp.

We hypothesized that this might be attributable to heightened cytotoxic effects of other ALL chemotherapeutic agents on DS versus non-DS host tissues. Panels of DS and non-DS lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and primary fibroblast cell lines were treated with asparaginase, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, mafosfamide and vincristine.

No significant differences were observed between DS and non-DS cell lines using either assay.

In addition, the mycelial elements of Aspergillus species seen in tissue sections are histopathologically indistinguishable from those of non-Aspergillus species. We analyzed the usefulness of a DNA probe directed against the alkaline proteinase (ALP) gene of Aspergillus fumigatus for the identification of Aspergillus species by the in situ hybridization (ISH) technique in patients with oral mycosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ALP probe was tested on tissue specimens from 16 patients with hematologic malignancies who had invasive, orofacial fungal infections and a positive culture for one of the following organisms: Aspergillus species in 13 patients (A. flavus in 10, A. terreus in 2, and A. fumigatus in 1), and Exophiala dermatitis, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, and Candida albicans in 1 patient each. In situ hybridization with the ALP probe was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. RESULTS: The ALP probe showed a strong reaction with specimens from all 13 patients who had culture-proven aspergillosis specimens attributable to A. flavus, A. terreus, and A. fumigatus. On the other hand, the ALP probe showed no cross-reactivity with other fungi (Exophiala dermatitis, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, and Candida albicans).

The purpose of the present study was to examine the apoptotic and antiproliferative activity of beta-escin in HL-60 human acute myeloid leukaemia cells. Antiproliferative activity was examined by soft agar colony assay and the trypan blue exclusion method. Apoptotic activity was evaluated by morphological analysis, annexin V analysis, DNA fragmentation analysis and flow cytometry cell cycle analysis. The results showed that beta-escin caused a significant inhibition of HL-60 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Morphological evidence of apoptosis, including vacuolization, apoptotic nuclei fragmentation and apoptotic body formation, was observed in cells treated with 30 microg mL(-1) of beta-escin for 24, 48 and 72 h. A significant increase in the population of annexin V+ and PI- cells (early apoptotic) among the total cells was observed in cells treated with beta-escin (30-50 microg mL(-1)) for 24 h (P<0.001). Typical DNA ladders, DNA with a unit length of about 180 bp, were detected in cells treated with beta-escin (30-50 microg mL(-1)) for 48 h by agarose gel electrophoresis.

PBMNCs isolated from healthy donors were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium contained 10% FBS supplied with 3 cytokines (rhGM-CSF, rhIL-4, TNF-alpha) for 4 days, DCs harvested were divided into 4 groups, DCI: DC alone; DCII: DC + Se (adding 0.5 micromol/L of Se); DCIII: DC + K562 (pulsed with lysed K562 cells); DCIV: DC + Se + K562. Morphology of DCs was observed under microscope at day 7. The CD1a, CD40, CD83, and CD86 were detected by FCM. Cytotoxicity of T cells induced by DC were measured with LDH release test at day 12. The level of IL-12 in supernatant of cultured DCs were determined with ELISA. The results indicated that at 7th day DC in 4 groups showed characteristic morphology, the colony numbers of 4 groups were all higher than those before cultivation. There were no obvious differences of morphology and colony counts between DCI group and DCII group. The colony numbers of DCIII group and DCIV group increased, as well as the ratio of suspended cells enhanced. The expressions of CD1a, CD40, CD83 and CD86 in 4 groups of DC were significantly higher than those in PBMNC group (p < 0.01), the expressions of CD1a and CD40 in 4 groups of DC did not display significant difference (p > 0.05), the expressions of CD83 and CD86 in both DCIII group and DCIV group were all higher than those in DCI group and DCII group (p < 0.01), but their expressions of CD83 and CD86 in DCI and DCII were not significantly different (p > 0.05), as well as those in DCIII group and DCIV group.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with PV, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and controls were exposed to dasatinib (0.1 to 500 nm mL(-1)). Colony growth was stimulated by interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin. Endogenous erythroid colony (EEC) growth was investigated without exogenous cytokines. Real-time PCR was performed to assess the percentage of JAK2(V617F) cells. RESULTS: 10 nm of dasatinib suppressed EEC growth from PV by 89% (P = 0.002). This inhibition was dose dependent and occurred at pharmacological concentrations. Erythroid and myeloid colony growth was also significantly suppressed in the presence of exogenous cytokines. When compared to PV the inhibition of stimulated colony growth was significantly less pronounced in controls but tended to be more vigorous in CML. Interestingly, despite the potent inhibition of PV cells real-time PCR revealed that the numbers of JAK2(V617F) transcripts did not decrease upon exposure to dasatinib. CONCLUSION: This study shows a marked inhibition of the proliferative capacity of progenitor cells from PV. Although JAK2(V617F) transcript levels did not decrease upon exposure to dasatinib, the drug might suppress PV progenitors through inhibition of a yet undefined molecular target.",,"['Wappl, M', 'Jaeger, E', 'Streubel, B', 'Gisslinger, H', 'Schwarzinger, I', 'Valent, P', 'Oehler, L']","['Wappl M', 'Jaeger E', 'Streubel B', 'Gisslinger H', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Valent P', 'Oehler L']","['Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",,,2008/08/23 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/23 09:00'],"['2008/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['ECI1982 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2008.01982.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2008 Aug;38(8):578-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2008.01982.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common mechanism encountered in the laboratory is the increased efflux of hydrophobic cytotoxic drugs that is mediated by a family of energy-dependent transporters. Besides, resistance to apoptosis can also cause failure in the treatment of leukemia. Recently, we have introduced 4-(4-bromophenyl)-2,3-dihydro-N,3-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-oxoidmidazole-1-c arboxamide (MZ3) as a novel synthesized combretastatin A-4 analogue which is a potent and specific compound against leukemia cells both in vitro and in vivo. Aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of MZ3 on multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells of leukemia, and explore the antimultidrug-resistant mechanisms. Here, we observed that the MDR leukemia cell models investigated, overexpressing MDR1 (P-gp), were hypersensitive against MZ3. Parental K562, HL60 cells and MDR1-overexpressing K562R, HL60R cells were employed in this study. MZ3 hypersensitivity was confirmed to be based on great apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest at unaltered intracellular drug accumulation. Cell proliferation assay demonstrated that, compared with HL60 and K562 cells, HL60R and K562R cells exhibited 1.3-fold and 2.4-fold resistance to MZ3, showing 26.9-fold and 92.2-fold resistance to daunorubicin (DNR) respectively. Moreover, real-time RT-PCR result showed that MZ3 impacted the transcription of MDR1 gene and western blotting results indicated that MZ3 can activate apoptosis on MDR cells by downregulating the anti-apoptotic protein XIAP levels and inducing the decrease in the phosphorylation state of ERK. Summarizing, our data demonstrate that MZ3 can inhibit the MDR function of leukemia cells, and it exerts the effect through altering the transcription of MDR1 genes and downregulating the anti-apopotic protein levels. MZ3 may be a potential candidate for further research and development in anti-MDR territory.",,"['Xu, Danqing', 'Fang, Liang', 'Zhu, Qionghua', 'Hu, Yongzhou', 'He, Qiaojun', 'Yang, Bo']","['Xu D', 'Fang L', 'Zhu Q', 'Hu Y', 'He Q', 'Yang B']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,"['0', '(4-(4-bromophenyl)-2,3-dihydro-N,3-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-oxoidmi-dazole-1', '-carboxamide)', '0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2008/08/23 09:00,2008/09/11 09:00,['2008/08/23 09:00'],"['2008/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmazie. 2008 Jul;63(7):528-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we review potential molecular and cellular therapeutic strategies that (i) target key signaling networks (e.g., PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK/STAT, Notch1, and SRC kinase family-containing pathways) which regulate lymphocyte growth, survival, and function; (ii) block the interaction of ALL cells with stromal cells or lymphoid growth factors secreted by the bone marrow microenvironment; or (iii) stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses.",,"['Brown, Valerie I', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Reid, Gregor S D', 'Teachey, David T', 'Grupp, Stephan A']","['Brown VI', 'Seif AE', 'Reid GS', 'Teachey DT', 'Grupp SA']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, ARC 902, 3615 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA. brownv@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['NIH 1 K08 CA104882-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA104882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA104882-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH R03 CA123554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA123554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA1116660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Immunol Res,Immunologic research,8611087,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/metabolism/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*therapy', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",PMC2890314,['NIHMS209775'],2008/08/22 09:00,2009/03/12 09:00,['2008/08/22 09:00'],"['2008/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12026-008-8038-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Res. 2008;42(1-3):84-105. doi: 10.1007/s12026-008-8038-9.,,158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms leading to this aberrant PTEN localization in human cancers are currently unknown. We have previously reported that ubiquitinylation of PTEN at specific lysine residues regulates its nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning. Here we show that functional promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies co-ordinate PTEN localization by opposing the action of a previously unknown PTEN-deubiquitinylating enzyme, herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP, also known as USP7), and that the integrity of this molecular framework is required for PTEN to be able to enter the nucleus. We find that PTEN is aberrantly localized in acute promyelocytic leukaemia, in which PML function is disrupted by the PML-RARalpha fusion oncoprotein. Remarkably, treatment with drugs that trigger PML-RARalpha degradation, such as all-trans retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide, restore nuclear PTEN. We demonstrate that PML opposes the activity of HAUSP towards PTEN through a mechanism involving the adaptor protein DAXX (death domain-associated protein). In support of this paradigm, we show that HAUSP is overexpressed in human prostate cancer and is associated with PTEN nuclear exclusion. Thus, our results delineate a previously unknown PML-DAXX-HAUSP molecular network controlling PTEN deubiquitinylation and trafficking, which is perturbed by oncogenic cues in human cancer, in turn defining a new deubiquitinylation-dependent model for PTEN subcellular compartmentalization.",,"['Song, Min Sup', 'Salmena, Leonardo', 'Carracedo, Arkaitz', 'Egia, Ainara', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Song MS', 'Salmena L', 'Carracedo A', 'Egia A', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Genetics Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA092629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA092629-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082328/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7', '*Ubiquitination', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",PMC3398484,['NIHMS276220'],2008/08/22 09:00,2008/11/14 09:00,['2008/08/22 09:00'],"['2007/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature07290 [pii]', '10.1038/nature07290 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2008 Oct 9;455(7214):813-7. doi: 10.1038/nature07290.

Although different strategies have been adopted to obtain complete remission, the disease actually progresses in about 60-70% of patients. Bortezomib has been used in multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies because of its antitumor activity. Here we examined the sensitivity of bone marrow cells from AML patients (34 patients: 25 newly diagnosed, 4 relapsed, 5 refractory) to bortezomib alone or in combination with TRAIL, a member of the TNF family that induces apoptosis in tumor cells while sparing normal cells. Bortezomib induced cell death in blasts from each patient sample. The cytotoxic effect was dose- and time-dependent (concentration from 0.001 to 10 microM for 24 and 48 h) and was associated with a downregulation of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, an upregulation of TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, p21, activation of executioner caspases and a loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, low doses of bortezomib primed TRAIL-resistant AML cells for enhanced TRAIL-mediated killing. These results suggest that a combination of proteasome inhibitors and TRAIL could be effective for treating AML patients, even patients who are refractory to conventional chemotherapy.","['Copyright 2008 S.

The ability of ICP0 to act as a potent viral transactivator is mediated by its N-terminal zinc-binding RING finger domain. This domain confers E3 ubiquitin ligase activity to ICP0 and is required for the proteasome-dependent degradation of a number of cellular proteins during infection, including the major nuclear domain 10 (ND10) constituent protein promyelocytic leukemia. In previous work we mapped three phosphorylation regions within ICP0, two of which directly affected its transactivation capabilities in transient transfection assays (Davido et al., J. Virol. 79:1232-1243, 2005). Because ICP0 is a phosphoprotein, we initially sought to test the hypothesis that phosphorylation regulates the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of ICP0. Although none of the mutations affected ICP0 E3 ligase activity in vitro, transient transfection analysis indicated that mutations within one or more of the phosphorylated regions impaired the ability of ICP0 to form foci with colocalizing conjugated ubiquitin and to disrupt ND10. Mutations within one of the regions also affected ICP0 stability, and all of these phenomena occurred in a cell type-dependent manner. In the context of viral infection, only one ICP0 phosphorylation mutant (P1) showed a significant defect in viral replication and enhanced protein stability compared to all the other viruses tested. This study suggests that specific cellular environments and context of expression (transfection versus infection) differentially regulate several activities of ICP0 related to its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity via phosphorylation.",,"['Boutell, Chris', 'Everett, Roger', 'Hilliard, Joshua', 'Schaffer, Priscilla', 'Orr, Anne', 'Davido, David']","['Boutell C', 'Everett R', 'Hilliard J', 'Schaffer P', 'Orr A', 'Davido D']","['MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virology, Church Street, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['R01CA20260/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016475/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI72357/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'MC_U130169966/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA020260/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI072357/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphorylation', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Virus Replication']",PMC2573210,,2008/08/22 09:00,2008/11/01 09:00,['2008/08/22 09:00'],"['2008/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01063-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01063-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Nov;82(21):10647-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01063-08.

This vaccination can very rarely induce a potentially lethal neurotropic or viscerotropic disease. In severely immunodeficient patients, the vaccination is contra-indicated because postvaccinal encephalitis may occur after the vaccination, due to vaccine strain pathogenecity. It is important to evaluate the general health status in elderly individuals before vaccinating because of the increased risk of viscerotropic disease in people of 60 years of age and over. Pregnant women should not be vaccinated, except if departure to an endemic zone is unavoidable. YF vaccinatio is contra-indicated for newborns under six months of age. Solid organ grafts, congenital immunodeficiency, leukemia, lymphoma, cancer, and immunosuppressive treatments are contra-indications for this vaccination. Nevertheless, YF immunization is possible after a bone marrow graft and a two-year period without graft-versus-host disease or immunosuppressive treatment. There is no data to support that immunization of the dono prior to the graft could confer protection against yellow fever to the recipient. Low doses, short courses of corticosteroids either as systemic treatment or intra-articular injections are not contra-indications for YF vaccination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mononuclear cells isolated from a patient with AML-M2 subtype were passaged by liquid culture medium. Interleukin-3 and bone marrow stromal cells were used to support cell proliferation at the first 3 months. Various methods, including cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), multiplex FISH (M-FISH), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), multiplex RT-PCR, short tandem repeat (STR)-PCR, direct sequencing of DNA, clonogenic assay, and tumorigenicity in nude and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were employed to identify and characterize SH-2 cell line. RESULTS: SH-2 cells were maintained without cytokine and stromal cells for 3 years. It had no Epstein-Barr virus or mycoplasma contamination. The SH-2 cell line showed typical myelocytic features in morphology and simultaneous strongly expressed myeloid antigens (CD13, 99.6% and CD33, 99.26%) and natural killer (NK)-related antigens (CD56, 99.5% and CD16/56, 99.62%) suggesting that SH-2 is an AML cell line with NK-antigen expression. SH-2 cell line initially showed a karyotype of 45, X, -Y, der(16)t(16;17)(q24;q12), -17, +19. During the passage period, the cells with a hypodiploid karyotype gradually decreased and were replaced by the near-tetraploid cells with a karyotype of 71-105(86), XX, -Y, -Y, der(16)t(16;17)x2, -17, -17, +19, +19. FISH and M-FISH delineated all abnormalities. SH-2 cells had the approximately same morphological, immunophenotypical, and cytogenetic features as the patient's leukemia cells had. STR-PCR provided powerful evidence for the derivation of SH-2 cell line from the patient's leukemia cells. SH-2 cells showed multiple drug resistance (MDR), which may be related to the p53 gene alteration, including the loss of one p53 allele due to the monosomy 17 and a point mutation of CAG to CAT at codon 576 of exon 5 in another p53 allele resulting in the loss of p53 gene function. In addition, SH-2 cell line did not express MDR-related genes, such as MDR1, multidrug resistance-related protein, and lung resistance protein, but expressed apoptosis-related genes, such as Bcl-2, Fas, glutathione S-transferase-pi, and p21, which were also related to the MDR. SH-2 cell line had tumorigenic capacities in nude and SCID mice. CONCLUSION: Because SH-2 cell line had a clear biology background, it will provide a useful tool for the study of the pathogenesis and treatment strategy of AML with MDR.",,"['Qiu, Huiying', 'Xue, Yongquan', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Pan, Jinlan', 'Dai, Haiping', 'Wu, Yafang', 'Wang, Yong', 'Chen, Suning', 'Wu, Depei']","['Qiu H', 'Xue Y', 'Zhang J', 'Pan J', 'Dai H', 'Wu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Chen S', 'Wu D']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Suzhou, P.

As one of the very few repair systems for oxidized proteins, MsrA and MsrB enzymes play a major role in protein homeostasis during aging and have also been involved in cellular defenses against oxidative stress, by scavenging reactive oxygen species. To elucidate the role of zinc on the Msr system, the effects of zinc treatment on control and stably overexpressing MsrA and MsrB2 MOLT-4 leukemia cells have been analyzed. Here we show that zinc treatment has a pro-antioxidant effect in MOLT-4 cells by inducing the transcription of metallothioneins and positively modulating the activity of the Msr enzymes. In contrast, due to its pro-oxidant effect, zinc also led to increased cell death, reactive oxygen species production, and protein damage. Our results indicate that overexpression of the Msr enzymes, due to their antioxidant properties, counteracts the pro-oxidant effects of zinc treatment, which lead to a cellular protection against protein oxidative damage and cell death, by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species.",,"['Cabreiro, Filipe', 'Picot, Cedric R', 'Perichon, Martine', 'Friguet, Bertrand', 'Petropoulos, Isabelle']","['Cabreiro F', 'Picot CR', 'Perichon M', 'Friguet B', 'Petropoulos I']","['Laboratoire de Biologie et Biochimie Cellulaire du vieillissement, Universite Paris-Diderot-Paris, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.8.4.- (MSRB2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.8.4.- (Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases)', 'EC 1.8.4.11 (methionine sulfoxide reductase)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Metallothionein/genetics', 'Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases', 'Microfilament Proteins', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Oxidoreductases/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Zinc/*pharmacology']",,,2008/08/22 09:00,2009/04/21 09:00,['2008/08/22 09:00'],"['2008/08/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/ars.2008.2102 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2009 Feb;11(2):215-25. doi: 10.1089/ars.2008.2102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The erythrocyte protein band 3 (B3) is one of the most frequently targeted Ags in autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

B3 interaction with CLL cells involves the recognition of its N-terminal domain and leads to its internalization. Interestingly, when binding of erythrocyte-derived vesicles as found physiologically in blood was assessed, we observed that CLL cells could only interact with inside-out vesicles, being this interaction strongly dependent on the recognition of the N-terminal portion of B3. We then examined T cell responses to B3 using circulating CLL cells as APCs. Resting B3-pulsed CLL cells were unable to induce T cell proliferation. However, when deficient costimulation was overcome by CD40 engagement, B3-pulsed CLL cells were capable of activating CD4(+) T cells in a HLA-DR-dependent fashion. Therefore, our work shows that CLL cells can specifically bind, capture, and present B3 to T cells when in an activated state, an ability that could allow the neoplastic clone to trigger the autoaggressive process against erythrocytes.",,"['Galletti, Jeremias', 'Canones, Cristian', 'Morande, Pablo', 'Borge, Mercedes', 'Oppezzo, Pablo', 'Geffner, Jorge', 'Bezares, Raimundo', 'Gamberale, Romina', 'Giordano, Mirta']","['Galletti J', 'Canones C', 'Morande P', 'Borge M', 'Oppezzo P', 'Geffner J', 'Bezares R', 'Gamberale R', 'Giordano M']","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Hematologic Research, National Academy of Medicine, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune', 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/*metabolism', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Binding', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,,2008/08/21 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/08/21 09:00'],"['2008/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/5/3674 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.5.3674 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Sep 1;181(5):3674-83. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.5.3674.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Friend virus (FV), a mouse retrovirus, causes persistent infection in all strains of mice and erythroleukaemia in susceptible strains, the course of which can be strongly influenced by both genetic and extrinsic factors. In this study we examine the impact of coinfection on the requirements for immune control of FV infection. We show that congenic C57BL/6 mice, in which the introduction of an allele of the Friend virus susceptibility 2 gene provides the potential for FV-induced leukemia development, effectively resist FV infection, and both T cell- and Ab-dependent mechanisms contribute to their resistance. However, we further demonstrate that coinfection with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) renders these otherwise immunocompetent mice highly susceptible to FV infection and subsequent disease. The presence of LDV delays induction of FV-specific neutralizing Abs and counteracts the protective contribution of adaptive immunity. Importantly, the disease-enhancing effect of LDV coinfection requires the presence of a polyclonal B cell repertoire and is reproduced by direct polyclonal B cell activation. Thus, immune activation by coinfecting pathogens or their products can contribute to the pathogenicity of retroviral infection.",,"['Marques, Rute', 'Antunes, Ines', 'Eksmond, Urszula', 'Stoye, Jonathan', 'Hasenkrug, Kim', 'Kassiotis, George']","['Marques R', 'Antunes I', 'Eksmond U', 'Stoye J', 'Hasenkrug K', 'Kassiotis G']","['Division of Immunoregulation, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['MC_U117512710/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U117581330/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'U.1175.02.006.00007(81330)/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Arterivirus Infections/*complications/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus', 'Leukemia, Experimental', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/*complications/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections']",PMC2655735,['UKMS4221'],2008/08/21 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/08/21 09:00'],"['2008/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/5/3432 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.5.3432 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Sep 1;181(5):3432-40. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.5.3432.,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: UKMS4221'],,,,,,

It was also originally identified as the product of a proto-oncogene involved in chromosomal translocations in multiple myeloma. In contrast to its oncogenic function in late stages of B lymphopoiesis, expression of IRF-4 is down-regulated in certain myeloid and early B-lymphoid malignancies. In this study, we found that the IRF-4 protein levels are increased in lymphoblastic cells transformed by the BCR/ABL oncogene in response to BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. We further found that IRF-4 deficiency enhances BCR/ABL transformation of B-lymphoid progenitors in vitro and accelerates disease progression of BCR/ABL-induced acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in mice, whereas forced expression of IRF-4 potently suppresses BCR/ABL transformation of B-lymphoid progenitors in vitro and BCR/ABL-induced B-ALL in vivo. Further analysis showed that IRF-4 inhibits growth of BCR/ABL+ B lymphoblasts primarily through negative regulation of cell-cycle progression. These results demonstrate that IRF-4 functions as tumor suppressor in early B-cell development and may allow elucidation of new molecular pathways significant to the lymphoid leukemogenesis by BCR/ABL.

This silencing is in large part attributable to the presence of a nuclear repression complex, which targets a sequence element of the proviral DNA, the repressor-binding site. The repressor-binding site closely overlaps the tRNA primer binding site, a highly conserved sequence essential for virus replication and defining the site of initiation of DNA synthesis during reverse transcription. We have recently demonstrated that the cellular corepressor TRIM28 is recruited to the proline tRNA primer-binding site used by many MLVs and is required to mediate this silencing. Here, we show that TRIM28 is also required for the restriction of retroviruses using a completely distinct tRNA for the priming of their DNA synthesis, namely Lys-1,2 tRNA.

With the presence of random hospital/centre effects, a long-term survivor model with bivariate random effects is proposed to analyse clustered survival data with a possible portion of cured patients. This model extends earlier work by allowing random effects in both the cured fraction and the hazard function parts to follow a bivariate normal distribution, which gives a generalized model with an additional correlation parameter governing the relationship between the recovery probability and the instantaneous failure rate due to the hospital/centre effects. By adopting the GLMM formulation, random effects are incorporated in the model via the linear predictor terms. REML estimation of parameters is achieved via the EM algorithm. Application to the two sets of data illustrates the usefulness of the proposed model.

Data from preclinical studies have revealed that selenite, an inorganic form of selenium, may also be useful in cancer chemotherapy. DNA topoisomerases (topos) are the target of several useful anticancer drugs. These drugs induce DNA complexes with either topo I or topo II; then cellular processing coverts these topo-DNA complexes into permanent DNA strand breaks that ultimately lead to cell death. Previous reports have revealed that selenite can induce apoptosis in cancer cells selectively and that selenite-induced apoptosis is preceded by the formation of DNA strand breaks. In vitro experiments have shown that selenite induces topo II-DNA complexes, which seem to be involved in selenite-induced apoptosis. Using the cell-based assay TARDIS, here we show that selenite induces topo II-DNA complexes (topo IIalpha and topo IIbeta) in K562 leukemia cells; these complexes appeared in a time-dependent manner and correlated with the induction of apoptosis. Cells lacking topo IIbeta were resistant to selenite-induced cell growth inhibition, suggesting that this isoenzyme is a target for selenite. We report for the first time that selenite induces topo I-DNA complexes in K562 cells; the levels of these complexes were high at short exposure times and seem to appear before the induction of apoptosis. Overall, our results show that selenite induces topo-DNA complexes in cells with both topo I and II, and support previous data that suggest that this agent has potential for the treatment of cancer.","['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Lopez-Lazaro, Miguel', 'Willmore, Elaine', 'Elliott, Sarah L', 'Austin, Caroline A']","['Lopez-Lazaro M', 'Willmore E', 'Elliott SL', 'Austin CA']","['Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, The Medical School, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Sodium Selenite/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2008/08/21 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/08/21 09:00'],"['2008/08/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23783 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Nov 1;123(9):2217-21. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23783.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, evidence for this association has often been lacking because of a lack of specific biomarkers and methods available to evaluate oxidative stress status in humans with disease conditions. Emphasis is now being placed on biomarkers of oxidative stress, which can be objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological and pathogenic processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) as biomarkers for oxidative stress and disease progression in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 20 CML patients and 10 age-and sex-matched healthy control volunteers. The mean age of CML patients was 37.11+/-11.36 years and that of controls was 31.07+/-7.60 years. RESULTS: There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in plasma MDA and PC levels in CML patients as compared to healthy volunteers. Our results also showed that plasma MDA and PC levels were significantly higher (p<0.001) in both chronic phase (CML-CP) and accelerated phase (CML-AP) as compared to healthy volunteers. During the follow-up of 12 months, two patients of CML-CP progressed to the accelerated phase. The mean plasma levels of MDA and PC in patients with CML-CP who progressed to CML-AP were found to be higher than in patients with CML-CP who did not progress to the accelerated phase. CONCLUSION: Plasma MDA and PC appears to reflect the oxidative stress status and disease progression in CML and can be used as biomarkers for oxidative stress and disease progression.",,"['Ahmad, Rizwan', 'Tripathi, Anil Kumar', 'Tripathi, Payal', 'Singh, Sushma', 'Singh, Ranjana', 'Singh, Raj Kumar']","['Ahmad R', 'Tripathi AK', 'Tripathi P', 'Singh S', 'Singh R', 'Singh RK']","['Department of Biochemistry, C.S.M.

Causes of splenomegaly were looked into 100 adult patients with splenomegaly, admitted over a period of ten months in a teaching hospital in South India. Patients having ascites were excluded from the study. Malaria was the commonest cause of splenomegaly, observed in 22 patients. Other causes, in order of importance, were chronic myeloid leukaemia (n=11), non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (n=9), enteric fever (n=9), cirrhosis of liver (n=8) and hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly also called as tropical splenomegaly syndrome (n=7) and so on.

Twenty-three patients had splenomegaly of indeterminate origin ie, cause could not be detected on first assessment. Detailed re-evaluation with repeat investigations including liver biopsy revealed the causes as follows: Hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly -7 (30.4%), non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis - 4 (17.4%), cirrhosis of liver - 4 (17.4%) and iron deficiency anaemia - 5 (21.7%).

This drug inhibits metabolic processes in the tumor and causes metabolic disorders in cancer cells. Moreover, NSC-631570 induced the changes in certain amino acids concentrations in biological fluids and tumor tissue in animal models and cancer patients. These changes cannot be explained by metabolic amino acid disorders in cancer known so far. In this study the effects of NSC-631570 on blood plasma amino acids has been investigated. Blood was sampled from 10 healthy donors and 29 patients with different types of cancer (stomach, rectal, lung, breast, bladder, prostate, and leukemia). Comparison of NSC-531570 effects in plasma of healthy donors and cancer patients has shown, that this compoumd: 1) affects amino acids with positively charged (His, Arg) or not charged (Tyr, Thr, Gln) R-groups; 2) decreases concentration of His and increase the concentrations of beta-Ala and Tau. These changes depend on the concentration of NSC-631570 and the type of cancer.

Our aim was to investigate the possible association between MRP1 gene expression level and clinical outcomes among Iranian leukemia patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was an analytical cross-sectional study on patients referred to the Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Research Center, Sharyatee Public Hospital, whose diagnosis was acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). All molecular work was performed at NIGEB (public institution). METHODS: To correlate with prognostic markers and the clinical outcome of acute leukemia, MRP1 gene expression was assessed in 35 AML cases and 17 ALL cases, using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and comparing this to the chemotherapy response type. RESULTS: Mean expression in AML patients in complete remission (0.032 +/- 0.031) was significantly lower than in relapsed cases (0.422 +/- 0.297). In contrast, no significant difference in MRP1 mRNA level was observed between complete remission and relapsed ALL patients. There was a difference in MRP1 expression between patients with unfavorable and favorable cytogenetic prognosis (0.670 +/- 0.074 and 0.028 +/- 0.013, respectively). MRP1 expression in M5 was significantly higher (p-value = 0.001) than in other subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that high MRP1 expression was associated with poor clinical outcome and was correlated with the M5 subtype and poor cytogenetic subgroups among AML patients but not among ALL patients.",,"['Mahjoubi, Frouzandeh', 'Golalipour, Masoud', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran']","['Mahjoubi F', 'Golalipour M', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Alimoghaddam K']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Oncology and Stem Cell Research Center, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran. frouz@nrcgeb.ac.ir']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Sao Paulo Med J,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100897261,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Young Adult']",,,2008/08/20 09:00,2009/10/15 06:00,['2008/08/20 09:00'],"['2008/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/15 06:00 [medline]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1516-31802008000300007 [pii]', '10.1590/s1516-31802008000300007 [doi]']",ppublish,Sao Paulo Med J. 2008 May 1;126(3):172-9. doi: 10.1590/s1516-31802008000300007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can cause leukemia/lymphoma in adults, tropical spastic paralysis, HTLV associated myelopathy, spastic paraparesis, tropical myelopathy (HAM/TSP), and some other nervous system diseases. It is transmitted by means of blood products via blood transfusion. In Iran, except the Great Khorasan region, none of blood products undergo screening for HTLV. Immunodeficiency in HD patients, results in increased risk of infection. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I/II antibody among hemo-dialysis patients and healthy blood donors in Urmia, Iran. A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2005 to January 2006 among healthy blood donors and in 2006 among hemodialysis patients. The serum of 2046 blood donors and 95 Hemodialysis patients was checked with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti HTLV-I/II, and positive cases were confirmed by western blot. Three seropositive cases among 95 hemodialysis patients were detected, and only one of them was confirmed by western blot. Of the healthy blood donors 1910 (93.4%) were males and 136 (6.6%) were females. Serum of 1997 (97.6%) subjects was negative, and 49 (2.6%) cases were positive for HTLV by ELISA. Among the positive cases western blot confirmed only 7 (14.3%) persons as HTLV positive, 37 (75.5%) as negative, and 5 (10.2%) as indeterminate. Among the 7 positive cases 6 (85.6%) were infected with HTLV-I, and only one (14.3%) with HTLV-I /II infection. Total Serologic prevalence of HTLV in healthy blood donors was 0.34%. We conclude that such high serologic prevalence in the population of blood donors in Urmia city, suggests the high probability of transmission through blood transfusion, and therefore screening of blood donors for human T-lymphocyte virus is essential in this region.

All kinds of aberrations have been found in ubiquitin-26S proteasome system, among them: truncated version of ubiquitin (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia), elongated ubiquitin (Alcoholic Liver Disease), suppressed proteasome, accelerative degradation, decreased rates of degradation and etc. As irreversible course of cell cycle is very sensitive to protein degradation process, each of these derangements may cause proliferative disorders and hence development of heavy diseases.

Five of seven patients with T-cell ALL (T-ALL) failed to achieve CR2. Among patients in CR2, MRD greater than 0.01% was detected at the end of block 1 in 75% +/- 7% of ER (n = 36) versus 51% +/- 8% of LR (n = 43; P = .0375) and 12-month event-free survival was 80% +/- 7% versus 58% +/- 7% in MRD-negative versus positive patients (P < .0005). Blocks 2 and 3 of therapy resulted in reduction of MRD burden in 40 of 56 patients who were MRD positive after block 1. Toxicity was acceptable during all three blocks with five deaths (4%) from infections. CONCLUSION: The AALL01P2 regimen is a tolerable and active reinduction platform, suitable for testing in combination with novel agents in B-precursor ALL. Alternative strategies are needed for T-ALL.

Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HCT) has the potential to cure patients with advanced CLL, it is not known whether this holds true for patients with 17p-CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline data from patients, for whom information on the presence of 17p-CLL was available, were downloaded from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation database. Additional information on the course of CLL and follow-up was collected with a questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients with 17p-CLL received allogeneic HCT between March 1995 and July 2006 from a matched sibling (n = 24) or an alternative donor (n = 20). 17p-CLL had been diagnosed by fluorescent in situ hybridization in 82% of patients and by conventional banding in 18% of patients. The median age was 54 years. Before HCT, a median of three lines of chemotherapy had been administered. At HCT, 53% of patients were in remission. Reduced-intensity conditioning was applied in 89% of patients. Acute, grade 2 to 4 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 43% of patients, and extensive chronic GVHD occurred in 53% of patients. At last follow-up, 19 patients were alive, with a median observation time of 39 months (range, 18 to 101 months). Three-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 44% and 37%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of progressive disease at 4 years was 34%. No late relapse occurred in nine patients with a follow-up longer than 4 years. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic HCT has the potential to induce long-term disease-free survival in patients with 17p-CLL.",,"['Schetelig, Johannes', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Brand, Ronald', 'Caballero, Dolores', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Itala, Maija', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Schmitz, Norbert', 'Schwerdtfeger, Rainer', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Onida, Francesco', 'Mohr, Brigitte', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Dreger, Peter']","['Schetelig J', 'van Biezen A', 'Brand R', 'Caballero D', 'Martino R', 'Itala M', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Volin L', 'Schmitz N', 'Schwerdtfeger R', 'Ganser A', 'Onida F', 'Mohr B', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Bornhauser M', 'de Witte T', 'Dreger P']","['University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Dresden, Germany. johannes.schetelig@uniklinikum-dresden.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2008/08/20 09:00,2008/11/15 09:00,['2008/08/20 09:00'],"['2008/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2008.16.2982 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.16.2982 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Nov 1;26(31):5094-100. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.16.2982.

In rare cases, CD8(+) phenotypes have been described based on immunostaining of skin specimens. Although some CD8(+) lymphomas have an indolent course, others, such as CD8(+) epidermotropic cytotoxic T-cell lymphomas, are typically more aggressive. To our knowledge, involvement of peripheral blood or cerebrospinal fluid with a malignant population of CD8(+) cells demonstrated by flow cytometry and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement has not been previously described. OBSERVATIONS: We describe a patient with a CD8(+) cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with an initially indolent course and early stage diagnosed on the basis of a skin biopsy specimen. However, when flow cytometry was performed looking specifically at CD8(+)/CD4(-) cells in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, a malignant population of CD8(+)/CD4(-)/CD26(-)/CD7(-) cells was discovered. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for prognosis and treatment to be able to identify CD8(+) epidermotropic cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma and separate it from other relatively indolent CD8(+) lymphomas. Furthermore, detection of an abnormal CD8(+)/CD26(-)/CD7(-) T-cell population within the peripheral blood has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. The use of flow cytometry looking for abnormal CD8(+) populations in the peripheral blood or cerebrospinal fluid can assist with this critical information.",,"['Introcaso, Camille E', 'Kim, Ellen J', 'Gardner, Jennifer', 'Junkins-Hopkins, Jacqueline M', 'Vittorio, Carmela C', 'Rook, Alain H']","['Introcaso CE', 'Kim EJ', 'Gardner J', 'Junkins-Hopkins JM', 'Vittorio CC', 'Rook AH']","['Department of Dermatology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, 2 Maloney Bldg, 3400 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. camille.introcaso@uphs.upenn.edu']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/immunology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*immunology', '*T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/metabolism']",,,2008/08/20 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2008/08/20 09:00'],"['2008/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['144/8/1027 [pii]', '10.1001/archderm.144.8.1027 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 2008 Aug;144(8):1027-9. doi: 10.1001/archderm.144.8.1027.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How it contributes to the malignancy is unknown. The 3' fusion partner, MAL/MKL1/MRTF-A, is a transcriptional coactivator of serum response factor (SRF). MAL plays a key role in regulated gene expression depending on Rho family GTPases and G-actin. Here we demonstrate that OTT-MAL is a constitutive activator of SRF and target gene expression. This requires the SRF-binding motif and the MAL-derived transactivation domain. OTT-MAL localizes to the nucleus and is not regulated by upstream signaling. OTT-MAL deregulation reflects its independence from control by G-actin, which fails to interact with OTT-MAL in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Regulation cannot be restored by reintroduction of the entire MAL N terminus into the fusion protein. OTT-MAL also caused a delayed induction of the MAL-independent, ternary complex factor-dependent target genes c-fos and egr-1 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk pathway. With testing in heterologous tissue culture systems, however, we observed considerable antiproliferative effects of OTT-MAL.

Inactivation of Mtg16 skewed early myeloid progenitor cells toward the granulocytic/macrophage lineage while reducing the numbers of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells. In addition, inactivation of Mtg16 impaired the rapid expansion of short-term stem cells, multipotent progenitor cells, and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells that is required under hematopoietic stress/emergency.

Our previous study showed DNA damage response induced by manumycin in cancer cells. We hypothesized that methoxyamine, an inhibitor of base-excision repair, can enhance the antineoplastic effect of manumycin. This study was to investigate apoptosis induced by manumycin combined with methoxyamine in myeloid leukemia cell line U937, and to explore the role of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in apoptosis induction of the two drugs. METHODS: U937 cells were treated with various concentrations of manumycin and/or methoxyamine for 48 h. The cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay. Colony formation was evaluated by soft agar clonogenic assay. Cell apoptosis was investigated by flow cytometry. Protein expressions of cytochrome c, caspase-9, and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: The dose-response curve of manumycin was shifted to the left after addition of methoxyamine. The combination index (CI) was less than 1 (P<0.05) in U937 cells (P<0.05), indicating a synergistic effect of manumycin and methoxyamine. Rates of colony formation of U937 cells treated with 1 micromol/L manumycin, or 5 mmol/L methoxyamine, or the combination of the two were 0.3641+/-0.0463, 0.7541+/-0.0379, and 0.0473+/-0.0024, respectively compared with that of control cells (P<0.05). Moreover, the drug combination resulted in enhanced apoptosis in U937 cells. The apoptotic rates of the control, manumycin, methoxyamine and combination group were (2.34+/-0.30)%, (8.80+/-0.95)%, (2.21+/-0.19)%, and (13.37+/-0.91)%, respectively. The combination of manumycin with methoxyamine also promoted the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, activated caspase-9, and led appearance of specific cleavage of PARP in U937 cells. CONCLUSION: Methoxyamine enhances manumycin-induced apoptosis in U937 myeloid leukemia cells.",,"['She, Miao-Rong', 'Guo, Kun-Yuan', 'Niu, Xin-Qing', 'Lu, Xiao-Xun']","['She MR', 'Guo KY', 'Niu XQ', 'Lu XX']","['Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, P.

Mitoxantrone is an effective drug used for acute leukemias. This study was to observe the effects of mitoxantrone on the activity of recombinant holoenzyme of human protein kinase CK2 and proliferation in human leukemia cell line HL-60. METHODS: The CK2 holoenzyme composed of alphao and beta subunits was recombined in vitro. Subsequently, CK2 was treated with mitoxantrone at various concentrations, followed by addition of reacting liquid containing [gamma-32P] ATP. CK2 activity was measured by detecting the radioactivity of 32P transferred onto the substrates of CK2. The effect of mitoxantrone on the proliferation of HL-60 cells was detected by the trypan blue dye exclusion assay; the changes in the cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM); apoptosis was analyzed by FCM and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis; effects of the drugs on the intrinsic CK2 activity were measured by a specific CK2 peptide substrate. RESULTS: Mitoxantrone strongly inhibited the holoenzyme activity of recombinant human protein kinase CK2 (IC50=0.66 micromol/L). The inhibition of CKZ by mitoxantrone was competitive with respect to ATP (Ki 0.25 micromol/L) and mostly non-competitive with respect to casein (Ki 0.66 micromol/L). Mitoxantrone exerted strong cytotoxicity to HL-60 cells. When treated with 0.1 micromol/L mitoxantrone for 12 h, the apoptotic rate of HL-60 cells was 9.3%. Mitoxantrone did not affect intracellular CK2 activity. CONCLUSIONS: Mitoxantrone is a strong inhibitor of recombinant human protein kinase CK2 in vitro.

However, treatment administered to control this disease may be complicated by acute leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34 years old male was diagnosed to have Langerhans cell histiocytosis in March 1999. Unfortunately, the cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy given to control the repeated relapses and exacerbations of the primary disease predisposed him to therapy-induced myelodysplastic syndrome which transformed into acute myeloid leukemia. After achieving complete remission of his leukemia, the patient received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The allograft was complicated by chronic graft versus host disease that was controlled by various immunosuppressive agents and extracorporal photophoresis. CONCLUSION: Management of complicated cases of histiocytosis requires various therapeutic modalities and a multidisciplinary approach. Having complications of therapy eg myelodysplasia or acute leukemia make the outcome more dismal and the management options limited to aggressive forms of treatment. High dose chemotherapy followed by an allograft may be a curative option not only for therapy-related myelodysplasia/acute leukemia, but also for frequently relapsing and poorly controlled Langerhans cell histiocytosis.",,"['Al-Anazi, Khalid A', 'Alshehri, Abdulrahman', 'Al-Zahrani, Hazza A', 'Al-Mohareb, Fahad I', 'Maghfoor, Irfan', 'Ajarim, Dahish']","['Al-Anazi KA', 'Alshehri A', 'Al-Zahrani HA', 'Al-Mohareb FI', 'Maghfoor I', 'Ajarim D']","['Section of Adult Hematology and Hematopoietic, Stem Cell Transplant, King Faisal Cancer Centre, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, P,O, Box: 3345, Riyadh, 11211, Saudi Arabia. kaa_alanazi@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Cases J,Cases journal,101474272,,,,PMC2527498,,2008/08/20 09:00,2008/08/20 09:01,['2008/08/20 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:01 [medline]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['1757-1626-1-101 [pii]', '10.1186/1757-1626-1-101 [doi]']",epublish,Cases J. 2008 Aug 18;1(1):101. doi: 10.1186/1757-1626-1-101.,20080818,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whilst the dogma that CLL results from accumulation of dormant lymphocytes is supported by the unresponsiveness of leukaemic cells to antigens and polyclonal activators, recent in vivo kinetic measurements indicate that B lymphocytes do divide at significant rates in CLL. However, an important and still unanswered question is whether CLL cells proliferate faster or slower compared with their normal counterparts. This report addressed directly this point and compared B-cell kinetics in CLL subjects and healthy controls, using a pulse-chase approach based on incorporation of deuterium from 6,6-(2)H(2)-glucose into DNA. We confirmed that B cells proliferated at significant levels in CLL but found that the proliferation rates were reduced compared with healthy subjects (mean 0.47 vs. 1.31%/d respectively, P = 0.007), equivalent to an extended doubling time of circulating B cells (147 d vs. 53 d). In conclusion, CLL B cells proliferate at reduced levels compared with healthy controls. CLL is thus characterized by an aberrant B-cell kinetics with a decrease in cell turnover, an observation that may impact on elaboration of efficient therapeutic strategies.",,"['Defoiche, Julien', 'Debacq, Christophe', 'Asquith, Becca', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Lagneaux, Laurence', 'Macallan, Derek', 'Willems, Luc']","['Defoiche J', 'Debacq C', 'Asquith B', 'Zhang Y', 'Burny A', 'Bron D', 'Lagneaux L', 'Macallan D', 'Willems L']","['Molecular and Cellular Biology, FUSAG, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],['G0601072/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'AR09D82C7G (Deuterium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/analysis/metabolism', 'Deuterium/analysis/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,2008/08/20 09:00,2008/12/18 09:00,['2008/08/20 09:00'],"['2008/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7348 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07348.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Oct;143(2):240-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07348.x.

In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the most useful MRD assays are based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of antigen-receptor genes, and on flow cytometric detection of abnormal immunophenotypes. The latter is the only MRD assay available for most patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). PCR amplification of chromosomal breakpoints and fusion transcripts can also be used to track MRD in a minority of patients with ALL or AML. Because of the strong correlation between MRD levels and risk of relapse, several ongoing regimens include treatment intensification for children with higher MRD. Treatment de-intensification for patients with early MRD clearance is also being tested. In addition to their direct clinical application, MRD measurements can be used to better understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of drug resistance in vivo. The identification of new markers of leukaemia and the use of increasingly sophisticated technologies for detection of rare cells should further facilitate routine monitoring of MRD and elucidate the features of drug-resistant leukaemic cells.",,"['Campana, Dario']",['Campana D'],"[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. dario.campana@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['CA115422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA115422-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA060419-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA115422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC2784675,['NIHMS154353'],2008/08/20 09:00,2009/01/08 09:00,['2008/08/20 09:00'],"['2008/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7350 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07350.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Nov;143(4):481-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07350.x.

Femoral midshaft fractures were produced in Fischer 344 rats by the three-point bending technique. The MLV-HA-LMP-1 or control vector was applied at the fracture site through percutaneous injections 1 day postfracture. Analysis of fracture healing of 10 MLV-HA-LMP-1-treated and 10 control MLV-beta-galactosidase (beta-gal)-treated animals was completed at 3 weeks by X-ray, peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and histology. MLV-HA-LMP-1-treated animals had 63% more bone mineral content at the fracture site (P < 0.01), 34% greater total hard callus area (P < 0.05), and 45% less cartilage in the fracture callus (P < 0.05) compared to MLV-beta-gal-treated animals. There was no effect of LMP-1 treatment on the density of the hard callus. Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of the LMP-1 transgene in the fracture callus at 21 days postfracture. Immunohistochemistry also revealed that LMP-1 transgene expression did not result in an increase in BMP-4 expression in the fracture callus. Compared to MLV-BMP-4 gene therapy studies, MLV-HA-LMP-1 gene therapy improved bony union of the fracture gap to a greater extent and did not cause heterotopic bone formation. This suggests that LMP-1 may be a better potential candidate for gene therapy for fracture repair than BMP-4. These exciting, albeit preliminary, findings indicate that LMP-1-based gene therapy may potentially be a simple and effective means to enhance fracture repair that warrants further investigation.",,"['Strohbach, Cassandra A', 'Rundle, Charles H', 'Wergedal, Jon E', 'Chen, Shin-Tai', 'Linkhart, Thomas A', 'Lau, K-H William', 'Strong, Donna D']","['Strohbach CA', 'Rundle CH', 'Wergedal JE', 'Chen ST', 'Linkhart TA', 'Lau KH', 'Strong DD']","['Musculoskeletal Disease Center, Jerry L.

We focus on etiologic research, where the aim is to make inferences about spatially varying environmental factors influencing the risk of disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We illustrate the approach through three exemplars: a) magnetic fields from overhead electric power lines and the occurrence of childhood leukemia, which illustrates the use of geographic information systems to focus on areas with high exposure prevalence; b) drinking-water disinfection by-products and reproductive outcomes, taking advantage of large between- to within-area variability in exposures from the water supply; and c) chronic exposure to air pollutants and cardiorespiratory health, where issues of socioeconomic confounding are particularly important. DISCUSSION: The small-area epidemiologic approach assigns exposure estimates to individuals based on location of residence or other geographic variables such as workplace or school. In this way, large populations can be studied, increasing the ability to investigate rare exposures or rare diseases. The approach is most effective when there is well-defined exposure variation across geographic units, limited within-area variation, and good control for potential confounding across areas. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with traditional individual-based approaches, small-area studies offer a valuable addition to the armamentarium of the environmental epidemiologist. Modeling of exposure patterns coupled with collection of individual-level data on subsamples of the population should lead to improved risk estimates (i.e., less potential for bias) and help strengthen etiologic inference.",,"['Elliott, Paul', 'Savitz, David A']","['Elliott P', 'Savitz DA']","['Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK. p.elliott@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)']",IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology', 'Electric Power Supplies', '*Environmental Exposure', '*Epidemiologic Research Design', '*Geographic Information Systems', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Magnetics', 'Reproduction/drug effects', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/epidemiology', '*Small-Area Analysis', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical/toxicity', 'Water Purification']",PMC2516594,,2008/08/19 09:00,2008/09/11 09:00,['2008/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.10817 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2008 Aug;116(8):1098-104. doi: 10.1289/ehp.10817.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['air pollution', 'chlorination by-products', 'exposure assessment', 'extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields', 'small-area studies', 'spatial epidemiology']",,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed currently available data to determine the extent to which recent studies assist in distinguishing the effect of pentachlorophenol from that of its contaminants (e.g., dioxins and other chlorophenols). DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: We performed a systematic review of published studies pertaining to cancer risk in relation to pentachlorophenol exposure, focusing on results pertaining specifically to all cancer sites and specific hematopoietic cancers, and data pertaining to risks associated with other types of chlorophenols, dioxins, or furans. SYNTHESIS: The pentachlorophenol studies presented considerable evidence pertaining to hematopoietic cancers, with strong associations seen in multiple studies, in different locations, and using different designs. There is little evidence of an association between these cancers and chlorophenols that contain fewer than four chlorines. The extension of a large cohort study of sawmill workers, with follow-up to 1995, provided information about risks of relatively rare cancers (e.g., non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma), using a validated exposure assessment procedure that distinguishes between exposures to pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol. In contrast with dioxin, pentachlorophenol exposure has not been associated with total cancer incidence or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The updated cohort study focusing on pentachlorophenol provides increased statistical power and precision, and demonstrates associations between hematopoietic cancer and pentachlorophenol exposure not observed in earlier evaluations of this cohort. Contaminant confounding is an unlikely explanation for the risks seen with pentachlorophenol exposure.",,"['Cooper, Glinda S', 'Jones, Samantha']","['Cooper GS', 'Jones S']","['National Center for Environmental Assessment, US Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460, USA. cooper.glinda@epa.gov']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Chlorophenols)', '0 (Dioxins)', '0 (Fungicides, Industrial)', 'D9BSU0SE4T (Pentachlorophenol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Chlorophenols/*toxicity', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dioxins/*toxicity', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Fungicides, Industrial/*toxicity', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentachlorophenol/*toxicity', 'Risk Assessment']",PMC2516570,,2008/08/19 09:00,2008/09/11 09:00,['2008/08/19 09:00'],"['2007/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.11081 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2008 Aug;116(8):1001-8. doi: 10.1289/ehp.11081.,,55,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'childhood leukemia', 'chlorophenols', 'dioxins', 'furans', 'multiple myeloma', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'pentachlorophenol', 'soft-tissue sarcoma']",,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A descriptive epidemiological study. SETTING: University teaching hospital, Haematology Clinic, Skopje. RESULTS: The crude incidence rates of acute leukaemia in adults during this period increased substantially (p for overall trend < 0.001). The lowest crude incidence rates (CIR) were observed in 1996 (CIR = 1.64/100 000; 95% Confidence Interval CI = 1.1-2.4), while the highest were noted in 2003 (CIR = 3.76/100 000; 95% CI = 2.9-4.8). In 1993 the sex ratio of the incidence rates (males to females) was Rate Ratio (RR) = 2.23, while as of 2001 the association between sexes disappeared (RR = 1). The trend in males was not significant (p = 0.160), while in females it showed a monotonic increase that was highly significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During a short period of time (11 years) we have noted an increase in the incidence rates of acute leukaemia in our population aged 15 years and above. The study suggests that this could be due to increased risk in females, and in adults over 40 years. In addition, according to the census results in 1994 and 2002 the proportion of people aged 65 and above increased by 30.5% implying that this demographic change could account for part of the relative increase in the incidence rates of acute leukaemia. Further analytic studies are needed to address the possible causes of these changes. What is already known on this topic: The risk of acute leukaemia increases by age and it is higher in males than in females. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The incidence rates are equal between the sexes; the increase in risk of acute leukemia in females could be due to environmental risk factor.",,"['Lazarevic, Vladimir', 'Paltiel, Ora', 'Georgievski, Borce']","['Lazarevic V', 'Paltiel O', 'Georgievski B']","['Department of Social Medicine, Medical Faculty, Skopje, R.

TOSO was identified as overexpressed candidate gene in CLL, applying unit-transformation assays of publicly available microarray datasets. Based on CLL samples from 106 patients, TOSO was identified to exhibit elevated relative expression (RE) of 6.8 compared with healthy donor B cells using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR; P = .004). High levels of TOSO expression in CLL correlated with high leukocyte count, advanced Binet stage, previous need for chemotherapy, and unmutated IgV(H) status. CD38(+) CLL subsets harboring proliferative activity showed enhanced TOSO expression. We evaluated functional mechanisms of aberrant TOSO expression and identified TOSO expression significantly induced by B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation compared with control cells (RE; 8.25 vs 4.86; P = .01). In contrast, CD40L signaling significantly reduced TOSO expression (RE, 2.60; P = .01). In summary, we show that the antiapoptotic factor TOSO is associated with progressive disease and enhanced in the proliferative CD38(+) CLL subset. Both association with unmutated IgV(H) and the specific induction of TOSO via the BCR suggest autoreactive BCR signaling as a key mediator of apoptosis resistance in CLL.",,"['Pallasch, Christian Philipp', 'Schulz, Alexandra', 'Kutsch, Nadine', 'Schwamb, Janine', 'Hagist, Susanne', 'Kashkar, Hamid', 'Ultsch, Alfred', 'Wickenhauser, Claudia', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin']","['Pallasch CP', 'Schulz A', 'Kutsch N', 'Schwamb J', 'Hagist S', 'Kashkar H', 'Ultsch A', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Hallek M', 'Wendtner CM']","['Laboratory of Cellular Immunotherapy, Clinic I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (FCMR protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2008/08/19 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/19 09:00'],"['2008/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51876-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-157255 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Nov 15;112(10):4213-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-05-157255.

Some evidence for these effects originated from region II of Chile, which had a period of elevated arsenic levels in drinking water, in particular from 1958 to 1970. This unique exposure scenario provides a rare opportunity to investigate the effects of early-life arsenic exposure on childhood mortality; to our knowledge, this is the first study of childhood cancer mortality and high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water. In this article, we compare cancer mortality rates under the age of 20 in region II during 1950 to 2000 with those of unexposed region V, dividing subjects into those born before, during, or after the peak exposure period. Mortality from the most common childhood cancers, leukemia and brain cancer, was not increased in the exposed population. However, we found that childhood liver cancer mortality occurred at higher rates than expected. For those exposed as young children, liver cancer mortality between ages 0 and 19 was especially high: the relative risk (RR) for males born during this period was 8.9 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.7-45.8; P = 0.009]; for females, the corresponding RR was 14.1 (95% CI, 1.6-126; P = 0.018); and for males and females pooled, the RR was 10.6 (95% CI, 2.9-39.2; P < 0.001).

The SUMO-binding ubiquitin ligase RNF4 mediates this modification and causes disruption of PML nuclear bodies upon treatment with ATO. Reconstitution of SUMO-dependent ubiquitylation of PML by RNF4 in vitro and in a yeast trans vivo system revealed a preference of RNF4 for chain forming SUMOs.

Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) metabolises thiopurine drugs and influences their cytotoxic activity. TPMT, like DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), transfers methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and generates S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Since SAM levels are dependent on de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) and the metabolic products of 6-TG and 6-MP differ in their ability to inhibit DNPS, we postulated that 6-TG compared to 6-MP would have differential effects on changes in SAM and SAH levels and global DNA methylation, depending on TPMT status. To test this hypothesis, we used a human embryonic kidney cell line with inducible TPMT. Although changes in SAM and SAH levels occurred with each drug, decrease in global DNA methylation more closely reflected a decrease in DNMT activity. Inhibition was influenced by TPMT for 6-TG, but not 6-MP. The decrease in global methylation and DNMT activity with 6-MP, or with 6-TG when TPMT expression was low, were comparable to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. However, this was not reflected in changes in methylation at the level of an individual marker gene (MAGE1A). The results suggest that a non-TPMT metabolised metabolite of 6-MP and 6-TG and the TPMT-metabolised 6-MP metabolite 6-methylthioguanosine 5'-monophosphate, contribute to a decrease in DNMT levels and global DNA methylation. As demethylating agents have shown promise in leukaemia treatment, inhibition of DNA methylation by the thiopurine drugs may contribute to their cytotoxic affects.",,"['Hogarth, L A', 'Redfern, C P F', 'Teodoridis, J M', 'Hall, A G', 'Anderson, H', 'Case, M C', 'Coulthard, S A']","['Hogarth LA', 'Redfern CP', 'Teodoridis JM', 'Hall AG', 'Anderson H', 'Case MC', 'Coulthard SA']","['Leukaemia Research Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK. l.a.hogarth@ncl.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Methyltransferases/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/metabolism', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology']",,,2008/08/19 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/08/19 09:00'],"['2008/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(08)00515-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.07.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Oct 15;76(8):1024-35. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.07.026.

Furthermore, the signaling pathway underlying its action is poorly understood. Here, we have evaluated IL-21-induced cytokine production in human monocytes and U937 leukemia cells. We found that IL-21 induces upregulation of a variety of cytokines from multiple cytokine families. We also found that IL-21 triggers rapid activation of ERK1/2. Neutralizing antibody to the IL-21R prevented both IL-21-induced cytokine production and IL-21-induced activation of ERK1/2.

The wiring diagrams composed of these interaction networks capture a static view of cellular state. An important challenge in systems biology is obtaining a dynamic perspective on these networks by integrating them with gene expression measurements taken under multiple conditions. We present a top-down computational approach to identify building blocks of molecular interaction networks by: (i) integrating gene expression measurements for a particular disease state (e.g., leukemia) or experimental condition (e.g., treatment with growth serum) with molecular interactions to reveal an active network, which is the network of interactions active in the cell in that disease state or condition; and (ii) systematically combining active networks computed for different experimental conditions using set-theoretic formulae to reveal network legos, which are modules of coherently interacting genes and gene products in the wiring diagram. We propose efficient methods to compute active networks, systematically mine candidate legos, assess the statistical significance of these candidates, arrange them in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and exploit the structure of the DAG to identify true network legos. We describe methods to assess the stability of our computations to changes in the input and to recover active networks by composing network legos. We analyze two human datasets using our method. A comparison of three leukemias demonstrates how a biologist can use our system to identify specific differences between these diseases. A larger-scale analysis of 13 distinct stresses illustrates our ability to compute the building blocks of the interaction networks activated in response to these stresses.

The aim of our study was to determine whether the chemokine CXCL7 stimulates migration of human bone marrow-derived MSC and to analyze the effect of CXCL7 on the recruitment of MSC on the broad molecular level. Chemotaxis assays documented that high doses of CXCL7 significantly recruited MSC. Gene expression profiling using oligonucleotide microarrays showed that MSC treated with CXCL7 differentially expressed genes related to cell migration, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling. Pathway analysis showed that CXCL7 induced the expression of all chemokines binding the interleukin (IL) receptors A and B, CXCR1 and CXCR2, as well as the IL6 signal transducer (gp130) and its ligands IL6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Induction of differentially expressed chemokines CXCL1-3, CXCL5, and CXCL6 as well as LIF and gp130 in MSC by CXCL7 was verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunoassay of cell culture supernatants confirmed elevated levels of the interleukins 6 and 8 in MSC upon treatment with CXCL7. Chemotaxis assays showed that interleukin 6 did not recruit MSC. In conclusion, CXCL7 significantly stimulates the migration of human MSC in vitro. Pathway analysis suggests that recruitment of human MSC by CXCL7 is supported by the induction of ligands of the interleukin 8 receptors, synergistically activating the respective signaling pathways.",,"['Kalwitz, Gregor', 'Endres, Michaela', 'Neumann, Katja', 'Skriner, Karl', 'Ringe, Jochen', 'Sezer, Orhan', 'Sittinger, Michael', 'Haupl, Thomas', 'Kaps, Christian']","['Kalwitz G', 'Endres M', 'Neumann K', 'Skriner K', 'Ringe J', 'Sezer O', 'Sittinger M', 'Haupl T', 'Kaps C']","['TransTissue Technologies GmbH, Tucholskystrasse 2, 10117 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (PPBP protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8B)', '0 (beta-Thromboglobulin)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8B/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'beta-Thromboglobulin/immunology/*metabolism']",,,2008/08/19 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2008/08/19 09:00'],"['2008/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(08)00313-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2008.07.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2009 Mar;41(3):649-58. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2008.07.011.

However, their application is often limited by a rapid loss of bioactivity: retroviruses spontaneously loose activity at 37 degrees C, with a half-life of 4 to 9 h depending on the retrovirus type. We sought to determine which components of the retrovirus are responsible for this loss in bioactivity and to obtain a quantitative characterization of their stability. To this end, we focused on RNA and viral proteins, two major components that we hypothesized may undergo degradation and negatively influence viral infectivity. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) targeting RNA encoding portions of the viral genome clearly demonstrated time-dependent degradation of RNA which correlated with the loss in viral bioactivity. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analyses of viral proteins did not show any change in secondary structure or evidence of proteolysis. The mechanism underlying the degradation of viral RNA was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis of proteins encoded by the viral genome. Reverse transcriptase and protease mutants exhibited enhanced RNA stability in comparison to wild type recombinant virus, suggesting that the degradation of RNA, and the corresponding virus loss of activity, is mediated by the reverse transcriptase enzyme.",,"['Casali, Monica', 'Zambonelli, Carlo', 'Goldwasser, Jonathan', 'Vu, Halong N', 'Yarmush, Martin L']","['Casali M', 'Zambonelli C', 'Goldwasser J', 'Vu HN', 'Yarmush ML']","['Department of Surgery, Center for Engineering in Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Shriners Burns Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA. mcasali@hms.harvard.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Genome, Viral', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/genetics']",,,2008/08/19 09:00,2008/11/06 09:00,['2008/08/19 09:00'],"['2008/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(08)00458-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2008.07.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2008 Oct 10;380(1):91-8. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2008.07.011.

IL-18 treatment increased ULBP2 expression in leukemia cells at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, PD98059 (an ERK1/2 MAPK inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) attenuated IL-18-induced ULBP2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. We observed that ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK phosphorylation increased upon treatment with IL-18. IL-18 elevated CD107a expression in cancer cells and increased the cytotoxic activity of NK cells; therefore, we propose that IL-18 increases the susceptibility of target cells by inducing surface expression of ULBP2.

METHODS: In 24 hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) patients, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nested PCR and sequence analysis, we investigated the frequency of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and other abnormalities of tyrosine kinase family genes like PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta, C-KIT, FGFR1, ABL and FLT3 as well as gene mutation ""hotspots"", like MPL515 and JAK2V617F, frequently involved in myeloproliferative diseases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to confirm the 4q12 deletion. RESULTS: The FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion transcript was found in 8 (33%) of 24 patients with HES, corresponding to the chromosome 4q12 deletion identified by FISH. The FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-associated patients diagnosed with CEL, frequently had hepatosplenomegaly, eosinophil-related tissue damage, anemia, thrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis and a short overall survival time. Nevertheless, imatinib mesylate induced rapid and complete hematological responses in treated FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha cases, followed by molecular remission and reversal of myelofibrosis. FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion could co-exist with other mutations of tyrosine kinase family genes, like FLT3 or PDGFRbeta. We also demonstrated that the SNPs of PDGFRbeta were associated with selective splicing of exon 19 in case 20. CONCLUSIONS: Correlating the CEL genotype with phenotype, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha emerges as a relatively homogeneous clinicobiological entity that co-exists with other abnormalities of tyrosine kinase family genes. It reflects the disease progression and there is a good response to imatinib. Detection of the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion gene is valid for both CEL diagnosis and therapy surveillance.",,"['Wang, Lin-na', 'Pan, Qin', 'Fu, Jian-fei', 'Shi, Jing-yi', 'Jin, Jie', 'Li, Jun-ming', 'Hu, Jiong', 'Zhao, Wei-li', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Sai-juan']","['Wang LN', 'Pan Q', 'Fu JF', 'Shi JY', 'Jin J', 'Li JM', 'Hu J', 'Zhao WL', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (FIP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*genetics']",,,2008/08/19 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/19 09:00'],"['2008/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2008 May 20;121(10):867-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An anti-resistant stealthy liposomal vincristine plus quinacrine was defined in this study. Human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 and MDR K562 cells were included for comparisons. Anti-tumor activity studies were performed on female BALB/c nude mice with MDR K562 cell xenografts. Results showed that quinacrine was effective in reversing the resistance in the MDR K562 cells, and enhanced the anti-tumor effect of vincristine in K562 cells. The caspase-9 and -3 activities in the MDR K562 and K562 cells were increased with the dose rise of quinacrine. In the MDR K562 cell xenografts in mice, the anti-resistant tumor effect of the stealthy liposomal vincristine plus quinacrine was evidently observed. The enhanced anti-tumor effects of vincristine by quinacrine in the resistant/non-resistant K562 cells could be because of the direct injury and the potentiating apoptotic effect of vincristine via activating the initiator caspase-9 and subsequently the effector caspase-3, and the long circulatory effect of stealthy liposomes.

In this study, the expression pattern of FCRL1-5 molecules was investigated in Iranian patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Our RT-PCR results have demonstrated that all FCRL molecules, except FCRL4, were expressed in the vast majority of the patients with B-CLL. However, comparison of the relative mRNA expression levels of FCRL between B-CLL (n = 86) and elderly normal subjects (n = 10) revealed significantly lower expression levels of FCRL1 (p < 0.0001), FCRL3 (p = 0.01) and FCRL4 (p = 0.002), but not FCRL2 or FCRL5, in cases with B-CLL. No significant differences were observed between the indolent and progressive subtypes of patients with B-CLL. Comparison between the mutated and unmutated subtypes revealed a significantly higher expression level of FCRL3 (p = 0.017) in patients with mutated CLL. Surface and intracytoplasmic expression of FCRL1, 2, 4 and 5 in leukemic cells of 12 patients by flow cytometry revealed similar results to those obtained by RT-PCR with a few exceptions. Thus, while FCRL4 was expressed in only 2 samples at intracytoplasmic level, FCRL1 and 2 were expressed in the majority of samples, both at surface and intracytoplasm. FCRL5 protein was also detected in 10 samples, but surface expression was confirmed in only 2. Analysis of B-cells from 5 normal subjects by flow cytometry revealed higher expression levels of FCRL molecules compared to CLL. Our results indicate differential expression of FCRL molecules in B-CLL and suggest the potential implication of FCRL1 and 2 for immunotherapeutic interventions.","['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Kazemi, Tohid', 'Asgarian-Omran, Hossein', 'Hojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad', 'Shabani, Mahdi', 'Memarian, Ali', 'Sharifian, Ramazan Ali', 'Razavi, Seyed Mohsen', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood', 'Rabbani, Hodjatallah', 'Shokri, Fazel']","['Kazemi T', 'Asgarian-Omran H', 'Hojjat-Farsangi M', 'Shabani M', 'Memarian A', 'Sharifian RA', 'Razavi SM', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Rabbani H', 'Shokri F']","['Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (FCRL2 protein, human)', '0 (FCRL3 protein, human)', '0 (FCRL4 protein, human)', '0 (FCRL5 protein, human)', '0 (FCRLA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Receptors, Fc/*genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2008/08/16 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/08/16 09:00'],"['2008/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23751 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Nov 1;123(9):2113-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23751.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite its relative tolerability, some patients require a lower dosage or temporary cessation of treatment because of severe adverse events. It remains unclear whether reduced-dose imatinib is as effective as the standard dose in achieving and maintaining a major molecular response (MMolR), an important goal of imatinib therapy. In this study, Japanese patients with CML-CP, as classified by their Sokal scores, were treated with imatinib. MMolR was observed in all patients with low Sokal scores who were treated with 300 or 400 mg/day imatinib, suggesting that low scores predict favorable response to treatment even at lower dosages, which is preferable since it is associated with fewer adverse events. Low-dose therapy also achieved MMolR in patients with intermediate or high scores. However, loss of complete cytogenetic response (CCgR) or an increase in BCR-ABL transcripts was noted shortly after these patients achieved CCgR, suggesting that a CCgR short of MMolR still indicated a risk of loss of response in these risk categories. MMolR was maintained in these patients by timely increases in dosage.

Inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway reduce BCR-ABL-mediated transformation in vitro; however, the specific PI3K isoforms involved are poorly defined. Using a murine model of Ph+ pre-B-ALL, we found that deletion of both Pik3r1 and Pik3r2, genes encoding class IA PI3K regulatory isoforms, severely impaired transformation. BCR-ABL-dependent pre/pro-B cell lines could be established at low frequency from progenitors that lacked these genes, but the cells were smaller, proliferated more slowly, and failed to cause leukemia in vivo. These cell lines displayed nearly undetectable PI3K signaling function and were resistant to the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. However, they maintained activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and were more sensitive to rapamycin. Treatment with rapamycin caused feedback activation of AKT in WT cell lines but not PI3K-deficient lines. A dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR, PI-103, was more effective than rapamycin at suppressing proliferation of mouse pre-B-ALL and human CD19+CD34+)Ph+ ALL leukemia cells treated with the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib.

Initial antibiotic treatment is chosen empirically before the results of cultures are available. Rational choices depend on updated knowledge of microbial resistance patterns. We have examined microorganisms in blood cultures over a 10-year period and compared them with the preceding 5-year period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed isolates from blood cultures in patients with a hematological malignant disorder treated in the Hematology Unit, St. Olavs Hospital during the years 1995 - 2005. RESULTS: We found 373 isolates and 322 episodes of bacteremia in 225 patients. Most patients had acute leukemia or myeloma, with neutropenia after cytostatic treatment. The dominating pathogens were Escherichia coli (20 %), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13 %) and alpha-haemolytic streptococci (10 %). Enterococcus infections seem to occur more frequently and were associated with a high mortality. Gram-negative organisms constituted 48 % and gram-positive organisms 48 % of the isolates. About 3 / 4 of the patients had infections with penicillin-resistant bacteria. There was a low prevalence of organisms resistant to aminoglycoside. Acute leukemia patients with bacteremia had a 30-days all-cause mortality of 10.3 %. INTERPRETATION: We found small changes in the pattern of pathogens and antibiotic resistance over time. The rates of antibiotic resistance were favorable compared to other European countries. The mortality rate seems to be unchanged and acceptable. Penicillin G and aminoglycoside can still be considered as first-line treatment for suspected bacteremia in neutropenic patients in Norway.",,"['Hammerstrom, Jens', 'Roym, Anja Lokken', 'Gran, Frode Width']","['Hammerstrom J', 'Roym AL', 'Gran FW']",['Hematologisk avdeling St. Olavs Hospital 7006 Trondheim og Institutt for kreftforskning og molekylaer medisin Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet. jens.hammerstrom@ntnu.no'],['nor'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'Q42T66VG0C (Penicillin G)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/immunology/microbiology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology/microbiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/immunology/microbiology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Penicillin G/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2008/08/16 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/08/16 09:00'],"['2008/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['1712660 [pii]'],ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2008 Aug 14;128(15):1655-9.,,,,Bakteriemi ved maligne blodsykdommer.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arctium lappa Linne (Compositae) (AL) has been used as a traditional medicine in Brazil and throughout Asia and is known to have an anti-inflammatory effect. In this study, the inhibitory effects of AL on degranulation and the release of mediators as well as on inhibition of cys-leukotriene biosynthesis by basophils were investigated. AL was selected out of 10,000 herbal extracts in a set-up for high throughput screening in which the degree of degranulation was monitored by the release of beta-hexosaminidase from rat basophil leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. The AL extract significantly reduced degranulation and biosynthesis of cys-leukotrienes of human basophils in peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 8.3 and 11.4 microg/ml, respectively). Viability and metabolic activity of the PBMCs were not affected. Although arctiin, the active component of AL that has been described in the literature, was not able to reduce degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells, a single high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fraction from the AL extract inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release (IC(50) = 22.2 microg/ml). Topical administration of an aqueous extract of AL (5 mg/ear) on the ear of whey-sensitized mice 4 hrs before challenge with whey in the ear inhibited acute ear swelling by 50% in an in vivo cow's milk allergic model. The extract had no effect in this model when administered orally. In conclusion, the active component present in the active HPLC fraction of the AL extract was able to significantly reduce the release of inflammatory mediators through inhibition of degranulation and cys-leukotriene release in vitro. In addition, this active component was able to inhibit acute skin response in mice in vivo, indicating that AL is a very promising natural component for use in anti-allergic treatment.",,"['Knipping, Karen', 'van Esch, Elisabeth C A M', 'Wijering, Selva C', 'van der Heide, Sicco', 'Dubois, Anthony E', 'Garssen, Johan']","['Knipping K', 'van Esch EC', 'Wijering SC', 'van der Heide S', 'Dubois AE', 'Garssen J']","['University of Utrecht, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sorbonnelaan 16, 3508 TC Utrecht, The Netherlands. c.t.knipping@uu.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Arctium/*chemistry', 'Basophil Degranulation Test', 'Basophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Ear Diseases/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Edema/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukotrienes/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Rats']",,,2008/08/16 09:00,2009/01/16 09:00,['2008/08/16 09:00'],"['2008/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['0803-RM-97 [pii]', '10.3181/0803-RM-97 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2008 Nov;233(11):1469-77. doi: 10.3181/0803-RM-97.

The significance of CD20 expression has been evaluated in childhood precursor B-lineage ALL with conflicting results. We retrospectively analyzed the influence of CD20 expression on outcome in 253 adults with de novo precursor B-lineage ALL treated with either conventional (VAD/CVAD) or intensive (hyper-CVAD) frontline chemotherapy regimens in the pre-rituximab era. Overall, CD20 positivity of at least 20% was associated with lower 3-year rates of complete remission duration (CRD; 20% vs 55%, P < .001) and overall survival (OS; 27% vs 40%, p = .03). In the CD20 negative subset, the 3-year rates for CRD (58% vs 42%, p = .04) and OS (60% vs 28%, P < .001) were superior for hyper-CVAD compared with VAD/CVAD; rates were particularly favorable for the CD20 negative younger age group (68% and 85%, respectively). In contrast, 3-year CRD and OS rates were uniformly poor for the CD20-positive group regardless of therapy (27% or less). Multivariate analysis for event-free survival identified older age, leukocyte count higher than 30 x 10(9)/L, presence of Philadelphia chromosome, high systemic risk classification, and CD20 positivity as independent predictors of worse outcome.

Neutrophils and antimicrobial peptides are major components of innate defense with the capacity of rapid bacterial killing. Patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) experience recurrent and chronic infections despite recombinant G-CSF-mobilized neutrophils. We have shown previously that these neutrophils are deficient in that they lack the antimicrobial peptide LL-37. Here, we show that pro-LL-37 mRNA is not expressed in neutrophil precursors from patients with SCN, although the gene and promoter region for pro-LL-37, CAMP, does not display any mutations. The hormonal form of vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] induced the expression of pro-LL-37 in isolated neutrophil progenitors and in EBV-transformed B cells from patients with SCN, whereas all-trans retinoic acid only induced expression in transformed B cells.

Our purpose was to determine whether (111)In-HuM195 anti-CD33 antibodies modified with peptides harboring nuclear localizing sequences (NLS) could kill drug-resistant AML cell lines and primary AML patient specimens expressing MDR transporters through the emission of Auger electrons. METHODS: HuM195, M195, and irrelevant mouse IgG (mIgG) were conjugated to 10+/-3 NLS peptides and then labeled with (111)In by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid substitution to a specific activity of 1-8 MBq/microg. The binding affinity of HuM195 and M195 was determined for HL-60 and mitoxantrone-resistant HL-60-MX-1 cells. Nuclear localization of (111)In-NLS-HuM195, (111)In-NLS-M195, (111)In-HuM195, and (111)In-M195 was measured by subcellular fractionation. The antiproliferative effects of (111)In-NLS-HuM195, (111)In-NLS-M195, (111)In-HuM195, and (111)In-M195 (2.5-250 kBq/well) on HL-60 and HL-60-MX-1 were studied using the WST-1 assay. Clonogenic survival of HL-60 and HL-60-MX-1 leukemic cells and 10 primary AML specimens with MDR phenotype (assessed by flow cytometry) was determined after exposure for 3 h at 37 degrees C to 2.5-250 mBq/cell of (111)In-NLS-HuM195, (111)In-HuM195, or (111)In-NLS-mIgG. Clonogenic survival versus the amount of radioactivity incubated with the cells (mBq/cell) was plotted, and the mean lethal amount of radioactivity and the lower asymptote of the curve (plateau) were determined. RESULTS: The (111)In-labeled anti-CD33 monoclonal antibodies HuM195 and M195 modified with NLS were efficiently routed to the nucleus of HL-60 cells and their mitoxantrone-resistant clone after CD33-mediated internalization. The following are the principal findings of our study: (111)In-NLS-HuM195 was more effective at killing HL-60 and HL-60-MX-1 cells than was (111)In-HuM195, a strong correlation between the specific activity of the (111)In-labeled radioimmunoconjugates and their cytotoxicity toward AML cells existed, and leukemic cells from patients were killed by (111)In-NLS-M195 or (111)In-M195, but the cytotoxic response among specimens was heterogeneous. CONCLUSION: NLS conjugation enhanced the nuclear uptake and cytotoxicity of (111)In-HuM195 and (111)In-M195 toward drug-resistant AML cell lines as well as patient specimens expressing a diversity of MDR phenotypes, including Pgp-170, BCRP1, or MRP1 transporters. Targeted Auger electron radioimmunotherapy using (111)In-labeled anti-CD33 monoclonal antibodies modified with NLS may be able to overcome MDR and provide a means of treating chemotherapy-resistant myeloid leukemias in patients.",,"['Kersemans, Veerle', 'Cornelissen, Bart', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Reilly, Raymond M']","['Kersemans V', 'Cornelissen B', 'Minden MD', 'Brandwein J', 'Reilly RM']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (NCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 2)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*radiation effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indium Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy', 'Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 2', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/*therapeutic use', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology']",,,2008/08/16 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/08/16 09:00'],"['2008/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['jnumed.107.047399 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.107.047399 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2008 Sep;49(9):1546-54. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.107.047399.

We found first-degree relatives of LPL/WM patients to have 20-fold (4.1-98.4), 3.0-fold (2.0-4.4), 3.4-fold (1.7-6.6), and 5.0-fold (1.3-18.9) increased risks of developing LPL/WM, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), respectively. However, there was no evidence of an increased risk of developing multiple myeloma or Hodgkin lymphoma. In analyses stratified by type of first-degree relative (parent, sibling, offspring), age at diagnosis of the probands (greater or less than 70 years), and sex of the first-degree relative, we did not observe the risk estimates to be significantly different compared with the overall analyses. Our findings of highly increased risks of developing LPL/WM, NHL, CLL, and MGUS support the operation of shared susceptibility genes that predispose to LPL/WM and other lymphoproliferative disorders.",,"['Kristinsson, Sigurdur Y', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Goldin, Lynn R', 'McMaster, Mary L', 'Turesson, Ingemar', 'Landgren, Ola']","['Kristinsson SY', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Goldin LR', 'McMaster ML', 'Turesson I', 'Landgren O']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. sigurdur.kristinsson@karolinska.se .']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Family Health', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Sweden', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*epidemiology/*genetics']",PMC2569164,,2008/08/16 09:00,2008/10/17 09:00,['2008/08/16 09:00'],"['2008/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59708-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-162768 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Oct 15;112(8):3052-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-162768.

We report that PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger, Zbtb16), a member of the BTB/POZ-ZF family of transcription factors that includes the CD4-lineage-specific c-Krox (Th-POK), is exquisitely specific to CD1d-restricted NKT cells and human MR1-specific MAIT cells. PLZF was induced immediately after positive selection of NKT cell precursors, and PLZF-deficient NKT cells failed to undergo the intrathymic expansion and effector differentiation that characterize their lineage. Instead, they preserved a naive phenotype and were directed to lymph nodes. Conversely, transgenic expression of PLZF induced CD4(+) thymocytes to acquire effector differentiation and migrate to nonlymphoid tissues. We suggest that PLZF is a transcriptional signature of NKT cells that directs their innate-like effector differentiation during thymic development.",,"['Savage, Adam K', 'Constantinides, Michael G', 'Han, Jin', 'Picard, Damien', 'Martin, Emmanuel', 'Li, Bofeng', 'Lantz, Olivier', 'Bendelac, Albert']","['Savage AK', 'Constantinides MG', 'Han J', 'Picard D', 'Martin E', 'Li B', 'Lantz O', 'Bendelac A']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Committee on Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 DK042086/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI038339-12A2/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI038339/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK42086/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK042086-18/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunity,Immunity,9432918,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology']",PMC2613001,['HHMIMS72586'],2008/08/16 09:00,2008/10/17 09:00,['2008/08/16 09:00'],"['2008/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1074-7613(08)00337-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.immuni.2008.07.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunity. 2008 Sep 19;29(3):391-403. doi: 10.1016/j.immuni.2008.07.011.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) suggest that chromosomal abnormalities occur more frequently, most commonly trisomy 12, retinoblastoma gene deletion (Rb1 gene) and P53 gene deletion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 30 patients with B-CLL were enrolled in the trial from two centers in Cairo, Egypt during the period May 2000 to January 2002. Karyotyping and FISH assessment for possible chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 12, Rb1 gene and P53 gene) were done at initial diagnosis. Results of cytogenetic abnormalities were correlated with clinical picture and survival. RESULTS: The median age was 57.4 years (range 40-75). Karyotyping technique showed that no metaphase could be detected in 30%, metaphase with normal karyotyping was observed in 63% and cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in two cases (one trisomy 12 and one deletion in chromosome 13). FISH examination of interphase and metaphase nuclei revealed cytogenetic abnormalities in 15 cases (50%), trisomy 12 in 9 (30%), Rb1 gene deletion in 5 (17%) and P53 gene deletion in 3. At diagnosis, patients with trisomy 12 were significantly associated with advanced stage and absolute lymphocyte count of >or=30,000/mm(3). Univariate analysis showed that absolute lymphocyte count >or=30,000/mm(3) (p=0.004) and trisomy 12 (p=0.024) were associated with poor progression free survival. CONCLUSION: Interphase and metaphase FISH studies improve the cytogenetic diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities in B-CLL.

However, several complications are reported with this treatment the most serious and life threatening being Retinoic Acid Syndrome (RAS). We aimed at identifying factors that could predict complications caused by ATRA during induction treatment of APL. PATIENTS: Forty-two patients with confirmed APL (by t(15;17) and/or PML/RARA) treated at our institution (University hospital of Tunis) between January 1998 and June 2006 using two consecutive protocols: European APL93 trial (24 patients) until February 2004 and Spanish PETHEMA LPA99 trial (18 patients) more recently. Induction regimen consisted of ATRA 45 mg/m(2)/d until CR combined to DNR 60 mg/m(2)/d x 3+Cytarabine 200 mg/m(2)/d x 7 (APL93) and Idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) d2, 4, 6, 8 (LPA99). Prednisone (0.5 mg/kg d1-d15) was added if WBC >10 x 10(9)/L to prevent RAS in LPA 99. RESULTS: Median age was 36 yr (7-64 yr), M/F=16/26 (0.61), median WBC was 2.4 x 10(9)/L (range 0.6-100 x 10(9)/L). WBC >10 x 10(9)/L was noted in 14 patients (33%). Additional cytogenetic abnormalities were seen in 12/42 (28%). Median body mass index (BMI=weight/height(2):N 20-25) was 24 kg/m(2) (range 16-40 kg/m(2)), BMI >30 was noted in nine patients (8F and 1M). Thirty-three patients achieved CR (78.57%):18/24 (75%) in APL93 versus 15/18 (83%) in LPA99. Nine patients (21.42%) had early death. Causes of early death were: RAS (6) and CNS hemorrhage (3). Complications due to ATRA were: RAS (10), Scrotal ulcerations (3), Sweet syndrome (2), Perineal ulcerations (1), and Pseudotumor cerebri (1). Prognostic factors for complications of ATRA (Fisher exact test) were: BMI >35 (p=0.055), induction treatment without cytarabine (LPA99 trial) (p=0.047), whereas age (p=0.74), gender (p=0.51), initial WBC (p=0.47), and additional cytogenetic abnormalities (p=0.83) were not predictive. Retinoic Acid Syndrome was more reported in patients with initial WBC >10 x 10(9)/L (p=0.08).

Flow cytometry allowed for the detection of AC141 expression in 42.8% of the patients. A strong correlation with myeloid lineage was observed. All AC141(+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases were of immature morphology and a strong concordance with CD34 expression was found. However, discordant patterns were also observed. Besides, AC141 expression correlated with CD7 in the absence of mature markers (CD14, CD15 and CD64). Similarly to CD34, P-glycoprotein levels were also significantly higher in AC141(+) AML cases.

The identification of biological correlates of outcome and therapeutic targets remains a significant challenge in this disease. We therefore analyzed a panel of potential biological markers to determine optimal prognostic markers. We constructed a tissue microarray from 97 intracranial tumors from 74 patients (WHO grade II-III) and analyzed the candidate markers nucleolin, telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT; antibody clone 44F12), survivin, Ki-67, and members of the receptor tyrosine kinase I (RTK-I) family by immunohistochemistry. Telomerase activity was determined using the in vitro-based telomere repeat amplification protocol assay, and telomere length was measured using the telomere restriction fragment assay. Primary tumors with low versus high nucleolin protein expression had a 5-year event-free survival of 74%+/-13% and 31%+/-7%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified low nucleolin expression to be independently associated with a more favorable prognosis (hazard ratio=6.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-24.2; p=0.008). Ki-67 and survivin correlated with histological grade but not with outcome. Immunohistochemical detection of the RTK-I family did not correlate with grade or outcome. Telomerase activity was evident in 19 of 22 primary tumors, with telomere lengthening and/or maintenance occurring in five of seven recurrent cases. Low nucleolin expression was the single most important biological predictor of outcome in pediatric intracranial ependymoma.

IE1 consists of four distinct regions: an amino-terminal region required for nuclear localization, a large central hydrophobic region responsible for PML targeting and transactivation activity, an acidic domain, and a carboxyl-terminal chromatin tethering domain. We found that the acidic domain of IE1 is required for binding to STAT2. A mutant HCMV encoding IE1(Delta421-475) with the acidic domain deleted was generated. In mutant virus-infected cells, IE1(Delta421-475) failed to bind to STAT2. The growth of mutant virus was only slightly delayed at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) but was severely impaired at a low MOI with low-level accumulation of viral proteins. When cells were pretreated with beta interferon, the mutant virus showed an additional 1,000-fold reduction in viral growth, even at a high MOI, compared to the wild type. The inhibition of STAT2 loading on the target promoter upon infection was markedly reduced with mutant virus. Furthermore, sumoylation of IE1 at this acidic domain was found to abolish the activity of IE1 to bind to STAT2 and repress the interferon-stimulated genes. Our results provide genetic evidence that IE1 binding to STAT2 requires the 55-amino-acid acidic domain and promotes viral growth by interfering with interferon signaling and demonstrate that this viral activity is negatively regulated by a cellular sumoylation pathway.",,"['Huh, Yong Ho', 'Kim, Young Eui', 'Kim, Eui Tae', 'Park, Jung Jin', 'Song, Moon Jung', 'Zhu, Hua', 'Hayward, Gary S', 'Ahn, Jin-Hyun']","['Huh YH', 'Kim YE', 'Kim ET', 'Park JJ', 'Song MJ', 'Zhu H', 'Hayward GS', 'Ahn JH']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, Gyeonggido, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI024576/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI24576/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT2 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', '*Protein Interaction Mapping', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion']",PMC2573188,,2008/08/15 09:00,2008/11/01 09:00,['2008/08/15 09:00'],"['2008/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00833-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00833-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Nov;82(21):10444-54. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00833-08.

Molecular models were used to interpret the similarities and differences in specificity between these retroviral proteases. The results showed that the retroviral proteases had similar preferences (Phe and Tyr) for the P1 position in this sequence context, but differences were found for the P3 and P4 positions. Importantly, the sizes of the P3 and P4 residues appear to be a major contributor for specificity. The substrate specificities correlated well with the phylogenetic tree of the retroviruses.

We report the first comprehensive mutational screen of key exons of these genes in a large cohort of unselected acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases at diagnosis (n = 86) and in a more selected cohort at disease recurrence (n = 47) using the sensitive method of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. We show that somatic mutations that deregulate the pathway constitute one of the most common genetic aberrations in childhood ALL (cALL), being found in 35% of diagnostic and 25% of relapse samples.

In the present study, we show that up-regulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 is another mechanism critical for protection of melanoma cells against ER stress-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of Mcl-1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) rendered melanoma cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by the ER stress inducers thapsigargin and tunicamycin, but this sensitization was partially reversed by siRNA knockdown of PUMA or Noxa, as shown in Mcl-1-deficient melanoma cells. Both PUMA and Noxa were increased by ER stress through transcriptional up-regulation, but only up-regulation of Noxa was dependent on p53, whereas up-regulation of PUMA seemed to be mediated by a p53-independent mechanism(s). Up-regulation of Mcl-1 was also due to increased transcription that involved the IRE1alpha and activating transcription factor 6 signaling pathways of the unfolded protein response. In addition, activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway seemed to be necessary for optimal up-regulation of Mcl-1. Taken together, these results reveal the mechanisms of resistance of melanoma cells to apoptosis induction mediated by BH3-only proteins upon ER stress, and identify Mcl-1 as a target for the treatment of melanoma in combination with therapeutics that induce ER stress.",,"['Jiang, Chen Chen', 'Lucas, Keryn', 'Avery-Kiejda, Kelly A', 'Wade, Margaret', 'deBock, Charles E', 'Thorne, Rick F', 'Allen, John', 'Hersey, Peter', 'Zhang, Xu Dong']","['Jiang CC', 'Lucas K', 'Avery-Kiejda KA', 'Wade M', 'deBock CE', 'Thorne RF', 'Allen J', 'Hersey P', 'Zhang XD']","['Immunology and Oncology Unit, Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATF6 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 6)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ERN1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*physiology', 'Endoribonucleases/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2008/08/15 09:00,2008/10/03 09:00,['2008/08/15 09:00'],"['2008/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/16/6708 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0349 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Aug 15;68(16):6708-17. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0349.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CHR-79888 is a potent inhibitor of a number of intracellular aminopeptidases, including leucine aminopeptidase. CHR-2797 exerts antiproliferative effects against a range of tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo and shows selectivity for transformed over nontransformed cells. Its antiproliferative effects are at least 300 times more potent than the prototypical aminopeptidase inhibitor, bestatin. However, the mechanism by which inhibition of these enzymes leads to proliferative changes is not understood. Gene expression microarrays were used to profile changes in mRNA expression levels in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 treated with CHR-2797. This analysis showed that CHR-2797 treatment induced a transcriptional response indicative of amino acid depletion, the amino acid deprivation response, which involves up-regulation of amino acid synthetic genes, transporters, and tRNA synthetases. These changes were confirmed in other leukemic cell lines sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of CHR-2797. Furthermore, CHR-2797 treatment inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR substrates and reduced protein synthesis in HL-60 cells, both also indicative of amino acid depletion. Treatment with CHR-2797 led to an increase in the concentration of intracellular small peptides, the substrates of aminopeptidases. It is suggested that aminopeptidase inhibitors, such as CHR-2797 and bestatin, deplete sensitive tumor cells of amino acids by blocking protein recycling, and this generates an antiproliferative effect.

To identify miRNAs that are potentially deregulated in MM, we investigated those mapping within transcription units, based on evidence that intronic miRNAs are frequently coexpressed with their host genes. To this end, we monitored host transcript expression values in a panel of 20 human MM cell lines (HMCLs) and focused on transcripts whose expression varied significantly across the dataset. METHODS: miRNA expression was quantified by Quantitative Real-Time PCR. Gene expression and genome profiling data were generated on Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. Significant Analysis of Microarrays algorithm was used to investigate differentially expressed transcripts. Conventional statistics were used to test correlations for significance. Public libraries were queried to predict putative miRNA targets. RESULTS: We identified transcripts specific to six miRNA host genes (CCPG1, GULP1, EVL, TACSTD1, MEST, and TNIK) whose average changes in expression varied at least 2-fold from the mean of the examined dataset. We evaluated the expression levels of the corresponding intronic miRNAs and identified a significant correlation between the expression levels of MEST, EVL, and GULP1 and those of the corresponding miRNAs miR-335, miR-342-3p, and miR-561, respectively. Genome-wide profiling of the 20 HMCLs indicated that the increased expression of the three host genes and their corresponding intronic miRNAs was not correlated with local copy number variations. Notably, miRNAs and their host genes were overexpressed in a fraction of primary tumors with respect to normal plasma cells; however, this finding was not correlated with known molecular myeloma groups. The predicted putative miRNA targets and the transcriptional profiles associated with the primary tumors suggest that MEST/miR-335 and EVL/miR-342-3p may play a role in plasma cell homing and/or interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment. CONCLUSION: Our data support the idea that intronic miRNAs and their host genes are regulated dependently, and may contribute to the understanding of their biological roles in cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of deregulated miRNA expression in MM, providing insights that may lead to the identification of new biomarkers and altered molecular pathways of the disease.",,"['Ronchetti, Domenica', 'Lionetti, Marta', 'Mosca, Laura', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Andronache, Adrian', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Deliliers, Giorgio Lambertenghi', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Ronchetti D', 'Lionetti M', 'Mosca L', 'Agnelli L', 'Andronache A', 'Fabris S', 'Deliliers GL', 'Neri A']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Leukemia Study Center, University of Milan, Italy. domenica.ronchetti@unimi.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,,,PMC2531129,,2008/08/15 09:00,2008/08/15 09:01,['2008/08/15 09:00'],"['2008/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/15 09:01 [medline]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['1755-8794-1-37 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-1-37 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2008 Aug 13;1:37. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-1-37.,20080813,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemids vary clinically and they are usually a manifestation of bone marrow or immunologic impairment, but also Sweet syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythroderma, maculopapular exanthema, prurigo-like papules, generalized pigmentation, follicular mucinosis, generalized pruritus may be found during the course of leukemia. CASE REPORT: We report a 70-year-old male with a 3-month history of erythema, papules and pustules on the face, ears and neck and over a month history of refractory anemia, anorexia, weight loss, malaise, and fever. Physical examination revealed symmetric erythematous, violaceous papules, papulo-nodules and plaques with slate scale and sparse, small pustules on the face, earlobes and neck. Histopathologic findings of involved skin showed diffuse mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate with perifollicular accentuation and focal granulomatous inflammation in the papillary and upper reticular dermis.

Transfected rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL-2H3) co-expressing FcepsilonRI and FcalphaR was analyzed for effects of simultaneous receptor engagement by their specific antibodies on degranulation and signaling. Whereas supraoptimal FcepsilonRI engagement decreased degranulation, which is known as a bell-shaped dose-response curve, such inhibitory effect was not observed with FcalphaR engagement. However, simultaneous engagement of FcepsilonRI and FcalphaR showed that supraoptimal FcepsilonRI engagement down-regulates FcalphaR-mediated degranulation. This inhibition was associated with extensive phosphorylation of inositol polyphosphate 5'-phosphatase SHIP1 and FcepsilonRIbeta, and reversed by adding actin-depolymerizing drug, latrunculin B.

Unlike the known intracellular pathogens, P. zucineum maintains a stable association with its host cell without affecting the growth and morphology of the latter. RESULTS: Here, we report the whole genome sequence of the type strain HLK1T. The genome consists of a circular chromosome (3,996,255 bp) and a circular plasmid (382,976 bp). It encodes 3,861 putative proteins, 42 tRNAs, and a 16S-23S-5S rRNA operon. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that it is phylogenetically closest to Caulobacter crescentus, a model species for cell cycle research. Notably, P. zucineum has a gene that is strikingly similar, both structurally and functionally, to the cell cycle master regulator CtrA of C. crescentus, and most of the genes directly regulated by CtrA in the latter have orthologs in the former.

Our previous report had shown that GCs could inhibit allergic asthma within 10 min, which the classical mechanism could not explain. OBJECTIVE: To confirm the existence and verify the sites of GCs' rapid action, we investigated nongenomic effects of GCs on degranulation of mast cells in allergic asthma. METHODS: The GCs' rapid action on airway mast cells deregulations was evaluated in the allergic asthma model of guinea pigs by the computer-assisted morphometry. Using whole-cell patch clamp and fluorometric assay, we examined GCs' nongenomic effect on IgE-mediated exocytosis and histamine release of rat basophilic leukaemia-2H3 mast cells. Employing the flash photolysis technique, we studied the role of Ca(2+) signal in the GCs' nongenomic effect. RESULTS: Inhaled GCs significantly inhibited airway mast cells degranulation in the allergic asthma model of guinea pigs within 10 min. In vitro, GCs could rapidly inhibit IgE-mediated exocytosis and histamine release of mast cells, and neither GC nuclear receptor antagonist nor protein synthesis inhibitor could block the rapid action. We further demonstrated that GCs' nongenomic effect was not through direct action on secretory machinery, but was mediated by a reduction in the [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggested for the first time that nongenomic pathway was involved in GCs' rapid inhibition on allergic asthma, and raised the possibility of new therapeutic strategies for allergic diseases including asthma.",,"['Zhou, J', 'Liu, D-F', 'Liu, C', 'Kang, Z-M', 'Shen, X-H', 'Chen, Y-Z', 'Xu, T', 'Jiang, C-L']","['Zhou J', 'Liu DF', 'Liu C', 'Kang ZM', 'Shen XH', 'Chen YZ', 'Xu T', 'Jiang CL']","['Laboratory of Stress Medicine, Department of Nautical Medicine, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Asthma/drug therapy', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects', 'Time Factors']",,,2008/08/14 09:00,2009/01/17 09:00,['2008/08/14 09:00'],"['2008/08/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['ALL1725 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01725.x [doi]']",ppublish,Allergy. 2008 Sep;63(9):1177-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01725.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently identified Siglec-8 as an eosinophil-prominent Siglec, and cross-linking of Siglec-8 on human eosinophils induces apoptosis. In this article, we address the in vivo consequences of Siglec engagement. We and others have identified mouse Siglec-F as the closest functional paralog of human Siglec-8, based on shared ligand-binding and expression pattern. We therefore hypothesized that Siglec-F engagement would affect levels and viability of eosinophils in vivo. METHODS: Wild type and hypereosinophilic mice were administered Siglec-F antibody and levels of eosinophils in peripheral blood and tissue were measured. Eosinophil apoptosis (in vivo and in vitro) was determined by binding of Annexin-V. RESULTS: Studies in IL-5 transgenic mice, displaying hypereosinophilia, show that administration of a single dose of Siglec-F antibody results in rapid reductions in quantum of eosinophils in the blood. This decrease was accompanied by reductions in tissue eosinophils. Quantum of eosinophils in blood was decreased using two separate antibodies, as well as in other mouse models (wild type mice and in a mouse model of chronic eosinophilic leukemia). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that Siglec-F antibody administration induced apoptosis of eosinophils in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that activation of innate immune receptors, like Siglec-F, can significantly reduce mouse eosinophil viability. As such, targeting Siglec-8/F may be a therapeutic approach for eosinophilic disorders.",,"['Zimmermann, N', 'McBride, M L', 'Yamada, Y', 'Hudson, S A', 'Jones, C', 'Cromie, K D', 'Crocker, P R', 'Rothenberg, M E', 'Bochner, B S']","['Zimmermann N', 'McBride ML', 'Yamada Y', 'Hudson SA', 'Jones C', 'Cromie KD', 'Crocker PR', 'Rothenberg ME', 'Bochner BS']","[""Division of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['081882/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 AI072265-01A1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI041472/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI041472/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI41472/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI041472-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI072265/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI072265-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins)', '0 (Siglecf protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Eosinophilia/*blood/immunology', 'Eosinophils', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins']",PMC2726770,['NIHMS124187'],2008/08/14 09:00,2009/01/17 09:00,['2008/08/14 09:00'],"['2008/08/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['ALL1709 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01709.x [doi]']",ppublish,Allergy. 2008 Sep;63(9):1156-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01709.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is caused by mutations in the RMRP (ribonuclease mitochondrial RNA processing) gene, encoding the RNA component of the ribonuclease complex RNase MRP. The aim of this study was to further elucidate the risk and spectrum of cancer in CHH. A cohort of 123 Finnish patients with CHH (51 males) was followed for malignancy through the Finnish Cancer Registry. The number of identified cancers was compared with expected numbers of cancer using population-based data to obtain standardized incidence ratios (SIR). Hospital records were reviewed for clinical data related to the malignancies. During the follow-up (2,365 person-years; mean 19.2 years), 14 cases of cancer were diagnosed in the CHH cohort (expected number 2.0; SIR 7.0, CI 3.8-12). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma was the most frequent cancer type (n = 9; SIR 90.2, CI 39.0-180) followed by squamous cell carcinoma (3), leukemia (1) and Hodgkin lymphoma (1). One tumor was not histologically classified. Nine of the 14 cancers were diagnosed in patients less than 45 years of age. In addition, ten patients had basal cell carcinoma of the skin (expected number 0.3; SIR 33.2, CI 16-61). Patients with CHH have significantly increased risk for developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma or basal cell carcinoma at early age; the overall prognosis is poor. The underlying pathogenetic mechanisms remain to be elucidated in future studies.

The new renin inhibitor, aliskiren, markedly increases the plasma concentration of the (pro)renin receptor ligands prorenin and renin in patients. The effects of prorenin and of renin inhibitors on the signal transduction cascade of the (pro)renin receptor are currently unknown. RESULTS: Our results indicate that renin and prorenin were equally potent in (pro)renin receptor activation by decreasing (pro)renin receptor mRNA, increasing phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase p85alpha mRNA and augmenting viable cell number, respectively. These effects of renin and prorenin are both abolished using small-interfering RNA against the (pro)renin receptor or its adaptor promyelocytic zinc finger protein. The renin inhibitor aliskiren did not inhibit the renin-induced or prorenin-induced activation of the (pro)renin receptor. CONCLUSION: This is the first report demonstrating equal ligand activities of both, renin and prorenin, on the (pro)renin receptor - promyelocytic zinc finger protein-phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-p85alpha pathway. The failure of aliskiren to inhibit the noncatalytic effects of renin and prorenin may be of clinical relevance considering the increase in plasma concentrations of (pro)renin under aliskiren treatment.",,"['Schefe, Jan H', 'Neumann, Christian', 'Goebel, Matthias', 'Danser, Jan', 'Kirsch, Sebastian', 'Gust, Ronald', 'Kintscher, Ulrich', 'Unger, Thomas', 'Funke-Kaiser, Heiko']","['Schefe JH', 'Neumann C', 'Goebel M', 'Danser J', 'Kirsch S', 'Gust R', 'Kintscher U', 'Unger T', 'Funke-Kaiser H']","['Center for Cardiovascular Research (CCR)/Institute of Pharmacology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Hessische Strasse 3-4, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Hypertens,Journal of hypertension,8306882,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antihypertensive Agents)', '0 (Fumarates)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (prorenin receptor)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '502FWN4Q32 (aliskiren)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.23.15 (Renin)']",IM,"['Amides/*pharmacology', 'Antihypertensive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fumarates/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'Renin/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology']",,,2008/08/14 09:00,2008/12/20 09:00,['2008/08/14 09:00'],"['2008/08/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/HJH.0b013e3283060f2e [doi]', '00004872-200809000-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,J Hypertens. 2008 Sep;26(9):1787-94. doi: 10.1097/HJH.0b013e3283060f2e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene expression profiling provided a molecular signature of Burkitt's lymphoma, but also demonstrated that a subset of aggressive B-cell lymphomas not fulfilling the current World Health Organization criteria for the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma nonetheless show a molecular signature of Burkitt's lymphoma ('discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma'). Given the different treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas we investigated molecular differences within gene expression-defined Burkitt's lymphoma. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied tumors from 51 Burkitt's lymphoma patients, comprising 26 with classic Burkitt's lymphoma, 17 with atypical Burkitt's lymphoma and 8 with 'discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma', by comparative genomic hybridization and gene expression profiling. RESULTS: Classic and atypical Burkitt's lymphoma (excluding 'discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma'), in adult and pediatric cases do not differ in underlying genomic imbalances or gene expression suggesting that these subgroups are molecularly homogeneous. 'Discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma', however, differ dramatically in the absolute number of alterations from classic/atypical Burkitt's lymphoma and from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Moreover, this category includes lymphomas that carry both the t(14;18) and t(8;14) translocations and are clinically characterized by presentation in adult patients and an aggressive course. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric and adult Burkitt's lymphoma are molecularly homogeneous, whereas 'discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma' differ in underlying genetic and clinical features from typical/atypical Burkitt's lymphoma. 'Discrepant Burkitt's lymphoma' may therefore form a distinct genetic subgroup of aggressive B-cell lymphomas, which show poor response to multi-agent chemotherapy.",,"['Salaverria, Itziar', 'Zettl, Andreas', 'Bea, Silvia', 'Hartmann, Elena M', 'Dave, Sandeep S', 'Wright, George W', 'Boerma, Evert-Jan', 'Kluin, Philip M', 'Ott, German', 'Chan, Wing C', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Rimsza, Lisa M', 'Braziel, Rita M', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Staudt, Louis M', 'Muller-Hermelink, Hans Konrad', 'Campo, Elias', 'Rosenwald, Andreas']","['Salaverria I', 'Zettl A', 'Bea S', 'Hartmann EM', 'Dave SS', 'Wright GW', 'Boerma EJ', 'Kluin PM', 'Ott G', 'Chan WC', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Delabie J', 'Rimsza LM', 'Braziel RM', 'Jaffe ES', 'Staudt LM', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Campo E', 'Rosenwald A']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 2 97080 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['UO1-CA84967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', '*Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,2008/08/14 09:00,2009/01/01 09:00,['2008/08/14 09:00'],"['2008/08/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.13071 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13071 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Sep;93(9):1327-34. doi: 10.3324/haematol.13071.

Viral load, lymphocyte counts, and HIV-1-specific CD8(+) cell immune responses were compared before and after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Uninterrupted administration of HAART was feasible during nonmyeloablative conditioning and after HCT. The HIV RNA remained undetectable and no HIV-associated infections were observed. CD8(+) T-cell responses targeting multiple epitopes were detected before HCT. After HCT a different pattern of donor-derived HIV-specific CTL responses emerged by day +80, presumably primed in vivo.

Using this technique, we found that the PAX5 gene was rearranged to a variety of partner genes including ETV6, FOXP1, AUTS2, and C20orf112 in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The 3' end of the PAX5 gene was replaced by the partner gene. The PAX5 fusion products bound to PAX5 recognition sequences as strongly as wild-type PAX5 and suppressed its transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative fashion. In human B cell leukemia cells, binding of wild-type PAX5 to a regulatory region of BLK, one of the direct downstream target genes of PAX5, was diminished by expression of the PAX5-fusion protein, leading to repression of BLK.

It has also been implicated in numerous human malignancies. Signal transduction pathways shown to be of importance for c-Kit-mediated transformation include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. We have previously shown that two alternative splice forms of c-Kit, denoted GNNK(-) and GNNK(+), mediate distinctively different signals. In this study, we found that in the hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3, GNNK(-) c-Kit mediates a substantially stronger activation of PI3K/Akt than GNNK(+) c-Kit. This difference in signaling was shown to be dependent on the association of the scaffolding protein Gab2 with c-Kit, and Src-mediated phosphorylation of Gab2 was shown to be to be independent of the direct association of PI3K with c-Kit. Furthermore, proliferation and survival of Ba/F3 cells expressing a mutant of c-Kit that fails to bind to PI3K directly were slightly decreased compared with wild-type c-Kit-expressing cells. Using small interfering RNA technology, we further verified a role of Gab2 in inducing activation of PI3K/Akt downstream of c-Kit. To summarize, we show that PI3K activation by c-Kit is both splice form-dependent and cell type-specific. Furthermore, activation of PI3K by c-Kit is dependent both on the direct PI3K-binding site in c-Kit and on the phosphorylation of Gab2. The fact that c-Kit has been found mutated in numerous human malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, and that Gab2 is often overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia suggests a potential role of Gab2-mediated PI3K activation in transformation.",,"['Sun, Jianmin', 'Pedersen, Malin', 'Ronnstrand, Lars']","['Sun J', 'Pedersen M', 'Ronnstrand L']","['Experimental Clinical Chemistry, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Malmo University Hospital, Lund University, SE-205 02 Malmo, Sweden.', 'Experimental Clinical Chemistry, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Malmo University Hospital, Lund University, SE-205 02 Malmo, Sweden.', 'Experimental Clinical Chemistry, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Malmo University Hospital, Lund University, SE-205 02 Malmo, Sweden.

The patients were placed into reverse isolation for administration of preparative regimens (high dose chemotherapy) in HSCT unit with high-energy particulate air (HEPA)-filtered single rooms. First case was a 62 years-old man with advanced multiple myeloma, which was refractory to multiple line treatment with high dose steroid including regimens and with secondary acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML); second case was a 45 years-old male patient with multiple myeloma, who had undergone autologous HSCT following high dose chemotherapy; third case was a 52 years-old man with AML that was refractory to multiple line treatment and had undergone allogeneic HSCT from a HLA-matched unrelated donor. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were collected from the patients in order to search for RSV positivity. RSV was investigated by in-house nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the first patient and by direct antigen detection method (Monofluoscreen RSV-Biorad, France) in the others. First case had clinical picture of RSV infection just on the HSCT day when high dose chemotherapy has already been given. As RSV-RNA analysis yielded positive result, peroral ribavirin was initiated. Engraftment did not occur in this patient. He developed severe respiratory failure which necessitated mechanical ventilatory support, however, he has succumbed. After the detection of RSV positive index case, weekly screening of RSV in other five patients in the same unit had been performed. Following the first case, after nine and 17 days, respectively, RSV positivity was detected in two more patients. While clinical signs and symptoms of RSV infection developed in second case, third case remained asymptomatic. Both of the following patients had received ribavirin very early at first RSV positivity and recovered from RSV infection. Engraftment did not occur in the last patient who had undergone allogeneic HSCT from a HLA-matched unrelated donor and a second HSCT was performed.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: this is a retrospective and descriptive study that assessed medical records of 354 patients with AL from January 1995 to December 2004. RESULTS: acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed in 273 (77.1%) patients and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (AML) in 81 (22.9%). There were 210 males (59.4%) and 144 females (40.6%). The most common presenting features were: abdominal pain (19.5% in ALL and 11.8% in AML), nausea and vomiting (14.9 in ALL and 14% in AML), abdominal distention (18.5 in ALL and 8.6% in AML; p 0.024), constipation (5% in ALL and 6.5% in AML), diarrhea (3.6% in ALL and 11.8% in AML; p 0.03%), and gastrointestinal bleeding (7.9% in ALL and 9.7% in AML). Ultrasound scanning was made in 61.1% and hepatomegaly was found on 33.6% and esplenomegaly on 28.5% of the patients with AL. Seventy-seven (21.7%) and 15 (4.2%) patients received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and glucocorticoids before the diagnostic of AL. An association is well-defined between abdominal symptoms like nausea, vomiting and pain and use of this therapy but this association did not occurred clearly in this study.

However, gradual induction of p53 in tet-onSAOS2 cells resulted in a transient increase of the PDGFRB-promoter activity and its expression. As binding of p53 to the promoter increased, previously bound p73, DeltaNp73, c-Myc, HDAC1 and HDAC4 were dismissed from the repressed promoter, and p300 was recruited. The transient increase of the promoter activity was therefore induced by the release of the p73, Myc and HDACs, previously shown to act as repressors to this promoter. Along with further increase of p53, p300 was replaced by HDAC1 and HDAC4, resulting in decreased PDGFRB expression. For the repression, acetylation of the C-terminal lysines of p53 is important, and both acetyl-K373p53 and methyl-K370p53 became bound to the promoter. The acetyl-K373p53 was accumulated in the nucleus and colocalized with promyelocytic leukemia protein. Mitomycin treatment of MEF induced similar epigenetic modification of p53 and its binding to the promoter chromatin. Addition of a PDGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor to p53-inducing tet-onSAOS2 increased the number of apoptotic cells. These results suggest that p53 represses the PDGFRB promoter, facilitating the p53-induced apoptosis, whereas tumor cells with p53 mutation or a high level of DeltaNp73 or Myc could become refractory to the regulation.","['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Yang, Weiwen', 'Wetterskog, Daniel', 'Matsumoto, Yoshiki', 'Funa, Keiko']","['Yang W', 'Wetterskog D', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Funa K']","['Department of Medical Chemistry and Cell Biology, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (delta Np73 protein, human)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Methylation', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/physiology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/physiology', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/physiology']",,,2008/08/13 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/08/13 09:00'],"['2008/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23735 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Nov 1;123(9):2020-30. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23735.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, we studied cell lines FDC-P1 and HL60 (Bcr-Abl-negative) and FDrv210 and K562 (Bcr-Abl-positive) with our technique. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody was used along with fluorescence-conjugated microspheres for reference (ratio of sample fluorescence: bead fluorescence = relative fluorescence unit [RFU]). Samples from 20 controls and 32 patients undergoing treatment were analyzed using the same method. Bcr-Abl status for each patient was confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization or polymerase chain reaction gene amplification (PCR). Testing of cell lines consistently produced expected results. Patient values were found to be significantly higher than control values (P < 0.001) and values for patients with advanced disease were significantly higher than for patients with chronic-phase disease (P < 0.05). Results of clinical monitoring were consistent with results from PCR. Two patients who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation had molecular remission confirmed by PCR and had a marked decrease in RFU value (from 62 to five and from 131 to 23).

Several randomized trials have shown favorable results concerning response rate, survival, transformation to acute leukemia, and quality of life. In these trials, treatment was administered continuously until progression. In the retrospective study presented here, we evaluated the outcome of patients with higher risk MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) treated with a limited number of 5-AZA cycles. A total of 32 patients received 5-AZA alone (n=30) or in combination with valproic acid and all-trans retinoic acid (n=2). 5-AZA was administered subcutaneously at a fixed dose of 75 mg/m(2) daily for 7 days and repeated every 28 days. 5-AZA was given for a median of four courses. Treatment was continued for two more cycles as consolidation in patients who had achieved complete remission (CR), marrow CR, or stable disease with hematologic improvement. The overall response rate was 50% according to the modified International Working Group criteria. Complete remissions were achieved in 15.6% and stable disease in 34.4% of patients. Peripheral blood counts normalized in 6.3% of patients while hematologic improvement was achieved in 25%. The median time to AML in responding patients was 45 weeks, while AML occurred after a median of 14 weeks in non-responding patients (P= .038). The median survival of all patients was 60 weeks; the median survival of responders was 74 weeks compared with 26 weeks in non-responders (P= .047). In this retrospective analysis, 5-AZA was associated with a survival advantage in responding patients with higher risk MDS or sAML. These favorable results suggest that patients may benefit even from a limited number of courses of 5-AZA. A randomized controlled clinical trial is required to prospectively validate these findings.",,"['Muller-Thomas, Catharina', 'Schuster, Tibor', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Gotze, Katharina S']","['Muller-Thomas C', 'Schuster T', 'Peschel C', 'Gotze KS']","['III Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Ismaningerstr. 15, 81675 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2008/08/13 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/08/13 09:00'],"['2008/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0583-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Mar;88(3):213-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-008-0583-8.

In 80 B-CLL patients, the frequency of Treg (CD4+CD25hi FOXP3+) cells was significantly higher in B-CLL patients when compared to healthy volunteers (HV) and increased with the progression of the disease (median: 8.24% in stage A, 11.24% in stage B and 12.57% in stage C according to the Binet classification). The frequency of Treg showed no correlation with prognostic markers such as ZAP-70, CD38 and HLA-G. Notably, Treg frequency correlated with serum levels of TNF (r(2)=0.45, p=0.001). T-cell immune responses against epitopes derived from the tumor-associated antigens survivin, fibromodulin and RHAMM as well as from the influenza matrix protein were evaluated. Functionally, higher frequencies of Treg correlated with decreased T-cell responses against viral and tumor antigens. In conclusion, we detected higher frequencies of Treg in B-CLL patients than in HV.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetics and overall survival (OS) were analyzed in 1,975 AML patients age 15 to 60 years. RESULTS: Besides AML with normal cytogenetics (CN) and core binding factor (CBF) abnormalities, we distinguished 733 patients with cytogenetic abnormalities. Among the latter subgroup, loss of a single chromosome (n = 109) conferred negative prognostic impact (4-year OS, 12%; poor outcome). Loss of chromosome 7 was most common, but outcome of AML patients with single monosomy -7 (n = 63; 4-year OS, 13%) and other single autosomal monosomies (n = 46; 4-year OS, 12%) did not differ. Structural chromosomal abnormalities influenced prognosis only in association with a single autosomal monosomy (4-year OS, 4% for very poor v 24% for poor). We derived a monosomal karyotype (MK) as a predictor for very poor prognosis of AML that refers to two or more distinct autosomal chromosome monosomies (n = 116; 4-year OS, 3%) or one single autosomal monosomy in the presence of structural abnormalities (n = 68; 4-year OS, 4%). In direct comparisons, MK provides significantly better prognostic prediction than the traditionally defined complex karyotype, which considers any three or more or five or more clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, and also than various individual specific cytogenetic abnormalities (eg, del[5q], inv[3]/t[3;3]) associated with very poor outcome. CONCLUSION: MK enables (in addition to CN and CBF) the prognostic classification of two new aggregates of cytogenetically abnormal AML, the unfavorable risk MK-negative category (4-year OS, 26% +/- 2%) and the highly unfavorable risk MK-positive category (4-year OS, 4% +/- 1%).",,"['Breems, Dimitri A', 'Van Putten, Wim L J', 'De Greef, Georgine E', 'Van Zelderen-Bhola, Shama L', 'Gerssen-Schoorl, Klasien B J', 'Mellink, Clemens H M', 'Nieuwint, Aggie', 'Jotterand, Martine', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Lowenberg, Bob']","['Breems DA', 'Van Putten WL', 'De Greef GE', 'Van Zelderen-Bhola SL', 'Gerssen-Schoorl KB', 'Mellink CH', 'Nieuwint A', 'Jotterand M', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Beverloo HB', 'Lowenberg B']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Network Antwerp, Campus Stuivenberg, Antwerp, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2008/08/13 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/08/13 09:00'],"['2008/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2008.16.0259 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.16.0259 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct 10;26(29):4791-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.16.0259.

Here, we show that interaction with PEBP2-beta leads to the phosphorylation of RUNX1, which in turn induces p300 phosphorylation. This is mediated by homeodomain interacting kinase 2 (HIPK2), targeting Ser(249), Ser(273), and Thr(276) in RUNX1, in a manner that is also dependent on the RUNX1 PY motif. Importantly, we observed the in vitro disruption of this phosphorylation cascade by multiple leukemogenic genetic defects targeting RUNX1/CBFB. In particular, the oncogenic protein PEBP2-beta-SMMHC prevents RUNX1/p300 phosphorylation by sequestering HIPK2 to mislocalized RUNX1/beta-SMMHC complexes. Therefore, phosphorylation of RUNX1 appears a critical step in its association with and phosphorylation of p300, and its disruption may be a common theme in RUNX1-associated leukemogenesis.",,"['Wee, Hee-Jun', 'Voon, Dominic Chih-Cheng', 'Bae, Suk-Chul', 'Ito, Yoshiaki']","['Wee HJ', 'Voon DC', 'Bae SC', 'Ito Y']","['Genomics and Genetics Division, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Proteos, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CBFB protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (HIPK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism']",PMC2572802,,2008/08/13 09:00,2008/11/13 09:00,['2008/08/13 09:00'],"['2008/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51938-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-134122 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Nov 1;112(9):3777-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-134122.

The exact role of the transcription factor Stat5 in erythropoiesis remained puzzling, however, since the first Stat5-deficient mice carried a hypomorphic Stat5 allele, impeding full phenotypical analysis. Using mice completely lacking Stat5--displaying early lethality--we demonstrate that these animals suffer from microcytic anemia due to reduced expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 followed by enhanced apoptosis. Moreover, transferrin receptor-1 (TfR-1) cell surface levels on erythroid cells were decreased more than 2-fold on erythroid cells of Stat5(-/-) animals. This reduction could be attributed to reduced transcription of TfR-1 mRNA and iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP-2), the major translational regulator of TfR-1 mRNA stability in erythroid cells. Both genes were demonstrated to be direct transcriptional targets of Stat5.

Serum induces RhoA-dependent translocation of MKL1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and also causes a rapid increase in MKL1 phosphorylation. We have mapped a serum-inducible phosphorylation site and found, surprisingly, that its mutation causes constitutive localization to the nucleus, suggesting that phosphorylation of MKL1 inhibits its serum-induced nuclear localization. The key site, serine 454, resembles a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation site, and its modification was blocked by the MEK1 inhibitor U0126, implying that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is the serum-inducible kinase that phosphorylates MKL1. Previous results indicated that G-actin binding to MKL1 promotes its nuclear export, and we found that MKL1 phosphorylation is required for its binding to actin, explaining its effect on localization. We propose a model in which serum induction initially stimulates MKL1 nuclear localization due to a decrease in G-actin levels, but MKL1 is then downregulated by nuclear export due to ERK1/2 phosphorylation.",,"['Muehlich, Susanne', 'Wang, Ruigong', 'Lee, Seung-Min', 'Lewis, Thera C', 'Dai, Chao', 'Prywes, Ron']","['Muehlich S', 'Wang R', 'Lee SM', 'Lewis TC', 'Dai C', 'Prywes R']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA.']",['eng'],"['F31 GM082027/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA050329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA050329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1F31GM082027-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*enzymology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', '*Serum', 'Serum Response Factor/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators']",PMC2577419,,2008/08/13 09:00,2008/10/25 09:00,['2008/08/13 09:00'],"['2008/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00427-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00427-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Oct;28(20):6302-13. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00427-08.

Because our prior work has specifically implicated translation initiation in CML, we tested compounds that could modulate translation initiation and polysomal mRNA assembly. Here, we evaluated the activity of one such compound, CGP57380, against CML cells and explored its mechanisms of action. First, using polysomal mRNA profiles, we found that imatinib and CGP57380 could independently, and cooperatively, impair polysomal mRNA loading. Imatinib and CGP57380 also synergistically inhibited the growth of Ba/F3-Bcr-Abl and K562 cells via impaired cell cycle entry and increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, CGP57380 inhibited efficient polysomal assembly via two processes. First, it enhanced imatinib-mediated inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F induction, and second, it independently impaired phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 on the preinitiation complex. We also identified multiple substrates of the mTOR, Rsk, and Mnk kinases as targets of CGP57380. Finally, we found a novel negative-feedback loop to the mitogen-activated protein kinase/Mnk pathway that is triggered by CGP57380 and demonstrated that an interruption of the loop further increased the activity of the combination against imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cells.

The human SWI/SNF-associated PRMT5 is involved in the transcriptional repression of target genes by directly methylating H3R8 and H4R3. To further understand the impact of PRMT5-mediated histone methylation on cancer, we analyzed its expression in normal and transformed human B lymphocytes. Our findings reveal that PRMT5 protein levels are enhanced in various human lymphoid cancer cells, including transformed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cell lines. PRMT5 overexpression is caused by the altered expression of the PRMT5-specific microRNAs 19a, 25, 32, 92, 92b, and 96 and results in the increased global symmetric methylation of H3R8 and H4R3. An evaluation of both epigenetic marks at PRMT5 target genes such as RB1 (p105), RBL1 (p107), and RBL2 (p130) showed that promoters H3R8 and H4R3 are hypermethylated, which in turn triggers pocket protein transcriptional repression. Furthermore, reducing PRMT5 expression in WaC3CD5 B-CLL cells abolishes H3R8 and H4R3 hypermethylation, restores RBL2 expression, and inhibits cancer cell proliferation. These results indicate that PRMT5 overexpression epigenetically alters the transcription of key tumor suppressor genes and suggest a causal role of the elevated symmetric methylation of H3R8 and H4R3 at the RBL2 promoter in transformed B-lymphocyte pathology.",,"['Wang, Li', 'Pal, Sharmistha', 'Sif, Said']","['Wang L', 'Pal S', 'Sif S']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA116093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RBL2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*genetics', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC2577430,,2008/08/13 09:00,2008/10/25 09:00,['2008/08/13 09:00'],"['2008/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00923-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00923-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Oct;28(20):6262-77. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00923-08.

In this work we show that erythropoietin stimulation of K562 cells can induce nuclear translocation of active Akt, a downstream molecule of the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. Akt shows a peak of activity in whole cell homogenates at earlier stage when compared to the nucleus, which shows a peak delayed of 10 min. Akt increases its intranuclear amount and activity rapidly and transiently in response to EPO. Almost all Akt kinase that translocates to the nucleus shows a marked phosphorylation on serine 473. Nuclear enzyme translocation is blocked by the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase inhibitor Ly294002 or Wortmannin. The specific Akt pharmacological inhibitor VI, VII and VIII that act as blocking enzyme activation inhibited translocation as well, whereas Akt inhibitor IX, that inhibits Akt activity, did not block Akt nuclear translocation. When cells were treated by means of siRNA sequences or with the Akt inhibitors the differentiation process was arrested, thus showing the requirement of the nuclear translocation of the active enzyme to differentiate. These findings strongly suggest that the intranuclear translocation of active Akt kinase represents an important step in the signaling pathway that mediates erythropoietin-induced erythroid differentiation.",,"['Missiroli, Silvia', 'Etro, Daniela', 'Buontempo, Francesca', 'Ye, Keqiang', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Neri, Luca Maria']","['Missiroli S', 'Etro D', 'Buontempo F', 'Ye K', 'Capitani S', 'Neri LM']","[""Dipartimento di Morfologia ed Embriologia, Sezione di Anatomia Umana, Signal Transduction Unit, Universita' di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wortmannin']",,,2008/08/13 09:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2008/08/13 09:00'],"['2008/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(08)00283-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2008.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2009 Mar;41(3):570-7. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2008.07.002.

A subset of hESC-derived CD45(+) cells coexpresses CD34 and show progenitor function in colony-forming units assays. These hESC-derived hematopoietic stem (HSC), or progenitor cells, display, however, distinct functional properties, including poor repopulation ability; impaired differentiation; and lack of homing when compared to HSCs from fetal blood (FB) or cord blood. Whether these differences are cell-autonomous or driven by their microenvironment remains to be elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, to gain insight into the molecular determinants accounting for these functional differences, a gene-expression profiling comparing candidate hESC-HSCs vs FB-derived HSCs (FB-HSCs) was conducted. RESULTS: Only 2.4% of differentially expressed transcripts were common for FB-HSCs and candidate hESC-HSCs, suggesting a completely different molecular signature for HSCs isolated from two different in utero ontogeny stages. Several key hematopoietic transcription factors, apoptosis and cycle regulators, and cell aggregation and homing genes may contribute to explain the functional differences between hESC-HSCs and FB-HSCs. Importantly, components of Notch and Wnt signaling pathways involved in HSC self-renewal and hematopoietic specification were significantly underexpressed in candidate hESC-HSCs. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a platform to understand the molecular basis underlying hESC-HSCs functional properties. Future studies are needed to address the functional role of the transcripts identified here, eventually leading to identification of intrinsic determinants and cytokines driving physiological specification of hESCs into definitive HSCs.",,"['Shojaei, Farbod', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Shojaei F', 'Menendez P']","['Robarts Research Institute, London, ON, Canada. farbodshojaei@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multigene Family', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology']",,,2008/08/13 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/13 09:00'],"['2008/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00265-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Nov;36(11):1436-48. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.06.001.

Normal pre-B cells are absolutely dependent on BM stroma for survival and differentiation. It is not known whether transformed pre-B ALL cells retain any of this dependence, which possibly could impact on drug sensitivity or MRD measurements. RESULTS: Pre-B ALL cells, highly purified by a novel method using surface expression of CD19 and immunoglobulin light chains, from BM and PB show a very high degree of similarity in gene expression patterns, with differential expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a notable exception. In addition, the cell sorting procedure revealed that in 2 out of five investigated patients, a significant fraction of the malignant cells had matured beyond the pre-B cell stage. CONCLUSION: The transition of ALL cells from the BM into the circulation does not demand, or result in, major changes of gene expression pattern.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of Notch-induced apoptosis in the erythroleukaemic cell line TF-1, and in primary cord blood CD34+ cells. METHODS: Retroviral constructs containing constitutively active forms of Notch as well as components of the Notch signalling pathway were used to transduce cells and their effect on cell cycle kinetics and apoptosis assayed by immunostaining for the S-phase marker Ki67 and Annexin V. RESULTS: We found that TF-1 cells undergo cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis in a cytokine-independent manner in response to active Notch. Transduction of TF-1 cells with known targets of Notch signalling, Deltex1, HES1 and HERP2, showed that Notch-induced cell cycle arrest was not mediated by these proteins. However, analysis of cell cycle gene expression revealed that Notch signalling was associated with an up-regulation of IFI16 expression in TF-1 cells and in primary cord blood CD34+ cells.

The aim of this phase I/II study was to establish the safety and efficacy of a new administration route (intrabone) for cord-blood cells, measured by the donor-derived neutrophil and platelet engraftment. METHODS: Adult patients with acute leukaemia, for whom an unrelated stem-cell transplantation was indicated and no suitable unrelated human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor had been identified, were included in the study and underwent a cord-blood transplant in San Martino Hospital, Genoa, Italy. Eight patients were in first complete remission, ten in second complete remission, and 14 had advanced-stage, refractory disease. HLA matching was 5/6, 4/6, and 3/6 for 9, 22, and one patient, respectively. Cord-blood cells were concentrated in four 5-mL syringes, and were infused in the superior-posterior iliac crest under rapid general anaesthesia. Median transplanted cell dose was 2.6 x 10(7)/kg (range 1.4-4.2). The primary endpoint was the probability of neutrophil and platelet recovery after intrabone cord-blood transplantantion. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease, relapse, and overall survival. This trial is registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website, number NCT 00696046. FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2006, and Jan 25, 2008, 32 consecutive patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (n=20) or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n=12) underwent a cord-blood transplant (median age 36 years [range 18-66]). No complications occurred during or after the intrabone infusion of cells. Four patients with advanced-stage disease died within 12 days of the procedure. Median time to recovery of neutrophils in 28 patients (>/=0.5 x 10(9)/L) was 23 days (range 14-44) and median time to recovery of platelets in 27 patients (>/=20 x 10(9)/L) was 36 days (range 16-64). All patients were fully chimeric from 30 days after transplantation to the last follow-up visit, suggesting an early complete donor engraftment. No patient developed grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease. Causes of death were transplant related (n=5), infection (n=7), and relapse (n=4). 16 patients were alive and in haematological remission at a median follow-up of 13 months (range 3-23).

The accumulation of the promyelocytic blasts in the bone marrow produces intense peripheral blood cytopenias or, less commonly, hyperleucocytosis, both of which are frequently associated with a life-threatening consumptive coagulopathy. The body of available biological information on APL establishes this leukemia as a unique entity that has to be promptly recognized and clearly distinguished from all other acute leukemias, especially in light of its striking response to treatment with anthracyclines and differentiating agents such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or arsenic trioxide (ATO). Current state-of-the-art treatments, which include simultaneous administration of ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy for induction and consolidation, as well as ATRA-based maintenance, have dramatically transformed APL into the most curable acute leukemia in adults, with approximately 80% of long-term survivors. Risk-adapted strategies to modulate treatment intensity may be an effective approach to minimizing therapy-related morbidity and mortality while maintaining the potential of cure. Nonetheless, a sizeable proportion of patients will relapse after the ATRA-based upfront therapy. Given the high anti-leukemic efficacy observed with ATO in patients who relapse, this agent is currently regarded as the best treatment option in this setting. In this article, we will review the current treatment strategies in the management of newly diagnosed and relapsed APL. We also highlight other aspects that can be crucial for the outcome of individual patients, including supportive care, recognition and treatment of life-threatening complications, management of ATRA- and ATO-associated adverse events, and the role of minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring.",,"['Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel']","['Lo-Coco F', 'Ammatuna E', 'Montesinos P', 'Sanz MA']","['Department of Biopathology, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. francesco.lo.coco@uniroma2.it <francesco.lo.coco@uniroma2.it>']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Oxides/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,,2008/08/12 09:00,2008/09/10 09:00,['2008/08/12 09:00'],"['2008/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0093-7754(08)00120-6 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2008.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2008 Aug;35(4):401-9. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2008.04.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Definition of these pretreatment characteristics coupled with morphological response to induction chemotherapy provides the framework for current risk-stratification schemes, aimed at identifying subgroups most (and least) likely to benefit from allogeneic transplant. However, since such parameters lack the precision to distinguish the individual patient likely to be cured with conventional therapy from those destined to relapse, there has been considerable interest in development of multiparameter flow cytometry, identifying leukemia-associated aberrant phenotypes, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) detecting leukemia-specific targets (eg, fusion gene transcripts, NPM1 mutation) or genes overexpressed in AML (eg, WT1), to provide a more precise measure of disease response. Minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring has been shown to be a powerful independent prognostic factor and is now routinely used to guide therapy in patients with the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) subtype.

They constitute 10% to 12% of all AML patents, with the incidence of complex karyotypes increasing with the more advanced age. Recent studies using molecular-cytogenetic techniques (spectral karyotyping [SKY], multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization [M-FISH]) and array comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) considerably improved characterization of previously unidentified, partially identified, or cryptic chromosome aberrations, and allowed precise delineation of genomic imbalances. The emerging nonrandom pattern of abnormalities includes relative paucity, but not absence, of balanced rearrangements (translocations, insertions, or inversions), predominance of aberrations leading to loss of chromosome material (monosomies, deletions, and unbalanced translocations) that involve, in decreasing order, chromosome arms 5q, 17p, 7q, 18q, 16q, 17q, 12p, 20q, 18p, and 3p, and the presence of recurrent, albeit less frequent and often hidden (in marker chromosomes and unbalanced translocations) aberrations leading to overrepresentation of segments from 8q, 11q, 21q, 22q, 1p, 9p, and 13q. Several candidate genes have been identified as targets of genomic losses, for example, TP53, CTNNA1, NF1, ETV6, and TCF4, and amplifications, for example, ERG, ETS2, APP, ETS1, FLI1, MLL, DDX6, GAB2, MYC, TRIB1, and CDX2.

Especially, in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) molecular genetic and gene expression analyses are becoming of increasing importance. In addition to the impact of gene mutations, including the MLL, FLT3, CEBPA, or NPM1 genes in CN-AML, recent analyses have provided evidence that altered gene expression might not only be of biological but also of prognostic relevance in CN-AML patients. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) and recent advances in genome-wide DNA microarray-based gene expression profiling (GEP) represent powerful tools for the systematic exploration of the molecular variation underlying the biologic and clinical heterogeneity of CN-AML.

Activation of signal transduction in AML may occur through a variety of genetic alterations affecting different signaling molecules, such as the FLT3 and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and members of the RAS family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. These mutant signaling proteins are attractive therapeutic targets; however, developing targeted therapies for each genotypic variant and determining the relationships between different genotypes and critical functional dependencies of the leukemic cells remain major challenges. As the large number of mutant signaling proteins that have been identified in AML are likely to reflect activation of a more limited number of downstream effector pathways, such as the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT cascades, targeting these unifying pathways may represent a more broadly applicable therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, integrative genomic studies combining DNA sequencing, DNA copy number analysis, transcriptional profiling, and functional genetic approaches hold great promise for identifying additional signaling abnormalities in AML that are relevant to leukemogenesis and can be exploited therapeutically.

Following treatment, the majority of tumors, including leukemias, initially respond. However, relapse is common and often fatal. A likely explanation for this is that leukemia stem cells are relatively insensitive to current therapies and that tumor bulk reduction reflects the death of leukemic blasts that lack tumor initiation potential. This review will focus on what is known of the molecular and cellular biology of the leukemia stem cell and the leukemia stem cell niche in AML and then will identify molecular pathways critical for leukemia stem cells.

We report here the crystal structure of the human GM-CSF/GM-CSF receptor ternary complex and its assembly into an unexpected dodecamer or higher-order complex. Importantly, mutagenesis of the GM-CSF receptor at the dodecamer interface and functional studies reveal that dodecamer formation is required for receptor activation and signaling.

An estrogen receptor has now been found localized to the plasma membrane of human myeloblastic leukemia cells (HL-60). Its expression occurs throughout the cell cycle, progressively increasing as cells mature from G(1) to S to G(2)/M. To ascertain that the receptor functioned, the effect of ligands, including a non-internalizable estradiol-BSA conjugate and tamoxifen, an antagonist of nuclear estrogen receptor function, were tested. The ligands caused activation of the ERK MAPK pathway. They also modulated the effect of retinoic acid, an inducer of MAPK dependent terminal differentiation along the myeloid lineage in these cells. In particular the ligands inhibited retinoic acid-induced inducible oxidative metabolism, a functional marker of terminal myeloid cell differentiation. To a lesser degree they also diminished retinoic acid-induced earlier markers of cell differentiation, namely CD38 and CD11b. However, they did not regulate retinoic acid-induced G(0) cell cycle arrest. There is thus a membrane localized estrogen receptor in HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells that can cause ERK activation and modulates the response of these cells to retinoic acid, indicating crosstalk between the membrane estrogen and retinoic acid evoked pathways relevant to propulsion of cell differentiation.",,"['Kauss, M Ariel', 'Reiterer, Gudrun', 'Bunaciu, Rodica P', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Kauss MA', 'Reiterer G', 'Bunaciu RP', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033505-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033505-24S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'CD11b Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Estrogen Antagonists/metabolism', 'Estrogens/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', '*HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tamoxifen/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC2580735,['NIHMS72606'],2008/08/12 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/08/12 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(08)00295-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.07.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2008 Oct 1;314(16):2999-3006. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.07.015.

Patterning of individual vertebrae and distinct regions of the vertebral column is accomplished by Polycomb and Hox proteins in the paraxial mesoderm, while their subsequent morphogenesis depends partially on Pax1/Pax9 in the sclerotome. In this study, we uncover that Pbx1/Pbx2 are co-expressed during successive stages of vertebral and rib development. Next, by exploiting a Pbx1/Pbx2 loss-of-function mouse, we show that decreasing Pbx2 dosage in the absence of Pbx1 affects axial development more severely than single loss of Pbx1. Pbx1/Pbx2 mutants exhibit a homogeneous vertebral column, with loss of vertebral identity, rudimentary ribs, and rostral hindlimb shifts. Of note, these axial defects do not arise from perturbed notochord function, as cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of regulators of notochord signaling are normal in Pbx1/Pbx2 mutants. While the observed defects are consistent with loss of Pbx activity as a Hox-cofactor in the mesoderm, we additionally establish that axial skeletal patterning and hindlimb positioning are governed by Pbx1/Pbx2 through their genetic control of Polycomb and Hox expression and spatial distribution in the mesoderm, as well as of Pax1/Pax9 in the sclerotome.",,"['Capellini, Terence D', 'Zewdu, Rediet', 'Di Giacomo, Giuseppina', 'Asciutti, Stefania', 'Kugler, Jamie E', 'Di Gregorio, Anna', 'Selleri, Licia']","['Capellini TD', 'Zewdu R', 'Di Giacomo G', 'Asciutti S', 'Kugler JE', 'Di Gregorio A', 'Selleri L']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 1300 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['HD050704/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'DE18031/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD043997/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DE018031/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD050704/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD43997/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (PAX9 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Pax9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142661-96-9 (PAX1 transcription factor)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Patterning/*physiology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'PAX9 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Spine/*embryology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC5918304,['NIHMS70657'],2008/08/12 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/08/12 09:00'],"['2007/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-1606(08)00270-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2008 Sep 15;321(2):500-14. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.04.005.

METHODS: The study was performed on a hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) grown in normal or hormone-deprived charcoal-stripped (c.s.) medium. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by SRB assay and Annexin-V/TUNEL assays, respectively. Activated caspase-3, p21, pMEK and MCL-1 expression levels were detected by western blotting. RESULTS: The simultaneous exposure of zoledronic acid [100 microM] and docetaxel [0.01 microM] for 1 h followed by treatment with zoledronic acid for 72, 96 or 120 h produced a high synergistic interaction (R index = 5.1) with a strong decrease in cell viability. This cytotoxic effect was associated with a high induction of apoptosis in both LNCaP and in c.s. LNCaP cells. The induction of apoptosis was paralleled by a decrease in pMEK and Mcl-1 expression. CONCLUSION: The zoledronic acid-docetaxel combination produced a highly significant synergistic effect on the LNCaP cell line grown in normal or hormone-deprived medium, the principal molecular mechanisms involved being apoptosis and decreased pMEK and Mcl-1 expression. This experimentally derived schedule would seem to prevent the selection and amplification of hormone-resistant cell clones and could thus be potentially used alongside standard androgen deprivation therapy in the management of hormone-sensitive prostate carcinoma.",,"['Fabbri, Francesco', 'Brigliadori, Giovanni', 'Carloni, Silvia', 'Ulivi, Paola', 'Vannini, Ivan', 'Tesei, Anna', 'Silvestrini, Rosella', 'Amadori, Dino', 'Zoli, Wainer']","['Fabbri F', 'Brigliadori G', 'Carloni S', 'Ulivi P', 'Vannini I', 'Tesei A', 'Silvestrini R', 'Amadori D', 'Zoli W']","['Biosciences Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Italy. francesco.fabbri@ausl.fo.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '2609-88-3 (lissamine rhodamine B)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Diphosphonates/administration & dosage', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling/methods', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rhodamines/metabolism', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors', 'Zoledronic Acid']",PMC2525627,,2008/08/12 09:00,2008/09/27 09:00,['2008/08/12 09:00'],"['2008/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1479-5876-6-43 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-6-43 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2008 Aug 8;6:43. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-6-43.,20080808,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the influence of polymorphisms in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and coadministration of antimetabolites on post-HDMTX toxicity. METHODS: Toxicity was retrospectively analysed after 656 HDMTX courses administered to 88 paediatric ALL patients at a single treatment centre. RESULTS: High-dose methotrexate with high-intensity co-treatment (6MP 75 mg/m(2)/d + MTX 20 mg/m(2)/wk) was found associated with increased odds of haematological toxicity (OR's: 3.47-7.88; P's: <0.001), hepatic toxicity (OR = 6.91; P < 0.001), hospitalization with fever (OR = 2.2; P = 0.004) and interruption maintenance treatment (OR = 15.9; P < 0.001) compared to HDMTX with low-intensity co-treatment (6MP 25 mg/m(2)/d). Addition of cytarabine to the low-intensity co-treatment increased the odds of neutropenia (OR = 3.51; P = 0.002), thrombocytopenia (OR = 6.56; P < 0.001), hepatic toxicity (OR = 3.84; P = 0.012) and interruption of maintenance treatment (OR = 4.25; P = 0.002). Alterations in 6MP dose were associated with significant changes in toxicity. Dose reduction reduced the odds of haematological toxicity (OR's: 0.22-0.34; P's: <0.001-0.020), while dose increase increased the odds of haematological toxicity (OR's: 2.72-7.42; P's: 0.006-0.027), fever (OR = 2.65; P = 0.037) and interruption of maintenance treatment (OR = 3.04; P = 0.032). No convincing associations were found between the MTHFR C677T or A1298C polymorphisms and toxicity. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that toxicity after HDMTX is influenced by coadministrated antimetabolites, and modifiable by alterations in 6MP dose.

RhoH gene, a member of the Rho family, is specifically expressed in haematopoietic cells. The known function of RhoH is antagonising Rac and mediating activation of ZAP-70 in T lymphocytes; however, biological roles of RhoH in myeloid cells remain unknown. Here, we analysed the prognostic implication of the expression level of the RhoH gene transcript in bone marrow samples from 90 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients using a real-time fluorescence detection method. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that low expression of the RhoH transcript was a predictor of worse prognosis in both overall and disease-free survival. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low expression of RhoH was an independent unfavourable prognostic factor for both overall and disease-free survival of AML patients. Overexpression of RhoH leads to dephosphorylation of Bad at Serine 75 residue possibly through deactivation of Rac. It is possible that low expression of RhoH (i.e. high GTP-Rac) contributes to chemotherapy resistance in leukaemia cells.

Malignancies of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic origin often have increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), a key modulator of inflammation. For example, hematological malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma often highly express Cox-2, which correlates with poor patient prognosis. Expression of Cox-2 enhances survival and proliferation of malignant cells, while negatively influencing anti-tumor immunity. Hematological malignancies expressing elevated levels of Cox-2 potentially avoid immune responses by producing factors that enhance angiogenesis and metastasis. Cellular immune responses regulated by natural killer cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and T regulatory cells are also influenced by Cox-2 expression.

The clonal proliferations of B-cells show a high degree of variation in terms of clinical and presenting features, histopathology, immunophenotype, and genetics. Primary tumor samples are useful for examining the characteristics of a patient's own tumor, although both primary leukemic cells and cell lines provide an initial step for screening novel compounds for their activity in some hematological malignancies, they should be followed by models in intact animals. In this review, we try to summarize the animal models generated to study B-cell malignancies, in particular, B-cell lymphoma, B-cell CLL and MM that represent the major part of B-cell malignancies. Animals that spontaneously develop cancer are flawed to predict human disease. The development of human tumor xenograft models represented a big step towards more clinically relevant models. The major problems of these models are the requirement of immuno-compromised animals and the inability of these models to recapitulate the complex relationship between the tumor and the microenvironment. A number of strategies have been also applied to develop genetically engineered models of malignancies, in which the tumor arises ""naturally"" in the host. The disadvantages of these models include the differences between rodent and human stroma and that they can not be used to characterise anti-tumor activity of many immunotherapeutic drugs.

The present review examines harmonized preclinical drug safety guidelines for immunotoxicity in light of environmentally-mediated childhood disease trends as well as research-based mechanisms for DIT. Because none of the guidelines was designed to address risk of DIT, suggestions are offered for closing the early-life immune dysfunction data gap.

Forced expression of GD3 synthase induced erythroid differentiation as determined by an increase in glycophorin A expression and synthesis of hemoglobins. The proteomic analysis revealed that 15 proteins were increased by GD3 synthase. In contrast, we observed three protein gel spots decreased in contents in the cell membranes of GD3 synthase-transfected K562 cells. Among the increased proteins, membrane transglutaminase 2 (TG2) was specifically increased in the cell membrane of GD3 synthase-transfected K562 cells. Then, we generated the GD3 synthase-transfected cells in the K562 cells. Interestingly, the TG2 level was increased in GD3 synthase-transfected cells compared with vector- and plasma membrane-associated ganglioside sialidase (Neu3)-transfected cells. In addition, its ability to be photoaffinity-labeled with [alpha-(32)P]GTP was also increased in the GD3 synthase- and TG2-transfected cells. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) analysis for the GD3 synthase showed the decrease or abolishment of the membrane TG2.

It was the objective of this study to analyse age-related disturbances in coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters during the induction phase of the antileukemic treatment. Sixty-four children were classified by age into three groups (1-5, 6-10, 11-16 years), and studied during induction treatment of ALL including four weeks of dexamethasone, followed by two weeks tapering of dexamethasone during which 6,000 IU/m(2) native L-Asparaginase (total 4 doses) was administered intravenously twice weekly. Blood samples were collected immediately before each L-Asparaginase infusion to analyze procoagulant (fibrinogen, factor [F] II, FV, FVII, F IX, F X) and anticoagulant factors (antithrombin [AT], protein C, protein S), parameters of thrombin generation (F1+2, TAT) and fibrinolysis (alpha2-antiplasmin, plasminogen, PAP, D-dimer). Children were in a hypercoagulable state after four weeks of dexamethasone due to upregulation of coagulation parameters. Upregulation was highest in the two youngest age groups. During L-Asparaginase treatment the 11- to 16-year-olds showed lower values in procoagulant and, even more, in anticoagulant factor levels compared to the younger children. Activation markers of thrombin generation and fibrinolysis did not change over time during the study period. Decreased synthesis of alpha2-antiplasmin and plasminogen during L-Asparaginase treatment resulted in less potential of clot lysis by plasmin in children older than 11 years of age.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 62 ampullary adenocarcinoma patients who underwent curative surgery between 1996 and 2005 were included. Expression analysis of PML was carried out by immunohistochemical staining and correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: In 24 tumor specimens (38.7%), PML was classified as absent, in 16 (25.8%) as focally expressed and in 22 (35.5%) as diffusely expressed. By univariate analysis, DFS was significantly influenced by pathological T stage (P=0.03), lymph nodal involvement (P=0.002), and PML expression (P=0.001). DFS in patients without PML expression was 28.0 months versus 45.1 and 75.5 for patients with focal and diffuse expression, respectively. OS in the group of patients without PML expression, with focal expression, and with diffuse expression was 40, 48, and 77 months, respectively (P=0.002). By a multivariate analysis, PML expression was the strongest prognostic factor for DFS (P=0.003) and the only statically significant prognostic factor for OS (P=0.009).

Rituximab mediates complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of CD20-positive human B cells. In addition, rituximab sensitizes B-NHL cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy and has direct apoptotic and antiproliferative effects. Whereas expression of the CD20 antigen is a natural prerequisite for rituximab sensitivity, cell-autonomous factors determining the response of B-NHL to rituximab are less defined. To this end, we have studied rituximab-induced apoptosis in human B-NHL models. We find that rituximab directly triggers apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation. Expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL confers resistance against rituximab-induced apoptosis in vitro and rituximab treatment of xenografted B-NHL in vivo. B-NHL cells insensitive to rituximab-induced apoptosis exhibit increased endogenous expression of multiple antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, or activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling resulting in up-regulation of Mcl-1. The former resistance pattern is overcome by treatment with the BH3-mimetic ABT-737, the latter by combining rituximab with pharmacologic phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitors. In conclusion, sensitivity of B-NHL cells to rituximab-induced apoptosis is determined at the level of mitochondria. Pharmacologic modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins or their upstream regulators is a promising strategy to overcome rituximab resistance.",,"['Stolz, Claudia', 'Hess, Georg', 'Hahnel, Patricia S', 'Grabellus, Florian', 'Hoffarth, Sandra', 'Schmid, Kurt W', 'Schuler, Martin']","['Stolz C', 'Hess G', 'Hahnel PS', 'Grabellus F', 'Hoffarth S', 'Schmid KW', 'Schuler M']","['Department of Medicine (Cancer Research), West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, Essen, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rituximab', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",,,2008/08/12 09:00,2008/10/17 09:00,['2008/08/12 09:00'],"['2008/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59739-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-124487 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Oct 15;112(8):3312-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-124487.

Mutations in the absence of 17p deletions were found in 4.5%. We found a shorter survival for patients with TP53 mutation (n = 18; P = .002), which was more pronounced when analyzed from the time point of mutation detection (6.8 vs 69 months, P < .001). The survival was equally poor for patients with deletion 17p plus TP53 mutation (7.6 months, n = 13), TP53 mutation only (5.5 months, n = 5), and 17p deletion only (5.4 months, n = 3). The prognostic impact of TP53 mutation (HR 3.71) was shown to be independent of stage, VH status, and 11q and 17p deletion in multivariate analysis. Serial samples showed evidence of clonal evolution and increasing clone size during chemotherapy, suggesting that there may be patients where this treatment is potentially harmful.

A dysfunction in this inhibitory process has been postulated to contribute to leukemogenesis. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of monocyte inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1alpha) in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancy. The study comprised 54 patients and 15 healthy controls. Patients were divided into 3 groups (25 with lymphoma, 12 with multiple myeloma and 17 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Serum MIP-1alpha level was estimated by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Sixteen patients were followed up to examine the relationship between serum MIP-1alpha level and response to treatment and survival of patients. The serum level (pg/ml) of MIP-1alpha was significantly higher in patients with lymphoid malignancy compared to controls (97.9 +/- 171.1 versus 2.5 +/- 2.2, p < 0.05). Comparing with controls, the correlation was statistically significant in patients with multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (192.3 +/- 156.6, P < 0.001; 78.7 +/- 115.9, p < 0.05 respectively) but not in lymphoma patients (65.9 +/- 196.5, p > 0.05). There was a significant correlation between MIP-1alpha serum level and the overall survival of patients. Patients with higher MIP-1alpha level showed an increased percentage of death and relapse than patients with normal MIP-1alpha (72.72% versus 21.87%, p < 0.05).

In this work, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the gene expression (mRNA) of CD30 variant (CD30v) and CD30 Ligand (CD30L) on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 15 healthy individuals as a control group, 15 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 15 patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The results revealed that simultaneous positive expression of both CD30v and CD30L was found in 46.7%, 40% and 53.3% of whole leukemic patients and those with AML and ALL respectively, with significant difference from controls in whom no expression was found (P=0.007, 0.021 and 0.005, respectively). Patients with positive expression of CD30v and CD30L were found to have significantly increased blast cell % (p<0.001), increased total leucocytic count (P<0.001) and decreased platelets count (P<0.001) than those with negative expression. No significant difference in expression could be noticed in relation to age (p>0.05), sex (P=0.998.) or hemoglobin (Hb) level (P=0.20). As regard to immunophenotypes of ALL, positive expression was found to be significantly higher in B-cell than T-cell subtype (77.8% versus 16.7%, P=0.02). It could be concluded that frequent expression of CD30V and CD30L was detected only in newly diagnosed cases of AML and ALL, but not in healthy individuals. Positive expression was also significantly associated with more aggressive disease and with B-cell than T-cell subtypes.

Some new prognostic factors, such as immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgVH) mutational status, zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70) and CD38 expression in leukemic cells were introduced to identify attenuated versus progressive types of CLL bearing the potential to facilitate risk-adapted treatment strategies. So, the aim of this work is to evaluate the clinical value of ZAP-70 and CD38 as predictors of disease progression. We assessed the expression of these markers by flowcytometry in 38 patients with CLL and correlated their levels with genetic abnormalities detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and the clinical outcome. We found that 18 patients (47.4 %) were positive for ZAP-70 (> or = 20%) and 16 patients (42.1%) were positive for CD38 (> or = 20%). Positive ZAP-70 and CD38 status were associated with an unfavorable clinical course including high leukocytic count, lymphocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum level, advanced disease stage, trisomy 12 and del (11q); negative ZAP-70 and CD38 status were correlated with del (13q). The treatment-free survival time was 30 months for ZAP-70-positive patients and 18 months for ZAP-70-nagative patients (p < 0.01). Combined analysis of ZAP-70 and CD38 yielded discordant results in 10 patients (26.3 %), whereas 16 patients (42.1%) were concordantly negative and 12 patients (31.6%) were concordantly positive for ZAP-70 and CD38 expression. Median treatment-free survival times in patients whose leukemic cells were ZAP-70+CD38+ was 27 months as compared to 100 months in patients with a ZAP-70(-)CD38(-) status. In patients with discordant ZAP-70/CD38 results, the median treatment-free survival time was 40 months. Thus, ZAP-70 and CD38 expression analyses provide complementary prognostic information and allow distinguishing the patients groups with the most favorable prognosis as well as those with the worst.

PROCEDURE: Three hundred and seven children (1-14 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated with a modified BFM protocol 76/79 between 1985 and 2003. Treatment outcome and prognostic factors were evaluated. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years; 78% had B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 22% had T lineage disease. Good prednisolone response was observed in 82% of cases. Two hundred and seventy-three children (91.6%) achieved complete remission; with 2% induction-related mortality and 6.4% having resistant disease. 52% of all evaluable patients and 56.8% of complete responders are in continuous complete remission (CCR) at a median follow up of 62 months (30-194 months). The median event free survival (EFS) was 114 months. The estimated 5 year overall survival, EFS and disease free survival was 59.8%, 56%, and 53.9%, respectively.

While 9 of 10 patients were successfully treated, 4 of the 9 developed T cell leukemia 31-68 months after gene therapy.

Here, we report data on the 2 most recent adverse events, which occurred in patients 7 and 10. In patient 10, blast cells contained an integrated vector near LMO2 and a second integrated vector near the proto-oncogene BMI1. In patient 7, blast cells contained an integrated vector near a third proto-oncogene,CCND2. Additional genetic abnormalities in the patients' blast cells included chromosomal translocations, gain-of-function mutations activating NOTCH1, and copy number changes, including deletion of tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A, 6q interstitial losses, and SIL-TAL1 rearrangement.

A new statistical approach.,e1000144,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000144 [doi],"Retroviral vectors are widely used in gene therapy to introduce therapeutic genes into patients' cells, since, once delivered to the nucleus, the genes of interest are stably inserted (integrated) into the target cell genome. There is now compelling evidence that integration of retroviral vectors follows non-random patterns in mammalian genome, with a preference for active genes and regulatory regions. In particular, Moloney Leukemia Virus (MLV)-derived vectors show a tendency to integrate in the proximity of the transcription start site (TSS) of genes, occasionally resulting in the deregulation of gene expression and, where proto-oncogenes are targeted, in tumor initiation. This has drawn the attention of the scientific community to the molecular determinants of the retroviral integration process as well as to statistical methods to evaluate the genome-wide distribution of integration sites. In recent approaches, the observed distribution of MLV integration distances (IDs) from the TSS of the nearest gene is assumed to be non-random by empirical comparison with a random distribution generated by computational simulation procedures. To provide a statistical procedure to test the randomness of the retroviral insertion pattern, we propose a probability model (Beta distribution) based on IDs between two consecutive genes. We apply the procedure to a set of 595 unique MLV insertion sites retrieved from human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The statistical goodness of fit test shows the suitability of this distribution to the observed data. Our statistical analysis confirms the preference of MLV-based vectors to integrate in promoter-proximal regions.",,"['Ambrosi, Alessandro', 'Cattoglio, Claudia', 'Di Serio, Clelia']","['Ambrosi A', 'Cattoglio C', 'Di Serio C']","['University Centre for Statistics in the Biomedical Sciences, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan Italy.']",['eng'],['GGP06101/TI_/Telethon/Italy'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors/metabolism', 'Genome, Human', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein/*methods', '*Statistical Distributions', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Transcription Initiation Site/physiology', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",PMC2453317,,2008/08/09 09:00,2008/12/19 09:00,['2008/08/09 09:00'],"['2007/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000144 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2008 Aug 8;4(8):e1000144. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000144.,20080808,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptors for HMGB1 include TLR4, TLR2, and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). We tested the hypothesis that extracellular HMGB1 can induce LPS tolerance. HMGB1 dose-response experiments were performed on IFN-gamma-differentiated human monocyte-like THP-1 cells. Treatment with 1 microg/ml HMGB1 18 h before exposure to LPS (1 microg/ml) decreased TNF release, NF-kappaB nuclear DNA-binding activity, phosphorylation, and degradation of IkappaBalpha. Preconditioning with HMGB1 alone and HMGB1 in the presence of polymyxin B decreased LPS-mediated, NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression. The specificity of HMGB1 in tolerance induction was supported further by showing that boiled HMGB1 failed to induce tolerance, and antibodies against HMGB1 blocked the induction of LPS tolerance. Bone marrow-derived macrophages obtained from C57Bl/6 wild-type mice became LPS-tolerant following HMGB1 exposure ex vivo, but macrophages derived from RAGE-deficient mice failed to develop tolerance and responded normally to LPS. Mice preconditioned with HMGB1 (20 microg) 1 h before LPS injection (10 mg/kg) had lower circulating TNF compared with control mice preconditioned with saline vehicle. Similarly, decreased nuclear DNA binding of hepatic NF-kappaB was observed in mice preconditioned with HMGB1. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular HMGB1 induces LPS tolerance, and the RAGE receptor is required for this induction.",,"['Aneja, Rajesh K', 'Tsung, Allan', 'Sjodin, Hanna', 'Gefter, Julia V', 'Delude, Russell L', 'Billiar, Timothy R', 'Fink, Mitchell P']","['Aneja RK', 'Tsung A', 'Sjodin H', 'Gefter JV', 'Delude RL', 'Billiar TR', 'Fink MP']","[""Department of Critical Care Medicine and Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA. anejar@upmc.edu""]",['eng'],"['K08 GM076344/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 GM076344-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Probes', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HMGB1 Protein/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*toxicity', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood/physiology']",PMC2567896,,2008/08/09 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/08/09 09:00'],"['2008/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0108030 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0108030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2008 Nov;84(5):1326-34. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0108030.

Here we demonstrate that an adjacent region 1 kb upstream (+18 element) is in an open chromatin configuration and carries active histone marks but does not function as an enhancer in transgenic mice. Instead, it boosts activity of the +19 enhancer both in stable transfection assays and during differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells carrying single-copy reporter constructs targeted to the Hprt locus. The +18 element contains a mammalian interspersed repeat (MIR) which is essential for the +18 function and which was transposed to the Tal1 locus approximately 160 million years ago at the time of the mammalian/marsupial branchpoint.

A high level of ZAP-70 expression is observed in leukemia, which suggests ZAP-70 as a logical target for immunomodulatory therapies. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is one of the major green tea catechins that is suggested to have a role as a preventive agent in cancer, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Here we identified ZAP-70 as an important and novel molecular target of EGCG in leukemia cells. ZAP-70 and EGCG displayed high binding affinity (Kd = 0.6207 micromol/liter), and additional results revealed that EGCG effectively suppressed ZAP-70, linker for the activation of T cells, phospholipase Cgamma1, extracellular signaling-regulated kinase, and MAPK kinase activities in CD3-activated T cell leukemia. Furthermore, the activation of activator protein-1 and interleukin-2 induced by CD3 was dose-dependently inhibited by EGCG treatment. Notably, EGCG dose-dependently induced caspase-mediated apoptosis in P116.cl39 ZAP-70-expressing leukemia cells, whereas P116 ZAP-70-deficient cells were resistant to EGCG treatment. Molecular docking studies, supported by site-directed mutagenesis experiments, showed that EGCG could form a series of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions within the ATP binding domain, which may contribute to the stability of the ZAP-70-EGCG complex. Overall, these results strongly indicated that ZAP-70 activity was inhibited specifically by EGCG, which contributed to suppressing the CD3-mediated T cell-induced pathways in leukemia cells.",,"['Shim, Jung-Hyun', 'Choi, Hong Seok', 'Pugliese, Angelo', 'Lee, Sung-Young', 'Chae, Jung-Il', 'Choi, Bu Young', 'Bode, Ann M', 'Dong, Zigang']","['Shim JH', 'Choi HS', 'Pugliese A', 'Lee SY', 'Chae JI', 'Choi BY', 'Bode AM', 'Dong Z']","['Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, Minnesota 55912, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA111536/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA120388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81064/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'CD3 Complex/*biosynthesis', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",PMC2568917,,2008/08/09 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/09 09:00'],"['2008/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)64233-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M802200200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Oct 17;283(42):28370-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M802200200.

A hamster cheek pouch model was used in which 0.5% DMBA was applied topically onto the left cheek pouch of male Syrian golden hamsters either three times per week for 3 weeks (short term) or 6 weeks (long term). Zyflamend was then applied topically at one of three different doses (25, 50 and 100 microl) onto the left cheek pouch three times for 1 week (short-term study) or chronically for 18 weeks. Zyflamend significantly reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, incidence of hyperplasia and dysplastic lesions, bromodeoxyuridine-labeling index as well as number of SCC in a concentration-dependent manner. Application of Zyflamend (100 microl) reduced formation of leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) by 50% compared with DMBA-treated tissues. The reduction of LTB(4) was concentration dependent. The effect of Zyflamend on inhibition of LTB(4) formation was further confirmed with in vitro cell-based assay. Adding LTB(4) to RBL-1 cells, a rat leukemia cell line expressing high levels of 5-LOX and LTA(4) hydrolase, partially blocked antiproliferative effect of Zyflamend.

Asymptomatic persons with fewer CLL-phenotype cells have monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). The goal of this study was to investigate the relation between MBL and CLL. METHODS: We investigated 1520 subjects who were 62 to 80 years of age with a normal blood count and 2228 subjects with lymphocytosis (>4000 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter) for the presence of MBL, using flow cytometry. Monoclonal B cells were further characterized by means of cytogenetic and molecular analyses. A representative cohort of 185 subjects with CLL-phenotype MBL and lymphocytosis were monitored for a median of 6.7 years (range, 0.2 to 11.8). RESULTS: Monoclonal CLL-phenotype B cells were detected in 5.1% of subjects (78 of 1520) with a normal blood count and 13.9% (309 of 2228) with lymphocytosis. CLL-phenotype MBL had a frequency of 13q14 deletion and trisomy 12 similar to that of CLL and showed a skewed repertoire of the immunoglobulin heavy variable group (IGHV) genes. Among 185 subjects presenting with lymphocytosis, progressive lymphocytosis occurred in 51 (28%), progressive CLL developed in 28 (15%), and chemotherapy was required in 13 (7%). The absolute B-cell count was the only independent prognostic factor associated with progressive lymphocytosis. During follow-up over a median of 6.7 years, 34% of subjects (62 of 185) died, but only 4 of these deaths were due to CLL. Age above 68 years and hemoglobin level below 12.5 g per deciliter were the only independent prognostic factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: The CLL-phenotype cells found in the general population and in subjects with lymphocytosis have features in common with CLL cells. CLL requiring treatment develops in subjects with CLL-phenotype MBL and with lymphocytosis at the rate of 1.1% per year.",['2008 Massachusetts Medical Society'],"['Rawstron, Andy C', 'Bennett, Fiona L', ""O'Connor, Sheila J M"", 'Kwok, Marwan', 'Fenton, James A L', 'Plummer, Marieth', 'de Tute, Ruth', 'Owen, Roger G', 'Richards, Stephen J', 'Jack, Andrew S', 'Hillmen, Peter']","['Rawstron AC', 'Bennett FL', ""O'Connor SJ"", 'Kwok M', 'Fenton JA', 'Plummer M', 'de Tute R', 'Owen RG', 'Richards SJ', 'Jack AS', 'Hillmen P']","['Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Leeds, United Kingdom. andy.rawstron@hmds.org.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genetic Markers', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/mortality', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precancerous Conditions/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Reference Values']",,,2008/08/09 09:00,2008/08/21 09:00,['2008/08/09 09:00'],"['2008/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['359/6/575 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa075290 [doi]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2008 Aug 7;359(6):575-83. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa075290.,,,"['N Engl J Med. 2008 Aug 7;359(6):638-40.

AML1/ETO is associated with 15% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. The fusion gene is a dominant inhibitor of myeloid-specific genes, notably AML1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha), and myeloperoxidase (MPO). In this study, we investigated the role of antiapoptosis gene survivin as a target of AML1/ETO-related leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through the combination of reporter assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of genes, we showed that survivin is a critical target of AML1/ETO. Biological studies were performed in cell lines and primary human CD 34(+) cells. RESULTS: In this study, we have shown that ectopic expression of AML1/ETO induces survivin gene expression in both a cell line model and in the primary human hematopoietic CD34(+) cells. Reporter assays demonstrate that ectopically expressed AML1/ETO activates survivin promoter. Endogenous AML1/ETO derived from the Kasumi-1 cell line nuclear extract binds physically to the AML1 core enhancer-binding sequence, TGTGGT, derived from the survivin promotor. Knockdown of survivin expression by shRNA in ectopically expressed AML1/ETO myeloid leukemia cell lines restores expression of C/EBPalpha, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, and MPO genes, which leads to their growth arrest and granulocytic differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that survivin gene acts as a critical mediator of AML1/ETO-induced late oncogeneic events.",,"['Balkhi, Mumtaz Yaseen', 'Christopeit, Maximilian', 'Chen, Yong', 'Geletu, Mulu', 'Behre, Gerhard']","['Balkhi MY', 'Christopeit M', 'Chen Y', 'Geletu M', 'Behre G']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, State Centre for Cell and Gene Therapy, Clinic Internal Medicine IV, Martin-Luther-University, Halle, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*physiology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Survivin', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2008/08/09 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/09 09:00'],"['2007/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00230-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.05.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Nov;36(11):1449-60. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.05.008.

In this study, we examined the expression of Notch receptors and ligands in the human CML cell line K562. When the active form of Notch1, the Notch intra-cellular domain (NIC), was over-expressed in K562, the proliferation of K562 was mildly but significantly inhibited, accompanied by increased Hes1 mRNA level. On the other hand, when Notch signaling was attenuated by over-expression of a dominant-negative RBP-J, RBP-J(R218H), in K562 cells, the proliferation of K562 was increased. Moreover, we found that activation of Notch signaling inhibited while repression of Notch signaling promoted the colony-forming activity of K562 cells. We examined cell cycle-related molecules in K562 transfected with NIC or RBP-J(R218H), and found that the protein level of the retinoblastoma gene product (the Rb protein) was induced in K562 expressing NIC, and down-regulated in K562 expressing RBP-J(R218H).

Low molecular weight liquid polymers are used as plasticizers in paints, waxes, adhesives, and plastics. alpha-Methylstyrene was nominated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for toxicologic evaluation and genotoxicity studies based on its high production volume and limited information available on its toxicity. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to alpha-methylstyrene (99.5% pure) by inhalation for 3 months or 2 years. Inhalation studies were conducted because the primary route of human exposure is via inhalation. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed by whole-body inhalation to alpha-methylstyrene at concentrations of 0, 75, 150, 300, 600, or 1,000 ppm for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. Additional clinical pathology groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to the same concentrations for 23 days. All rats survived to the end of the study, and mean body weights of all exposed groups were similar to those of the chamber controls. Kidney weights were significantly increased in 1,000 ppm males and 600 and 1,000 ppm females. Statistically significant increases in liver weights occurred in 150 ppm or greater males and 600 and 1,000 ppm females. The incidences of renal hyaline droplet accumulation were similar between exposed groups and chamber control groups, but the severity of hyaline droplet accumulation in 600 and 1,000 ppm males was greater than in chamber controls. Consistent with the hyaline droplet accumulation, an exposure-related increase in alpha2mu-globulin was detected in the kidneys of males exposed to alpha-methylstyrene. Morphologic changes were not detected in the liver. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed by whole-body inhalation to alpha-methylstyrene at concentrations of 0, 75, 150, 300, 600, or 1,000 ppm for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. Two female mice in the 1,000 ppm group died before exposure on day 3. Final mean body weights of 600 and 1,000 ppm males and 75, 300, and 1,000 ppm females were significantly less than those of the chamber controls; final mean body weight gains of mice exposed to 300 ppm or greater were also significantly less. Moderate to severe sedation (males only) and ataxia were observed in 1,000 ppm mice. The absolute liver weights of 600 and 1,000 ppm females and the relative liver weights of 300, 600, and 1,000 ppm males and females were significantly increased. The estrous cycle lengths of 600 and 1,000 ppm female mice were significantly longer than that of the chamber controls. Minimal to mild centrilobular hypertrophy was present in the livers of male and female mice exposed to 600 or 1,000 ppm alpha-methylstyrene. The incidences of exposure-related nasal lesions, including atrophy and hyperplasia of Bowman's glands and atrophy and metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium, were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and females. The incidences of hyaline degeneration, characterized by the accumulation of eosinophilic globules in the cytoplasm of the respiratory epithelium, were significantly increased in females exposed to 150 ppm or greater. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed by whole body inhalation to alpha-methylstyrene at concentrations of 0, 100, 300, or 1,000 ppm for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, except holidays, for 105 weeks. Survival rates of exposed male and female rats were similar to those of the chamber controls. The mean body weights of 1,000 ppm males and females were less than those of the chamber control groups during year 2 of the study. Two 1,000 ppm males and one 300 ppm male had renal tubule carcinomas, and one 300 ppm male had a renal tubule adenoma. Because of the neoplasms observed in 300 and 1,000 ppm males at the end of the 2-year study and the finding of alpha2mu-globulin accumulation in the kidneys at 3 months, which is often associated with kidney neoplasms, additional step sections of kidney were prepared; additional males with focal hyperplasia or adenoma were identified. The incidences of renal tubule adenoma and carcinoma (combined) in the 1,000 ppm males were significantly greater than those in the chamber controls when the single and step sections were combined. The incidence of mineralization of the renal papilla was significantly increased in 1,000 ppm males. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in 1,000 ppm males was significantly increased compared to the chamber controls. In the nose, the incidences of basal cell hyperplasia were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and females, and the incidences of degeneration of the olfactory epithelium were increased in 1,000 ppm males and females and 300 ppm females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed by whole body inhalation to alpha-methylstyrene at concentrations of 0, 100, 300, or 600 ppm for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, except holidays, for 105 weeks. Survival of all exposed male and female mice was similar to that of the chamber control groups. Mean body weights of 600 ppm males were less than those of the chamber control group throughout the study, and those of 600 ppm females were less after week 13. The mean body weights of 300 ppm males and females were less than those of the chamber controls during much of the study, but these groups recovered by the end of the study. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly increased in the 100 and 600 ppm males and in all exposed groups of females. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma were significantly increased in all exposed groups of females, and the incidences in all exposed groups of males and females exceeded the historical range for chamber controls. The incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma and eosinophilic foci of the liver were significantly increased in 600 ppm females. The incidences of olfactory epithelial metaplasia and hyperplasia of the glands overlying the olfactory epithelium were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and females. In addition, atrophy of the olfactory epithelium was significantly increased in 300 and 600 ppm males. The incidence and severity of nephropathy were increased in 600 ppm females compared to chamber controls. Epithelial hyperplasia of the forestomach also was present in male mice. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: alpha-Methylstyrene was not mutagenic in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium, with or without rat or hamster liver metabolic activation enzymes (S9). alpha-Methylstyrene did not induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9 activation, but did significantly increase the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in cultures exposed in the presence of S9. In vivo, no significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were seen in blood samples of male mice obtained at the conclusion of the 3-month study. However, in female mice from the 3-month study, a significant increase in micronucleated erythrocytes was observed in the 1,000 ppm group. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this 2-year inhalation study, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of alpha-methylstyrene in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule adenomas and carcinomas (combined). The increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in 1,000 ppm male F344/N rats may have been related to alpha-methylstyrene exposure. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of alpha-methylstyrene in female F344/N rats exposed to 100, 300, or 1,000 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of alpha-methylstyrene in male B6C3F1 mice based on marginally increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of alpha-methylstyrene in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. Exposure of rats to alpha-methylstyrene resulted in kidney toxicity, which in males exhibited some features of alpha2mu-globulin nephropathy. Exposure to alpha-methylstyrene resulted in nonneoplastic lesions of the nose in male and female rats and mice and of the liver and kidney in female mice.",,,,,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Technical Report']",United States,Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser,National Toxicology Program technical report series,8500747,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Styrenes)', 'D46R9753IK (alpha-methylstyrol)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'CHO Cells', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Kidney/drug effects/pathology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/chemically induced/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/chemically induced/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/chemically induced', 'Mutagens/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*etiology/pathology', 'Nose Diseases/chemically induced', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Styrenes/administration & dosage/*toxicity', '*Toxicity Tests']",,,2008/08/08 09:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2008/08/08 09:00'],"['2008/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser. 2007 Nov;(543):1-210.,,,,,,,['National Toxicology Program'],,,,,,,,,

The acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations leads to deregulation of these processes and the development of acute leukemias. A prerequisite to targeted therapies directed against these malignancies is a thorough understanding of the processes that subvert the normal developmental program of the hematopoietic system. This involves identifying the molecular lesions responsible for malignant transformation, their mechanisms of action and the cell type(s) in which they occur. Over the last 3 decades, significant progress has been made through the identification of recurrent genetic alterations and translocations in leukemic blast populations, and their subsequent functional characterization in cell lines and/or mouse models. Recently, primary human hematopoietic cells have emerged as a complementary means to characterize leukemic oncogenes. This approach enables the process of leukemogenesis to be precisely modeled in the appropriate cellular context: from primary human hematopoietic cells to leukemic stem cells capable of initiating disease in vivo.

However, the importance of cyclin D1 in the maintenance and progression of the disease remains to be defined. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of cyclin D1 overexpression using an efficient cyclin D1-shRNA and a lentiviral system in well-characterized MCL cell lines. Surprisingly, the knockdown of cyclin D1 led to a moderate retardation in growth, without induction of apoptosis. The cyclin D1-shRNA-transduced MCL cells showed a 15% shift from S phase to G(1) phase of the cell cycle, a weak induction of p27(Kip1), decreased Rb (Ser807/811) phosphorylation, and a consistent upregulation of cyclin D2 mRNA and protein expression. However, double knockdown of cyclins D1 and D2 did not intensify the effects observed with cyclin D1 knockdown alone. These data suggest that the moderate effects of cyclin D1 downregulation on survival and proliferation are likely the result of compensatory cyclin-independent mechanisms governing proliferation or alternatively, secondary genetic events that make cyclin D1 dispensable. These findings have important implications for MCL therapy, as strategies targeting only cyclin D1 function might be hampered by compensatory regulatory mechanisms, resulting in a low probability of treatment response.",,"['Klier, M', 'Anastasov, N', 'Hermann, A', 'Meindl, T', 'Angermeier, D', 'Raffeld, M', 'Fend, F', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, L']","['Klier M', 'Anastasov N', 'Hermann A', 'Meindl T', 'Angermeier D', 'Raffeld M', 'Fend F', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L']","['Institute of Pathology, Helmholtz Center Munich-German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin D1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Cyclins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2008/08/08 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/08 09:00'],"['2008/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008213 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.213 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Nov;22(11):2097-105. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.213.

Which of these indexes best predict survival is unknown yet. We retrospectively studied 286 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT. HCT-CI and PAM scores required grading according to pre-transplant pulmonary function tests (PFTs), which were lacking for some patients. We thus designed a reduced HCT-CI and an adjusted PAM, without results of PFTs. Using CCI, 25% of patients had indexes of 1 or more; median reduced HCT-CI score was 1; median adjusted PAM score was 24. The discriminative properties of the three CIs were rather low in our population.

Drug resistance was associated with decreased p53 induction after doxorubicin treatment, which was due to a higher level of proteasomal degradation of p53. Dominant-negative (DN) p53 genes increased the resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, MDM-2 and MEK inhibitors, further substantiating the role of p53 in therapeutic sensitivity. The involvement of signal transduction and apoptotic pathways was examined, as drug resistance did not appear to be due to increased drug efflux. Drug-resistant FL/Doxo cells had higher levels of activated Raf/MEK/ERK signaling and decreased induction of apoptosis when cultured in the presence of doxorubicin than drug-sensitive FL5.12 cells. Introduction of DN MEK1 increased drug sensitivity, whereas constitutively active (CA) MEK1 or conditionally active BRAF augmented resistance, documenting the importance of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in drug resistance. MEK inhibitors synergized with chemotherapeutic drugs to reduce the IC(50). Thus the p53 and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways play key roles in drug sensitivity.

Recent studies have demonstrated that nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK, originated from the fusion of NPM and ALK genes, causes cell transformation through diverse mechanisms. Here, we show a novel mechanism by which NPM-ALK transforms lymphoid tumor cells to become resistant to glucocorticoid (GC) or dexamethasone (Dex) treatment. Transformed BaF3 cells by NPM-ALK were much more resistant to Dex compared with their parental cells, and concurrently had a constitutive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, as evidenced by hyperphosphorylation of its downstream effectors, p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin suppressed activation of p70S6K in BaF3/NPM-ALK cells and reversed GC resistance by synergistically inhibiting mTOR signaling pathway, enhancing cell cycle arrest at G(1) phase and promoting apoptotic cell death. In conclusion, our data indicate that the ALK fusion kinase, NPM-ALK, induces GC resistance by activating mTOR signaling, and addition of mTOR inhibitors to the chemotherapeutic regimen of ALK+ lymphomas may improve the prognosis.",,"['Gu, L', 'Gao, J', 'Li, Q', 'Zhu, Y P', 'Jia, C S', 'Fu, R Y', 'Chen, Y', 'Liao, Q K', 'Ma, Z']","['Gu L', 'Gao J', 'Li Q', 'Zhu YP', 'Jia CS', 'Fu RY', 'Chen Y', 'Liao QK', 'Ma Z']","['Laboratory of Hematology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Eif4ebp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (p80(NPM-ALK) protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*pharmacology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",,,2008/08/08 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/08 09:00'],"['2008/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008204 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.204 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Nov;22(11):2091-6. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.204.

All patients with PLF clinically presented with a solitary nodule preferentially involving the face. Beside hair follicle hyperplasia, the typical features were a dense infiltrate of small well-differentiated lymphocytes, lymphoplasmacytoid cells, plasma cells, and epithelioid histiocytes forming tiny granulomas. Some unusual or worrisome features recognized included eccrine/apocrine duct hyperplasia, subcutis/muscle infiltration, lymphocyte ""smudging,"" single file infiltration, and large atypical cells. Immunohistochemically, T-cell predominant cases dominated in the series. All 34 tested cases revealed a polyclonal pattern of kappa and lambda immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain expression. In 4 cases, scattered CD30+ cells were identified. Monoclonal rearrangements of T-cell receptor (TCR) and IgH genes were detected in 19 and 3 cases respectively, including 1 case with dual T-cell receptor/IgH rearrangement. Three of 30 tested cases proved positive for herpes simplex virus-1, whereas herpes simplex virus-2 always tested negative. Of 31 cases tested for Borrelia burgdorferi, 30 specimens were negative. In 9 cases, fluorescent in situ hybridization for t(11;18) and t(14;18) revealed none of the above translocations. The most common treatment modality was surgical removal.

THP-1 monocytes and PBMC promote shaving, but PBMC also kill antibody-opsonized cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a reaction generally considered to be due to NK cells. We hypothesized that within PBMC, monocytes and NK cells would have substantially different and competing activities with respect ADCC or shaving, thereby either enhancing or inhibiting the therapeutic action of RTX. We measured ADCC and RTX removal from RTX-opsonized Daudi cells promoted by PBMC, or mediated by NK cells and monocytes. NK cells take up RTX and CD20 from RTX-opsonized B cells, and mediate ADCC. PBMC depleted of NK cells show little ADCC activity, whereas PBMC depleted of monocytes have greater ADCC than the PBMC. Pre-treatment of RTX-opsonized B cells with THP-1 cells or monocytes suppresses NK cell-mediated ADCC, and blockade of Fc gammaRI on monocytes or THP-1 cells abrogates their ability to suppress ADCC. Our results indicate NK cells are the principal cells in PBMC that kill RTX-opsonized B cells, and that monocytes can suppress ADCC by promoting shaving. These results suggest that RTX-based immunotherapy of cancer may be enhanced based on paradigms which include infusion of compatible NK cells and inhibition of monocyte shaving activity.",,"['Beum, Paul V', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Taylor, Ronald P']","['Beum PV', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Taylor RP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Communication/*immunology', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*immunology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Opsonin Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rituximab']",,,2008/08/08 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/08/08 09:00'],"['2008/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/4/2916 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.4.2916 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Aug 15;181(4):2916-24. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.4.2916.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas seven cell lines representing a spectrum of primary cutaneous T cell lymphoproliferative disorders expressed CD25 and TGF-beta, the expression of FOXP3 and, to a lesser degree, IL-10 was restricted to two CTCL cell lines that are dependent on exogenous IL-2. IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21, all of which signals through receptors containing the common gamma chain, induced expression of IL-10 in the IL-2-dependent cell lines as well as primary leukemic CTCL cells. However, only IL-2 and IL-15, but not IL-21, induced expression of FOXP3. The IL-2-triggered induction of IL-10 and FOXP3 expression occurred by signaling through STAT3 and STAT5, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis of the CTCL tissues revealed that FOXP3-expressing cells were common among the CD7-negative enlarged atypical and small lymphocytes at the early skin patch and plaque stages. Their frequency was profoundly diminished at the tumor stage and in the CTCL lymph node lesions with or without large cell transformation.

Antitumor effects of the iNKT cell ligand alpha-galactosylceramide (alphaGC) and iNKT cell adoptive transfer have been demonstrated in various tumor models. Together with reduced numbers of iNKT cells in cancer patients, which have been linked to poor clinical outcome, these data suggest that cancer patients may benefit from therapy aiming at iNKT cell proliferation and activation. Herein we present results of investigations on the effects of human iNKT cells on Ag-specific CTL responses. iNKT cells were expanded using alphaGC-pulsed allogeneic DC derived from the acute myeloid leukemia cell line MUTZ-3, transduced with CD1d to enhance iNKT cell stimulation, and with IL-12 to stimulate type 1 cytokine production. Enhanced activation and increased IFN-gamma production was observed in iNKT cells, irrespective of CD4 expression, upon stimulation with IL-12-overexpressing dendritic cells. IL-12-stimulated iNKT cells strongly enhanced the MART-1 (melanoma Ag recognized by T cell 1)-specific CD8(+) CTL response, which was dependent on iNKT cell-derived IFN-gamma. Furthermore, autologous IL-12-overexpressing dendritic cells, loaded with Ag as well as alphaGC, was superior in stimulating both iNKT cells and Ag-specific CTL. This study shows that IL-12-overexpressing allogeneic dendritic cells expand IFN-gamma-producing iNKT cells, which may be more effective against tumors in vivo.

Deregulated expression of AID is associated with various B-cell malignancies and, currently, it remains unclear how AID activity is extinguished to avoid illegitimate mutations. AID has also been shown to be alternatively spliced in malignant B cells, and there is limited evidence that this also occurs in normal blood B cells. The functional significance of these splice variants remains unknown. Here we show that normal GC human B cells and blood memory B cells similarly express AID splice variants and show for the first time that AID splicing variants are singly expressed in individual normal B cells as well as malignant B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. We further demonstrate that the alternative AID splice variants display different activities ranging from inactivation of CSR to inactivation or heightened SHM activity. Our data therefore suggest that CSR and SHM are differentially switched off by varying the expression of splicing products of AID at the individual cell level. Most importantly, our findings suggest a novel tumor suppression mechanism by which unnecessary AID mutagenic activities are promptly contained for GC B cells.",,"['Wu, Xiaosheng', 'Darce, Jaime R', 'Chang, Sook Kyung', 'Nowakowski, Grzegorz S', 'Jelinek, Diane F']","['Wu X', 'Darce JR', 'Chang SK', 'Nowakowski GS', 'Jelinek DF']","['Department of Immunology, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA062242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '(CA062242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*physiology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytidine Deaminase/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Germinal Center/immunology/metabolism/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/*genetics']",PMC2597133,,2008/08/08 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/08/08 09:00'],"['2008/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51817-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-145995 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Dec 1;112(12):4675-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-03-145995.

We found that BCR/ABL(+) human leukemic cells express PI3Kdelta and therefore explored its impact on leukemia development. Using PI3Kdelta-deficient mice, we define a dual role of PI3Kdelta in leukemia. We observed a growth-promoting effect in tumor cells and an essential function in natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumor surveillance: Abelson-transformed PI3Kdelta-deficient cells induced leukemia in RAG2-deficient mice with an increased latency, indicating that PI3Kdelta accelerated leukemia progression in vivo. However, the absence of PI3Kdelta also affected NK cell-mediated tumor surveillance. PI3Kdelta-deficient NK cells failed to lyse a large variety of target cells because of defective degranulation, as also documented by capacitance recordings. Accordingly, transplanted leukemic cells killed PI3Kdelta-deficient animals more rapidly. As a net effect, no difference in disease latency in vivo was detected if both leukemic cells and NK cells lack PI3Kdelta. Other tumor models confirmed that PI3Kdelta-deficient mice succumbed more rapidly when challenged with T- or B-lymphoid leukemic or B16 melanoma cells. Thus, the action of PI3Kdelta in the NK compartment is as relevant to survival of the mice as the delayed tumor progression.

Two main features of NC's chaperone activity are its abilities to aggregate and to destabilize nucleic acids. These functions are associated with NC's highly basic character and with its zinc finger domains, respectively. While the chaperone activity of HIV-1 NC has been extensively studied, less is known about the chaperone activities of other retroviral NCs. In this work, complementary experimental approaches were used to characterize and compare the chaperone activities of NC proteins from four different retroviruses: HIV-1, Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The different NCs exhibited significant differences in their overall chaperone activities, as demonstrated by gel shift annealing assays, decreasing in the order HIV-1 approximately RSV > MLV >> HTLV-1. In addition, whereas HIV-1, RSV, and MLV NCs are effective aggregating agents, HTLV-1 NC, which exhibits poor overall chaperone activity, is unable to aggregate nucleic acids. Measurements of equilibrium binding to single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides suggested that all four NC proteins have moderate duplex destabilization capabilities.

Neither a casual relationship between XMRV infection and prostate cancer nor a mechanism of tumorigenesis has been established. To determine the integration site preferences of XMRV and the potential risk of proviral insertional mutagenesis, we carried out a genome-wide analysis of viral integration sites in the prostate cell line DU145 after an acute XMRV infection and compared the integration site pattern of XMRV with those found for murine leukemia virus and two human retroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Among all retroviruses analyzed, XMRV has the strongest preference for transcription start sites, CpG islands, DNase-hypersensitive sites, and gene-dense regions; all are features frequently associated with structurally open transcription regulatory regions of a chromosome. Analyses of XMRV integration sites in tissues from prostate cancer patients found a similar preference for the aforementioned chromosomal features. Additionally, XMRV integration sites in cancer tissues were associated with cancer breakpoints, common fragile sites, microRNA, and cancer-related genes, suggesting a selection process that favors certain chromosomal integration sites. In both acutely infected cells and cancer tissues, no common integration site was detected within or near proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pinopode formation, expression of LIF, LIFR, gp130, and SOCS1 protein and mRNA in endometrial biopsies. RESULT(S): The expression of LIFR in the endometrium was negatively correlated to the expression of SOCS1 and positively correlated to the formation of pinopodes. In control fertile women, simultaneous intense apical staining of LIFR and gp130 together with faint SOCS1 staining was observed in epithelial cells, whereas the opposite was seen in most women with unexplained infertility.

A prior publication suggests that loss of the Y chromosome in more than 75% of cells may indicate a clonal phenomenon that could be a marker for hematologic disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between loss of the Y chromosome and AML/MDS. DESIGN: A retrospective review of cytogenetic reports of 2896 male patients ascertained from 1996 to 2007 was performed. Results were stratified based on the percentage of cells missing the Y chromosome and were correlated with patients' ages and bone marrow biopsy reports through logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age. RESULTS: Loss of the Y chromosome was found in 142 patients. Of these, 16 patients demonstrated myeloid disease, with 2 cases of AML and 14 cases of MDS. An increased incidence (P < .05) of AML/MDS was seen only in the group composed of 8 patients with complete loss of the Y chromosome in all karyotyped cells (1 case of AML and 7 cases of MDS). CONCLUSION: Loss of the Y chromosome appears to be primarily an age-related phenomenon. However, in individuals in which all cells on cytogenetic analysis showed loss of the Y chromosome, there was a statistically significant increase in AML/MDS, suggesting that the absence of any normal-dividing cells in a bone marrow analysis may be indicative of AML/MDS.",,"['Wong, Anna K', 'Fang, Belle', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Guo, Xiuqing', 'Lee, Stephen', 'Schreck, Rhona']","['Wong AK', 'Fang B', 'Zhang L', 'Guo X', 'Lee S', 'Schreck R']","['Department of Pathology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. anna.wong@cshs.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Y', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2008/08/08 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/08/08 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['2007-0668-OAR1 [pii]', '10.5858/2008-132-1329-LOTYCA [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2008 Aug;132(8):1329-32. doi: 10.5858/2008-132-1329-LOTYCA.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As CD34 has been related with poor outcome in ALL in general, we investigated the prognostic significance of the stem cell marker CD34, as well as the association of CD34 positivity with the expression of several multidrug resistance (MDR) genes. PROCEDURE: In this retrospective study, we investigated the prognostic significance of the expression of the early T-cell differentiation marker CD34 and the expression of MDR genes in relation to outcome in a cohort of 72 newly diagnosed pediatric T-ALL patients. RESULTS: CD34 expression was related to a poor 5-year disease-free-survival and a poor 5-year overall survival. Using the Cox proportional hazard model, CD34 expression predicted for increased risk for relapse and death. Expression of CD34 was associated with elevated MDR1 and MRP1 mRNA expression levels. For the entire T-ALL cohort, these expression levels of MDR1 or MRP1 did not independently predict for poor outcome.

Although cytologic features are helpful for diagnosing typical SLL and transformed large-cell lymphoma (tLCL), SLL in accelerated phase (SLLacc) is more difficult to diagnose. Additional tests are needed to identify those patients who are transforming to a higher-grade lymphoma. This study evaluated the use of a multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe panel specifically designed for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/SLL and assessed the association between FISH findings and cytologic diagnosis, proliferation index, and risk of death. METHODS: FNA specimens from 50 patients (32 men and 18 women; mean age, 57 years [range, 36-77 years]) with histologically confirmed CLL and/or SLL were evaluated in this study for chromosomal abnormalities of 11q22 (ATM), 12, 13q14.3, 13q34.3 (LAMP1), and 17p13.1 (p53) by using a multiprobe FISH kit. One of the 50 cases was excluded because of an insufficient number of cells for FISH analysis. The FISH findings were compared with the cytologic diagnoses (26 SLLs, 12 SLLaccs, and 11 tLCLs), Ki-67 immunostaining, and risk of death. RESULTS: Abnormal signal patterns for 17p13.1 and 13q34.3 were associated with tLCL. Aberrations of 17p13.1 were found to be significantly associated with Ki-67 staining. Of the 49 patients with interpretable FISH results, 22 (45%) had died at the time of the study, with a mean overall survival time of 17 months after FNA. Patients with aberrations of 17p13.1 and 11q22 had 3.7 and 2.7 times the risk of death, respectively, compared with patients with normal patterns. CONCLUSIONS: FISH can be performed on FNA specimens from patients with a history of SLL/CLL. Chromosomal aberrations of 17p13.1 and 11q22 are associated with an increased risk of death. Knowledge of genetic abnormalities from FNAs may be useful in deciding when and how to treat indolent or progressive SLL.",['(c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],"['Caraway, Nancy P', 'Thomas, Elizabeth', 'Khanna, Abha', 'Payne, Linda', 'Zhang, Hua-Zhong', 'Lin, E', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Katz, Ruth L']","['Caraway NP', 'Thomas E', 'Khanna A', 'Payne L', 'Zhang HZ', 'Lin E', 'Keating MJ', 'Katz RL']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas M.

In the current study, the authors assessed the association between serum levels of various cytokines and clinical outcomes in patients with untreated AML or high-risk MDS. METHODS: Serum levels of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, IL-10, and endostatin were measured in patients with AML or high-risk MDS who presented for treatment at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from September 1994 through January 2001. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test for correlations with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Higher TNF-alpha levels were found to correlate with poorer performance status; higher leukocyte counts; higher levels of beta2-microglobulin, creatinine, uric acid, and alkaline phosphatase; lower levels of creatinine clearance and albumin; baseline infection; and M4-M5 AML subtypes. TNF-alpha levels <10 pg/mL were associated with higher rates of complete remission (P = .003), survival (P = .0003), and event-free survival (EFS) (P = .0009). However, on multivariate analyses, TNF-alpha level > or =10 pg/mL was not found to be an independent factor predicting clinical outcomes, but became statistically significant when leukocyte count was excluded from the models. The other cytokines were not found to be predictive of clinical outcomes.

Matched unrelated donors are increasingly used and improved HLA matching has led to increased survival. In addition, stem cells derived from peripheral blood and cord blood are being utilized to a greater extent. During the last decade, reduced-intensity conditioning, which is preferentially used in older patients or those with organ dysfunction, was introduced as an alternative to standard myeloablative regimens. In addition, the isolation of patients after transplant has been challenged by allowing patients to be treated at home after ASCT. Analysis of mutations in caspase recruitment domain containing protein 15 and levels of regulatory T-cells may be important in identifying patients at risk for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Mesenchymal stem cells that have immunomodulatory effects home in to injured tissues and may be used in the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory GVHD. In addition, the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) or graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect (ie, the attack of the transplanted immune system against the tumor or leukemia), is of major importance for the success of ASCT in patients with malignant disease.

Transcriptional induction of proapoptotic proteins including Puma are thought to mediate p53-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, recent studies have identified a novel nontranscriptional mechanism, involving direct binding of p53 to antiapoptotic proteins including Bcl-2 at the mitochondrial surface. Here we show that the major fraction of p53 induced in CLL cells by chlorambucil, fludarabine, or nutlin 3a was stably associated with mitochondria, where it binds to Bcl-2. The Puma protein, which was constitutively expressed in a p53-independent manner, was modestly up-regulated following p53 induction. Pifithrin alpha, an inhibitor of p53-mediated transcription, blocked the up-regulation of Puma and also of p21(CIP1). Surprisingly, pifithrin alpha dramatically augmented apoptosis induction by p53-elevating agents and also accelerated the proapoptotic conformation change of the Bax protein. These data suggest that direct interaction of p53 with mitochondrial antiapoptotic proteins including Bcl-2 is the major route for apoptosis induction in CLL cells and that p53's transcriptional targets include proteins that impede this nontranscriptional pathway. Therefore, strategies that block up-regulation of p53-mediated transcription may be of value in enhancing apoptosis induction of CLL cells by p53-elevating drugs.",,"['Steele, Andrew J', 'Prentice, Archibald G', 'Hoffbrand, A Victor', 'Yogashangary, Birunthini C', 'Hart, Stephen M', 'Nacheva, Elisabeth P', 'Howard-Reeves, Julie D', 'Duke, Veronique M', 'Kottaridis, Panagiotis D', 'Cwynarski, Kate', 'Vassilev, Lyubomir T', 'Wickremasinghe, R Gitendra']","['Steele AJ', 'Prentice AG', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Yogashangary BC', 'Hart SM', 'Nacheva EP', 'Howard-Reeves JD', 'Duke VM', 'Kottaridis PD', 'Cwynarski K', 'Vassilev LT', 'Wickremasinghe RG']","['Department of Hematology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)', 'D213B92S1Y (pifithrin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Toluene/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,,2008/08/07 09:00,2008/11/13 09:00,['2008/08/07 09:00'],"['2008/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51943-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-156380 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Nov 1;112(9):3827-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-05-156380.

In the present study, we identify a signaling pathway initiated from the nongenomic activity of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) to stimulate complex formation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) with its upstream kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). The activated ERK2 phosphorylates threonine-210 (Thr-210) of TR2, stimulating its subsequent SUMOylation. Dephosphorylated TR2 recruits coactivator PCAF and functions as an activator for its target gene Oct4. Upon phosphorylation at Thr-210, TR2 increasingly associates with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, becomes SUMOylated, and recruits corepressor RIP140 to act as a repressor for its target, Oct4.

Selective ablation of Evi-1 in Tie2(+) cells mimics Evi-1 deficiency, suggesting that Evi-1 function is required in Tie2(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitors. Conditional deletion of Evi-1 in the adult hematopoietic system revealed that Evi-1-deficient bone marrow HSCs cannot maintain hematopoiesis and lose their repopulating ability. In contrast, Evi-1 is dispensable for blood cell lineage commitment. Evi-1(+/-) mice exhibit the intermediate phenotype for HSC activity, suggesting a gene dosage requirement for Evi-1.

METHODS: Cultured K562 cells were treated with HSS at various concentrations (10-40 mg/L). The cell cycle, cell growth and the expression of apoptosis suppressor gene bcl-2 and apoptosis promoting gene bax were evaluated. RESULTS: HSS, 20mg/L, inhibited cell cycle in the G0/G1 and S phases. HSS, 20mg/L, also inhibited the growth of K562 cells over time. Expression of bcl-2 gene in the HSS 20mg/L (58.8%+/-4.7%) and HSS 40 mg/L group (26.6%+/-2.1%) were lower than in the control group (91.0+/-8.7%, P < 0.01). Expression of bax gene in the HSS 20mg/L (77.7+/-3.6%) and 40 mg/L group (90.6+/-3.7%) were higher than in the control group (10.9+/-6.6%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: HSS suppresses leukemia K562 cell growth by inhibiting the G0/G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. It also induces apoptosis in these leukemia cells by reducing the expression of apoptosis suppressor gene bcl-2, and increasing the expression of apoptosis promoting gene bax.

This dearth of knowledge about CSCs and metastasis is due largely to technical challenges associated with the use of primary human cancer cells in pre-clinical models of metastasis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop suitable pre-clinical model systems for studying stem-like cells in breast cancer metastasis, and to test the hypothesis that stem-like cells play a key role in metastatic behaviour. We assessed four different human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7) for expression of prospective CSC markers CD44/CD24 and CD133, and for functional activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), an enzyme involved in stem cell self-protection. We then used fluorescence-activated cell sorting and functional assays to characterize differences in malignant/metastatic behaviour in vitro (proliferation, colony-forming ability, adhesion, migration, invasion) and in vivo (tumorigenicity and metastasis). Sub-populations of cells demonstrating stem-cell-like characteristics (high expression of CSC markers and/or high ALDH) were identified in all cell lines except MCF-7. When isolated and compared to ALDH(low)CD44(low/-) cells, ALDH(hi)CD44(+)CD24(-) (MDA-MB-231) and ALDH(hi)CD44(+)CD133(+) (MDA-MB-468) cells demonstrated increased growth (P < 0.05), colony formation (P < 0.05), adhesion (P < 0.001), migration (P < 0.001) and invasion (P < 0.001). Furthermore, following tail vein or mammary fat pad injection of NOD/SCID/IL2gamma receptor null mice, ALDH(hi)CD44(+)CD24(-) and ALDH(hi)CD44(+)CD133(+) cells showed enhanced tumorigenicity and metastasis relative to ALDH(low)CD44(low/-) cells (P < 0.05). These novel results suggest that stem-like ALDH(hi)CD44(+)CD24(-) and ALDH(hi)CD44(+)CD133(+) cells may be important mediators of breast cancer metastasis.",,"['Croker, Alysha K', 'Goodale, David', 'Chu, Jenny', 'Postenka, Carl', 'Hedley, Benjamin D', 'Hess, David A', 'Allan, Alison L']","['Croker AK', 'Goodale D', 'Chu J', 'Postenka C', 'Hedley BD', 'Hess DA', 'Allan AL']","['London Regional Cancer Program, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'London Regional Cancer Program, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'London Regional Cancer Program, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'London Regional Cancer Program, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'London Regional Cancer Program, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Physiology & Pharmacology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'London Regional Cancer Program, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism']",PMC6512388,,2008/08/07 09:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2008/08/07 09:00'],"['2008/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2008/08/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00455.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2009 Aug;13(8B):2236-2252. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00455.x.

Moreover, BCL11A is localized in the characteristic nuclear body in which BCL6 is co-localized. However, the significance of BCL11A in leukemogenesis and nuclear function remains unknown. In this study we show that BCL11A interacts with UBC9, a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E2 conjugating enzyme, and recruits SUMO1 into the nuclear body. A lysine residue at amino acid 634 of BCL11A is SUMOylated but not required for the SUMO1 recruitment. The N-terminal region of BCL11A is responsible for SUMO1 recruitment as well as its nuclear body formation. We also show that SENP2, a SUMO specific peptidase, is co-localized in the nuclear body.

In this report, we characterized endothelial development of cultured E14 ESCs and mapped the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on these cells. After removal of leukemia inhibitory factor undifferentiated state ESCs were precultured for 6 days and then cultured for up to 30 days in differentiation culture medium, with or without supplemental VEGF. ELISA analysis was used to detect endogenous VEGF levels. Early vasculogenic development and expression of selected genes were characterized using flow cytometry for specific antigens and quantitative RT-PCR. ELISA analysis showed no endogenous VEGF after preculture and at day 2 in unsupplemented culture, therafter VEGF levels rise. Directly after preculture a high proportion (36%) of the ESCs showed positivity for endothelial CD31. We describe characteristic endothelial differentiation patterns in embryoid bodies (EB) kept in culture for up to 30 days. VEGF supplementation lead to qualitative changes in the EB vessels, specific activation of vasculogenesis-related genes (CD31, CD144, and ERG) and temporary down-regulation of the VEGF receptor gene flk-1. VEGF supplementation did not produce measurable changes in the endothelial cell fractions as judged by surface antigen presence.

Panniculitis may represent a sign of systemic disease and/or a modified immune response to hematogenously disseminated antigen. METHODS: We describe 10 cases of sterile neutrophilic dominant lobular panniculitis that represented an id reaction to non-tuberculous stimuli. RESULTS: Four males and six females had sudden tender non-ulcerated lower extremity nodules with preceding non-tuberculous infectious triggers. Three also had upper extremity lesions. Biopsies showed dominant neutrophilic infiltrate with subcutaneous microabscesses (7), extravascular granulomatous infiltrates (5), thrombotic microangiopathy (5) and necrotizing vasculitis (5). Stains evaluating microbial pathogens were negative. Lesions resolved with antibiotic treatment and/or abscess drainage; no case recurred. Medical histories included atopic diathesis (4), primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (1), ulcerative colitis (1) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (1). Serologies showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, cold agglutinins and cryofibrinogens. CONCLUSIONS: We propose the term acute infectious id panniculitis for cases of neutrophilic lobular panniculitis triggered by non-tuberculous infectious stimuli. This course may be self-limited.

It has been postulated to be an important factor in homing of lymphocytes to the skin because of its function as a ligand for E-selectin expressed on cutaneous endothelial cells. DESIGN: We investigated the expression of CLA using the HECA-452 antibody on paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue in a variety of reactive, neoplastic and preneoplastic cutaneous lymphoid infiltrates of T- and B-cell derivation. RESULTS: CLA was expressed at high levels in various types of inflammatory dermatoses with the exception of lupus erythematosus. High levels of CLA expression were seen in epidermotropic T-cell dyscrasias and epidermotropic T-cell lymphomas including mycosis fungoides (MF) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATCLL). A loss of CLA in tumors normally positive for CLA was a feature of disease progression best exemplified by tumor-stage MF and acute ATCLL. There was a lack of CLA expression in those lymphocytic infiltrates manifesting subcutaneous localization including lupus profundus, panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma and atypical lymphocytic lobular panniculitis. CLA expression was not only observed in primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma but also seen in cases of nodal anaplastic large cell lymphoma secondarily involving the skin and was negative in cases of nodal anaplastic large cell lymphoma without any established skin involvement. An oligodot pattern defined a novel reaction pattern in those aggressive systemic dyscrasias with a proclivity to involve the skin. CLA was negative in the majority of B-cell lymphomas. CONCLUSIONS: CLA plays a role in the pattern of T-cell lymphocyte migration in the skin and subcutis in both reactive and neoplastic states. An alteration in the expression of this marker, whether it is in the context of the acquisition of expression in a cell that is normally CLA negative or its loss of expression, may define a key event in determining cutaneous and extracutaneous hematopoietic cell distribution.",,"['Magro, Cynthia M', 'Dyrsen, Molly E']","['Magro CM', 'Dyrsen ME']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA. cym2003@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Dermatitis/complications/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/complications/immunology/pathology', 'Lichen Planus/complications/immunology/pathology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/complications/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*immunology/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology']",,,2008/08/07 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2008/08/07 09:00'],"['2008/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['CUP971 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0560.2007.00971.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2008 Nov;35(11):1040-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.2007.00971.x.

However, little is known about the factors that are needed to maintain human embryonic stem (ES) cells in an undifferentiated state. In a search for such requirements, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of publicly available SAGE and microarray data. The rationale for this analysis was to identify genes that are exclusively expressed in human ES cell lines compared to 30 differentiated tissue types. The WNT receptor FZD7 was found among the genes with an ES cell-specific expression profile in both SAGE and microarray analyses. Subsequent validation by quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry confirmed that FZD7 mRNA levels in human ES cells are up to 200-fold higher compared to differentiated cell types. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of FZD7 in human ES cells induced dramatic changes in the morphology of ES cell colonies, perturbation of expression levels of germ layer-specific marker genes, and a rapid loss of expression of the ES cell-specific transcription factor OCT4. These findings identify the WNT receptor FZD7 as a novel ES cell-specific surface antigen with a likely important role in the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal capacity.",,"['Melchior, Kai', 'Weiss, Jonathan', 'Zaehres, Holm', 'Kim, Yong-mi', 'Lutzko, Carolyn', 'Roosta, Neda', 'Hescheler, Jurgen', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Melchior K', 'Weiss J', 'Zaehres H', 'Kim YM', 'Lutzko C', 'Roosta N', 'Hescheler J', 'Muschen M']","[""Leukemia Research Program, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,"['0 (FZD7 protein, human)', '0 (Frizzled Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Frizzled Receptors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2008/08/07 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/08/07 09:00'],"['2008/08/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/BC.2008.108 [doi]', '10.1515/BC.2008.108 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Chem. 2008 Jul;389(7):897-903. doi: 10.1515/BC.2008.108.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A considerable number of PML NB components play vital roles in apoptosis, senescence regulation and tumour suppression. The molecular basis by which PML NBs control these cellular responses is still just beginning to be understood. In addition to PML itself, numerous further tumour suppressors including transcriptional regulator p53, acetyl transferase CBP (CREB binding protein) and protein kinase HIPK2 (homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2) are recruited to PML NBs in response to genotoxic stress or oncogenic transformation and drive the senescence and apoptosis response by regulating p53 activity. Moreover, in response to death-receptor activation, PML NBs may act as nuclear depots that release apoptotic factors, such as the FLASH (FLICE-associated huge) protein, to amplify the death signal. PML NBs are also associated with other nuclear domains including Cajal bodies and nucleoli and share apoptotic regulators with these domains, implying crosstalk between NBs in apoptosis regulation.

For HTLV-1 and for several virus groups this process is sensitive to inhibition by peptides that mimic the C-terminal alpha-helical region of the trimer-of-hairpins. RESULTS: We now show that amino acids that are conserved between BLV and HTLV-1 TM tend to map to the hydrophobic groove of the central triple-stranded coiled coil and to the leash and C-terminal alpha-helical region (LHR) of the trimer-of-hairpins. Remarkably, despite this conservation, BLV envelope was profoundly resistant to inhibition by HTLV-1-derived LHR-mimetics. Conversely, a BLV LHR-mimetic peptide antagonized BLV envelope-mediated membrane fusion but failed to inhibit HTLV-1-induced fusion. Notably, conserved leucine residues are critical to the inhibitory activity of the BLV LHR-based peptides. Homology modeling indicated that hydrophobic residues in the BLV LHR likely make direct contact with a pocket at the membrane-proximal end of the core coiled-coil and disruption of these interactions severely impaired the activity of the BLV inhibitor. Finally, the structural predictions assisted the design of a more potent antagonist of BLV membrane fusion. CONCLUSION: A conserved region of the HTLV-1 and BLV coiled coil is a target for peptide inhibitors of envelope-mediated membrane fusion and HTLV-1 entry. Nevertheless, the LHR-based inhibitors are highly specific to the virus from which the peptide was derived. We provide a model structure for the BLV LHR and coiled coil, which will facilitate comparative analysis of leukaemia virus TM function and may provide information of value in the development of improved, therapeutically relevant, antagonists of HTLV-1 entry into cells.",,"['Lamb, Daniel', 'Schuttelkopf, Alexander W', 'van Aalten, Daan M F', 'Brighty, David W']","['Lamb D', 'Schuttelkopf AW', 'van Aalten DM', 'Brighty DW']","['The Biomedical Research Centre, College of Medicine, Ninewells Hospital, The University, Dundee, DD1 9SY, Scotland, UK. d.J.Lamb@dundee.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Conserved Sequence', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/chemistry/*drug effects/physiology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Internalization/*drug effects']",PMC2533354,,2008/08/06 09:00,2008/10/24 09:00,['2008/08/06 09:00'],"['2008/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-5-70 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-70 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2008 Aug 4;5:70. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-5-70.,20080804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As genotyping procedures have become available for NAT1 and NAT2 gene variations, hundreds of association studies on NAT polymorphisms and cancer risk have been conducted. Here we review the findings obtained from these studies. Evidence for a putative association of NAT1 polymorphism and myeloma, lung and bladder cancer, as well as association of NAT2 polymorphisms with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, liver, colorectal and bladder cancer have been reported. In contrast, no consistent evidence for a relevant association of NAT polymorphisms with brain, head & neck, breast, gastric, pancreatic or prostate cancer have been described. Although preliminary data are available, further well-powered studies are required to fully elucidate the role of NAT1 in most human cancers, and that of NAT2 in astrocytoma, meningioma, esophageal, renal, cervical and testicular cancers, as well as in leukaemia and myeloma. This review discusses controversial findings on cancer risk and putative causes of heterogeneity in the proposed associations, and it identifies topics that require further investigation, particularly mechanisms underlying association of NAT polymorphisms and risk for subsets of cancer patients with specific exposures, putative epistatic contribution of polymorphism for other xenobiotic-metabolising enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases of Cytochrome P450 enzymes, and genetic plus environmental interaction.",,"['Agundez, Jose A G']",['Agundez JA'],"['Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, University of Extremadura, Avda. de Elvas s/n, E-06071, Badajoz, Spain. jagundez@unex.es']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Drug Metab,Current drug metabolism,100960533,['EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)'],IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics/*physiology', 'Risk']",,,2008/08/06 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/08/06 09:00'],"['2008/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138920008784892083 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Drug Metab. 2008 Jul;9(6):520-31. doi: 10.2174/138920008784892083.,,260,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, arachidonoyl lysoPC and docosahexaenoyl lysoPC were found to inhibit potato 5-LOX-catalyzed oxygenation of linoleic acid (LA) in a noncompetitive type with Ki values of 0.38 and 1.90 microM, respectively.

Most studies on the biology of the hematopoietic system in AML have focused on cells from adult patients; much less is known about hematopoietic cells from childhood AML. PROCEDURE: By using a negative immunoselection system, we have obtained a primitive cell population (enriched for CD34(+) Lin(-) cells) from the bone marrow (BM) of 17 pediatric AML patients and characterized its proliferation, expansion, and differentiation potentials in liquid cultures supplemented with a mixture of 8 different recombinant stimulatory cytokines. RESULTS: The proportion of CD34(+) cells in AML patients was extremely heterogeneous, ranging from 0% to 74%. Regardless of their CD34(+) cell content, and in contrast to normal cells, AML cells showed a deficient capacity to proliferate even in the presence of the stimulatory cytokines. AML progenitors were unable to generate new progenitor cells, indicating their inability to expand. Interestingly, AML cells were able to differentiate in culture, giving rise to morphologically recognizable precursors. A major difference, however, as compared to hematopoietic progenitors from normal subjects, was the fact that whereas in cultures of normal cells both myeloid and erythroid precursors were produced, in AML cultures the vast majority of the cells generated corresponded to myeloid cells, mostly mature macrophages.

Seven hips in five patients were revised to total hip arthroplasties (THA) because of pain; three of these showed radiographic loosening of the femoral head resurfacing component. The median time from resurfacing to revision was 2.4 years (range, 0.9-4.8 years). Marginal Cox-regression analysis, adjusting for correlations owing to bilateral involvement, showed positive association of revision-free survival of the prosthesis with patient's age; time from resurfacing to the end of anticancer therapy, end of glucocorticosteroid therapy; percentage of joint space at the last radiograph; and size of the lesion has a negative association with revision-free survival. Because of this study's exploratory nature, p values were not adjusted for the number of statistical comparisons.

Retroviruses interact with target cells through their surface molecules (i.e., envelope proteins) and cellular receptors, which limit the susceptibility of target cells to retroviral vectors. Murine leukemia retrovirus (MuLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) overcomes the species barrier and is more resistant to mechanical and biochemical inactivation. A cell line producing VSV-G pseudotyped MuLV vector can be established by transfecting 293T cells expressing Gag, Pol, and VSV-G (293 GPG cell line) with a retroviral vector plasmid. Transduction potency of the resulting VSV-G pseudotyped MuLV retroviral supernatant can be quantified by titration, electron microscopy (EM), and the reverse transcriptase (RT) assay.

This observation suggested a functional interaction between Hox gene overexpression and E2A-PBX1 in lymphoid tumors. To further explore this possibility, we generated a series of compound E2A-PBX1 x Hox transgenic mice and tested the genetic interaction between these genes in the generation of lymphoid leukemia in vivo. Results presented in this report show that the onset of T-cell leukemia is significantly accelerated in E2A-PBX1 x Hoxb4 compound transgenic animals when compared with control E2A-PBX1 or Hoxb4 littermates. Hoxa9 appears less potent than Hoxb4 to accelerate E2A-PBX1-induced T-cell leukemia in mice. E2A-PBX1-induced T-cell leukemias express much higher levels of Hoxa genes than MMLV-induced counterparts, possibly suggesting a contribution of these genes to T-cell transformation by E2A-PBX1.

RegIIIbeta, also known as Reg2 in rat and HIP/PAP1 in humans, is a member of a family of growth factors found in many areas of the body and previously shown to play an important role in both the development and regeneration of subsets of motor neurons. It has been suggested that RegIIIbeta expressed by motor neurons is both an obligatory intermediate in the downstream signaling of the leukemia inhibitory factor/ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) family of cytokines, maintaining the integrity of motor neurons during development, as well as a powerful influence on Schwann cell growth during regeneration of the peripheral nerve. Here we report that in mice with a deletion of the RegIIIbeta gene, motor neuron survival was unaffected up to 28 weeks after birth. However, there was no CNTF-mediated rescue of neonatal facial motor neurons after axotomy in KO animals when compared with wild-type. In mice, RegIIIbeta positive motor neurons are concentrated in cranial motor nuclei that are involved in the patterning of swallowing and suckling. We found that suckling was impaired in RegIIIbeta KO mice and correlated this with a significant delay in myelination of the hypoglossal nerve. In summary, we propose that RegIIIbeta has an important role to play in the developmental fine-tuning of neonatal motor behaviors mediating the response to peripherally derived cytokines and growth factors and regulating the myelination of motor axons.",,"['Tebar, L A', 'Geranton, S M', 'Parsons-Perez, C', 'Fisher, A S', 'Bayne, R', 'Smith, A J H', 'Turmaine, M', 'Perez-Luz, S', 'Sheasby, A', 'De Felipe, C', 'Ruff, C', 'Raivich, G', 'Hunt, S P']","['Tebar LA', 'Geranton SM', 'Parsons-Perez C', 'Fisher AS', 'Bayne R', 'Smith AJ', 'Turmaine M', 'Perez-Luz S', 'Sheasby A', 'De Felipe C', 'Ruff C', 'Raivich G', 'Hunt SP']","['National Centre for Cancer Research, Melchor Fernandez Almagro, 3.

Immunotoxin BL22 targets CD22 positive malignancies and is composed of an anti-CD22 Fv fused to a 38-kDa fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38). BL22 has produced many complete remissions in drug-resistant Hairy cell leukemia, where many treatment cycles can be given, because neutralizing antibodies do not form. In marked contrast, only minor responses have been observed in trials with immunotoxins targeting solid tumors, because only a single treatment cycle can be given before antibodies develop. To allow more treatment cycles and increase efficacy, we have produced a less immunogenic immunotoxin by identifying and eliminating most of the B cell epitopes on PE38. This was accomplished by mutation of specific large hydrophilic amino acids (Arg, Gln, Glu, Lys) to Ala, Ser, or Gly. The new immunotoxin (HA22-8X) is significantly less immunogenic in three strains of mice, yet retains full cytotoxic and anti-tumor activities.

Co-expression of Tax, but not the Tax mutant unable to bind to CBP, significantly inhibited the reporter gene expression directed by IFN-stimulated regulatory elements, despite that the formation of DNA-binding ISGF3 complex was unaffected. Gene activation induced by STAT2 transcription domain was also inhibited by expression of Tax. Furthermore, Tax-mediated transcriptional inhibition was reversed by overexpression of p300. These observations indicate that Tax interferes with IFN-alpha-induced JAK-STAT pathway by competition with STAT2 for CBP/p300 binding. Consistently, GST pull-down assay showed that Tax dose-dependently inhibited binding of STAT2 to p300.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant species were collected throughout South Africa and voucher specimens were deposited and identified at the South African National Biodiversity Institute. Plant extracts were prepared and screened for in vitro anticancer activity against a panel of three human cell lines (breast MCF7, renal TK10 and melanoma UACC62) at the CSIR. Plant extracts that exhibited anticancer activity against these three human cell lines were screened by the NCI against sixty human cancer cell lines organized into sub-panels representing leukaemia, melanoma, cancer of the lung, colon, kidney, ovary, central nervous system, breast and prostate. RESULTS: A total of 7500 plant extracts were screened for in vitro anticancer activity against breast MCF7, renal TK10 and melanoma UACC62 human cell lines between the period 1999 and 2006. Hits were classified into four categories based on their total growth inhibition of the cell lines. A hit rate of 5.9% was obtained for extracts which showed moderate activity and these were screened by the NCI against a panel of sixty human cancer cell lines. The extracts of plant species with limited published information for their anticancer properties were subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation and the active constituents isolated and identified. The largest number of plant specimens in this study was from the family Asteraceae, which is rich in sesquiterpene lactones. CONCLUSIONS: Although the extracts of the plants were randomly selected, 68% of these plant species which were hits in the screening programme are reported to be used medicinally. Based on our data, it appears that unrelated medicinal use of the source plants may serve as an initial guide to selection of plants for anticancer screening.",,"['Fouche, G', 'Cragg, G M', 'Pillay, P', 'Kolesnikova, N', 'Maharaj, V J', 'Senabe, J']","['Fouche G', 'Cragg GM', 'Pillay P', 'Kolesnikova N', 'Maharaj VJ', 'Senabe J']","['Biosciences, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, PO Box 395, Pretoria, Gauteng 0001, South Africa. gfouche@csir.co.za']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Solvents)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Plants, Medicinal/*chemistry', 'Solvents', 'South Africa']",,,2008/08/06 09:00,2009/01/24 09:00,['2008/08/06 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-8741(08)00359-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2008.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2008 Oct 28;119(3):455-61. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2008.07.005.

The main aim of the current study is to identify particular cytokine/chemokine patterns of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, and, on a longer term, to correlate them with the patient outcome and response to therapy. Therefore, the influence of BMSCs on in vitro modulation of cytokine secretion (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-2) by AML cells as well as the AML cells supportive capacity of BMSCs-derived soluble factors was investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: With this purpose, we used an in vitro experimental model consisting in the evaluation of the effect of BMSC confluent layers-conditioning medium (BMSC-CM) on M4/5 AML cell cultures. RESULTS: Our results show that BMSC-CM from both AML patients and healthy subjects conferred a substantial beneficial effect on AML cells throughout the culture (p=0.0002 and 0.0020 respectively at 24 hours and p=0,0013 and 0,0030 respectively at 72 hours), with a temporary increase in AML cell viability conferred by BM plasma from AML patients. Significant differences were observed with respect to IL1 b secretion which was upregulated in AML cell cultures both after 24 and 72 hours following the addition of AML-BMSC-CM, in contrast to control-BMSC-CM.

Here, we report the discovery and characterization of sialate-O-acetyltransferase enzyme in ALL-cell lines and lymphoblasts from bone marrow of children diagnosed with B- and T-ALL. We observed a positive correlation between the enhanced sialate-O-acetyltransferase activity and the enhanced expression of Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs in these lymphoblasts. Sialate-O-acetyltransferase activity in cell lysates or microsomal fractions of lymphoblasts of patients was always higher than that in healthy donors reaching up to 22-fold in microsomes. Additionally, the V (max) of this enzymatic reaction with AcCoA was over threefold higher in microsomal fractions of lymphoblasts. The enzyme bound to the microsomal fractions showed high activity with CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid, ganglioside GD3 and endogenous sialic acid as substrates. N-acetyl-7-O-acetylneuraminic acid was the main reaction product, as detected by radio-thin-layer chromatography and fluorimetrically coupled radio-high-performance liquid chromatography. CMP and coenzyme A inhibited the microsomal enzyme. Sialate-O-acetyltransferase activity increased at the diagnosis of leukaemia, decreased with clinical remission and sharply increased again in relapsed patients as determined by radiometric-assay. A newly-developed non-radioactive ELISA can quickly detect sialate-O-acetyltransferase, and thus, may become a suitable tool for ALL-monitoring in larger scale. This is the first report on sialate-O-acetyltransferase in ALL being one of the few descriptions of an enzyme of this type in human.",,"['Mandal, Chandan', 'Srinivasan, G Vinayaga', 'Chowdhury, Suchandra', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Mandal, Chhabinath', 'Schauer, Roland', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Mandal C', 'Srinivasan GV', 'Chowdhury S', 'Chandra S', 'Mandal C', 'Schauer R', 'Mandal C']","['Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

The lack of efficacy of conventional therapy has stimulated interest in developing novel strategies. Recent studies have shown that 11q23-positive acute leukemia cells express the high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA). This tumor antigen represents a useful target to control growth of human melanoma tumors in patients and in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, utilizing antibody-based immunotherapy. This effect appears to be mediated by inhibition of the HMW-MAA function such as triggering of the focal adhesion kinase/proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) pathways. Therefore, in this study we tested whether HMW-MAA-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) could inhibit growth of 11q23-positive leukemia cells in SCID mice. METHODS: HMW-MAA-specific mAb were tested for their ability to inhibit the in vitro proliferation of an 11q23-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line and blasts from four patients with 11q23 aberrations and their in vivo growth in subcutaneous and disseminated xenograft models. RESULTS: The HMW-MAA-specific mAb did not affect in vitro proliferation although they down-regulated phosphorylated (P) Pyk2 expression. Furthermore, the mAb enhanced the in vitro anti-proliferative effect of cytarabine. In vivo the mAb inhibited the growth of leukemic cells in a dose-dependent fashion. However, the difference did not reach statistical significance. No effect was detected on P-Pyk2 expression. Furthermore, HMW-MAA-specific mAb in combination with cytarabine did not improve tumor inhibition. Lastly, the combination of two mAb which recognize distinct HMW-MAA determinants had no detectable effect on survival in a disseminated xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: HMW-MAA-specific mAb down-regulated P-Pyk2 expression and enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of cytarabine in vitro, but had no detectable effect on survival or growth of leukemia cells in vivo. Whether the HMW-MAA-specific mAb can be used as carriers of toxins or chemotherapeutic agents against 11q23-acute leukemia remains to be determined.",,"['Drake, Allison S', 'Brady, Michael T', 'Wang, Xin Hui', 'Sait, Sheila J N', 'Earp, Justin C', 'Ghoshal Gupta, Sampa', 'Ferrone, Soldano', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Wetzler, Meir']","['Drake AS', 'Brady MT', 'Wang XH', 'Sait SJ', 'Earp JC', 'Ghoshal Gupta S', 'Ferrone S', 'Wang ES', 'Wetzler M']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA105500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM57980/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138188-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM057980/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105500-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 105500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HMW-MAA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Melanoma/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",PMC2741306,['NIHMS129780'],2008/08/05 09:00,2009/01/29 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2007/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-008-0567-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2009 Mar;58(3):415-27. doi: 10.1007/s00262-008-0567-5.

Gain-of-function NOTCH1 alleles that initiate strong downstream signals induce leukemia in mice, but it is unknown whether the gain-of-function NOTCH1 mutations most commonly found in individuals with T-ALL generate downstream signals of sufficient strength to induce leukemia. We addressed this question by expressing human gain-of-function NOTCH1 alleles of varying strength in mouse hematopoietic precursors. Uncommon gain-of-function NOTCH1 alleles that initiated strong downstream signals drove ectopic T cell development and induced leukemia efficiently. In contrast, although gain-of-function alleles that initiated only weak downstream signals also induced ectopic T cell development, these more common alleles failed to efficiently initiate leukemia development. However, weak gain-of-function NOTCH1 alleles accelerated the onset of leukemia initiated by constitutively active K-ras and gave rise to tumors that were sensitive to Notch signaling pathway inhibition. These data show that induction of leukemia requires doses of Notch1 greater than those needed for T cell development and that most NOTCH1 mutations found in T-ALL cells do not generate signals of sufficient strength to initiate leukemia development. Furthermore, low, nonleukemogenic levels of Notch1 can complement other leukemogenic events, such as activation of K-ras.

Whereas HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells display sustained cell cycle arrest, BV173 leukemia cells undergo rapid apoptosis and other cell lines show an intermediate response. We found that the expression of the p53 target genes p21, 14-3-3sigma and the microRNA miR-34a correlates tightly with the cell fate choice adopted. All three genes were strongly induced in arresting cells, but silenced in cells undergoing Nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. In contrast, key apoptotic p53 target genes were equally expressed in arresting and apoptotic cells. Interestingly, we establish that miR-34a cooperates with p21 and 14-3-3sigma to override the apoptotic signals generated by p53 activation. Strikingly, p53 binding to chromatin and p53-mediated recruitment of certain coactivators to all three target loci does not vary among cell types. Instead, the cell type-specific silencing of these genes is due to enhanced p21 mRNA degradation, 14-3-3sigma promoter DNA methylation and reduced processing of the miR-34a primary transcript.

The Wilms' tumor antigen (WT1) is overexpressed in several human leukemias and thus considered as promising target for development of leukemia vaccine. However, recent studies indicated that the generation of effective WT1-specific cytotoxic T cells can be largely affected by the presence of T(regs). We have generated T-cell lines and clones that specifically recognized a WT1-84 (RYFKLSHLQMHSRKH) peptide in an HLA-DRB1*0402-restricted manner. Importantly, they recognized HLA-DRB1*04-matched fresh leukemic cells expressing the WT1 antigen. These clones exerted a T helper 2 cytokine profile, had a CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)GITR(+)CD127(-) T(reg) phenotype, and significantly inhibited the proliferative activity of allogeneic T cells independently of cell contact. Priming of alloreactive T cells in the presence of T(regs) strongly inhibited the expansion of natural killer (NK), NK T, and CD8(+) T cells and had an inhibitory effect on NK/NK T cytotoxic activity but not on CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, priming of T cells with the WT1-126 HLA-A0201-restricted peptide in the presence of T(regs) strongly inhibited the induction of anti-WT1-126 CD8(+) CTL responses as evidenced by both very low cytotoxic activity and IFN-gamma production. Moreover, these T(reg) clones specifically produced granzyme B and selectively induced apoptosis in WT1-84-pulsed autologous antigen-presenting cells but not in apoptotic-resistant DR4-matched leukemic cells. Importantly, we have also detected anti-WT1-84 interleukin-5(+)/granzyme B(+)/Foxp3(+) CD4(+) T(regs) in five of eight HLA-DR4(+) acute myeloid leukemia patients.

We previously described the induction of caspase-independent mithochondrial death in leukemia cells by Bobel-24 (AM-24) and derivatives. Here, we explored whether these compounds induce a similar cytotoxicity in human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (NP18, NP9, NP31, and NP29). Bobel-24 or Bobel-16 induced cytotoxicity and DNA synthesis inhibition in all cell lines and apoptosis in all lines, except for NP9. Caspase and/or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activity inhibition experiments showed that cytotoxicity was mainly induced through apoptosis in NP18 and through a caspase-independent process in NP9. Moreover, in NP29 or NP31 cell lines, both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death mechanisms coexisted. Cell death was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release, AIF nuclear translocation, and lysosomal cathepsin release. Inhibition of ROS production, mitochondrial pore permeability, PARP-1, or phospholipase A2 partially prevented cell death. Moreover, cathepsin B inhibition or down-regulation by small interfering RNA partially blocked cell death. In conclusion, Bobel-24 and derivatives trigger caspase-independent lysosomal and mitochondrial death in all tested human pancreatic cancer lines, irrespective of their degree of apoptotic sensitivity, becoming the only active cytotoxic mechanism in the apoptosis-resistant NP9 line.

The three PHD finger cassette, one of the highly conserved domains in MLL, is absent in all fusion proteins. This domain has been shown to interact with Cyp33, a cyclophilin which enhances the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDAC) to the MLL repression domain and mediates HOX gene repression. Insertion of the third PHD finger of MLL into MLL-ENL allows the recruitment of Cyp33 and, subsequently, HDAC1 to the fusion protein. Furthermore, expression of the fusion protein with the PHD finger insertion mediates the down-regulation of the HOXC8 gene expression in a Cyp33-dependent manner. Finally, the addition of the PHD finger domain or the third PHD finger alone into MLL-ENL blocks the hematopoietic stem cell immortalization potential of the fusion protein in serial plating colony assays. Insertion of only the first and second PHD fingers has no such effect. These data support the hypothesis that the binding of Cyp33 to the MLL third PHD finger switches the MLL function from transactivation to repression. In the immortalizing MLL fusion protein, the loss of the PHD fingers, in combination with the gain of the activation domain of ENL or of other partner proteins, makes the fusion protein a constitutive transactivator. This leads to constitutive overexpression of MLL target genes that block stem cell commitment and promote stem cell renewal, probably the first step in MLL-related leukemogenesis.",,"['Chen, Jing', 'Santillan, Donna A', 'Koonce, Mark', 'Wei, Wei', 'Luo, Roger', 'Thirman, Michael J', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J', 'Diaz, Manuel O']","['Chen J', 'Santillan DA', 'Koonce M', 'Wei W', 'Luo R', 'Thirman MJ', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ', 'Diaz MO']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University of Chicago Medical Center, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA040046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA105049-020003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA105049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA105049-01A29001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA040046-16A10004/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL087188/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HOXC8 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilins)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (PPIE protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclophilins/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC2734520,['NIHMS121692'],2008/08/05 09:00,2008/09/09 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/15/6199 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6514 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Aug 1;68(15):6199-207. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6514.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, Pin1 is involved in many cellular events, such as cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and differentiation through isomerizing prophosphorylated substrates. It has been reported that down-regulation of Pin1 induces apoptosis, and that Erk phosphorylates and up-regulates Mcl-1; however, the underlying mechanisms for the two phenomena are not clear yet. Here, we showed that Pin 1 stabilizes Mcl-1, which is required for Mcl-1 posphorylation by Erk. First, we found expression of Mcl-1 and Pin1 were positively correlated and associated with poor survival in human breast cancer. We then showed that Erk could phosphorylate Mcl-1 at two consensus residues, Thr 92 and 163, which is required for the association of Mcl-1 and Pin1, resulting in stabilization of Mcl-1. Moreover, Pin1 is also required for the up-regulation of Mcl-1 by Erk activation. Based on this newly identified mechanism of Mcl-1 stabilization, two strategies were used to overcome Mcl-1-mediated chemoresistance: inhibiting Erk by Sorafenib, an approved clinical anticancer drug, or knocking down Pin1 by using a SiRNA technique. In conclusion, the current report not only unravels a novel mechanism to link Erk/Pin1 pathway and Mcl-1-mediated chemoresistance but also provides a plausible combination therapy, Taxol (Paclitaxel) plus Sorafenib, which was shown to be effective in killing breast cancer cells.",,"['Ding, Qingqing', 'Huo, Longfei', 'Yang, Jer-Yen', 'Xia, Weiya', 'Wei, Yongkun', 'Liao, Yong', 'Chang, Chun-Ju', 'Yang, Yan', 'Lai, Chien-Chen', 'Lee, Dung-Fang', 'Yen, Chia-Jui', 'Chen, Yun-Ju Rita', 'Hsu, Jung-Mao', 'Kuo, Hsu-Ping', 'Lin, Chun-Yi', 'Tsai, Fuu-Jen', 'Li, Long-Yuan', 'Tsai, Chang-Hai', 'Hung, Mien-Chie']","['Ding Q', 'Huo L', 'Yang JY', 'Xia W', 'Wei Y', 'Liao Y', 'Chang CJ', 'Yang Y', 'Lai CC', 'Lee DF', 'Yen CJ', 'Chen YJ', 'Hsu JM', 'Kuo HP', 'Lin CY', 'Tsai FJ', 'Li LY', 'Tsai CH', 'Hung MC']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA116199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA099031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA116199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 CA101936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA099031-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA099031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 CA101936-010001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109311-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109311/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA083639-050003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA109311/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Down-Regulation', 'Humans', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/*metabolism', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib']",PMC2676572,['NIHMS76170'],2008/08/05 09:00,2008/09/09 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/15/6109 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0579 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Aug 1;68(15):6109-17. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0579.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, we found that methadone is also a potent inducer of cell death in leukemia cells and we clarified the unknown mechanism of methadone-induced cell killing in leukemia cells. Methadone inhibited proliferation in leukemia cells and induced cell death through apoptosis induction and activated apoptosis pathways through the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, down-regulation of Bcl-x(L) and X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. In addition, methadone induced cell death not only in anticancer drug-sensitive and apoptosis-sensitive leukemia cells but also in doxorubicin-resistant, multidrug-resistant, and apoptosis-resistant leukemia cells, which anticancer drugs commonly used in conventional therapies of leukemias failed to kill. Depending on caspase activation, methadone overcomes doxorubicin resistance, multidrug resistance, and apoptosis resistance in leukemia cells through activation of mitochondria. In contrast to leukemia cells, nonleukemic peripheral blood lymphocytes survived after methadone treatment. These findings show that methadone kills leukemia cells and breaks chemoresistance and apoptosis resistance. Our results suggest that methadone is a promising therapeutic approach not only for patients with opioid dependence but also for patients with leukemias and provide the foundation for new strategies using methadone as an additional anticancer drug in leukemia therapy, especially when conventional therapies are less effective.",,"['Friesen, Claudia', 'Roscher, Mareike', 'Alt, Andreas', 'Miltner, Erich']","['Friesen C', 'Roscher M', 'Alt A', 'Miltner E']","['Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. claudia.friesen@uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'UC6VBE7V1Z (Methadone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Methadone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Opioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy']",,,2008/08/05 09:00,2008/09/09 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/15/6059 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1227 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Aug 1;68(15):6059-64. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1227.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that a highly conserved 17-bp DNA cis-acting sequence element located upstream of the myogenin promoter (myogHCE) is essential for postnatal repression of myogenin in transgenic animals. We present multiple lines of evidence supporting the idea that repression is mediated by the Y-box protein MSY-3. Electroporation in vivo shows that myogHCE and MSY-3 are required for postnatal repression. We further show that, in the C2C12 cell culture system, ectopic MSY-3 can repress differentiation, while reduced MSY-3 promotes premature differentiation. MSY-3 binds myogHCE simultaneously with the homeodomain protein Pbx in postnatal innervated muscle. We therefore propose a model in which the myogHCE motif operates as a switch by specifying opposing functions; one that was shown previously is regulated by MyoD and Pbx and it specifies a chromatin opening, gene-activating function at the time myoblasts begin to differentiate; the other includes MYS-3 and Pbx, and it specifies a repression function that operates during and after postnatal muscle maturation in vivo and in myoblasts before they begin to differentiate.",,"['Berghella, Libera', 'De Angelis, Luciana', 'De Buysscher, Tristan', 'Mortazavi, Ali', 'Biressi, Stefano', 'Forcales, Sonia V', 'Sirabella, Dario', 'Cossu, Giulio', 'Wold, Barbara J']","['Berghella L', 'De Angelis L', 'De Buysscher T', 'Mortazavi A', 'Biressi S', 'Forcales SV', 'Sirabella D', 'Cossu G', 'Wold BJ']","['Institute of Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, San Raffaele Biomedical Science Park, Rome 00128, Italy. libera.berghella@spr-r.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MyoD Protein)', '0 (Myogenin)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Y box protein 3, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Electroporation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*growth & development', 'MyoD Protein/genetics/physiology', 'Myoblasts/physiology', 'Myogenin/*genetics/physiology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC2492748,,2008/08/05 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['22/15/2125 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.468508 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2008 Aug 1;22(15):2125-38. doi: 10.1101/gad.468508.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Female A/J mice were given two weekly i.p. injections of 4-(methylnitrosaminao)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (150 mg/kg total dose); 1 week later, mice were treated with PPE (0.25% or 0.5% in drinking fluid), atorvastatin (200 or 400 ppm in diet), or PPE (0.25%) plus atorvastatin (200 ppm) for 16 weeks. The interaction of these two agents was also studied in human lung cancer H1299 and H460 cells. RESULTS: The individual agents, PPE or atorvastatin, were not effective in inhibiting lung tumorigenesis. The low-dose combination of PPE and atorvastatin, however, significantly reduced both the tumor multiplicity and tumor burden (by 56% and 55%, respectively, P < 0.05). Isobologram analysis of the interaction of the two agents indicated that the combination synergistically decreased tumor multiplicity (P = 0.0006) and tumor burden (P = 0.0009). The inhibition was associated with enhanced apoptosis and suppressed myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) level in adenoma as determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blots. Treatment with combinations of PPE and atorvastatin also synergistically decreased the number of viable H1299 and H460 cells as determined by isobologram analysis. This synergistic effect was associated with increased apoptosis as determined by the terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling assay. The combination of PPE and atorvastatin was more efficient in reducing the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 level and increasing the cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase level than the single-agent treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present work showed that PPE and atorvastatin synergistically inhibited 4-(methylnitrosaminao)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone-induced lung tumorigenesis in mice and the growth of lung cancer H1299 and H460 cells, possibly through enhanced apoptosis.

In this study, we attempted to further reveal the association between HPV infection with Mcl-1 and interleukin (IL)-6 expressions and to elucidate the roles of HPV infection in lung tumorigenesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: IL-6 and Mcl-1 expressions were investigated in 79 tumor tissues from lung cancer patients by immunohistochemistry. Secreting IL-6 levels and Mcl-1 expressions were examined by ELISA and Western blot, respectively, in HPV 16/18 E6- and E7-transfected A549 human lung cancer cells, as well as in the HPV16-infected TL-1 lung cancer cells established from lung cancer patients. RESULTS: Lung tumors (70.9% and 57.0%) had positive IL-6 and Mcl-1 immunostainings, respectively. Significant correlation between IL-6 and Mcl-1 expression were observed (P < 0.0001). Both IL-6 and Mcl-1 expression were significantly associated with HPV 16/18 infection (P = 0.014 and P = 0.004, respectively). IL-6 and Mcl-1 protein levels were not only elevated in HPV 16/18 E6- and E7-transfected A549 cells but also in TL-1 cells. Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway was the major pathway contributing to the up-regulation of Mcl-1 by IL-6 in HPV-infected lung cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: The up-regulating effects of HPV 16/18 E6 and E7 to IL-6 and Mcl-1 expressions were observed in E6- and E7-transfected A549 cells and in HPV16-infected TL-1 cells, mainly through the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway. The involvement of HPV infection in lung tumorigenesis may be partly through a concomitant increased expression of autocrine and/or paracrine IL-6 and the downstream Mcl-1.",,"['Cheng, Ya-Wen', 'Lee, Huei', 'Shiau, Ming-Yuh', 'Wu, Tzu-Chin', 'Huang, Tsung-Teng', 'Chang, Yih-Hsin']","['Cheng YW', 'Lee H', 'Shiau MY', 'Wu TC', 'Huang TT', 'Chang YH']","['Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human papillomavirus 16/*metabolism', 'Human papillomavirus 18/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis']",,,2008/08/05 09:00,2008/09/09 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/15/4705 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4675 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Aug 1;14(15):4705-12. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4675.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a video-game intervention for improving adherence and other behavioral outcomes for adolescents and young adults with malignancies including acute leukemia, lymphoma, and soft-tissue sarcoma. METHODS: A randomized trial with baseline and 1- and 3-month assessments was conducted from 2004 to 2005 at 34 medical centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia. A total of 375 male and female patients who were 13 to 29 years old, had an initial or relapse diagnosis of a malignancy, and currently undergoing treatment and expected to continue treatment for at least 4 months from baseline assessment were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention was a video game that addressed issues of cancer treatment and care for teenagers and young adults. Outcome measures included adherence, self-efficacy, knowledge, control, stress, and quality of life. For patients who were prescribed prophylactic antibiotics, adherence to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was tracked by electronic pill-monitoring devices (n = 200). Adherence to 6-mercaptopurine was assessed through serum metabolite assays (n = 54). RESULTS: Adherence to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 6-mercaptopurine was greater in the intervention group. Self-efficacy and knowledge also increased in the intervention group compared with the control group. The intervention did not affect self-report measures of adherence, stress, control, or quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The video-game intervention significantly improved treatment adherence and indicators of cancer-related self-efficacy and knowledge in adolescents and young adults who were undergoing cancer therapy. The findings support current efforts to develop effective video-game interventions for education and training in health care.",,"['Kato, Pamela M', 'Cole, Steve W', 'Bradlyn, Andrew S', 'Pollock, Brad H']","['Kato PM', 'Cole SW', 'Bradlyn AS', 'Pollock BH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford Hospital, Stanford, California, USA. pkato@umcutrecht.nl']",['eng'],"['CA054174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*psychology/therapy', 'Patient Compliance/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Patient Education as Topic/*methods', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Probability', 'Quality of Life', 'Reference Values', 'Self Efficacy', '*Video Games']",,,2008/08/05 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['122/2/e305 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2007-3134 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2008 Aug;122(2):e305-17. doi: 10.1542/peds.2007-3134.,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00425139'],,,,,,,

In countries without official cancer registries, such as Greece, ad hoc nationwide registration of incident childhood leukaemias and lymphomas could help elucidate the underlying aetiology and monitor socioeconomic differentials in health care delivery. METHODS: We registered all cases and produced age, gender, type and immunophenotype specific figures and overall crude and age adjusted annual incidence rates and secular trends for 863 leukaemia and 311 lymphoma incident cases diagnosed in children <15 years of age across Greece during 1996-2006, namely the first 11 years of the Nationwide Registry for Childhood Hematological Malignancies. RESULTS: The epidemiological profiles of leukaemias/lymphomas in Greece are similar to those in industrialised countries. No secular trends are observed for either malignancy during the studied period. However, the calculated incidence for leukaemia (46.60 cases per 1 million children annually) is among the highest in the EU-27 (19% higher than average; p<0.001), whereas that for lymphoma (16.8 cases per 1 million children annually) is around the EU-27 average. CONCLUSIONS: Minimal secular changes in childhood leukaemias/lymphomas have been noted recently in the EU-27, which cannot be easily explained in countries with small populations. Therefore, centralised EU databases such as the Automated Childhood Cancer Information System (ACCIS) should be enlarged to generate sufficient statistical power for monitoring time trends. It would be interesting to explore whether different lifestyle patterns across the EU might be responsible for the observed excess leukaemia incidence in countries such as Greece.",,"['Petridou, E T', 'Pourtsidis, A', 'Dessypris, N', 'Katsiardanis, K', 'Baka, M', 'Moschovi, M', 'Polychronopoulou, S', 'Koliouskas, D', 'Sidi, V', 'Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou, F', 'Kalmanti, M', 'Belechri, M', 'La Vecchia, C', 'Curado, M P', 'Skalkidis, I']","['Petridou ET', 'Pourtsidis A', 'Dessypris N', 'Katsiardanis K', 'Baka M', 'Moschovi M', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Koliouskas D', 'Sidi V', 'Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou F', 'Kalmanti M', 'Belechri M', 'La Vecchia C', 'Curado MP', 'Skalkidis I']","['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Athens University Medical School, 75 Mikras Asias Str, Athens 115 27, Greece. epetrid@med.uoa.gr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Greece/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors']",,,2008/08/05 09:00,2009/01/06 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['adc.2007.133249 [pii]', '10.1136/adc.2007.133249 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2008 Dec;93(12):1027-32. doi: 10.1136/adc.2007.133249.

We have also observed that the reduction of transition at 95+/-3 degrees C in thermal scans of nuclear preparations isolated from blood of B-CLL randomized patients who showed response to cladribine or fludarabine combined with cyclophosphamide, i.e., CC and FC, respectively, corresponded with the decrease or disappearance of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and/or Mcl 1. In conclusion, these in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that quick DSC technique, usually supplemented by other methods, is a potent tool to distinguish efficacy of B-CLL treatment and could be helpful in choosing the most effective manner of treatment for this type of leukemia.",,"['Rogalinska, Malgorzata', 'Goralski, Pawel', 'Wozniak, Katarzyna', 'Bednarek, Jolanta D', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Piekarski, Henryk', 'Hanausek, Margaret', 'Walaszek, Zbigniew', 'Kilianska, Zofia M']","['Rogalinska M', 'Goralski P', 'Wozniak K', 'Bednarek JD', 'Blonski JZ', 'Robak T', 'Piekarski H', 'Hanausek M', 'Walaszek Z', 'Kilianska ZM']","['Department of Cytobiochemistry, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning/*methods', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cladribine/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phase Transition', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/deficiency', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,,2008/08/05 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00325-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.06.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Feb;33(2):308-14. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.06.032.

In the present study, we investigated whether inhibition of 2-AG hydrolysis reduced its uptake, i.e. whether this compound behaves in a manner analogous to the related endocannabinoid anandamide. The selective fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor URB597 (3'-(aminocarbamoyl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)-cyclohexylcarbamate) completely blocked the hydrolysis of anandamide and reduced its uptake by about half in RBL2H3 basophilic leukaemia cells. In contrast, in these cells, in PC3 and R3327AT-1 prostate cancer cells and in Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, the compound had more modest effects upon the hydrolysis of 2-AG and did not affect its cellular uptake at all, indicating that in these cells fatty acid amide hydrolase does not regulate the uptake of 2-AG. The serine hydrolase inhibitor methylarachidonoyl fluoronophosphonate behaved like URB597 with respect to anandamide uptake by RBL2H3 and Neuro-2a cells, and inhibited the hydrolysis of 2-AG with IC50 values of 0.014, 0.052, 0.41 and approximately 1 microM for RBL2H3, PC3, AT-1 and Neuro-2a cells, respectively. MAFP (1 microM) did not significantly reduce the uptake of 2-AG by RBL2H3, PC3 and AT-1 cells but did reduce the uptake of this endocannabinoid by Neuro-2a cells. Arachidonoyl trifluoromethyl ketone and URB602 ([1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl-carbamic acid, cyclohexyl ester) reduced the uptake of 2-AG by both RBL2H3 and Neuro-2a cells, but at the high concentrations needed, the compound also blocked the retention of these ligands by wells. It is concluded that unlike the situation for anandamide, hydrolysis of 2-AG does not regulate its cellular uptake in RBL2H3, AT-1 and PC3 cells, but may gate the uptake in Neuro-2a cells.",,"['Fowler, Christopher J', 'Ghafouri, Nazdar']","['Fowler CJ', 'Ghafouri N']","['Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University, SE901 87 Umea, Sweden. cf@pharm.umu.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (URB602)', ""0 (cyclohexyl carbamic acid 3'-carbamoylbiphenyl-3-yl ester)"", '8D239QDW64 (glyceryl 2-arachidonate)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators/*metabolism', 'Carbamates/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Glycerides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides/metabolism']",,,2008/08/05 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-6618(08)00128-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.phrs.2008.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 2008 Jul;58(1):72-6. doi: 10.1016/j.phrs.2008.07.002.

Animal models and analysis of human Ikaros in leukemic cells demonstrate deregulation of Ikaros expression. Short isoforms with a truncated DNA-binding domain suppress functions of Ikaros in a dominant-negative manner. Previous studies demonstrated that human leukemias are heterogeneous for Ikaros expression. We estimate the relative level of Ikaros mRNA transcripts in 80 childhood ALL cases in comparison with AML and healthy donor groups. We detected eight major isoforms and several minor mutant isoforms in most patients with acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia and in healthy donors, but the relative level of expression varied. The relatively high level of Ik4A isoform, rarely mentioned in previous reports, was detected in all analyzed groups. The ratio between functional and all isoforms was used to determine functional activity of Ikaros. The ratio was significantly less in AML (p=0.027) and BCR-ABL positive ALL (p=0.0028) than in healthy bone marrow. We found a negative association between the Ikaros ratio and myeloid coexpression in B-cell ALL, the most prominent was for CD15. The Ikaros ratio positively correlates with CD5 and negatively with CD7 expression in T-ALL.

However, up to one half of patients relapse and do not make it to transplant during the time required for the donor search, completion of donor HLA typing, bone marrow harvest, and shipment. Donor-versus-recipient NK cell alloreactivity is effected by a functional repertoire of NK cells which express inhibitory Killer-Cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor(s) (KIR) for self class I ligand(s), sense missing expression of donor KIR ligand(s) in the recipient and mediate alloreactions. It improves outcomes of HLA haplotype-mismatched ('haploidentical') transplants by controlling acute myeloid leukemia relapse without causing graft-versus-host disease.

It shows a remarkable heterogeneity, with some patients having an almost normal lifespan, others surviving only several years after diagnosis despite intensive therapy. To explore the prognostic significance of CD38 expression in Chinese patients with CLL, multi-parameter flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of CD38 on CD5(+)CD19(+) cells of 147 patients. CD38 expression and its association with some other prognostic factors such as Binet stage, lymphocyte count in peripheral blood, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG), ZAP-70 expression and cytogenetic abnormalities were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival curves, and results were compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to assess associations between survival time and potential risk factors. Out of the 147 CLL patients, positive expression of CD38 was found in 45 (30.6%) cases. CD38-positivity identified a subgroup of CLL patients with aggressive disease of Binet stage at the time of the test (P=0.036). Furthermore, the presence of higher serum LDH and beta2-MG levels at diagnosis was strongly correlated with CD38-positive (P=0.016 and 0.025, respectively). Prognostically unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities, including 17p13 and 11q22 deletions, were significantly more frequent in CD38-positive patients than in CD38-negative ones (P=0.047 and 0.001, respectively). There was no significant difference between CD38-positive and CD38-negative groups in molecular cytogenetic aberrations of del(6q23), del(13q14), 14q32 translocation, or trisomy 12. In addition, in CD38-positive patients, the percentage of leukemic cells expressing ZAP-70 protein was not significantly higher than in CD38-negative ones (P=0.120). CD38 expression was associated with poor outcome. Patients with positive expression of CD38 had significantly shorter overall survival (mean, 81 months) than patients without CD38 expression (mean, 179 months) (P=0.015). Univariate analysis showed that serum levels of LDH and beta2-MG, del(17p13) and CD38 expression were the significant factors in determining overall survival (OS). Del(17p13) and CD38 expression were the variables strongly associated with OS by multivariate Cox regression analysis.

Transient expression of pig7 in leukemic cells exhibited no evident effect on cell proliferation and differentiation, but could intensify inhibitory efficacy of etoposide (VP16) and daunorubicin (DNR). Conclusively, the present study provides the evidence that pig7 is a silenced gene affected by perturbed differentiation in acute leukemia and restoration of pig7 expression sensitizes leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic agents.",,"['Wang, Donghai', 'Liu, Jiazhuo', 'Tang, Kejing', 'Xu, Zhifang', 'Xiong, Xiujuan', 'Rao, Qing', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Wang D', 'Liu J', 'Tang K', 'Xu Z', 'Xiong X', 'Rao Q', 'Wang M', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300020, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (LITAF protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology']",,,2008/08/05 09:00,2009/01/03 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00307-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.06.034 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Jan;33(1):28-38. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.06.034.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substantially more people are exposed to formaldehyde environmentally, as it is generated by automobile engines, is a component of tobacco smoke and is released from household products, including furniture, particleboard, plywood, and carpeting. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) recently classified formaldehyde as a human carcinogen that causes nasopharyngeal cancer and also concluded that there is ""strong but not sufficient evidence for a causal association between leukemia and occupational exposure to formaldehyde"". Here, we review the epidemiological studies published to date on formaldehyde-exposed workers and professionals in relation to lymphohematopoietic malignances. In a new meta-analysis of these studies, focusing on occupations known to have high formaldehyde exposure, we show that summary relative risks (RRs) were elevated in 15 studies of leukemia (RR=1.54; confidence interval (CI), 1.18-2.00) with the highest relative risks seen in the six studies of myeloid leukemia (RR=1.90; 95% CI, 1.31-2.76). The biological plausibility of this observed association is discussed and potential mechanisms proposed. We hypothesize that formaldehyde may act on bone marrow directly or, alternatively, may cause leukemia by damaging the hematopoietic stem or early progenitor cells that are located in the circulating blood or nasal passages, which then travel to the bone marrow and become leukemic stem cells. To test these hypotheses, we recommend that future studies apply biomarkers validated for other chemical leukemogens to the study of formaldehyde.",,"['Zhang, Luoping', 'Steinmaus, Craig', 'Eastmond, David A', 'Xin, Xianjun K', 'Smith, Martyn T']","['Zhang L', 'Steinmaus C', 'Eastmond DA', 'Xin XK', 'Smith MT']","['School of Public Health, 50 University Hall, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-7356, USA.

The normality of spontaneous GH secretion was attributed to a compensatory increase in hypothalamic stimulatory input within a partially damaged hypothalamic-pituitary (h-p) axis. It is unknown, however, if such compensatory stimulation can also maintain normality of GH secretion in those who fail the ITT but pass the GHRH + AST. STUDY SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: We studied 24-h spontaneous GH secretion by 20-min sampling both in the fed state (n = 11) and in the last 24 h of a 33-h fast (n = 9) in adult cancer survivors with subnormal peak GH responses to the ITT but either normal or relatively less attenuated peak GH responses to the GHRH + AST. The study was conducted 8.3 +/- 1.8 (range 2-23) years after cranial irradiation for nonpituitary brain tumours (n = 9) or leukaemia/lymphoma (n = 2) in comparison with 30 normal controls (fasting, 14). RESULTS: Previously published diagnostic thresholds for the ITT, GHRH + AST and spontaneous GH secretion were used to characterize GH secretion. Four of the 11 patients with impaired stimulated responses to both tests showed only minor discordancies between stimulated and spontaneous GH secretion. Two of the remaining seven patients had subnormal spontaneous GH secretion. However, spontaneous GH secretion, both individually and as a group, was entirely normal in the remaining five patients who had impaired GH responses to the ITT but normal individual responses to the GHRH + AST; in these five patients, IGF-I standard deviation scores (SDS; -2.7 to -0.8) were significantly reduced to a moderate degree compared with normals. CONCLUSIONS: In cranially irradiated adult cancer survivors, it cannot be assumed that failure to pass the ITT in isolation reflects severe GH deficiency (GHD). It appears that in some patients near-maximal compensatory overdrive of the partially damaged somatotroph axis may result in near-normal quantitative restoration of spontaneous GH secretion, thus limiting further stimulation with the ITT to the extent that impaired GH responses can be seen even before spontaneous GH secretion starts to decline in adults. However, IGF-I status continues to provide useful information about the adequacy of the compensatory process and therefore the degree of normality of GH secretion.",,"['Darzy, Ken H', 'Thorner, Michael O', 'Shalet, Stephen M']","['Darzy KH', 'Thorner MO', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK32632/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00847/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,"['0 (Insulin)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9034-39-3 (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arginine/pharmacology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Human Growth Hormone/*deficiency/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/physiology/radiation effects', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",,,2008/08/05 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEN3359 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2265.2008.03359.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2009 Feb;70(2):287-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.2008.03359.x.

The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the risk of transfusion reactions in hematology/oncology patients who receive acetaminophen with diphenhydramine or placebo before transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled transfusion reaction study of 315 eligible patients was performed. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 to 65 years admitted to the leukemia or bone marrow transplant (BMT) services. Patients were excluded if they had a known allergy to either acetaminophen or diphenhydramine or had a documented history of a febrile or allergic transfusion reaction. All blood products were administered using a leukofilter. Study medications were given 30 minutes before transfusions and no other acetaminophen or diphenhydramine was given within 4 hours of administration of the study medications. Patients were monitored for the development of reaction symptoms within 4 hours after the transfusion. RESULTS: A total of 154 active drug patients were compared to 161 placebo patients. There was no significant difference in the overall risk of transfusion reactions between the two groups. However, analysis of specific reaction types revealed a significant decrease in the risk of febrile reactions when pretransfusion medication is used in addition to bedside leukoreduction. CONCLUSIONS: Pretransfusion medication of leukemia or BMT patients without a history of transfusion reaction does not decrease the overall risk of transfusion reactions. However, pretransfusion medication may decrease the risk of febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions to leukoreduced blood products.",,"['Kennedy, LeAnne D', 'Case, L Douglas', 'Hurd, David D', 'Cruz, Julia M', 'Pomper, Gregory J']","['Kennedy LD', 'Case LD', 'Hurd DD', 'Cruz JM', 'Pomper GJ']","['Department of Pharmacy, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157, USA. lakenned@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Histamine H1 Antagonists)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', '8GTS82S83M (Diphenhydramine)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Diphenhydramine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Leukocyte Reduction Procedures', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/therapy', '*Premedication', 'Prospective Studies', '*Transfusion Reaction']",,,2008/08/05 09:00,2009/01/16 09:00,['2008/08/05 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF01858 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01858.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2008 Nov;48(11):2285-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01858.x.

This review examines the transport of cytokines and neurotrophic factors into the spinal cord, emphasizing the upregulation of two cytokines--tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)--during the course of SCI.

Abelson tyrosine kinase (ABL) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth and proliferation and is usually under tight control. However, 95% of CML patients have the ABL gene from chromosome 9 fused with the breakpoint cluster (BCR) gene from chromosome 22, resulting in a short chromosome known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This Philadelphia chromosome is responsible for the production of BCR-ABL, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that causes uncontrolled cellular proliferation. An ABL inhibitor, imatinib, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of CML, and is currently used as first line therapy. However, a high percentage of clinical relapse has been observed due to long term treatment with imatinib. A majority of these relapsed patients have several point mutations at and around the ATP binding pocket of the ABL kinase domain in BCR-ABL. In order to address the resistance of mutated BCR-ABL to imatinib, 2(nd) generation inhibitors such as dasatinib, and nilotinib were developed. These compounds were approved for the treatment of CML patients who are resistant to imatinib. All of the BCR-ABL mutants are inhibited by the 2(nd) generation inhibitors with the exception of the T315I mutant. Several 3(rd) generation inhibitors such as AP24534, VX-680 (MK-0457), PHA-739358, PPY-A, XL-228, SGX-70393, FTY720 and TG101113 are being developed to target the T315I mutation. The early results from these compounds are encouraging and it is anticipated that physicians will have additional drugs at their disposal for the treatment of patients with the mutated BCR-ABL-T315I.

The genetic hallmarks of the disease are the t(9,22) (Philadelphia chromosome), registered by conventional cytogenetics in more than 90% of all chronic myeloid leukemia cases and the active tyrosine kinase protein encoded by bcr-abl fusion gene. The constitutively active tyrosine kinase is currently accepted to be the cause of chronic myeloid leukemia. The introduction of imatinib has considerably changed the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Prior studies demonstrated high rates of cytogenetic responses in all phases of the disease. METHODS: The authors evaluated the cytogenetic and molecular responses of 21 chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients who were consecutively admitted to their center. 13 of them were primarily treated with imatinib, and the other 7 were heavily pretreated with interferon alpha, cytarabine, all-trans-retinoic acid. Hydroxyurea pretreatment was routinely introduced in all patients until complete hematologic remission. Peripheral blood sample in every 3 months were collected for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and bone marrow aspirate in every 6 months for conventional cytogenetics. RESULTS: Hematologic remission could have been achieved with hydroxyurea pretreatment in each patient. Complete cytogenetic remission at the 6th month and major molecular response at the 12th month were observed in each patient. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib treatment caused complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response in each chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia patient in our group.

It is also responsible for a familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia (FPD-AML). The disruption of the largely unknown biological pathways controlled by RUNX1 is likely to be responsible for the development of leukemia. We have used multiple microarray platforms and bioinformatic techniques to help identify these biological pathways to aid in the understanding of why RUNX1 mutations lead to leukemia. RESULTS: Here we report genes regulated either directly or indirectly by RUNX1 based on the study of gene expression profiles generated from 3 different human and mouse platforms. The platforms used were global gene expression profiling of: 1) cell lines with RUNX1 mutations from FPD-AML patients, 2) over-expression of RUNX1 and CBFbeta, and 3) Runx1 knockout mouse embryos using either cDNA or Affymetrix microarrays. We observe that our datasets (lists of differentially expressed genes) significantly correlate with published microarray data from sporadic AML patients with mutations in either RUNX1 or its cofactor, CBFbeta. A number of biological processes were identified among the differentially expressed genes and functional assays suggest that heterozygous RUNX1 point mutations in patients with FPD-AML impair cell proliferation, microtubule dynamics and possibly genetic stability. In addition, analysis of the regulatory regions of the differentially expressed genes has for the first time systematically identified numerous potential novel RUNX1 target genes. CONCLUSION: This work is the first large-scale study attempting to identify the genetic networks regulated by RUNX1, a master regulator in the development of the hematopoietic system and leukemia. The biological pathways and target genes controlled by RUNX1 will have considerable importance in disease progression in both familial and sporadic leukemia as well as therapeutic implications.",,"['Michaud, Joelle', 'Simpson, Ken M', 'Escher, Robert', 'Buchet-Poyau, Karine', 'Beissbarth, Tim', 'Carmichael, Catherine', 'Ritchie, Matthew E', 'Schutz, Frederic', 'Cannon, Ping', 'Liu, Marjorie', 'Shen, Xiaofeng', 'Ito, Yoshiaki', 'Raskind, Wendy H', 'Horwitz, Marshall S', 'Osato, Motomi', 'Turner, David R', 'Speed, Terence P', 'Kavallaris, Maria', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Scott, Hamish S']","['Michaud J', 'Simpson KM', 'Escher R', 'Buchet-Poyau K', 'Beissbarth T', 'Carmichael C', 'Ritchie ME', 'Schutz F', 'Cannon P', 'Liu M', 'Shen X', 'Ito Y', 'Raskind WH', 'Horwitz MS', 'Osato M', 'Turner DR', 'Speed TP', 'Kavallaris M', 'Smyth GK', 'Scott HS']","['Molecular Medicine Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville 3050, Victoria, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to summarise and critique available data on the mechanism of action and clinical utility of acadesine, with a focus on treatment of ischaemic reperfusion injury, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The literature was acquired through numerous avenues including Medline, Pubmed, institutional libraries and relevant pharmaceutical companies using keyword search criteria for all trade and common names of acadesine and its derivatives. RESULTS: Acadesine has proven intravenous efficacy in the amelioration of ischaemic reperfusion injury associated with coronary artery bypass graft surgery in Phase III clinical trials. Acadesine is active only in metabolically stressed tissues in the presence of ATP catabolism and therefore has fewer unwanted peripheral side effects than systemic administration of adenosine. Metabolism of the drug is through the endogenous purine pathway and acadesine has been proven to be safe and well tolerated. More recently, acadesine has entered Phase I trials for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia to compete with purine antagonists that are used at present. AMPK-activating agents with high oral bioavailability have potential application in impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and types 1 and 2 diabetes, however the poor oral bioavailability of acadesine precludes such application. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights that, although limited to intravenous application, acadesine is a potentially viable therapy for ischaemic reperfusion injury following coronary artery bypass surgery. Further studies are required to determine the efficacy of acadesine for other ischaemic indications, including during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction.",,"['Drew, Brian G', 'Kingwell, Bronwyn A']","['Drew BG', 'Kingwell BA']","['Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, PO Box 6492, St Kilda Road Central, Melbourne, Victoria, 8008, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Ribonucleosides)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', '53IEF47846 (acadesine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*metabolism', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Myocardial Reperfusion Injury/metabolism/*prevention & control', '*Ribonucleosides/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2008/08/02 09:00,2008/10/08 09:00,['2008/08/02 09:00'],"['2008/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14656566.9.12.2137 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2008 Aug;9(12):2137-44. doi: 10.1517/14656566.9.12.2137.,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A shorter latent period and a higher mortality was found in the CC x IA chickens. In most chickens of this group, subperiosteal accumulations of primitive cells on the ribs, sternum and pelvic bones were observed, which were never detected in the CB x IA chickens. Unlike the typical myelocytomatosis, however, most of these cells were without specific cytoplasmic granules which indicated that they were less differentiated than the myelocytes. Another unexpected finding was the severe leukemia which developed in most CC x IA chickens, the primitive cells in the peripheral circulation having the typical morphology of myeloblasts. Tumour growths in the proventriculus were observed for the first time in both experimental groups of chickens. Lymphoid leukosis of a short latency was found in two CB x IA chickens. Of particular interest is the demonstrated severe selective suppression of myelopoiesis in the bone marrow of two CC x IA chickens as this is quite opposite to the usual activity of virus MC29. The results presented indicate that the pathogenic and oncogenic effects of virus MC29 depend on host genetic factors and that after infection of some inbred line of chickens, the myeloid cell differentiation might be arrested at various levels, including at the myeloblast stage.",,"['Filchev, A', 'Bozhkov, S', 'Karakoz, I', 'Plachy, J', 'Sotirov, N']","['Filchev A', 'Bozhkov S', 'Karakoz I', 'Plachy J', 'Sotirov N']","['Institute of General and Comparative Pathology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Avian Pathol,Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,8210638,,,,,,1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['784698016 [pii]', '10.1080/03079459308418922 [doi]']",ppublish,Avian Pathol. 1993 Jun;22(2):295-310. doi: 10.1080/03079459308418922.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3 is responsible for IKK activation. Chemical inhibition or knockdown of Flt3 with small interfering RNAs reduced NFkappaB activation in MDS and AML cell lines, as well as in primary CD34(+) bone marrow cells from patients, causing apoptosis. Epistatic analysis involving the simultaneous inhibition of Flt3 and IKK suggested that both kinases act in the same anti-apoptotic pathway. An IKK2 mutant with a constitutive kinase activity and a plasma membrane-tethered mutant of NEMO that activates IKK1/2 prevented the cytocidal action of Flt3 inhibition. Flt3 phosphorylates IKK2 in vitro, and Flt3 inhibition reduced the phosphorylation of IKK2 in MDS or AML cell lines. IKK2 and Flt3 physically associated in MDS and AML cells, and Flt3 inhibition disrupted this interaction. Flt3 inhibition only killed CD34(+) bone marrow cells from high-risk MDS and AML patients, in correlation with blast numbers and NFkappaB activity, yet had no lethal effect on healthy CD34(+) cells or cells from low-risk MDS. These results suggest that Flt3 inhibitors might exert an anti-neoplastic effect in high-risk MDS and AML through inhibition of NFkappaB.",,"['Grosjean-Raillard, Jennifer', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Boehrer, Simone', 'Tailler, Maximilien', 'Fabre, Claire', 'Braun, Thorsten', 'De Botton, Stephane', 'Israel, Alain', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Kroemer, Guido']","['Grosjean-Raillard J', 'Ades L', 'Boehrer S', 'Tailler M', 'Fabre C', 'Braun T', 'De Botton S', 'Israel A', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G']","['INSERM, U848, Institut Gustave Roussy, PR1, 38 rue Camille Desmoulins, 94805 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epistasis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2008/08/02 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/08/02 09:00'],"['2008/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10495-008-0243-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2008 Sep;13(9):1148-61. doi: 10.1007/s10495-008-0243-4.,,,,,,,,,,,['Apoptosis. 2015 Dec;20(12):1666-7.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CALGB performed a phase II trial of HHT (2.5 mg/m(2) per day) plus cytarabine (7.5 mg/m(2) per day), given together via continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days in previously untreated patients with Ph chromosome positive chronic phase CML. HHT/cytarabine cycles were repeated every 28 days if the blood counts were adequate. The primary endpoint was the major cytogenetic response rate after 9 months. RESULTS: Forty of the 44 enrolled patients required reduction in the infusion duration during at least one cycle. Myelosuppression was common; 66% developed neutrophil count <500/microl, but grade 3 infections occurred in only 7%. Thirty-six of 44 patients (82%) achieved a complete hematologic remission; the median duration has not been reached. Only 4 of the 23 patients (17%) having adequate cytogenetic response assessment achieved a major response within nine cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Although HHT/cytarabine was generally well tolerated, the cytogenetic response rate did not exceed the level previously seen in patients with interferon-refractory CML and was not nearly as high as associated with imatinib in newly diagnosed patients.",,"['Stone, Richard M', 'Donohue, Kathleen A', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Hars, Vera', 'Linker, Charles A', 'Shea, Thomas', 'Deangelo, Daniel J', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Larson, Richard A']","['Stone RM', 'Donohue KA', 'Stock W', 'Hars V', 'Linker CA', 'Shea T', 'Deangelo DJ', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Larson RA']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Room M1B-17, 44 Binney St, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. rstone@partners.org']",['eng'],"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Harringtonines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Harringtonines/administration & dosage', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Palliative Care', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2008/08/02 09:00,2009/03/27 09:00,['2008/08/02 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-008-0805-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2009 Apr;63(5):859-64. doi: 10.1007/s00280-008-0805-8.

Flow cytometry analysis of cell death in 17 glioma cell lines revealed drastic differences in their sensitivity to oxygen withdrawal (<0.1% O(2)). Cell death correlated with mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome C release, and translocation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged light chain 3 to autophagosomes but occurred in the absence of caspase activation or phosphatidylserine exposure. In both sensitive and tolerant glioma cell lines, anoxia caused a significant up-regulation of BH3-only genes previously implicated in mediating anoxic cell death in other cell types (BNIP3, NIX, PUMA, and Noxa). In contrast, we detected a strong correlation between anoxia resistance and high expression levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 that function to neutralize the proapoptotic activity of BH3-only proteins. Importantly, inhibition of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with the small-molecule BH3 mimetics HA14-1 and BH3I-2' and by RNA interference reactivated anoxia-induced autophagic cell death in previously resistant glioma cells. Our data suggest that endogenous BH3-only protein induction may not be able to compensate for the high expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in anoxia-resistant astrocytomas.

We hypothesized that dasatinib might be transported differently than imatinib, possibly accounting for its favorable effects in imatinib-resistant patients. (14)C-dasatinib uptake was greater in KCL22-transfected cells with pcDNA3-hOCT1 plasmid (high hOCT1-expressing cells) than in control cells (P = .02). However, hOCT inhibitors did not decrease dasatinib uptake into either control or primary cells, in contrast to their block on imatinib uptake. Dasa-tinib decreased the level of phosphorylated CrkL to 49.9% in control and 40.3% in high hOCT1-expressing cells. Dasa-tinib efflux was investigated in confluent ABCB1-transfected MDCKII cell monolayers. Both dasatinib and imatinib were transported from the basal to the apical layer, indicating that they were transported by ABCB1, which was confirmed using the ABCB1 inhibitor PSC833 (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively). Compared with imatinib, dasatinib achieved superior intracellular levels and BCR-ABL suppression even in cells with low or blocked hOCT1. Efflux of dasatinib and imatinib appear similar via ABCB1.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Therapy consisted of a single-agent phase (epratuzumab 360 mg/m(2)/dose intravenously twice weekly x four doses), followed by four weekly doses of epratuzumab in combination with standard reinduction chemotherapy. Morphologic and minimal residual disease (MRD) responses were determined at the end of this 6-week period. Serum concentrations of epratuzumab were determined before and 30 minutes after infusions, and CD22 targeting efficiency was determined by quantifying changes in CD22 expression after epratuzumab administration. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (12 fully assessable for toxicity) with first or later CD22-positive ALL marrow relapse enrolled on the feasibility portion of this study from December 2005 to June 2006. Two dose-limiting toxicities occurred: one grade 4 seizure of unclear etiology and one asymptomatic grade 3 ALT elevation. In all but one patient, surface CD22 was not detected by flow cytometry on peripheral blood leukemic blasts within 24 hours of drug administration, indicating effective targeting of leukemic cells by epratuzumab. Nine patients achieved a complete remission after chemoimmunotherapy, seven of whom were MRD negative. CONCLUSION: Treatment with epratuzumab plus standard reinduction chemotherapy is feasible and acceptably tolerated in children with relapsed CD22-positive ALL. CD22 targeting was efficient, and the majority of patients achieved favorable early responses.",,"['Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Blaney, Susan M', 'Krailo, Mark D', 'Leil, Tarek A', 'Reid, Joel M', 'Goldenberg, David M', 'Wegener, William A', 'Carroll, William L', 'Adamson, Peter C']","['Raetz EA', 'Cairo MS', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Blaney SM', 'Krailo MD', 'Leil TA', 'Reid JM', 'Goldenberg DM', 'Wegener WA', 'Carroll WL', 'Adamson PC']","[""Department of Pediatrics, New York University, School of Medicine, Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, New York, NY 10016, USA. elizabeth.raetz@nyumc.org""]",['eng'],"['U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '3062P60MH9 (epratuzumab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC2654811,,2008/08/02 09:00,2008/08/15 09:00,['2008/08/02 09:00'],"['2008/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/22/3756 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.3528 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Aug 1;26(22):3756-62. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.3528.,,,,,,,"[""Children's Oncology Group Pilot Study""]",,,,,,,,,

In fact, these reactions are believed to be responsible for the nephrotoxicity induced by platinum (II)-based drugs. Their activity has been evaluated in a panel of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines representing different French-American-British (FAB) subtypes and in the Philadelphia (Ph)-positive cell line K-562 and compared to cisplatin. Both compounds suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, colony formation in methylcellulose with ID50 values comparable to those of the reference drug cisplatin, excluding the ML-3 cell line (ID50 10-fold lower than cisplatin). Exposure of HL-60, ML-3, NB-4, and THP-1 cell lines to a cytotoxic concentration of [Pd(MSDT)Br]n (5 microM) determined: downregulation of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2, upregulation of the proapoptotic molecule Bax; apoptosis induction, as evaluated by APO2.7 and annexin V staining; mitochondrial membrane permeabilization; and DNA fragmentation. In ML-3 cells the Pd(II) complexes were more active than cisplatin in apoptosis induction. Finally, [Pd(MSDT)Br]n showed an inhibitory effect on clonogenic growth of hematopoietic progenitors (CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM, and BFU-E) with both ID50 and ID90 comparable to those of cisplatin. Remarkably, the Pd(II) complex was more potent in inhibiting the clonogenic growth of the less differentiated AML cell lines KG-1a, HL-60, NB-4, ML-3, and THP-1 (ID50 ranging from 0.02 +/- 0.001 to 0.52 +/- 0.04 microM), compared to normal hematopoietic progenitors (ID50 of 2.1 +/- 0.1, 3.8 +/- 0.4, and 2.5 +/- 0.2 microM) for CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-GM, respectively). These data suggest that leukemic cells of myelomonoblast lineage might represent a preferential target for its cytotoxic activity compared to normal committed hemopoietic progenitor cells. Altogether, our results indicate that these new Pd(II) dithiocarbamate derivatives might represent novel potentially active drugs for the management of some selected myeloid leukemia strains, able to conjugate cytostatic and apoptotic activity with reduced toxicity.",,"['Aldinucci, Donatella', 'Cattaruzza, Lara', 'Lorenzon, Debora', 'Giovagnini, Lorena', 'Fregona, Dolores', 'Colombatti, Alfonso']","['Aldinucci D', 'Cattaruzza L', 'Lorenzon D', 'Giovagnini L', 'Fregona D', 'Colombatti A']","['Experimental Oncology 2, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy. daldinucci@cro.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (KLHL41 protein, human)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5TWQ1V240M (Palladium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/chemical synthesis', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Palladium/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/blood', 'Thiocarbamates/chemical synthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/blood']",,,2008/08/02 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/08/02 09:00'],"['2008/08/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/096504008785055558 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2008;17(3):103-13. doi: 10.3727/096504008785055558.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This multi-institution phase II study investigated a novel dosing schedule of As(2)O(3) and AA in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies. Patients received As(2)O(3) 0.25 mg/kg iv and AA 1000 mg iv for five consecutive days during the first week of each cycle followed by twice weekly infusions during weeks 2-6. Cycles were repeated every 8 weeks. The primary end point was objective response. In a subset of patients, sequential levels of intracellular glutathione and measures of Bcl-2 and Bax gene expression were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during treatment. Seventeen patients were enrolled between March 2002 and February 2004. The median age was 71, and the majority of enrolled patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (12/17). Sixteen patients were evaluable, and one patient with mantle cell lymphoma achieved an unconfirmed complete response after five cycles of therapy for an overall response rate of 6%. The trial, which had been designed as a two-stage study, was closed after the first stage analysis due to lack of activity. Haematologic toxicities were the most commonly reported events in this heavily pre-treated population, and comprised the majority of grade 3 and 4 toxicities. Intracellular depletion of glutathione was not consistently observed during treatment. As(2)O(3) and AA in this novel dosing strategy was generally well tolerated but had limited activity in patients with relapsed and refractory lymphoid malignancies.","['Copyright 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Chang, J E', 'Voorhees, P M', 'Kolesar, J M', 'Ahuja, H G', 'Sanchez, F A', 'Rodriguez, G A', 'Kim, K', 'Werndli, J', 'Bailey, H H', 'Kahl, B S']","['Chang JE', 'Voorhees PM', 'Kolesar JM', 'Ahuja HG', 'Sanchez FA', 'Rodriguez GA', 'Kim K', 'Werndli J', 'Bailey HH', 'Kahl BS']","['Paul P.

In leukemia, it is well described that activating internal tandem duplications (ITD) mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases like cKit or Flt3 confer to the pathogenesis of cancer. Here, we analyzed whether Wnt-signaling plays a role in cKit-ITD mediated transformation. Stably transfected 32D cells with cKit-ITD cells had higher beta-Catenin protein levels compared to the cKit-WT. Analysis of beta-Catenin mRNA and protein levels revealed that beta-Catenin was regulated at post-transcriptional level in cKit-ITD as well as Flt3-ITD compared to the wildtype. Signaling analyses revealed higher-phosphorylation of GSK3beta by oncogenic cKit-ITD. Moreover, activation of Wnt signaling was confirmed by constitutive activation of c-myc luciferase by cKit-ITD cells. Importantly, using dominant negative TCF4, we show that activation of Wnt signaling plays an important role in cKit mediated transformation of myeloid cells. Application of specific receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for Flt3 or cKit result in a decrease of beta-Catenin that underwent with a decrease of GSK3beta phosphorylation, suggesting an indirect mechanism of beta-Catenin regulation by oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases in both ITD mutations.

Using real-time reverse transcription-PCR, we examined the expression of 43 clustered HOX, polycomb, MLL and FLT3 genes in 119 newly diagnosed adult acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) selected from all major cytogenetic groups. Downregulated HOX expression was a consistent feature of favorable AMLs and, among these cases, inv(16) cases had a distinct expression profile. Using a 17-gene predictor in 44 additional samples, we observed a 94.7% specificity for classifying favorable vs intermediate/unfavorable cytogenetic groups. Among other AMLs, HOX overexpression was associated with nucleophosmin (NPM) mutations and we also identified a phenotypically similar subset with wt-NPM. In many unfavorable and other intermediate cytogenetic AMLs, HOX levels resembled those in normal CD34+ cells, except that the homogeneity characteristic of normal samples was not present. We also observed that HOXA9 levels were significantly inversely correlated with survival and that BMI-1 was overexpressed in cases with 11q23 rearrangements, suggesting that p19(ARF) suppression may be involved in MLL-associated leukemia.

Risk of progression from MGUS to MM has been found to be very similar in whites and blacks.

Recently, c-Myb has been shown to be targeted by microRNA-150 (miR-150) which thereby controls B cell differentiation in mice. In this study, we demonstrated that c-Myb is an evolutionary conserved target of miR-150 in human and zebrafish, using reporter assays. Ectopic expression of miR-150 in breast cancer and leukemic cells repressed endogenous c-Myb at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Among several leukemia cell lines, primary leukemia cells, and normal lymphocytes, expression levels of miR-150 inversely correlated with c-Myb. The miR-150 overexpression or c-Myb silencing in zebrafish zygotes led to similar and serious phenotypic defects in zebrafish, and the phenotypic aberrations induced by miR-150 could be reversed by coinjection of c-Myb mRNA.

However, the mechanism by which OTT-BSAC promotes leukemia is largely unknown. Here we show that OTT-BSAC, but not BSAC or OTT strongly activates several promoters containing a transcription factor Yin Yang 1-binding sequence. In addition, although BSAC predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm and its nuclear translocation is considered to be regulated by the Rho-actin signaling pathway, OTT-BSAC exclusively localizes in the nucleus.

HES must be distinguished from reactive eosinophilia in parasitic infections, allergic diseases, and especially from hematological diseases of clonal origin. REACTIVE EOSINOPHILIA DUE TO INFECTIOUS AND PARASITIC DISEASES: Tissue helminth infections, especially toxocariasis, cause severe and long-standing hypereosinophilia. Despite specific therapy, eosinophilia may persist for over a year after diagnosis, and decreases slowly. Other helminth infections, such as trichinellosis, strongyloidosis, and rarely taeniasis and cysticercosis may also be diagnosed in patients with eosinophilia. HEMATOLOGIC AND OTHER NEOPLASTIC DISEASES: Numerous neoplastic diseases, like Hodgkin's and other malignant lymphomas, myeloproliferative diseases, systemic mastocytosis etc., may be associated with marked eosinophilia. We had two patients with clinical and histological features resembling chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and many others with T-cell lymphoma, planocellular or adenocarcinoma etc. where eosinophilia persisted DRUG-INDUCED EOSINOPHILIA: Drugs associated with eosinophilia include penicillins, tetracyclines, especially minocycline, clarithromycin, tetrazepam, mefloquine, and many, others. Toxins associated with L-tryptophan cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and toxic oil syndrome, also belonging in this group. Treatment includes drug discontinuation and administration of corticosteroids. HYPEREOSINOPHILIA WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION: Many severe diseases, such as sarcoidosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, pemphigus vulgaris, eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, inflammatory bowel disease and many others are associated with hypereosinophilia and target organ damage, e.g. involvement of the heart, lungs, skin, or nervous tissue. CONCLUSION: Eosinophilia can be classified as either familial or acquired. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a subcategory of idiopathic eosinophilia. If the differential diagnosis of hypereosinophilia fails to resolve the etiology succesfully, the diagnosis of idiopathic HES remains.",,"['Dinic-Uzurov, Vera', 'Lalosevic, Vesna', 'Milosevic, Ivana', 'Urosevic, Ivana', 'Lalosevic, Dusan', 'Popovic, Stevan']","['Dinic-Uzurov V', 'Lalosevic V', 'Milosevic I', 'Urosevic I', 'Lalosevic D', 'Popovic S']","['Klinika za hematologiju, Klinicki centar Vojvodine, Novi Sad.']",['srp'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Med Pregl,Medicinski pregled,2985249R,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Eosinophilia/diagnosis/etiology', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*diagnosis']",,,2008/08/01 09:00,2008/09/10 09:00,['2008/08/01 09:00'],"['2008/08/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2298/mpns0712581d [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pregl. 2007 Nov-Dec;60(11-12):581-6. doi: 10.2298/mpns0712581d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spinal affections of GS have been described but are uncommon, particularly in association with essential thrombocythemia. We present a case of a 75-year-old woman with a long history of essential thrombocythemia who developed 2 tumors: 1 in the bodies of T3 - 6 vertebras extending epidurally, and the other in the right frontal lobe, adherent to dura, thus, mimicking meningioma. The patient died because of massive pulmonary thrombembolia. Microscopical and immunohistochemical features of spinal and intracranial tumor samples obtained at autopsy were consistent with the diagnosis of GS with focal megakaryocytic differentiation. Clinicians and pathologists should be aware of this rare tumor being so diverse in its clinical presentation, as well as in microscopical and immunohistochemical features. Careful evaluation of morphology, in conjunction with immunohistochemistry for evidence of myeloid differentiation are required to avoid frequent errors in diagnostics of GS.

This review highlights the polymorphisms of TPMT gene and their clinical impact on the use of thiopurine drugs. To date, there are 18 known mutational TPMT alleles. The three main TPMT alleles, namely TPMT *2, *3A and *3C, account for 80 - 95% of the intermediate and low enzyme activity. The TPMT gene exhibits significant genetic polymorphisms among all ethnic groups studied. Patients who inherited very low levels of TPMT activity are at greatly increased risk for thiopurine-induced toxicity such as myelosuppression, when treated with standard doses of these drugs, while subjects with very high activity may be undertreated. Moreover, clinical drug interactions may occur due to TMPT induction or inhibition.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of each individual fusion transcript is impractical and time consuming. The purpose of this study was to develop simple RT-PCR methods to identify common fusion transcripts of newly diagnosed acute leukemia in children. Total RNA was extracted from bone marrow samples of children diagnosed with acute leukemia. Multiplex RT-PCR panel A (ALL) included primers for TEL-AML1, E2A-PBX, MLL-AF4, and BCR-ABL (p190) whereas panel B (ANLL) composed of primers for AML-ETO, PML-RARA, and CBFB-MYH11. Known leukemic cell lines were used to serve as positive controls. Eighty three children diagnosed with ALL (n = 63) and ANLL (n = 20) were included in this study.

During early postnatal development, photoreceptor precursors lose their responsiveness to CNTF. The underlying events causing this change in responsiveness are unknown. Moreover, whether rods express CNTF receptor alpha, a prerequisite for a direct response to the factor, is controversial. Since morphological studies have previously produced conflicting results, we have analyzed the expression of cytokine receptor components and potential ligands in the rat photoreceptor layer by real-time reverse transcription with the polymerase chain reaction after laser microdissection and by immunoblotting. Cytokine effects on rods were studied in explant cultures from newborn rat retina. CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFR alpha) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor ss (LIFRss) were expressed in immature photoreceptors. Expression of the CNTF-specific alpha-subunit (but not of LIFRss) was downregulated specifically in the photoreceptor layer in parallel with the appearance of opsin-positive rods. The decrease of CNTFR alpha levels in explant cultures was closely correlated with the loss of precursor cell responsiveness to CNTF. Increasing the CNTF concentration in the culture medium led to prolonged CNTFR alpha expression and, concomitantly, to persistent inhibition of rod differentiation. Application of CNTF and LIF in vitro induced phosphorylation of STAT3. Inducibility of STAT3 activation by CNTF decreased with photoreceptor maturation, whereas the LIF effect persisted. Our results thus indicate that CNTF acts directly on photoreceptor precursors inhibiting their differentiation via activation of the JAK/STAT3 signal transduction pathway, and that this effect is temporally limited because of the downregulation of CNTFR alpha.",,"['Hertle, Daniel', 'Schleichert, Michael', 'Steup, Andreas', 'Kirsch, Matthias', 'Hofmann, Hans-Dieter']","['Hertle D', 'Schleichert M', 'Steup A', 'Kirsch M', 'Hofmann HD']","['Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Freiburg, P.O.

The generation of cellular models of drug resistance has been pivotal in unravelling the main effectors of resistance to traditional chemotherapy at the molecular level (i.e. intracellular drug inactivation, detoxifying systems, defects in DNA repair, apoptosis evasion, membrane transporters and cell adhesion). The development of targeted therapies has also been followed by resistance, reminiscent of an evolutionary arms race, as exemplified by imatinib and other BCR-ABL inhibitors for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Although traditionally associated with the last stages of the disease, recent findings with minimally transformed pretumorigenic primary human cells indicate that the ability to generate drug resistance arises early during the tumorigenic process, before the full transformation. Novel technologies, such as genome profiling, have in certain cases predicted the outcome of chemotherapy and undoubtedly have tremendous potential for the future.

Several laboratories are now screening for this mutation in different malignancies, and, recently, the mutation was described by Malanga et al in 1.9% of lung cancer patients. Considering the importance of the PI3K/AKT pathway in mediating survival and antiapoptotic signals in the B-cell types of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), we sequenced the AKT1 exon 3 for the above mentioned mutation in 87 specimens, representing 45 CLLs, 38 ALLs and 4 prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) cases, which are all of B-cell origin.

Nevertheless, many people with CML eventually undergo HCT, raising the question of whether prior IM therapy impacts HCT success. Data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research on 409 subjects treated with IM before HCT (IM(+)) and 900 subjects who did not receive IM before HCT (IM(-)) were analyzed. Among patients in first chronic phase, IM therapy before HCT was associated with better survival but no statistically significant differences in treatment-related mortality, relapse, and leukemia-free survival. Better HLA-matched donors, use of bone marrow, and transplantation within one year of diagnosis were also associated with better survival. A matched-pairs analysis was performed and confirmed a higher survival rate among first chronic phase patients receiving IM.

In this study PML NB assembly dynamics were assessed by live cell imaging and mathematic modeling of its major component parts. We show that all six nuclear PML isoforms exhibit individual exchange rates at NBs and identify PML V as a scaffold subunit. SP100 exchanges at least five times faster at NBs than PML proteins. Turnover dynamics of PML and SP100 at NBs is modulated by SUMOylation. Exchange is not temperature-dependent but depletion of cellular ATP levels induces protein immobilization at NBs. The PML-RARalpha oncogene exhibits a strong NB retention effect on wild-type PML proteins. HIPK2 requires an active kinase for PML NB targeting and elevated levels of PML IV increase its residence time. DAXX and BLM turn over rapidly and completely at PML NBs within seconds.

Oncolytic virus therapy, where viruses replicate specifically in cancer cells and kill them, is another promising therapy approach against cancer. While encouraging results have been observed in clinical trials, consistent success has not been possible so far. Based on a computational framework, I report that even if oncolytic virus therapy fails to eradicate a cancer, it can have the potential to eradicate the sub-population of drug-resistant cancer cells. Once this has occurred, targeted drug therapy can be used to induce cancer remission. For this to work, a drug resistance mutation must confer a certain fitness cost to the cell, as has been documented in the literature. The reason for this finding is that in the presence of a shared virus, the faster growing (drug-sensitive) cell population produces an amount of virus that is too much for the slower growing (drug-resistant) cell population to survive. This is derived from a population dynamic principle known as apparent competition. Therefore, a sequential combination of oncolytic virus and targeted therapies can overcome major weaknesses of either approach alone.",,"['Wodarz, Dominik']",['Wodarz D'],"['Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of California, Irvine, 321 Steinhaus Hall, Irvine, CA 92697, USA. dwodarz@uci.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J R Soc Interface,"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",101217269,,IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy/*virology', '*Models, Biological', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy/*methods', 'Oncolytic Viruses/*physiology']",PMC2658788,,2008/07/31 09:00,2009/03/13 09:00,['2008/07/31 09:00'],"['2008/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['984651V278174210 [pii]', '10.1098/rsif.2008.0191 [doi]']",ppublish,J R Soc Interface. 2009 Feb 6;6(31):179-86. doi: 10.1098/rsif.2008.0191.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endocrine and signaling-related response patterns were determined by expression analysis of different factors, comprising endocrine (glucocorticoid receptor [GR], GR-alpha/beta/gamma; mineralocorticoid receptor [MR]) and signaling-related pathways (p105, STAT3, c-jun, c-fos, JNK1, GAPDH, TNF-alpha). METHODS: A semiquantitative RT-PCR for factor responses after 24 h of treatment was conducted and exploratory multivariate statistical procedures were applied for further analysis. RESULTS: Compared to controls, significant reduction of mRNA levels of GR-beta under imipramine and of c-jun under desipramine treatment were found. CS treatment significantly reduced mRNA levels of GR-alpha/beta, TNF-alpha, p105 and c-jun compared to controls. Compared to CS treatment, significantly increased mRNA levels were found for JNK1 under imipramine treatment and for GR-alpha after treatment with all AD examined. DISCUSSION: The multivariate approach meets the requirements of the complex situation of metabolic reactions induced by AD or CS treatment. Our data show that AD affect both, endocrine and signaling-related factors in human monocytic U-937 blood cells, although clearly not in a uniform manner. Hereby, GR is obviously playing a comparably central role. Overall, AD treatment might indeed normalize deviations of cellular endocrine and signaling-related pathways in major depressive disorder via the mechanisms examined.",,"['Gebhardt, Stefan', 'Heiser, Philip', 'Fischer, Sabine', 'Schneyer, Thomas', 'Krieg, Jurgen-Christian', 'Vedder, Helmut']","['Gebhardt S', 'Heiser P', 'Fischer S', 'Schneyer T', 'Krieg JC', 'Vedder H']","['Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Philipps-University of Marburg, Rudolf-Bultmann-Strasse 8, D-35033 Marburg, Germany.

This review focuses on recent advances in developing antimony anticancer agents with an emphasis on antimony coordination complexes, Sb (III) and Sb (V). These complexes, which include many organometallic complexes, may provide a broader spectrum of antitumoral activity. They were compared with classical platinum anticancer drugs. The review covers the literature data published up to 2007. A number of antimonials with different antitumoral activities are known and have diverse applications, even though little research has been done on their possibilities. It might be feasible to develop more specific and effective inhibitors for phosphatase-targeted, anticancer therapeutics through the screening of sodium stibogluconate (SSG) and potassium antimonyltartrate-related compounds, which are comprised of antimony conjugated to different organic moieties. For example, SSG appears to be a better inhibitor than suramin which is a compound known for its antineoplastic activity against several types of cancers.",,"['Sharma, Pankaj', 'Perez, Diego', 'Cabrera, Armando', 'Rosas, Noe', 'Arias, Jose Luis']","['Sharma P', 'Perez D', 'Cabrera A', 'Rosas N', 'Arias JL']","['Instituto De Quimica, UNAM Circuito Exterior, Coyoacan Mexico DF.04510, Mexico. pankajsh@servidor.unam.mx']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '9IT35J3UV3 (Antimony)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimony/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2008/07/31 09:00,2009/05/16 09:00,['2008/07/31 09:00'],"['2008/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1745-7254.2008.00818.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2008 Aug;29(8):881-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7254.2008.00818.x.,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 45-60% of patients with NK-AML carry NPM1 gene mutations and are associated with a favourable clinical outcome when FLT3-internal tandem duplications (ITD) are absent. High resolution melting (HRM) is a novel screening method that enables rapid identification of mutation positive DNA samples. RESULTS: We developed HRM assays to detect NPM1 mutations and FLT3-ITD and tested diagnostic samples from 44 NK-AML patients. Eight were NPM1 mutation positive only, 4 were both NPM1 mutation and FLT3-ITD positive and 4 were FLT3-ITD positive only. A novel point mutation Y572C (c.1715A>G) in exon 14 of FLT3 was also detected. In the group with de novo NK-AML, 40% (12/29) were NPM1 mutation positive whereas NPM1 mutations were observed in 20% (3/15) of secondary NK-AML cases. Sequencing was performed and demonstrated 100% concordance with the HRM results. CONCLUSION: HRM is a rapid and efficient method of screening NK-AML samples for both novel and known NPM1 and FLT3 mutations. NPM1 mutations can be observed in both primary and secondary NK-AML cases.",,"['Tan, Angela Y C', 'Westerman, David A', 'Carney, Dennis A', 'Seymour, John F', 'Juneja, Surender', 'Dobrovic, Alexander']","['Tan AY', 'Westerman DA', 'Carney DA', 'Seymour JF', 'Juneja S', 'Dobrovic A']","['Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia. angela.tan@petermac.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Genetic Testing/economics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC2517593,,2008/07/31 09:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2008/07/31 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2008/07/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['1756-8722-1-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-1-10 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2008 Jul 29;1:10. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-1-10.,20080729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a drug-oriented approach however is associated with problems. In the azole class, itraconazole has been shown to be effective, but hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal intolerability have made the drug less attractive. Posaconazole, approved for prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell recipients with graft versus host disease and in those with acute leukemia, is of promise but has a limitation relating to its oral bioavailability. Preliminary data do not show any survival advantage with voriconazole over fluconazole; also, emergence of resistant organisms, high frequency of drug interactions and liver function abnormalities with voriconazole are drawbacks. Whether serum levels of azoles need to be monitored for optimal outcome remain controversial. Reports of emergence of azole-resistant Aspergillus (e.g., A. ustus, A. nidulans, A. fumigatus) in azole-exposed and unexposed patients, though rare, raise concern. Echinocandins have static activity against Aspergillus, not orally administrable and have been associated with breakthrough aspergillosis. Polyenes (amphotericin B and its lipid forms) are shunned in view of their nephrotoxicity; inhalational (aerosol) form may be of promise, more data are needed.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) stimulates adenylate cyclase and induces differentiation in multiple cell types; VIP is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and in megakaryocytes, but its function in these cells has not yet been delineated. The present study was designed to investigate whether the type 1 VIP receptor, VPAC1, mediates VIP effects on megakaryocytopoiesis. The human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line (CMK) was transfected with VPAC1 and the transgene expression was confirmed by qualitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The rate of proliferation and the patterns of differentiation were then compared for CMK and CMK/VPAC1 through multiple growth cycles. Upregulation of VPAC1 expression resulted in a decreased proliferation rate (p = 0.0003) and enhanced differentiation with CMK/VPAC1 cells having twice the cell surface area of control CMK cells (p = 0.001), thus increasing potential for proplatelet formation.
