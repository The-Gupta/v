METHODS: Mortality experience and cancer incidence were evaluated in a combined cohort of 4872 individuals with a hospital discharge diagnosis of DS in Sweden (1965-1993) or Denmark (1977-1989) by linkage to national cancer and vital statistics registries. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated by comparison with age, sex, and calendar-year expected values. RESULTS: Individuals with DS had an increased risk of incident acute lymphocytic (SIR, 24.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15.2-36.6; n = 22) and acute nonlymphocytic (SIR, 28.2; 95% CI, 15.7-48.3; n = 14) leukemias. Risks of testicular cancer (SIR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.0-9.4; n = 4) and liver cancer (SIR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.2-17.5; n = 3) were also elevated. Individuals with DS also experienced elevated mortality attributed to stomach cancer (SMR, 6.4; 95% CI, 1.7-16.4; n = 4), dementia and Alzheimer disease (SMR, 54.1; 95% CI, 27.9-94.4), epilepsy (SMR, 30.4; 95% CI, 13.9-57.7), ischemic heart disease (SMR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.7-5.4), other heart disease (SMR, 16.5; 95% CI, 11.0-23.7), cerebrovascular disease (SMR, 6.0; 95% CI, 3.5-9.6), infectious diseases (SMR, 12.0; 95% 6.0-21.4), and congenital anomalies (SMR, 25.8; 95% CI, 21.0-31.4). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with DS have a substantially increased risk of mortality due to specific causes and may have an elevated risk of other incident cancers in addition to leukemia. These results provide clues regarding chromosome 21 gene involvement in diseases that complicate DS and are important for disease detection and care of affected individuals.","['Hill, Deirdre A', 'Gridley, Gloria', 'Cnattingius, Sven', 'Mellemkjaer, Lene', 'Linet, Martha', 'Adami, Hans-Olof', 'Olsen, Jorgen H', 'Nyren, Olof', 'Fraumeni, Joseph F Jr']","['Hill DA', 'Gridley G', 'Cnattingius S', 'Mellemkjaer L', 'Linet M', 'Adami HO', 'Olsen JH', 'Nyren O', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-7238, USA. dhill@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*epidemiology/genetics/mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2003/03/18 04:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['2003/03/18 04:00'],"['2003/03/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['ioi20111 [pii]', '10.1001/archinte.163.6.705 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 2003 Mar 24;163(6):705-11. doi: 10.1001/archinte.163.6.705.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven cases are discussed: two women, five men, aged 32-70 years. The period between the two neoplasias was 2-23 years (in 6 cases). In one case the two malignancies appeared concomitantly. The hematological malignancies were: multiple myeloma: 2 cases; chronic granulocytic leukemia: 2 cases; chronic lymphatic leukemia: 3 cases. In four cases, the solid tumor followed the hematological malignancy at variable periods (2 and 4 years). In other two cases, the solid tumors preceded the hematological malignancy with 2 years, 23 years respectively. The solid tumors were genital cancers, malignant melanoma, spino-cellular carcinoma, thyroid cancer, hemangiosarcoma.

It is also a trace contaminant and metabolic degradation product of a widely used class of ethylene bisdithiocarbamate fungicides. Ethylene thiourea is known to produce thyroid neoplasms in rats and liver neoplasms in mice following long-term administration; thus, it was chosen by the National Toxicology Program in an investigation of the potential value of perinatal exposures in assessing chemical carcinogenicity. Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies of ethylene thiourea, 99% pure, were conducted in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex. The studies were designed to determine 1) the effects of ethylene thiourea in rats and mice receiving adult exposure only (a typical carcinogenicity study), 2) the toxic and carcinogenic effects of ethylene thiourea on rats and mice receiving perinatal exposure only (dietary exposure of dams prior to breeding and throughout gestation and lactation), and 3) the effects of combined perinatal and adult exposure to ethylene thiourea. STUDIES IN F344/N RATS: In a preliminary study to determine the perinatal dietary concentrations for the 2-year studies, female F344/N rats were fed 0, 8, 25, 83, or 250 ppm ethylene thiourea in the feed beginning 2 weeks prior to breeding and continuing throughout gestation and lactation, and the pups were fed at these same concentrations up to 9 weeks postweaning. Based on decreased survival of rat pups between postnatal days 0 to 4 and reduction in body weight gains in male weanling rats receiving 250 ppm, dietary concentrations of 0, 9, 30, and 90 ppm were selected for the perinatal (F0) exposure levels in the 2-year studies. Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats, 8 to 9 weeks of age, were fed diets containing 0, 60, 125, 250, 500, or 750 ppm ethylene thiourea for 13 weeks to determine the adult dietary concentrations. Because of reduced weight gains and decreased feed consumption in rats receiving 500 or 750 ppm ethylene thiourea, dietary concentrations of 0, 25, 83, and 250 ppm were selected for the adult (F1) exposure during the 2-year studies. In the 2-year studies, perinatal and adult exposures to ethylene thiourea were applied separately and together to groups of male or female rats as shown in the following table. The principal toxic effects of ethylene thiourea involved the thyroid gland. Serum levels of thyroxine (T4) and/or triiodothyronine (T3) were significantly decreased in rats receiving adult concentrations of 83 or 250 ppm, and thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH) was significantly increased at these concentrations. In male and female rats receiving adult-only exposure of 83 or 250 ppm, the incidences of follicular cell hyperplasia or follicular cell adenoma of the thyroid gland were significantly increased relative to the controls. The incidences of follicular cell carcinoma were significantly increased in the 250 ppm groups, and carcinomas occurred more frequently in males than in females. Exposure Groups of Rats in the 2-Year Feed Studies of Ethylene Thiourea a F1 Concentration (ppm)b F0(ppm)c 0 25 83 250 0 60 -- 60 60 9 -- 60 -- -- 30 -- -- 60 -- 90 60 -- 60 60 a Ten rats from each group were sacrificed and evaluated at 9 months b Concentration of ethylene thiourea in feed given to rats beginning at 8 weeks of age for 24 months c Concentration of ethylene thiourea in feed through breeding, gestation, and lactation until pups were 8 weeks of age Perinatal-only exposure to 90 ppm had no effect on the incidence of thyroid neoplasms in these studies, although there was a marginal increase in follicular cell hyperplasia relative to the controls. However, for groups of rats receiving combined perinatal and adult exposure (F0:F1), males and females receiving concentrations of 90:250 ppm ethylene thiourea had significantly increased incidences of thyroid follicular cell neoplasms relative to those receiving adult-only exposure to 250 ppm. Further, groups of male rats receiving 90:83 ppm 83 ppm showed a significantly increased incidence of follicular cell hyperplasia. Final mean body weights of males and survival of males and females receiving combined perinatal (90 ppm) and adult (250 ppm) exposure were lower than those receiving adult-only exposure of 250 ppm. Thus, in rats, combined perinatal and adult exposure slightly enhanced the toxicity and proliferative effects on the thyroid gland observed with adult-only exposure to ethylene thiourea. Neoplasms of the Zymbal's gland were marginally increased in rats receiving 90:250 ppm (males - 0:0, 1/50; 90:250, 5/50; females - 0:0, 1/50; 90:250, 4/50). Mononuclear cell leukemia occurred with a significant trend in groups of male and female rats receiving perinatal exposure of 90 ppm and increasing adult concentrations (90:0, 90:83, and 90:250 ppm), and for female rats without perinatal exposure (0:0, 0:83, and 0:250 ppm). The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in males receiving 90:83 ppm and males and females receiving 90:250 ppm were statistically significant relative to the respective 0:0 ppm groups. Low incidences of renal tubule cell adenomas occurred in most dose groups of male rats, but not in the highest dose group or the controls. STUDIES IN B6C3F1 MICE: In a preliminary study to determine the perinatal dietary concentrations for the 2-year studies, adult female C57BL/6N mice were fed 0, 33, 100, 330, or 1,000 ppm ethylene thiourea in the feed beginning 2 weeks prior to breeding and continuing throughout gestation and lactation and up to 9 weeks postweaning. Because of reduced survival of mouse pups at postnatal day 28 and lower final mean body weights in weanlings receiving perinatal exposure of 1,000 ppm, dietary concentrations of 0, 33, 110, and 330 ppm were selected for the perinatal exposure levels in the 2-year studies. Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice, 8 to 9 weeks of age, were fed diets containing 0, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 ppm ethylene thiourea for 13 weeks to determine the adult dietary concentrations. Moderately severe diffuse follicular cell hyperplasia in the thyroid gland and centrilobular cytomegaly of the liver occurred in mice receiving 2,000 ppm. Because the severity of the thyroid lesion (and degree of hypothyroidism) at this concentration was considered potentially life threatening in 2-year studies, dietary concentrations of 0, 100, 330, and 1,000 ppm ethylene thiourea were selected for adult exposure during the 2-year studies. In the 2-year studies, perinatal and adult exposures to ethylene thiourea were applied separately and together to groups of male or female mice as shown in the following table. Exposure Groups of Mice in the 2-Year Feed Studies of Ethylene Thiourea a F1 Concentration (ppm)b F0(ppm)c 0 100 330 1,000 0 69 -- 60 60 33 -- 34/29d -- -- 110 -- -- 60 -- 330 60 -- 60 60 a Ten mice from each group except the 33:100 ppm group were sacrificed and evaluated at 9 months b Concentration of ethylene thiourea in feed given to mice beginning at 8 weeks of age for 24 months c Concentration of ethylene thiourea in feed through breeding, gestation, and lactation until pups were 8 weeks of age d 34 males and 29 females assigned to group The principal toxic effects of ethylene thiourea in mice occurred in the thyroid gland, liver, and pituitary gland. Serum levels of T3 were significantly decreased in groups of mice receiving adult concentrations of 1,000 ppm; TSH was significantly increased in mice receiving 330 and 1,000 ppm. The incidences of follicular cell hyperplasia and neoplasia increased principally in males receiving 1,000 ppm and in females receiving 330 or 1,000 ppm. Follicular cell carcinomas were significantly increased in mice receiving 1,000 ppm. Incidences of centrilobular hepatocellular cytomegaly (males and females), hepatocellular adenoma (females), hepatocellular carcinoma (males and females), and adenoma or carcinoma combined (males and females) also were significantly increased in mice receiving F1 concentrations of 330 or 1,000 ppm. In the pituitary gland, incidences of focal hyperplasia (males) or adenoma (males and females) of the pars distalis were significantly increased in groups of mice receiving 1,000 ppm ethylene thiourea. Perinatal exposure to concentrations of 330 ppm had no effect on the incidences of nonneoplastic lesions or neoplasms in mice. For groups of mice receiving combined perinatal and adult exposure, females receiving F0:F1 concentrations of 330:330 ppm had significantly increased incidences of follicular cell adenoma relative to those receiving adult-only exposure to 330 ppm. Similarly, male mice receiving F0:F1 concentrations of 330:330 ppm had significantly increased incidences of follicular cell hyperplasia. Thus, in mice, perinatal exposure slightly enhanced the proliferative effects on the thyroid gland of adult exposure. There were no effects of perinatal exposure in mice at sites other than in the thyroid gland. CONCLUSIONS: 2-Year Adult-Only Exposure:Under the conditions of these 2-year adult-only dietary exposures, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of ethylene thiourea in male and female F344/N rats, as shown by increased incidences of thyroid follicular cell neoplasms. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of ethylene thiourea in male and female B6C3F1 mice as shown by increased incidences of thyroid follicular cell neoplasms, hepatocellular neoplasms, and adenomas of the pars distalis of the pituitary gland. Nonneoplastic lesions associated with the administration of ethylene thiourea included follicular cell hyperplasia in rats and mice and follicular cell cytoplasmic vacuolation, centrilobular hepatocellular cytomegaly, and focal hyperplasia of the pars distalis of the pituitary gland in mice. Other effects associated with the administration of ethylene thiourea included decreased serum levels of T4 and/or T3 in rats and increased serum levels of TSH in rats and mice. Perinatal-Only Exposure:Perinatal exposure alone had no effect on the incidences of neoplasms in rats or mice after 2 years. Animals may have been able to tolerate higher perinatal exposure concentrations. Combined Perinatal and 2-Year Adult Exposures:Combined perinatal and 2-year adult dietary exposure to ethylene thiourea confirmed the findings of the 2-year adult-only exposures for the incidences of neoplasms in the thyroid gland of rats and mice and the liver and pituitary gland of mice. In male and female rats, combined perinatal and adult exposure to 90:250 ppm was associated with marginal increases, relative to the untreated (0:0 ppm) controls, in Zymbal's gland neoplasms and mononuclear cell leukemia, which may have been related to chemical administration. In rats receiving adult exposure to 250 ppm ethylene thiourea, perinatal exposure to 90 ppm was associated with a slightly enhanced incidence of thyroid neoplasms compared to adult-only exposure. However, increasing perinatal exposure from 0 to 90 ppm had no effect on incidences of thyroid neoplasms in rats receiving adult exposure to 83 ppm. Increasing perinatal exposure from 0 to 330 ppm was associated with a marginally increased incidence of thyroid neoplasms in female mice receiving adult exposure to 330 ppm, but there were no enhancing effects of perinatal exposure in mice receiving adult exposure to 1,000 ppm.

It is the principal chemical used to generate nitrogen gas in automobile safety airbags and airplane escape chutes and is a broad-spectrum biocide used in both research and agriculture. Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering sodium azide (greater than 99% pure) in distilled water by gavage to groups of male and female F344/N rats once daily, 5 days per week for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and Chinese hamster ovary cells. 14-Day Studies: Rats received 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg sodium azide. All male and female rats receiving 40 or 80 mg/kg and two of five female rats receiving 20 mg/kg died during the first week of the studies. Clinical findings of toxicity included lethargy and inactivity. No grossly observable lesions were present in any of the dose groups. 13-Week Studies: Rats received 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg sodium azide. Seven of 9 males and all 10 females receiving 20 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. Final mean body weights of treated rats were within 10% of those of the controls. Compound-related clinical findings of toxicity in the 20 mg/kg dose groups included lethargy and labored breathing. Histopathologic lesions induced by sodium azide were limited to the brain (necrosis of the cerebrum and thalamus) and lung (congestion, hemorrhage, and edema), and were observed in rats receiving 20 mg/kg that died during the studies. Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Survival in the 2-Year Studies: Because compound-related deaths were observed in the groups receiving 20 mg/kg in the 13-week studies, lower dose levels were used in the 2-year studies. Two-year studies were conducted by administering 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg sodium azide to groups of 60 male and 60 female rats. Dose-related depression in mean body weight was observed throughout the study period. Mean feed consumption values in low- and high-dose groups were lower than control values. Survival of high-dose rats of each sex was significantly (P<0.05) lower than controls (males-control, 24/60; low-dose, 27/60; high-dose, 9/60; females-37/60; 43/60; 21/59). The reduced survival was attributed to brain necrosis and cardiovascular collapse induced by sodium azide. Neoplastic and Nonneoplastic Effects in the 2-Year Studies: There were no compound-related increases in incidences of neoplasms in rats. Significantly decreased incidences were observed for certain neoplasms, including mononuclear cell leukemia in male rats (control, 33/60; low-dose, 28/60; high-dose, 14/60), adrenal gland pheochromocytoma in male rats (26/55; 16/56; 6/54), mammary gland fibroadenoma in female rats (20/60; 11/60; 8/59), and pituitary gland neoplasms in female rats (37/60; 28/60; 17/59). These decreases reflected to some extent, but could not be attributed solely to, the reduced survival of the high-dose groups. Compound-related nonneoplastic brain lesions (necrosis of the cerebrum and thalamus) were observed at significantly (P<0.001) increased incidences in high-dose male and female rats. The increased incidence of lung congestion observed in this dose group was considered due to cardiovascular collapse secondary to brain necrosis. Genetic Toxicology: Sodium azide was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA1535, with or without exogenous metabolic activation (S9); it was not mutagenic in strain TA1537 or TA98. In cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells, sodium azide induced sister chromatid exchanges, but not chromosomal aberrations, in the presence and the absence of S9. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of sodium azide in male or female F344/N rats administered 5 or 10 mg/kg. Sodium azide induced necrosis in the cerebrum and the thalamus of the brain in both male and female rats.

This Initiative was designed to evaluate representative benzidine congeners, benzidine congener-derived dyes, and benzidine-derived dyes. 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride was nominated for study because of the potential for human exposure during production of bisazobiphenyl dyes and because benzidine, a structurally related chemical, is a known human carcinogen. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (approximately 99% pure) in drinking water to groups of F344/N rats of each sex for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 9 or 14 months. The 14-month exposures were planned as 24-month exposures but were terminated early because of rapidly declining animal survival, due primarily to neoplasia. These studies were performed only in rats because similar studies were being performed in mice at the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR). Hematologic and serum chemical analyses and thyroid hormone determinations were conducted in conjunction with the 13-week and 9-month studies. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and Drosophila melanogaster. 14-Day Studies: Rats were exposed to 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride in drinking water at doses ranging from 600 to 7,500 ppm. All five males and one female in the 7,500 ppm group and 1/5 males in the 5,000 ppm group died. Final mean body weights were decreased in males receiving 1,250 ppm or more and in all exposed females, and final mean body weights of animals receiving 2,500 ppm or more were lower than initial weights. Water consumption decreased with increasing chemical concentration. Compound-related effects observed in rats receiving 5,000 ppm or more included minimal to slight hepatocellular necrosis, accumulation of brown pigment (presumably bile) in individual hepatocytes, increased severity of nephropathy relative to controls, and severe lymphocytic atrophy of the thymus. Treated animals also showed an increased severity of atrophy of the bone marrow relative to controls, varying degrees of lymphocytic atrophy of the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen, increased vacuolization and necrosis of cells of the adrenal cortex, focal acinar cell degeneration in the pancreas, and, in males, increased immature sperm forms in the testis and epididymis. 13-Week Studies: 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride was administered in drinking water at doses of 300, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 ppm. All rats receiving 4,000 ppm and 4/10 males and 1/10 females receiving 2,000 ppm died before the end of the studies. Depressions in final mean body weight relative to controls ranged from 12% to 48% for males and from 9% to 42% for females. Water consumption decreased with increasing dose. At compound concentrations of 300 to 2,000 ppm, mean water consumption was 29% to 83% of control values. Compound-related effects included an increase in the severity of nephropathy relative to controls; hepatocellular necrosis and accumulation of brown pigment (presumably bile) in sinusoidal lining cells; lymphocytic atrophy of the thymus, spleen, and mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes; atrophy of the bone marrow in the higher-dose groups; degeneration of pancreatic acinar cells; and, in males, immature sperm forms in the testis and epididymis. Decreases in serum triiodothyronine (T3) values were observed in exposed females, and decreases in mean thyroxin (T4) concentrations in exposed males and females; no significant changes were observed in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in exposed rats. Based on the decreased survival, reductions in water consumption and body weight gain, and chemical-induced hepatocellular and renal lesions observed in the 13-week studies, the doses selected for the 9- and 14-month drinking water studies of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride were 0, 3 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride were 0, 30, 70, and 150 ppm. Seventy rats of each sex were used in the control group, 45 in the low-dose group, 75 in the mid-dose group, and 70 in the high-dose group. 9-Month Studies: Ten rats of each sex in the control and 150 ppm dose groups were evaluated after 9 months. Chemical-related effects observed in exposed animals included alveolar/bronchiolar carcinoma in one male, basal cell carcinoma of the skin in one male, a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity in one female, preputial gland carcinoma in two males, clitoral gland carcinoma in three females, adenocarcinoma of the small intestine in two males, Zymbal's gland carcinoma in two males and three females, hepatocellular carcinoma in two males, and adenomatous polyps of the large intestine in three males. Other effects seen in dosed rats included focal cellular alteration in the liver, lymphoid atrophy in the spleen, and increased severity of nephropathy relative to controls. An increase in serum T3 values was observed in exposed males, and a decrease in mean T4 concentrations in exposed males and females. TSH concentrations were increased in exposed male and female rats. Body Weights and Survival in the 14-Month Studies: The average amount of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride consumed per day was approximately 1.8, 4.0, or 11.2, mg/kg for low-, mid-, or high-dose male rats and 3.0, 6.9, or 12.9 mg/kg for low-, mid-, or high-dose female rats. The mean body weight of high-dose males was about 85&percnt; of the control value by week 28. By the end of the study, mean body weights of low-, mid-, and high-dose males were 97&percnt;, 92&percnt;, and 70&percnt; of the control values, respectively. Mean body weights of high- and mid-dose females were about 85&percnt; of the control values at week 32 and week 44, respectively. At the end of the study, mean body weights of exposed females were about 94&percnt;, 81&percnt;, and 74&percnt; of the control values for low-, mid-, and high-dose groups, respectively. Because of extensive neoplasia, many exposed males and females were dying or were sacrificed moribund in the first year, and all high-dose males died by week 55. The studies were terminated at weeks 60 to 61, at which time the group survivals were male: control, 60/60, low dose, 41/45; mid dose, 50/75; high dose, 0/60; female: 59/60; 39/45; 32/75; 10/60. Nonneoplastic Effects in the 14-Month Studies: Increases in nonneoplastic lesions in dosed rats included cystic degeneration and foci of cellular alteration in the liver; exacerbation of nephropathy; and focal or multifocal hyperplasia of the Zymbal's gland, preputial and clitoral glands, and alveolar epithelium. Neoplastic Effects in the 14-Month Studies: Neoplasms were observed in exposed rats at many sites: skin, Zymbal's gland, preputial and clitoral glands, liver, oral cavity, small and large intestine, mammary gland, lung, brain, and mesothelium. The incidence of these neoplastic effects in male and female rats is summarized in the table at the end of this section (see page 8 of the Technical Report). Genetic Toxicology: 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 with exogenous metabolic activation; it was not mutagenic in strains TA100, TA1535, or TA97 with or without activation. 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride induced sister-chromatid exchanges (CHO) and chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation; these effects were not evident in test with S9 activation. Sex-linked recessive lethal mutations were induced in germ cells of adult male Drosophila melanogaster administered 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride in feed or by injection. No reciprocal translocations occurred in D. melanogaster germ cells following exposure to 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 14-month drinking water studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride for male F344/N rats, as indicated by benign and malignant neoplasms of the skin, Zymbal's gland, preputial gland, liver, oral cavity, small and large intestine, lung, and mesothelium. Increased incidences of neoplasms of the brain may have been related to chemical administration. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for female F344/N rats, as indicated by benign and malignant neoplasms of the skin, Zymbal's gland, clitoral gland, liver, oral cavity, small and large intestine, mammary gland, and lung. Increased incidences of neoplasms of the brain and mononuclear cell leukemia may have been related to chemical administration.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering TRCP (approximately 98% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 16 days, 16 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were performed in Salmonella typhimurium and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. 16-Day Studies: There were no chemical-related deaths, differences in final mean body weight, or histopathological lesions in rats receiving 22 to 350 mg/kg TRCP or in mice receiving 44 to 700 mg/kg TRCP for 12 doses over 16 days. Serum cholinesterase activity in female rats receiving 175 or 350 mg/kg TRCP was reduced slightly (80% of control levels), but enzyme activity in dosed male rats and in mice was similar to that in controls. 16-Week Studies: Rats received 22 to 350 mg/kg TRCP for 16 weeks (female) or 18 weeks (male). Several male and female rats in the 175 or 350 mg/kg dose groups died from chemical toxicity. Final mean body weights of female rats receiving 350 mg/kg were 20% greater than those of controls; final mean body weights of the remaining groups of dosed female rats and dosed male rats were similar. Chemical-related neuronal necrosis occurred in the hippocampus and thalamus of female rats and, to a lesser extent, of male rats. Serum cholinesterase activity was reduced in females receiving 175 or 350 mg/kg TRCP. There were no chemical-related deaths, differences in final mean body weight, or differences in cholinesterase activity in mice receiving 44 to 700 mg/kg TRCP for 16 weeks. Tubule epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei (cytomegaly and karyomegaly) were observed in the kidneys of high-dose (700 mg/kg) male and female mice. 2-Year Studies: The 2-year studies in rats were conducted by administering 0, 44, or 88 mg/kg TRCP to groups of 60 males and females, 5 days per week for up to 104 weeks; 9 or 10 rats of each dose group were evaluated at 66 weeks. The survival of high-dose male and female rats was reduced relative to that of controls. Final mean body weights of surviving rats were similar to those of controls. The principal chemical-related effects occurred in the kidney and brain of dosed rats. Focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium and renal tubule adenomas were markedly increased in male rats receiving 88 mg/kg TRCP and, to a lesser extent, in female rats (renal tubule hyperplasia, male rats: 0/50; 2/50; 24/50; female rats: 0/50; 3/50; 16/50; renal tubule adenoma, male rats: 1/50; 5/50; 24/50; female rats: 0/50; 2/50; 5/50). Renal tubule carcinomas occurred in one control and one high-dose male rat. Degenerative lesions consisting of gliosis, mineralization, hemorrhage, and/or hemosiderin accumulation occurred in the cerebrum and brain stem of more than 50% of female rats receiving 44 or 88 mg/kg TRCP; similar lesions were seen in only a few dosed males. Slightly increased incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell neoplasms (male rats: 5/50; 14/50; 13/50; female rats: 14/50; 16/50; 20/50) occurred in dosed males and females, but it is uncertain whether these were related to chemical administration. The 2-year studies in mice were conducted by administering 0, 175, or 350 mg/kg TRCP to groups of 60 males and females, 5 days per week for up to 104 weeks; 8 to 10 mice of each sex per dose group were evaluated at 66 weeks. There were no significant differences in survival between dosed and control groups of either sex, and final mean body weights of mice were similar among all groups. The principal chemical-related effects occurred in the kidney, in which nuclear enlargement (karyomegaly) of tubule epithelial cells was present in approximately 80% of high-dose mice. In the original diagnosis, renal tubule adenomas were seen in one control male, one high-dose male, and one low-dose female. A carcinoma was also seen in one high-dose male. In a s seen in one high-dose male. In a subsequent examination of step sections of all the mouse kidneys, adenomas were found in one low-dose male and two high-dose males. The incidences of renal tubule neoplasms in the original and step sections combined were 1/50, 1/50, and 4/50 for males. Female mice receiving TRCP demonstrated a marginally increased incidence of neoplasms (primarily adenomas) of the harderian gland (3/50; 8/50; 7/50); in addition, three harderian gland neoplasms occurred in high-dose female mice evaluated after 66 weeks. Genetic Toxicology: TRCP was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, or TA98 with or without exogenous metabolic activation (S9), and it tested negative for the induction of chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. TRCP produced an equivocal response in the presence of S9 for the induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in CHO cells. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for male and female F344/N rats receiving tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate as shown by increased incidences of renal tubule adenomas. Thyroid follicular cell neoplasms and mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats may have been related to chemical administration. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice as shown by a marginally increased incidence of renal tubule cell neoplasms. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity for female B6C3F1 mice as shown by a marginally increased incidence of harderian gland adenomas. Renal tubule cell hyperplasia in male and female rats and gliosis, hemorrhage, pigmentation (hemosiderin accumulation), and mineralization in the brains of female rats were associated with the administration of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate. Karyomegaly of renal tubule epithelial cells in male and female mice was also chemical related.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Congress, through the Safe Drinking Water Acts and Amendments, initiated studies to determine the most effective way to disinfect water supplies and, at the same time, minimize any potential long-term health effects associated with direct chemical exposure or indirect chemical exposure through the formation of byproducts. As part of this evaluation, 2-year studies of chlorinated or chloraminated deionized charcoal-filtered drinking water were conducted in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice to determine the potential toxicity and carcinogenicity associated with prolonged exposure and eliminate possible confounding effects of byproducts of chlorination. Chlorinated Water Studies: Water containing 0, 70, 140, or 275 ppm chlorine (based on available atomic chlorine) was provided to groups of 70 F344/N rats or B6C3F1 mice of each sex for up to 2 years. Groups of 10 rats or mice of each sex were predesignated for evaluation at 14 or 15 weeks and 66 weeks. Survival at 2 years of rats and mice receiving chlorinated water was similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of dosed male rats, high-dose female rats, and dosed mice were slightly lower than those of their respective control groups. There was a dose-related decrease in water consumption by rats and mice. Water consumption by high-dose rats during the second year of the studies was 21% lower than controls for males and 23% lower than controls for females; water consumption by high-dose mice was 31% lower than controls for males and 26% lower than controls for females. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in mid-dose, but not high-dose, female rats was significantly higher than that in controls (control, 8/50; low-dose, 7/50; mid-dose, 19/51; high-dose, 16/50). The proportion of female rats that died of leukemia before the end of the study and the mean time for observation of animals dying with leukemia were similar among all dose groups and controls. Although the marginal increase in leukemia incidence in the mid- and high-dose female rats suggested a possible association with the administration of chlorinated water, the incidence of leukemia was not clearly dose related. There was no indication of reduced latency of leukemia, and the incidence of leukemia in concurrent controls was less than the mean for historical controls; furthermore, there was no supporting evidence of an effect in male rats. Thus, the marginal increase in leukemia incidence in female rats was considered equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity. There were no neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions in male rats or in male or female mice that were clearly associated with the consumption of chlorinated water. Chloraminated Water Studies: Water containing 50, 100, or 200 ppm chloramine was provided to groups of 70 F344/N rats or B6C3F1 mice of each sex for up to 2 years. The same control groups were used for the chlorinated water and chloraminated water studies. Groups of 9 or 10 rats or mice of each sex were evaluated at 14 or 15 weeks and 66 weeks. Survival at 2 years of rats and mice receiving chloraminated water was similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of high-dose rats and dosed mice were lower than those of their respective control groups. There was a dose-related decrease in water consumption by rats and mice. Water consumption during the second year of the studies by high-dose rats was 34% lower than controls for males and 31% lower than controls for females; water consumption by high-dose mice was 42% lower than controls for males and 40% lower than controls for females. Mononuclear cell leukemia occurred with a marginally increased incidence in the mid- and high-dose female rats receiving chloraminated water (control, 8/50; low dose, 11/50; mid dose, 15/50; and high dose, 16/50). As in female rats receiving chlorinated water, the proportion of female rats that died of leukemia before the end of the study and t that died of leukemia before the end of the study and the mean time for observation of animals dying with leukemia were similar among all dose groups and controls. The marginal increase in leukemia incidence in females receiving chloraminated water was considered equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity for the same reasons given for female rats receiving chlorinated water. There were no neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions in male rats or in male or female mice that were clearly associated with the consumption of chloraminated water. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year drinking water studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of chlorinated water in male F344/N rats receiving 70, 140, or 275 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of chlorinated water in female F344/N rats based on an increase in the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of chlorinated water in male or female B6C3F1 mice receiving 70, 140, or 275 ppm. Under the conditions of these 2-year drinking water studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of chloraminated water in male F344/N rats receiving 50, 100, or 200 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of chloraminated water in female F344/N rats based on an increase in the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering acetaminophen (purity >99%) in feed to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 14 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and Chinese hamster ovary cells. 14-DAY STUDIES: Rats were fed diets containing 0, 800, 1,600, 3,100, 6,200, or 12,500 ppm acetaminophen, and mice were fed diets containing 0, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm acetaminophen. There were no deaths among any groups during the study; the final mean body weight of male rats that received 12,500 ppm was significantly lower than that of the controls. Final mean body weights of male and female mice and female rats that received acetaminophen were similar to those of the controls. Feed consumption by male and female rats that received 12,500 ppm acetaminophen was lower than that of the controls; feed consumption by all other exposed groups was higher than that of the controls. 13-WEEK STUDIES: Rats and mice were fed diets containing 0, 800, 1,600, 3,200, 6,200, 12,500, or 25,000 ppm acetaminophen. Two male and two female rats, and one male and one female mouse that received 25,000 ppm, and two male mice that received 12,500 ppm died from acetaminophen-related toxicity before the end of the studies. Final mean body weights of male and female rats and mice that received 12,500 or 25,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. The patterns of feed consumption and reduced body weights that occurred among rats and mice that received diets containing 12,500 or 25,000 ppm were indicative of poor feed palatability. Acetaminophen-related lesions were observed in the liver (necrosis, chronic active inflammation, hepatocytomegaly), kidney (tubule cast, tubule necrosis, tubule regeneration), reproductive organs (atrophy of testis, ovary, and uterus), thymus and lymph nodes (lymphoid depletion) of rats that received 25,000 ppm, and of the live (chronic active inflammation, hepatocytomegaly) and testis (atrophy) of male rats receiving 12,500 ppm. Compound-related lesions in mice were found in the liver (hepatocytomegaly, focal calcification, pigmentation, necrosis) of males that received 6,200, 12,500, or 25,000 ppm and females that received 12,000 or 25,000 ppm. Dose selection for the 2-year studies was based on reduced body weights and the liver lesions observed in rats and mice at 12,500 and 25,000 ppm. 2-YEAR STUDIES: Diets containing 0, 600, 3,000, or 6,000 ppm acetaminophen were given continuously to groups of 60 rats and mice of each sex for up to 104 weeks. After 65 weeks of exposure, 10 animals from each group were evaluated for histopathology and for hematology, urinalysis, and clinical chemistry parameters. Survival and mean body weights of rats that received acetaminophen were similar to those of the controls throughout the study. The average severity of nephropathy was increased in exposed male and female rats. In males this was associated with an increased incidence of parathyroid hyperplasia (renal hyperparathyroidism). The incidence of focal renal tubule hyperplasia was also increased in exposed male rats. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was increased in exposed female rats and was significantly increased in the 6,000 ppm group (9/50; 17/50; 15/50; 24/50). Survival of exposed and control mice was similar throughout the study. Mean body weights of mice that received acetaminophen were generally lower than those of the controls throughout the study. Although the incidence of thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia increased with dose among groups of exposed male and female mice, there was no increase in the incidence of follicular cell neoplasms. Renal tubule hyperplasia occurred in one low-dose and two high-dose males and a renal tubule adenoma was present in one low-dose and one high-dose male. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Acetaminophen was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, or TA98 witr TA98 with or without S9. In cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells, acetaminophen induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in both the presence and absence of S9. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of acetaminophen in male F344/N rats that received 600, 3,000, or 6,000 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of acetaminophen in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of acetaminophen in male and female B6C3F1 mice that received 600, 3,000, or 6,000 ppm. Nonneoplastic lesions associated with exposure to acetaminophen included increased severity of nephropathy and increased incidences of renal tubule hyperplasia and parathyroid hyperplasia in male rats, increased severity of nephropathy in female rats, and increased incidences of thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia in male and female mice.

Direct Blue 15 (CAS No. 2429-74-5) in F344 Rats (Drinking Water Studies).,1-245,"C.I. Direct Blue 15 is one of five chemicals being evaluated in 2-year carcinogenicity and toxicity studies as part of the NTP's Benzidine Dye Initiative. This Initiative was designed to evaluate representative benzidine congeners, benzidine congener-derived dyes, and benzidine-derived dyes. The dye, industrial grade C.I. Direct Blue 15, was chosen for study as a product to which workers are potentially exposed. Because of the high salt content, the dye was desalted prior to use. The purity was determined to be approximately 50%, with high-performance liquid chromatography indicating one major peak and approximately 35 impurities. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering the dye, C.I. Direct Blue 15, in drinking water to groups of F344/N rats of each sex for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 22 months. Planned as 24-month studies, the 22-month studies were terminated early because of rapidly declining animal survival, which was due primarily to neoplasia. These studies were performed only in rats because studies of benzidine congeners were being performed in mice at the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR). Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and Chinese hamster ovary cells. 14-Day Studies: Rats were given C.I. Direct Blue 15 in drinking water at doses of 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, or 30,000 ppm. All control and treated rats survived. Body weight gain in high-dose females was less than that in controls. Water consumption declined as the dose increased. Male and female rats receiving 30,000 ppm had slight degeneration and necrosis of individual hepatocytes in the liver, and females also had mild to moderate renal tubule degeneration and thymic lymphoid depletion. 13-Week Studies: C.I. Direct Blue 15 was administered in drinking water at doses of 0, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, or 30,000 ppm to male rats, and at doses of 0, 630, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm to female rats. Seven of 10 male rats receiving 30,000 ppm died; all rats in the other groups survived until the end of the studies. Mean final body weights of males receiving 10,000 or 30,000 ppm were 92% and 69% of those of controls, and mean final body weights of females receiving 5,000 or 10,000 ppm were 97% and 94% of those of controls. Tissues from treated animals were stained blue. Compound-related lesions were seen in the kidney and liver of male rats given 30,000 ppm and in the kidney of males and females given 10,000 ppm. The renal lesions included necrosis, degeneration, pigmentation and regeneration of the tubule epithelium, and tubule mineralization. Liver lesions included centrilobular hepatocellular degeneration, fatty metamorphosis, and individual cell necrosis with slight periportal hepatocellular hypertrophy. Lymphoid depletion in the thymus was also seen in the high-dose males. Based on the results of the 14-day and 13-week studies, the high dose chosen for the 22-month studies was 2,500 ppm. 22-Month Studies: At study initiation, 70 rats of each sex were given 0 or 2,500 ppm C.I. Direct Blue 15, 45 rats of each sex were given 630 ppm, and 75 rats of each sex were given 1,250 ppm. Interim evaluations were made at 9 and 15 months. The average amounts of compound consumed per day by the six dose groups after week 52 of the studies were estimated to be 45, 90, and 215 mg/kg for male rats and 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg for female rats. Survival and Body Weights: The studies were terminated at 22 months due to extensive mortality associated with chemical-related neoplasia. Survival of control, 630, 1,250, and 2,500 ppm males at 22 months was 37/50, 8/35, 11/65, and 2/50; survival of females was 40/50, 13/35, 22/65, and 4/50. At 22 months, the mean final body weights of the 630, 1,250, and 2,500 ppm groups were 95%, 91%, and 81% of those of the control for male rats and 91% of those of the control for all female dose groups. Histopathologic Effects in the 22-Month Studies: At the 9-month interim evaluations, one adenoma of the Zymbal's gland was seen in a high-dose male rat, and three carcinmbal's gland was seen in a high-dose male rat, and three carcinomas of the clitoral gland were seen in the high-dose females. At the 15-month interim evaluations, Zymbal's gland neoplasms were seen in low- and high-dose males and all treated female dose groups. Mid- and high-dose males and females also had preputial or clitoral gland neoplasms, and a few neoplasms were present in the skin, small and large intestine, liver, and oral cavity of treated animals at 15 months. At the end of the study, neoplasms related to chemical administration were found in the Zymbal's gland, skin, oral cavity, and the preputial or clitoral gland in both male and female rats. Neoplasms related to chemical administration were also seen at other sites including the small and large intestine, liver, uterus, and brain. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was also increased in treated rats. Genetic Toxicology: C.I. Direct Blue 15 was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA98 when tested in a standard preincubation protocol with or without exogenous metabolic activation; however, when a specialized reductive metabolism protocol was used, C.I. Direct Blue demonstrated mutagenic activity in Salmonella strain TA1538. C.I. Direct Blue 15 did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells with or without S9 activation; reductive metabolism was not used in these cytogenetic tests. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 22-month drinking water studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Direct Blue 15 (desalted industrial grade) in male F344/N rats, as indicated by benign and malignant neoplasms of the skin, Zymbal's gland, preputial gland, liver, oral cavity, and small and large intestine. Increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and neoplasms of the brain may have been related to chemical administration. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Direct Blue 15 in female F344/N rats, as indicated by benign and malignant neoplasms of the skin, Zymbal's gland, clitoral gland, liver, oral cavity, small and large intestine, and uterus, and by mononuclear cell leukemia.

The technical product used in these studies, Firemaster FF-1(R)), is a mixture of brominated biphenyls. Firemaster FF-1(R)) is a known liver carcinogen in rats and mice and is one of three compounds chosen by the National Toxicology Program to investigate the potential value of perinatal exposures in assessing chemical carcinogenicity. Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies of polybrominated biphenyls (Firemaster FF-1(R)) were conducted in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex. The studies were designed to determine: a) the effects of polybrominated biphenyls in rats and mice receiving adult ( F1) exposure only (a typical carcinogenicity study), b) the toxic and carcinogenic effects of polybrominated biphenyls in rats and mice receiving perinatal (F0) exposure only (dietary exposure of dams prior to breeding and throughout gestation and lactation), and c) the effects of combined perinatal and adult exposure to polybrominated biphenyls. STUDIES IN F344/N RATS: The exposure levels selected for F1 exposure, based on studies of polybrominated biphenyls in the literature, were 3, 10, and 30 ppm. In a preliminary study to determine the perinatal dietary concentrations for the 2-year study, female rats were administered 1 to 30 ppm polybrominated biphenyls in the feed beginning 60 days prior to breeding and continuing throughout gestation, lactation, and up to 4 weeks postweaning. The mean preweaning litter weight of the 30 ppm group was less than 80% of the mean litter weight of the control group at days 0, 4, and 12. At weaning, the mean weight of litters in this group was 80% of the control group mean. The final mean body weights (28 days after weaning) of males and females receiving 30 ppm were 13% to 19% lower than the final mean body weights of the controls. Therefore, dietary concentrations of 0, 1, 3, and 10 ppm were selected for the F0 exposure levels in the 2-year study. The eight F0 F1 exposure combinations selected for the 2-year study are shown in the following table (see page 6 of full technical report). Adult-Only Exposure The major organ affected by toxicity of polybrominated biphenyls was the liver. Rats evaluated at 9 months had decreased body weights, hepatomegaly, nonneoplastic histopathologic changes in the liver, mild anemia, increases in serum cholesterol concentrations, and decreases in serum triglyceride concentrations (males only). In rats receiving adult only exposure (F0 F1 concentrations of 0:10 or 0:30 ppm), there were no significant effects on survival. Mean body weights were significantly reduced in 0:10 and 0:30 ppm male rats and in 0:30 ppm female rats. Males and females exposed to 0:10 or 0:30 ppm had increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms (males: 0:0 ppm, 1/50; 0:10 ppm, 12/49; 0:30 ppm, 41/50; females: 0/50,12/50, 39/50). Increased incidences of the following nonneoplastic lesions were associated with the administration of polybrominated biphenyls: eosinophilic foci, cytoplasmic vacuolization, oval cell hyperplasia, and hypertrophy in the liver of males and females; acanthosis, inflammation, and ulceration of the forestomach in exposed males; and cystic endometrial hyperplasia of the uterus in 0:30 ppm females. Perinatal-Only Exposure For rats receiving only perinatal exposure (10:0 ppm), there were no changes in survival or body weights compared to the 0:0 ppm control groups. In female rats, there were no effects on neoplasm incidences, but perinatal exposure was associated with a marginally increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma in male rats (0:0 ppm, 1/50; 10:0 ppm, 5/50). The incidences of nonneoplastic lesions in the liver were increased in exposed males (eosinophilic foci and cytoplasmic vacuolization) and females (eosinophilic foci). Combined Perinatal and Adult Exposure Combined perinatal and adult exposure resulted in marginally reduced survival compared to the 0:0 ppm control group for male rats in the 3:10, 10:10, and 10:30 ppm groups. No significant survival differences were obseant survival differences were observed in female rats. The final mean body weights of male and female rats receiving 3:10,10:10, or 10:30 ppm were lower than those of the 0:0 ppm controls. In male rats, there were no enhancing effects of combined perinatal and adult exposure on the incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms. However, perinatal exposure enhanced the development of liver neoplasms in female rats receiving 10 or 30 ppm adult exposure. A combined analysis of all male and female exposure groups also revealed increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia that were considered related to polybrominated biphenyls exposure. STUDIES IN B6C3F1 MICE: The exposure levels selected for the F1 exposure, based on studies of polybrominated biphenyls in the literature, were 3,10, and 30 ppm. In a preliminary study to determine the perinatal dietary concentrations for the 2-year study, female C57BL/6N mice were exposed to 1 to 30 ppm polybrominated biphenyls in the feed beginning 60 days before breeding to C3H/HeN males, continuing throughout gestation and lactation and up to 4 weeks postweaning. There were no clear chemical-related effects on survival or growth at any phase of the study; therefore, 0, 3,10, and 30 ppm dietary concentrations were selected for the F0 exposure levels in the 2-year study. The eight F0 F1 exposure combinations selected for the 2-year study are shown in the table below (see page 7 of full technical report). Adult-Only Exposure The major organ affected by toxicity of polybrominated biphenyls was the liver. Animals evaluated at 9 months had lower body weights than the controls, hepatomegaly, and histopathologic changes in the liver. In mice receiving adult-only exposure, no males or females in the 0:30 ppm group survived to the end of the study. Neither survival nor body weights were affected in the 0:10 ppm groups. Males and females receiving 0:10 or 0:30 ppm had markedly increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms (males: 0:0 ppm, 16/50; 0:10 ppm, 48/49; 0:30 ppm, 48/50; females: 5/50, 42/50, 47/48). Increased incidences of nonneoplastic liver lesions including cytomegaly (hypertrophy), fatty change (cytoplasmic vacuolization), bile duct hyperplasia, eosinophilic and clear cell foci, and necrosis of individual hepatocytes were related to treatment with polybrominated biphenyls. Increased incidences and severity of chronic nephropathy in the kidney and excessive hematopoiesis in the spleen of 0:30 ppm males and females were also considered to be related to exposure to polybrominated biphenyls. Perinatal-Only Exposure There were no survival or body weight differences in mice receiving only perinatal exposure (30:0 ppm). Perinatal exposure resulted in significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms in males and females. The incidences of nonneoplastic lesions (cytomegaly, eosinophilic foci, clear cell foci) were increased in males and females. Combined Perinatal and Adult Exposure Combined perinatal and adult exposure resulted in markedly reduced survival for females in the 30:10 ppm group; no mice receiving 30:30 ppm survived to the end of the study. In those groups receiving adult exposure of 30 ppm, mean body weights were not affected. The incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms in male and female mice was significantly increased. At the 9-month interim evaluation the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas was significantly increased in males (0:30 ppm, 1/10; 30:30 ppm, 7/10). The incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in 30:30 ppm females was similar to that of 0:30 ppm females (0:30 ppm, 0/10; 30:30 ppm, 3/10). At the end of the study the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in males was statistically increased (0:30 ppm, 42/50; 30:30 ppm, 48/50). The incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in 30:30 ppm females was statistically decreased compared to that of 0:30 ppm females (0:30 ppm, 46/48; 30:30 ppm, 41/47). It was not possible to assess the potential enhancing effect of combined perinatal and adult exposure on hepatocellular neoplasms because adult-only exposure resulted in such high (84&percnt; to 98&percnt;) liver neoplasm incidences. CONCLUSIONS: Adult-Only Exposure Under the conditions of these 2-year, adult-only, dietary exposure studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for polybrominated biphenyls in male and female F344/N rats and male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms. Perinatal-Only Exposure Perinatal exposure alone (through dietary administration of 10:0 ppm polybrominated biphenyls to the dams) had no effect on the incidences of neoplasms in female F344/N rats, but in male F344/N rats, perinatal exposure was associated with a marginally increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas that may have been related to chemical administration. In male and female B6C3F1 mice, perinatal exposure to 30:0 ppm polybrominated biphenyls resulted in significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms. The incidences of a number of nonneoplastic lesions in the liver (cytomegaly, eosinophilic focus, and clear cell focus) were increased in male and female B6C3F1 mice. Combined Perinatal and Adult Exposure Combined perinatal and adult dietary exposure to polybrominated biphenyls confirmed findings of the adult-only exposures for the increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. In male F344/N rats, there were no enhancing effects of combined perinatal and adult exposure. However, perinatal exposure enhanced the susceptibility of female F344/N rats receiving adult exposure of 10 or 30 ppm to the induction of liver neoplasms. For male and female F344/N rats, a combined analysis of the incidences of leukemia in the adult-only, perinatal-only, and combined perinatal and adult exposure groups revealed an apparent association between increasing incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and exposure to polybrominated biphenyls. In male and female B6C3F1 mice, it was not possible to adequately assess the enhancing effects of combined perinatal and adult exposure on hepatocellular neoplasms, because adult-only exposure to 10 or 30 ppm polybrominated biphenyls resulted in high incidences (84&percnt; to 98&percnt;) of liver neoplasms. However, with increased perinatal exposure, there were increases in the numbers of B6C3F1 mice with hepatocellular carcinomas and in the numbers of B6C3F1 mice with multiple hepatocellular adenomas, which suggests an enhancement of polybrominated biphenyls-related hepatocellular carcinogenicity associated with perinatal exposure.

We compared the efficacy of imatinib with that of interferon alfa combined with low-dose cytarabine in newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1106 patients to receive imatinib (553 patients) or interferon alfa plus low-dose cytarabine (553 patients). Crossover to the alternative group was allowed if stringent criteria defining treatment failure or intolerance were met. Patients were evaluated for hematologic and cytogenetic responses, toxic effects, and rates of progression. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 19 months, the estimated rate of a major cytogenetic response (0 to 35 percent of cells in metaphase positive for the Philadelphia chromosome) at 18 months was 87.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 84.1 to 90.0) in the imatinib group and 34.7 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29.3 to 40.0) in the group given interferon alfa plus cytarabine (P<0.001). The estimated rates of complete cytogenetic response were 76.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 72.5 to 79.9) and 14.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 10.5 to 18.5), respectively (P<0.001). At 18 months, the estimated rate of freedom from progression to accelerated-phase or blast-crisis CML was 96.7 percent in the imatinib group and 91.5 percent in the combination-therapy group (P<0.001). Imatinib was better tolerated than combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of hematologic and cytogenetic responses, tolerability, and the likelihood of progression to accelerated-phase or blast-crisis CML, imatinib was superior to interferon alfa plus low-dose cytarabine as first-line therapy in newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML.","[""O'Brien, Stephen G"", 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Gathmann, Insa', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Hughes, Timothy', 'Lechner, Klaus', 'Nielsen, Johan L', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Shepherd, John', 'Simonsson, Bengt', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Goldman, John M', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Taylor, Kerry', 'Verhoef, Gregor', 'Bolton, Ann E', 'Capdeville, Renaud', 'Druker, Brian J']","[""O'Brien SG"", 'Guilhot F', 'Larson RA', 'Gathmann I', 'Baccarani M', 'Cervantes F', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Fischer T', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hughes T', 'Lechner K', 'Nielsen JL', 'Rousselot P', 'Reiffers J', 'Saglio G', 'Shepherd J', 'Simonsson B', 'Gratwohl A', 'Goldman JM', 'Kantarjian H', 'Taylor K', 'Verhoef G', 'Bolton AE', 'Capdeville R', 'Druker BJ']","['University of Newcastle, Newcastle, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",2003/03/15 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2003/03/15 04:00'],"['2003/03/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1056/NEJMoa022457 [doi]', '348/11/994 [pii]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2003 Mar 13;348(11):994-1004. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa022457.,['IRIS Investigators'],,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,['Copyright 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society'],"['N Engl J Med. 2003 Mar 13;348(11):1048-50.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The initial part of the study defined the MTD and DLT in solid tumors. The second part of the study defined the MTD and DLT in acute leukemia. RESULTS: The starting dose of clofarabine (15 mg/m(2)) was myelosuppressive, requiring several dose de-escalations to 2 mg/m(2), the dose suggested for phase II studies in solid tumors. Dose escalation in acute leukemia started at 7.5 mg/m(2), with several escalations to 55 mg/m(2). The DLT was reversible hepatotoxicity at 55 mg/m(2). The recommended dose for acute leukemia phase II studies was 40 mg/m(2). Among 32 treated patients with acute leukemia, two achieved a complete response and three had a marrow complete response without platelet recovery (hematologic improvement), for an overall response rate of 16%. At 40 mg/m(2), the median plasma clofarabine level was 1.5 micro mol/L (range, 0.42 to 3.2 micro mol/L; n = 7). Cellular and plasma pharmacokinetic studies suggested dose proportionality but showed a wide variation in intracellular concentrations of clofarabine triphosphate. CONCLUSION: This phase I study defined the following two MTDs for clofarabine given as a 1-hour infusion daily for 5 days: 2 mg/m(2) for solid tumors, the DLT being myelosuppression; and 40 mg/m(2) for acute leukemia, the DLT being hepatotoxicity.

METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of the risk of secondary leukemia or myelodysplasia after a solid tumor in childhood within the Societe Francaise d'Oncologie Pediatrique, including 61 patients with leukemia matched with 196 controls. The characteristics of the first cancer, the patient's family history of cancer, and the treatment (type, cumulative dose of chemotherapy, schedule of etoposide administration, and radiation dose delivered to active bone marrow) were compared in the two groups. RESULTS: Only two factors were found to increase the risk of leukemia in multivariate analysis, namely, the type of the first tumor, with an excess risk in patients with Hodgkin's disease (relative risk 6.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6 to 24) or osteosarcoma (relative risk 5; 95% CI, 1.3 to 19), and exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines. The risk of leukemia increased regularly with the cumulative dose of etoposide. In summary, patients who received between 1.2 and 6 g/m(2) of epipodophyllotoxins or more than 170 mg/m(2) of anthracyclines had a seven-fold higher risk (95% CI, 2.6 to 19) compared with patients who received lower doses or none of these drugs. The risk of leukemia in patients who received more than 6 g/m(2) of epipodophyllotoxins was multiplied by 197 (95% CI, 19 to 2,058). The risk of leukemia was not increased by exposure to alkylating agents or radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Both epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines increase the risk of secondary leukemia. The current challenge is to minimize the mutagenic effects of these drugs by diminishing cumulative doses without losing the therapeutic benefits.","['Le Deley, Marie-Cecile', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Shamsaldin, Akthar', 'Raquin, Marie-Anne', 'Lacour, Brigitte', 'Sommelet, Daniele', 'Chompret, Agnes', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Bayle, Chantal', 'Bernheim, Alain', 'de Vathaire, Florent', 'Vassal, Gilles', 'Hill, Catherine']","['Le Deley MC', 'Leblanc T', 'Shamsaldin A', 'Raquin MA', 'Lacour B', 'Sommelet D', 'Chompret A', 'Cayuela JM', 'Bayle C', 'Bernheim A', 'de Vathaire F', 'Vassal G', 'Hill C']","['Biostatistics and Epidemiology Unit, the Radiophysics Unit, the Department of Pediatric Oncology, the Cytogenetics Laboratory, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France. le_deley@igr.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",2003/03/15 04:00,2003/04/11 05:00,['2003/03/15 04:00'],"['2003/03/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.04.100 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Mar 15;21(6):1074-81. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.04.100.,"[""Societe Francaise d'Oncologie Pediatrique""]",,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective review of FDA archival documents and the published literature. RESULTS: More than 100 drugs have been approved by the Division of Oncology Drug Products of the FDA for the treatment of malignancies. Only 15 have pediatric use information in their labeling, which is less than 50% of the drugs commonly used in the treatment of pediatric malignancies. In the past 20 years, there have been six submissions to the FDA for pediatric oncology indications. To illustrate principles of the approval process, each submission is discussed. CONCLUSION: Potential reasons for a lack of New Drug Application submissions for pediatric oncology include the small pediatric oncology market compared with the adult oncology market and perceived barriers to performing studies in children. Reasons for failure to approve pediatric indications include small numbers of patients, lack of appropriate controls, and failure to demonstrate patient benefit. Approval criteria include the use of controlled trials, prospective data collection, and disease-appropriate end points.

This study was conducted to define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of its combination with cytarabine (ara-C), idarubicin, or topotecan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), advanced myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP) were initially randomly assigned to receive troxacitabine 5.0 mg/m(2) by intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes on days 1 to 5 with ara-C 1.0 g/m(2)/d IV [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] over 2 hours on days 1 to 5, idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) by 5 minute IV infusion on days 1 to 3, or topotecan 1.0 mg/m(2) as an continuous IV infusion on days 1 to 5. Doses were then adjusted to define DLT for each combination. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients (68 AML, eight MDS, 11 CML-BP) were treated. DLTs were hepatic transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and hand foot syndrome (HFS) on the troxacitabine plus ara-C combination. The recommended phase II doses were 6 mg/m(2) once a day for 5 days and 1.0g/m(2) once a day for 5 days, respectively. DLTs were diarrhea, rash, and mucositis on the troxacitabine plus topotecan combination. The recommended phase II doses were 4 mg/m(2) once a day for 5 days and 0.75 mg/m(2) once a day for 5 days, respectively. DLTs were HFS, rash, and mucositis on the troxacitabine plus idarubicin combination. The recommended phase II doses were 4 mg/m(2) once a day for 5 days and 9 mg/m(2) once a day for 3 days, respectively. Among 74 evaluable patients with AML or MDS, 10 (13%) achieved complete remission and four (5%) had hematologic improvement. Two of 11 (18%) evaluable patients with CML-BP returned to chronic phase.

Gene marking studies suggest that occult tumor cells within the autograft may contribute to clinical relapse. To date purging of autografts contaminated with cancer cells has been unsuccessful. The selective oncolytic property of reovirus against myriad malignant histologies in in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo systems has been previously demonstrated. In the present study we have shown that reovirus can successfully purge cancer cells within autografts. Human monocytic and myeloma cell lines as well as enriched ex vivo lymphoma, myeloma, and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia patient tumor specimens were used in an experimental purging model. Viability of the cell lines or purified ex vivo tumor cells of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and small lymphocytic lymphoma was significantly reduced after reovirus treatment. Further, [35S]-methionine labeling and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of cellular proteins demonstrated reovirus protein synthesis and disruption of host cell protein synthesis as early as 24 hours. Admixtures of apheresis product with the abovementioned tumor cells and cell lines treated with reovirus showed complete purging of disease. In contrast, reovirus purging of enriched ex vivo multiple myeloma, Burkitt lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma was incomplete. The oncolytic action of reovirus did not affect CD34+ stem cells or their long-term colony-forming assays even after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulation. Our results indicate the ex vivo use of an unattenuated oncolytic virus as an attractive purging strategy for autologous stem cell transplantations.","['Thirukkumaran, Chandini M', 'Luider, Joanne M', 'Stewart, Douglas A', 'Cheng, Tina', 'Lupichuk, Sasha M', 'Nodwell, Michael J', 'Russell, James A', 'Auer, Iwona A', 'Morris, Donald G']","['Thirukkumaran CM', 'Luider JM', 'Stewart DA', 'Cheng T', 'Lupichuk SM', 'Nodwell MJ', 'Russell JA', 'Auer IA', 'Morris DG']","['Calgary Laboratory Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Blood Component Removal/methods', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cell Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Mammalian orthoreovirus 3/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Transplantation, Autologous/methods']",2003/03/15 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/03/15 04:00'],"['2003/03/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2508 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54020-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 1;102(1):377-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2508.

The abnormalities are generally recurring deletions or chromosomal loss and involve precisely the same chromosomes with the same frequency as has been described in marrow cells from patients with secondary acute leukemia induced by alkylating agents. Reasoning that acquired Fanconi anemia protein dysfunction might contribute to cytogenetic instability in secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, we analyzed leukemic cells bearing characteristic complex cytogenetic defects obtained from a 68-year-old man whose lymphoblasts showed no evidence of Fanconi anemia. Unlike the lymphoblasts, this myeloid leukemia cell line (UoC-M1) was hypersensitive to mitomycin-C (MMC) and diepoxybutane (DEB) and exhibited a marked decrease in nuclear FANCA, FANCG, and FANCD2-L. Retroviral transduction of FANCA significantly reduced MMC sensitivity but FANCF, FANCG, and FANCC did not. Overexpression of FANCA restored levels of both FANCA and FANCG, whereas overexpression of FANCG or FANCC did not restore FANCA levels. The molecular mass of cytoplasmic FANCA, FANCG, FANCC, and nuclear FANCD2 were normal. All exons of FANCA and FANCG were sequenced, and no mutations were found. We conclude that perturbations of as yet unidentified factors that govern the binding activity or intracellular localization of FANCA may promote cytogenetic instability and clonal progression in patients with AML who do not have Fanconi anemia.","['Lensch, M William', 'Tischkowitz, Marc', 'Christianson, Tracy A', 'Reifsteck, Carol A', 'Speckhart, S Ashley', 'Jakobs, Petra M', ""O'Dwyer, Michael E"", 'Olson, Susan B', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Hodgson, Shirley V', 'Mathew, Christopher G', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bagby, Grover C Jr']","['Lensch MW', 'Tischkowitz M', 'Christianson TA', 'Reifsteck CA', 'Speckhart SA', 'Jakobs PM', ""O'Dwyer ME"", 'Olson SB', 'Le Beau MM', 'Hodgson SV', 'Mathew CG', 'Larson RA', 'Bagby GC Jr']","['OHSU Cancer Institute, CR145, Hatfield Research Center, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, Portland, OR 97201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', '*Chromosome Aberrations/chemically induced', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Proteins/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/03/15 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/03/15 04:00'],"['2003/03/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2781 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)53969-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 1;102(1):7-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2781.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can selectively induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In overnight assays, combinations of PS-341 and TRAIL were much more effective than either agent alone in promoting apoptosis of a murine myeloid leukemia, C1498, and a murine renal cancer, Renca. For C1498 cells, apoptosis sensitization by PS-341 affected neither the activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) nor the levels of most antiapoptotic proteins. However, reductions in the antiapoptotic protein c-FLIP in response to PS-341 were observed in both C1498 and Renca cells. Treatment of normal bone marrow mixed with C1498 tumor cells for 18 hours with a combination of PS-341 and TRAIL resulted in a specific depletion of the tumor cells. Upon transfer to irradiated syngeneic recipient mice, mixtures treated with the PS-341 plus TRAIL combination resulted in enhanced long-term tumor-free survival of mice.

Gene expression analysis of MLL-rearranged B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (MLL B-ALLs) has identified these cases as a unique subtype of leukemia, characterized by the expression of genes associated with both lymphoid and myeloid hematopoietic lineages. Here we show that MLL fusions also generate a distinct genetic subtype of T-lineage ALL (MLL T-ALL), in which leukemic cells are characterized by an early arrest in thymocyte differentiation, with suggestive evidence of commitment to the gammadelta lineage. Interestingly, multiple genes linked to cell proliferation (eg, PCNA, MYC, CDK2, and POLA) were down-regulated in MLL-fusion samples, relative to those transformed by other T-ALL oncogenes (P <.000 001, Fisher exact test). Overall, MLL T-ALL cases consistently demonstrated increased levels of expression of a subset of major HOX genes--HOXA9, HOXA10, and HOXC6--and the MEIS1 HOX coregulator (P <.008, one-sided Wilcoxon test), a pattern of gene expression that was reiterated in MLL B-ALLs. However, expression of myeloid lineage genes, previously reported in MLL B-ALLs, was not identified in T-lineage cases with this abnormality, suggesting that myeloid gene dysregulation is dispensable in leukemic transformation mediated by MLL fusion proteins. Our findings implicate dysregulation of HOX gene family members as a dominant mechanism of leukemic transformation induced by chimeric MLL oncogenes.","['Ferrando, Adolfo A', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Korsmeyer, Stanley J', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Ferrando AA', 'Armstrong SA', 'Neuberg DS', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB', 'Korsmeyer SJ', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Mayer-630, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2003/03/15 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/03/15 04:00'],"['2003/03/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3221 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54003-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 1;102(1):262-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3221.

However, the mechanisms that contribute to the expression of Mcl-1 in these cells have not been fully characterized. The present study focused on the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in regulation of Mcl-1 in macrophages. Sodium salicylate (NaSal) treatment induced apoptotic cell death in primary human macrophages in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Incubation with NaSal resulted in the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the release of cytochrome c and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP binding protein with low pH of isoelectric point (pI) from the mitochondria, and the activation of caspases 9 and 3. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that NaSal down-regulated the expression of Mcl-1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Western blot analysis for phosphorylated STAT3 demonstrated that STAT3 was constitutively activated in macrophages and that this STAT3 activation was suppressed by NaSal. The activation of STAT3 in macrophages was dependent on Ser727 phosphorylation, in the absence of detectable Tyr705 phosphorylation. Ectopic expression of STAT3 in murine RAW264.7 macrophages rescued the inhibition of Mcl-1 promoter-reporter gene activation and the cell death induced by NaSal treatment, while a dominant-negative STAT3 resulted in cell death. To confirm its role in primary macrophages, STAT3 antisense (AS) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were employed. STAT3 AS, but not control, ODNs decreased STAT3 and Mcl-1 expression and resulted in macrophage apoptosis. These observations demonstrate that the STAT3-mediated expression of Mcl-1 is essential for the survival of primary human in vitro differentiated macrophages.","['Liu, Hongtao', 'Ma, Yingyu', 'Cole, Shawn M', 'Zander, Christopher', 'Chen, Kun-Hung', 'Karras, Jim', 'Pope, Richard M']","['Liu H', 'Ma Y', 'Cole SM', 'Zander C', 'Chen KH', 'Karras J', 'Pope RM']","['Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 303 E Chicago Avenue, Ward 3-315, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism/physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Sodium Salicylate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2003/03/15 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/03/15 04:00'],"['2003/03/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-11-3396 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54015-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 1;102(1):344-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3396.

We investigated whether higher doses of imatinib may be more effective. Thirty-six patients with chronic-phase CML after failure on interferon-alpha were treated with 400 mg imatinib twice daily. Median time from diagnosis was 25 months (range, 10-135 months); 4 patients (11%) had clonal evolution. All 11 patients with active disease achieved complete hematologic response. Excluding patients with fewer than 35% Ph-positive metaphases before the start of therapy, 19 (90%) of 21 evaluable patients achieved a major cytogenetic response. Of 27 evaluable patients, 24 (89%) achieved a complete cytogenetic response. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed in bone marrow every 3 months. Of 32 evaluable patients, 18 (56%) showed BCR-ABL/ABL percentage ratios lower than 0.045%, including 13 (41%) with undetectable levels. With a median follow-up of 15 months, all patients were alive in chronic phase. Toxicities were similar to those reported with standard dose; 71% of patients continue to receive 600 mg or more of imatinib daily. In conclusion, high-dose imatinib induces complete cytogenetic responses in most patients with chronic-phase CML after interferon failure.

This region is amplified in a subset of primary B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), suggesting that increased copy number of a gene(s) located in this region confers a growth advantage to some primary human lymphomas. We examined a diverse panel of lymphoid malignancies for the expression of MCT-1. We demonstrated that there are significantly increased levels of MCT-1 protein in a panel of T-cell lymphoid cell lines and in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines. Furthermore, we identified a subset of primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas that exhibited elevated levels of MCT-1 protein. Interestingly, all transformed follicular lymphomas in our study demonstrated elevated protein levels of MCT-1. There was no detectable MCT-1 protein in leukemic cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or in any healthy lymphoid tissue examined. Lymphoid cell lines overexpressing MCT-1 exhibited increased growth rates and displayed increased protection against apoptosis induced by serum starvation when compared with matched controls. We found that MCT-1-overexpressing cells show constitutively higher levels of phosphorylated PKB/Akt protein, especially under serum starvation. Activation of survival pathways may be an additional function of the MCT-1 gene. Our data suggest that high levels of MCT-1 protein may be associated with a high-risk subset of lymphoid neoplasms and may further support the potential role of MCT-1 in promoting human lymphoid tumor development.","['Shi, Bo', 'Hsu, Hsin-Ling', 'Evens, Andy M', 'Gordon, Leo I', 'Gartenhaus, Ronald B']","['Shi B', 'Hsu HL', 'Evens AM', 'Gordon LI', 'Gartenhaus RB']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 303 E Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*etiology/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/03/15 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/03/15 04:00'],"['2003/03/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-11-3486 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54008-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 1;102(1):297-302. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3486.

Although most of these compounds are not used in pediatric leukemias, the concepts surrounding their clinical development are important to all pediatric hematologists/oncologists.","['Mantadakis, Elpis', 'Kalmanti, Maria']","['Mantadakis E', 'Kalmanti M']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Clinic, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Nucleosides/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",2003/03/15 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/03/15 04:00'],"['2003/03/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['BL1KFEQKDBX0DNX4 [pii]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2003 Apr-May;20(3):173-85.,,70,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nucleosides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean age of patients was 50 (range 15-60). The induction regimen (FLAG-Ida) included fludarabine (30 mg/sqm), Ara-C (2 g/sqm) on days 1-5, and idarubicin (10 mg/sqm) on days 1, 3, 5. G-CSF (300 mcg/day) was administered s.c. 12 hours before starting fludarabine and was continued for five days. HDT with stem cell rescue was planned for all patients in first CR after one course of high dose Ara-C (HDAC) consolidation and in good clinical conditions. Forty-two (98%) patients were evaluable for response. One patient died during induction (2%). CR was achieved in 35 patients (82%). Twenty-three patients, 66% of those achieving CR, underwent autologous (N = 17) or allogeneic (N = 6) transplantation.

In trial NHL-BFM 86, patients were stratified according to the histologic subtype and clinical stage. In the succeeding studies NHL-BFM 90 and 95, treatment stratification was additionally based on the speed of tumor response to therapy and for children with B-cell NHL/B-ALL also on the pre-therapeutic serum lactic dehydrogenase level. Event-free survival rates were 84% +/- 6% in trial NHL-BFM 86 (n = 39) and 86% +/- 4% in both trials NHL-BFM 90 (n = 67) and NHL-BFM 95 (n = 77). Patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma (mainly with T-cell phenotypes) had an excellent prognosis with an ALL-type chemotherapy regimen (n = 49; relapse, n = 1), whereas an intensive, short-pulse therapy delivered within a 2- to 4-month period was found to be highly efficacious in children with B-cell NHL/B-ALL (n = 114; relapse, n = 6; progression, n = 5). Patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) who were treated with similar alternating short courses of multi-agent chemotherapy had a less good outcome (n = 20; relapse, n = 6, progression, n = 3). Children with B-cell NHL and B-ALL who failed initial therapy also had a dismal prognosis (10/11 patients died). Local radiotherapy as a part of lymphoma therapy was completely abandoned in study NHL-BFM 90 and surgical interventions were confined to specific situations such as complete resection in localized B-cell NHL and ALCL, diagnostic biopsy and second-look operation. In conclusion, our results showed that the BFM treatment strategy for lymphoblastic lymphoma and B-cell NHL/B-ALL was highly successful in the majority of patients; however, optimal treatment for children with ALCL has not yet been defined. As a consequence, larger trials at an international level are necessary to find new prognostic markers that might define more precisely those patients who need further intensification of first-line treatment or novel therapy.","['Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Mann, Georg', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Trebo, Monika', 'Urban, Christian', 'Fink, Franz-Martin', 'Horcher, Ernst', 'Reiter, Alfred', 'Riehm, Hansjorg', 'Gadner, Helmut']","['Attarbaschi A', 'Mann G', 'Dworzak M', 'Trebo M', 'Urban C', 'Fink FM', 'Horcher E', 'Reiter A', 'Riehm H', 'Gadner H']","[""St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/03/15 04:00,2003/05/20 05:00,['2003/03/15 04:00'],"['2003/03/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2002 Dec 30;114(23-24):978-86.,['Austrian Cooperative Study Group'],,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of the side effects TLS, anuria, sepsis, and other complications during the first 2 weeks after admission were registered. Until March 1996, no urate oxidase was used (period 1). From November 1997 all children with B-ALL or stage III and IV B-NHL and LDH > or =500 U/l should receive urate oxidase prophylactically (period 3).

Currently, specific translocation markers are available for 40-50% of AMLs. Expression markers may widen this spectrum to 70-90%. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR, real-time PCR) is now as sensitive as conventional two-step PCR and could improve as well as facilitate clinical decision-making. Q-PCR has been applied to a variety of molecular markers, delineating threshold levels early after induction therapy, for postinduction monitoring, as well as for the detection of relapse. For most markers, lack of decline of transcript levels by less than 2 logs after chemotherapy has been established as a poor prognostic sign. Moreover, increases in transcript levels are almost invariably associated with relapse. However, the predictive value of PCR negativity after chemotherapy is not as clear. The major tasks for the future will be standardization of Q-PCR techniques, exact definition of threshold levels, and monitoring schedules in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), as well as investigation of novel markers found by microarray analysis.","['Jaeger, U', 'Kainz, B']","['Jaeger U', 'Kainz B']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, University of Vienna Medical School, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria. ulrich.jaeger@akh-wien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Gene Duplication', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2003/03/14 04:00,2003/05/08 05:00,['2003/03/14 04:00'],"['2002/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2002/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-002-0601-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2003 Mar;82(3):139-47. doi: 10.1007/s00277-002-0601-1.

The exact pathogenetic mechanism(s) that cause increased platelet counts in RA are still unknown. Recent investigations indicate that proinflammatory pleiotropic cytokines of RA also have megakaryocytopoietic/thrombopoietic properties. Moreover, several lineage-dominant hematopoietic cytokines can also act as acute phase responders and contribute to the inflammation. This review focuses on the current literature and our experience regarding the dual relationships of the pathologic thrombopoiesis of RA. Growth factors contributing to it, namely interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, stem cell factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, thrombopoietin (TPO), and the regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis during the inflammatory cascade are reviewed. Some data indicate that thrombopoietin could contribute to the reactive thrombocytosis of RA. In the non-lineage-specific gp130 cytokine family, IL-6 appears to predominate for the induction of megakaryopoiesis. However, other cytokines and growth factors may also contribute to the pathologic megakaryocytopoiesis of RA. Those pleiotropic mediators seem to act in concert to regulate this enigmatic process. Clarification of the pathobiologic basis of thrombopoiesis in RA may improve understanding of the disease pathogenesis and management of the inflammatory thrombocytosis.","['Ertenli, Ihsan', 'Kiraz, Sedat', 'Ozturk, M Akif', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim c', 'Celik, Ismail', 'Calguneri, Meral']","['Ertenli I', 'Kiraz S', 'Ozturk MA', 'Haznedaroglu Ic', 'Celik I', 'Calguneri M']","['Department of Rheumatology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Rheumatol Int,Rheumatology international,8206885,IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications/*immunology', 'Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Growth Substances/immunology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/immunology', 'Thrombocytosis/etiology/*immunology', 'Thrombopoiesis/*physiology']",2003/03/14 04:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/03/14 04:00'],"['2002/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2002/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00296-003-0289-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Rheumatol Int. 2003 Mar;23(2):49-60. doi: 10.1007/s00296-003-0289-0.

After NST, 20/23 patients engrafted. Ten out of 14 patients with uncontrolled disease reached complete remission. A multiplex-PCR using short tandem repeats was used for chimerism analysis and detected mixed chimerism (MC) in 14/22 evaluable patients (64%) after NST. Prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) were given to 11/14 patients with MC; MC converted to complete donor chimerism (CC) in 6/11 patients within 2-6 weeks. All patients with persistent MC with or without DLI relapsed during further follow-up. MC predicted impending relapse 4-52 weeks before clinical diagnosis. Ten of 23 patients (43%) are alive 2-34 months after stem cell transplantation. 12 of 23 patients (52%), have died from leukaemia after NST. One out of 23 patients has died from severe sepsis. In conclusion, NST leads to stable engraftment and complete remission in patients with advanced acute leukaemias. NST can cure a substantial proportion of these patients, but the relapse rate is still high. Repeated chimerism analysis is a useful tool to detect recipient cells, especially in patients without molecular markers of disease and can be used to monitor immunomodulatory therapies. MC is unstable in these patients and predicts impending relapse. Prophylactic DLI can convert MC to CC, which seemed to lower relapse risk.","['Massenkeil, G', 'Nagy, M', 'Lawang, M', 'Rosen, O', 'Genvresse, I', 'Geserick, G', 'Dorken, B', 'Arnold, R']","['Massenkeil G', 'Nagy M', 'Lawang M', 'Rosen O', 'Genvresse I', 'Geserick G', 'Dorken B', 'Arnold R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Charite, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', '*Transplantation Chimera', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",2003/03/14 04:00,2003/10/10 05:00,['2003/03/14 04:00'],"['2003/03/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703859 [doi]', '1703859 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Mar;31(5):339-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703859.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, magnolol did not cause apoptosis in neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors. Apoptosis was determined by detection of DNA fragmentation in gel electrophoresis, morphological alternations by flow cytometry, quantification of phosphatidylserine externalization by Annexin V labeling and oligonucleosomal DNA content by TUNEL labeling. Activation of caspase-9, -3 and -2, and the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were found during apoptosis induced by magnolol. In addition, both pan-caspase and selective caspase-9 inhibitor blocked magnolol-induced apoptosis. The apoptosis could also be partially attenuated by caspase-3 and -2 inhibitors. Magnolol induced the reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the release of cytochrome c into cytoplasm. In conclusion, our findings indicate that magnolol-induced apoptotic signaling is carried out through mitochondria alternations to caspase-9 and that then the downstream effector caspases are activated sequentially.

The presence of uncharacterized rodent cells or crude extracts imposes a risk to the clinical applications of hES cells. While others looked for a replacement of MEFs with human fetal cells, we attempted to use easily accessible postnatal human cells such as human marrow stromal cells (hMSCs). Culture-expanded hMSCs from multiple donors were used as feeder cells to support growth of the H1 hES cell line under a serum-free culture condition. Human ES cell colonies cultured on irradiated hMSCs amplified >100-fold during the 30-day continuous culture (in five passages). The longest continuous expansion of hES cells on hMSCs tested to date is 13 passages. The expanded hES cells displayed the unique morphology and molecular markers characteristic of undifferentiated hES cells as observed when they were cultured on MEFs. They expressed the transcription factor Oct-4, a membrane alkaline phosphatase, and the stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-4, but not the SSEA-1 marker. Expanded hES cells on hMSCs retained unique differentiation potentials in culture and a normal diploid karyotype. The well-studied hMSCs (and this animal cell- and serum-free system) may provide a clinically and ethically feasible method to expand hES cells for novel cell therapies.

The activity of methylated LTR was significantly lower than that of nonmethylated LTR.

The polymerase and polymerase accessory protein are subsequently recruited to these foci. Four stages of viral infection (stages I to IV) have been described previously (J. Burkham, D. M. Coen, and S. K. Weller, J. Virol. 72:10100-10107, 1998). Of these, stage III foci are equivalent to the previously described promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML)-associated prereplicative sites and contain all seven replication proteins. We constructed a series of mutations in the putative primase subunit, UL52, of the helicase-primase and have analyzed the mutant proteins for their abilities to form intermediates leading to the formation of replication compartments. The results shown in this paper are consistent with the model that the five proteins, ICP8, UL5, UL8, UL9, and UL52, form a scaffold and that formation of this scaffold does not rely on enzymatic functions of the helicase and primase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that recruitment of polymerase to this scaffold requires the presence of an active primase subunit. These results suggest that polymerase recruitment to replication foci requires primer synthesis. Furthermore, they support the existence of two types of stage III intermediates in the formation of replication compartments: stage IIIa foci, which form the scaffold, and stage IIIb foci, which contain, in addition, HSV polymerase, the polymerase accessory subunit, and cellular factors such as PML.","['Carrington-Lawrence, Stacy D', 'Weller, Sandra K']","['Carrington-Lawrence SD', 'Weller SK']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington 06032-3205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Helicases/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'DNA Primase', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics/*physiology', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/*genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Products, pol/physiology', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/enzymology/*genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Virus Replication/genetics/physiology', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",2003/03/14 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2003/03/14 04:00'],"['2003/03/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.7.4237-4247.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Apr;77(7):4237-47. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.7.4237-4247.2003.,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (ICP8 protein, Simplexvirus)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Primase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (helicase-primase, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 3.1.11.- (DNA polymerase, Simplexvirus)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",,,,"['R01 AI021747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI021747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI21747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC150627,,,,,,,,

Neutralizing antibodies were directed towards two distinct sites in MuLV SU: one overlapping the major receptor-binding pocket in the N-terminal domain and the other involving a region that includes the most C-terminal disulfide-bonded loop. Two other groups of MAbs, reactive with distinct sites in the N-terminal domain or in the proline-rich region (PRR), did not neutralize MuLV infectivity. Only the neutralizing MAbs specific for the receptor-binding pocket were able to block binding of purified SU and MuLV virions to cells expressing the ecotropic MuLV receptor, mCAT-1. Whereas the neutralizing MAbs specific for the C-terminal domain did not interfere with the SU-mCAT-1 interaction, they efficiently inhibited cell-to-cell fusion mediated by MuLV Env, indicating that they interfered with a postattachment event necessary for fusion. The C-terminal domain MAbs displayed the highest neutralization titers and binding activities. However, the nonneutralizing PRR-specific MAbs bound to intact virions with affinities similar to those of the neutralizing receptor-binding pocket-specific MAbs, indicating that epitope exposure, while necessary, is not sufficient for viral neutralization by MAbs. These results identify two separate neutralization domains in MuLV SU and suggest a role for the C-terminal domain in a postattachment step necessary for viral fusion.","['Burkhart, Michael Dominic', 'Kayman, Samuel C', 'He, Yuxian', 'Pinter, Abraham']","['Burkhart MD', 'Kayman SC', 'He Y', 'Pinter A']","['Laboratory of Retroviral Biology, Public Health Research Institute, Newark, New Jersey 07103-3535, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Antigens, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes/chemistry/genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology']",2003/03/14 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2003/03/14 04:00'],"['2003/03/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.7.3993-4003.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Apr;77(7):3993-4003. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.7.3993-4003.2003.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",,,,"['R01 AI046283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI046283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI046283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI46283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC150638,,,,,,,,

The disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, deltapsi(m), was paralleled by a decrease in ATP level, unmasking of the mitochondrial antigen 7A6, release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, activation of caspases 9 and 3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). This was followed by DNA fragmentation. These data suggest that ALA-PDT activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The level of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-binding chaperones ERp57 and ERp72 and of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) was decreased whereas that of Ca(2+)-binding protein calmodulin and the stress protein HSP60 was elevated following ALA-PDT. Inhibition of the initiator caspase 9, execution caspase 3 and Ca(2+)-dependent protease m-calpain, did not prevent DNA fragmentation. We conclude that, in our in vitro model, ALA-based photodynamic treatment initiates several signaling processes in HL60 cells that lead to rapidly progressing apoptosis, which is followed by slow necrosis. Two apoptotic processes proceed in parallel, one representing the mitochondrial pathway, the other involving disruption of calcium homeostasis and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated pathway.","['Grebenova, Dana', 'Kuzelova, Katerina', 'Smetana, Karel', 'Pluskalova, Michaela', 'Cajthamlova, Hana', 'Marinov, Iuri', 'Fuchs, Ota', 'Soucek, Josef', 'Jarolim, Petr', 'Hrkal, Zbynek']","['Grebenova D', 'Kuzelova K', 'Smetana K', 'Pluskalova M', 'Cajthamlova H', 'Marinov I', 'Fuchs O', 'Soucek J', 'Jarolim P', 'Hrkal Z']","['Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 12820 2 Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

The use of sonodynamic therapy for the potential clinical treatment of certain tumors is promising, however, the mechanism of sonodynamic therapy could be due to either sonomechanical and/or sonochemical effects on the cells. The aim of the current study is to determine the importance of the sonochemical mechanism for sonodynamic therapy. Sonochemical effects arise from the formation of radical species following collapse of cavitation bubbles. The synergistic effect of ultrasound (47 kHz) and analogues of a gallium-porphyrin derivative (ATX-70) on cytolysis of Human leukemia cells (HL-525 and HL-60) suspended in a cell culture medium were studied. Organic surfactants preferentially accumulate and subsequently decompose at the gas/solution interface of cavitation bubbles, producing secondary radicals that can diffuse to the bulk solution. The gallium porphyrin analogues used in the current study possess two n-alkyl side chains (ATX-C(x), where x = number of carbon atoms, ranging from x = 2 to x = 12). By varying the n-alkyl chain length, thereby modifying the surfactant properties of the ATX-C(x) derivatives, cell killing in relation to the accumulation of ATX-C(x) derivatives at the gas/solution interface of cavitation bubbles was determined. Following sonolysis in the presence of ATX-C(x), a strong correlation for the yield of carbon-centered radicals and cell killing was observed. These results support the hypothesis that a sonochemical mechanism is responsible for the synergistic effect of ultrasound and ATX-C(x) on HL-525 and HL-60 cells.","['Miyoshi, Norio', 'Sostaric, Joe Z', 'Riesz, Peter']","['Miyoshi N', 'Sostaric JZ', 'Riesz P']","['Radiation Biology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,"['Cell Death/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Free Radicals', 'Gallium/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Porphyrins/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Surface-Active Agents', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultrasonic Therapy']",2003/03/14 04:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/03/14 04:00'],"['2003/03/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/14 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0891584902014284 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(02)01428-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2003 Mar 15;34(6):710-9. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(02)01428-4.,,,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '135099-39-7 (ATX 70)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Independent human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) mutants at the hprt locus were isolated from untreated, ethyluitrosourea (ENU) and (60)Co gamma-ray-exposed cells, respectively, and verified by two-way screening. The genetic changes underlying the mutation were determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and electrophoresis technique. RESULTS: With dosage increased, survival rate of plated cell reduced (in the group with dosage of ENU with 100-200 micro g/ml, P<0.01; in the group with dosage of (60)Co gamma-ray with 2-4 Gy, P<0.05) and mutational frequency increased (in the group of ENU 12.5-200.0 micro g/ml, P<0.05; in the group of (60)Co gamma-ray with 1-4 Gy, P<0.05) significantly. In the 13 spontaneous mutants analyzed, 92.3 % of mutant clones did not show any change in number or size of exon, a single exon was lost in 7.7 %, and no evidence indicated total gene deletion occurred in nine hprt exons. However, deletions were found in 79.7 % of ENU-induced mutations (62.5-89.4 %, P<0.01) and in 61.7 % of gamma-ray-induced mutations (28.6-76.5 %, P<0.01). There were deletion mutations in all 9 exons of hprt gene and the most of induced mutations were chain deletion with multiplex exons (97.9 % in gamma-ray-induced mutants, 88.1 % in ENU-induced mutants).

METHODS: Chemical and pantropic retroviral gene transfer methodologies were compared for their ability to introduce a luciferase reporter gene into adult bovine cartilage chondrocytes grown in monolayer. Pantropic retrovirus was then used to transduce these cells with human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), and the stability of expression in monolayer or pellet culture was monitored for 6 weeks. Untransduced and TIMP-1-transduced cells were also used to tissue engineer 3-dimensional cartilage constructs that were then challenged with interleukin-1 (IL-1) for 4 weeks. Conditioned media and residual cartilage were collected for analysis of matrix components, including type II collagen and proteoglycans, and for TIMP-1 production and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. RESULTS: Chemical transfection of adult bovine chondrocytes gave rise to short-lived reporter expression that was virtually undetectable after 4 weeks of culture. In contrast, pantropic retroviral transduction gave rise to stable expression that persisted at a high level for at least 6 weeks. Pantropic transduction of the cells with TIMP-1 gave rise to similar long-term expression, both in monolayer and pellet cultures. TIMP-1-transduced tissue-engineered cartilage also retained TIMP-1 expression for an additional 4 weeks of culture in the presence of IL-1. Compared with control samples, TIMP-1-transgenic cartilage resisted the catabolic effects of IL-1, with MMP activity reduced to basal levels and a decreased loss of type II collagen. CONCLUSION: Pantropic retroviral transduction permits long-term expression of potentially therapeutic transgenes in adult tissue-engineered cartilage. While TIMP-1 transduction could be used to prevent collagen breakdown, alternative transgenes may be necessary to protect cartilage proteoglycans.","['Kafienah, Wael', 'Al-Fayez, Fayza', 'Hollander, Anthony P', 'Barker, Michael D']","['Kafienah W', 'Al-Fayez F', 'Hollander AP', 'Barker MD']","['University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,IM,"['Animals', '*Bioreactors', 'Cartilage/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/chemistry/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Organoids', 'Osteoarthritis/*therapy', 'Polyglycolic Acid', 'Tissue Engineering/*methods', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/pharmacology']",2003/03/13 04:00,2003/03/26 05:00,['2003/03/13 04:00'],"['2003/03/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.10842 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2003 Mar;48(3):709-18. doi: 10.1002/art.10842.,,,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '26009-03-0 (Polyglycolic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors reported previously that neuroblastoma cells have diminished apoptosis when placed in coculture with hepatocytes to stimulate a metastatic environment. It was hypothesized that the expression of proapoptotic (Bax) and prosurvival (Bcl-2 and Mcl-1) proteins would be altered in neuroblastoma cells grown in a cell culture model of metastatic neuroblastoma. METHODS: Human neuroblastoma cells (IMR-32) were grown alone or in coculture with human hepatocytes for 2, 3, or 4 days. Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bax mRNA were measured with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein, was significantly increased in cocultured neuroblastoma cells by day 4. Bax, a proapoptotic protein, was significantly diminished by day 3. No significant change in Mcl-1 occurred in this study. CONCLUSIONS: When neuroblastoma cells placed in coculture, the prosurvival protein, Bcl-2, is upregulated whereas the proapoptotic protein, Bax, is downregulated. The combination of these changes can maximally enhance the survival rate of neuroblastoma cells in coculture. The propensity for neuroblastoma to either metastasize or regress may be associated with its ability to differentially regulate the expression of different members of the Bcl-2 protein family.","['Beierle, Elizabeth A', 'Dai, Wei', 'Iyengar, Radha', 'Langham, Max R Jr', 'Copeland, Edward M 3rd', 'Chen, Mike K']","['Beierle EA', 'Dai W', 'Iyengar R', 'Langham MR Jr', 'Copeland EM 3rd', 'Chen MK']","['Department of Surgery, University of Florida, J.

Dishevelled (DVL) proteins are WNT signaling molecules implicated in beta-catenin pathway and PCP pathway. Xenopus Dapper and Frodo are Dvl-binding proteins, showing 89.8% total-amino-acid identity. Here, we identified and characterized human homologs of Xenopus Dapper and Frodo using bioinformatics. Human DAPPER1 gene was located within human genome draft sequence NT_025892.9 (nucleotide position 39378960-39387891 in the forward orientation), and human DAPPER2 gene within NT_007302.10 (nucleotide position 660279-672480 in the reverse orientation). DAPPER1 (799-amino-acids) and DAPPER2 (774-amino-acids) showed 28.8% total-amino-acid identity. Seven DAPPER homologous (DAPH) domains, including DAPH2 (leucine zipper), DAPH3 (serine rich) and DAPH7 (PDZ binding), were conserved between DAPPER1 and DAPPER2. Phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate Dapper proteins revealed that Xenopus Dapper and Frodo are orthologs of human DAPPER1. DAPPER1 mRNA was expressed in amnion, fetal brain, eye, heart, adult brain medulla, gastric cancer (signet ring cell features), RER+ colon tumor, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, germ cell tumor, chondrosarcoma, and parathyroid tumor. DAPPER2 mRNA was expressed in placenta, genitourinary tract tumor, and endometrial adenocarcinoma. DAPPER1 and DAPPER2 genes were mapped to human chromosome 14q22.3 and 6q27, respectively. Human chromosome 14q22.3 is deleted in astrocytoma, while human chromosome 6q27 is deleted in breast, ovarian, and gastric cancer. Based on evolutionary and functional conservation of WNT signaling molecules as well as human chromosomal localization, DAPPER1 and DAPPER2 genes are predicted to be potent cancer-associated genes.","['Katoh, Masuko', 'Katoh, Masaru']","['Katoh M', 'Katoh M']","['M&M Medical BioInformatics, Narashino 275-0022, Japan. mkatoh@ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Exons', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Xenopus', '*Xenopus Proteins']",2003/03/13 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/03/13 04:00'],"['2003/03/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2003 Apr;22(4):907-13.,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DACT1 protein, Xenopus)', '0 (DACT1 protein, human)', '0 (DACT2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When we examined the effects of this drug on ACHN cells, monensin decreased the levels of CDK2, CDK6, cdc2, cyclin A and cyclin B1 proteins. p21 and p27 proteins were increased by monensin. In addition, monensin markedly enhanced the binding of p21 with CDK2 and the binding of p27 with CDK6. Furthermore, the activities of CDK2- and CDK6-associated kinase were reduced in association with hypophosphorylation of Rb protein. Monensin also induced the apoptosis in several renal cell carcinoma cells. Apoptotic process of Caki-2 cells was associated with the changes of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-7 proteins as well as mitochondria transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) loss.

Raf isoforms areserine/threonine kinases that act as signal transducers in cascades initiated by many growth factors and mitogens. Raf isoform activation has been linked to drug resistance in leukemia. In this study we investigated effects of Bcl-2 and Raf-1 on doxorubicin-induced growth inhibition of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In the absence of doxorubicin, overexpression of Bcl-2 or a constitutively active form of Raf-1 in MCF-7 cells did not affect proliferation rate. Overexpression of Bcl-2 increased resistance of MCF-7 cells to doxorubicin in 2-day, 5-day, and 8-week assays. Analysis of doxorubicin sensitivity of individual MCF/Bcl-2 clones showed that doxorubicin resistance was positively correlated with level of Bcl-2 overexpression. Overexpression of constitutively active Raf-1 also increased resistance to doxorubicin. Induction of Raf-1 activity in MCF-7 cells overexpressing Bcl-2 resulted in greater doxorubicin resistance than induction of Raf-1 activity in MCF-7 cells lacking Bcl-2 overexpression. Furthermore, levels of P-glycoprotein mRNA were increased in MCF-7 cells overexpressing a constitutively active Raf-1. MCF-7 cells overexpressing constitutively active Raf-1 were also more resistant to paclitaxel, which, like doxorubicin, is a substrate of P-glycoprotein. These observations suggest both independent and overlapping roles for Raf-1 and Bcl-2 oncogenes in the resistance to growth inhibition by doxorubicin.","['Davis, Julianne M', 'Navolanic, Patrick M', 'Weinstein-Oppenheimer, Caroline R', 'Steelman, Linda S', 'Hu, Wei', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Blagosklonny, Mikhail V', 'McCubrey, James A']","['Davis JM', 'Navolanic PM', 'Weinstein-Oppenheimer CR', 'Steelman LS', 'Hu W', 'Konopleva M', 'Blagosklonny MV', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testosterone/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/03/13 04:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/03/13 04:00'],"['2003/03/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Mar;9(3):1161-70.,,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)']",,,,"['R01 CA 512025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 98195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Their structure, function, and substrate specificity have been studied intensively, but little is known about their clinical relevance in malignant diseases. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, the expression of the MRP2, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, and SMRP genes was measured using TaqMan real-time PCR in 53 children with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. Nine patients were also analyzed in relapse. RESULTS: MRP3 gene expression was higher in patients who did not achieve remission (P = 0.023). Expression of MRP2 (P = 0.09) or MRP3 (P = 0.041) was associated with a lower rate of survival, and patients who expressed high levels of both genes had a particularly poor prognosis (P < 0.01). No significant association was found for overall survival or remission rate and the expression of MRP4, MRP5, and SMRP. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides first data on the clinical relevance of five MRPs in acute myeloid leukemia patients. The results strongly suggest that MRP3 and possibly also MRP2 are involved in drug resistance in this disease. Those two proteins therefore represent interesting markers for risk-adapted therapy and possible targets for the development of specific drugs to overcome multidrug resistance.","['Steinbach, Daniel', 'Lengemann, Janka', 'Voigt, Astrid', 'Hermann, Johann', 'Zintl, Felix', 'Sauerbrey, Axel']","['Steinbach D', 'Lengemann J', 'Voigt A', 'Hermann J', 'Zintl F', 'Sauerbrey A']","[""University Children's Hospital, 07740 Jena, Germany. daniel@steinba.ch""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', '*Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*biosynthesis', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/03/13 04:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/03/13 04:00'],"['2003/03/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Mar;9(3):1083-6.,,,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (ABCC5 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MRP2 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '1YV0492L5Z (multidrug resistance-associated protein 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report 16 patients with CML who developed VZV infection during imatinib mesylate therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 1998 until February 2002, 771 patients were included in 11 imatinib mesylate studies for all CML phases in the Departments of Leukemia and Bioimmunotherapy at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Sixteen patients developed VZV infection. Charts and follow-up information of were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (2%) developed a VZV infection [15 episodes of herpes zoster (HZ), 1 varicella]. The baseline characteristics of the 16 patients with infection do not differ significantly from those who did not develop VZV infection, except for time from diagnosis of CML to imatinib (median: 55 versus 25 months, P = 0.0056) and the number of prior therapies (3 versus 1, P < 0.001). All patients received therapy with antiviral agents with good response. Six patients developed postherpetic neuralgia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that imatinib therapy in CML is associated with low incidence of HZ infection.

Sensitivity and specificity of 11 types of cancer were calculated. Multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate correlates of false-positive and false-negative reporting. Sensitivities showed great variation by cancer site. The highest sensitivities were observed for breast (96.4%) and thyroid (92.9%) cancers, whereas the lowest sensitivities were those for cervical (44.3%), endometrial (69.1%), and other skin (53.6%) cancers. The sensitivities for in situ cancers (at the time of diagnosis) were considerably lower than those for invasive cancers in about half of the cancer types surveyed. The specificities for individual cancer sites ranged from 90% to 99%; the highest were those for lung cancer, leukemia, and Hodgkin's disease (all 99.9%).

In view of the fact that the cellular biology of these two subsets of disease is currently unexplored, we performed an extensive analysis of the surface antigen expression and correlated this with the VH gene mutation status in a cohort of 32 CLL patients. Using polymerase chain reaction amplification and nucleotide sequencing, the VH genes were shown to be mutated in 10 cases (31%) and unmutated in 22 (69%). The expression of 27 surface membrane antigens in peripheral blood leukemic cells was analyzed by flow cytometry, measuring both the percentage of positive cells as well as the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (GMF). Most of the surface membrane antigens (CD5, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD40, CD45, VD79b, CD80, CD95, CD122, CD124, CD126, CD130, CD154, IgM, and IgD) showed a similar expression pattern in both UM-CLL and M-CLL patients. The similarity of M-CLL and UM-CLL, as demonstrated here for the first time with many protein markers, indicates a considerably homogeneous phenotype in both subsets. Furthermore, CD27 was strongly expressed in all cases, which may suggest a memory cell phenotype for both M-CLL and UM-CLL. More positive cells in the UM-CLL group were observed regarding CD38, but CD38 was not a good predictor of VH gene mutation status. Seventy percent of the M-CLL cases, but only 36% of UM-CLL cases, were Ig-lambda+. The most striking differential expression, however, was observed in the two slicing variants of the common leukocyte antigen CD45, namely CD45RO and CD45RA. CD45RO expression was significantly associated with M-CLL, whereas the GMF intensity of CD45RA tended to be associated with UM-CLL. The role of these CD45 splicing variants in the pathogenesis of CLL deserves further investigation.","['Vilpo, Juhani', 'Tobin, Gerard', 'Hulkkonen, Janne', 'Hurme, Mikko', 'Thunberg, Ulf', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Vilpo, Leena', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Vilpo J', 'Tobin G', 'Hulkkonen J', 'Hurme M', 'Thunberg U', 'Sundstrom C', 'Vilpo L', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Tampere Medical School, Laboratory Center of Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin']",2003/03/13 04:00,2003/05/08 05:00,['2003/03/13 04:00'],"['2003/03/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['2o838 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.02838.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2003 Jan;70(1):53-9. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.02838.x.,,,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We wanted to study if pretreatment serum lysozyme has any relation to prognosis in AML. For this purpose, 232 adult AML patients who had received remission induction therapy at two hospitals were reviewed retrospectively. Their median age was 65.5 yr. Sixty-three patients were FAB classified as ""monocytic"" AML (M4, M5) and 169 as ""non-monocytic"" AML (M0, M1, M2, M3, M6). A linear relation was rejected, and a bimodal relation was found between lysozyme and prognosis where values below 20 or above 80 mg L-1 were indicative of better outcome than values in the range 20-80 mg L-1. Analysed in three categories with cut-off levels at 20 and 80 mg L-1, lysozyme showed an independent effect on complete remission (CR) frequency (P = 0.0003), overall survival (P < 0.0001), and CR duration (P = 0.0005) in multivariate analysis. The hazard ratios (HR) for lysozyme <20, 20-80, and >80 mg L-1 regarding overall survival were 1.0, 3.3, and 0.7. Influence of lysozyme on survival was bimodal both in ""non-monocytic"" AML (HR 1.0, 3.0, and 0.1) and M4-M5 (HR 1.0, 10.1, and 1.2).

In this study, we evaluated a BCR-ABL-specific qPCR method using the LightCycler technology in 95 patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute leukemia (n = 7) or CML in different stages (n = 88). Primers and hybridization probes were chosen to detect the most prevalent variants of BCR-ABL (b2a2, b3a2, b2a3, b3a3, e19a2, e1a2) with a sensitivity of 10-5 for b2a2 and b3a2. With median BCR-ABL/G6PDH ratios of 10.7% in the untreated chronic phase, 43.2% in the newly diagnosed accelerated phase, and 131.4% in newly diagnosed blast crisis the BCR-ABL mRNA levels varied significantly between different stages of CML whereas no difference was found between blast crisis and untreated acute leukemias (136.9%). There was a strong relationship between qPCR results and cytogenetics in patients treated with imatinib, interferon-alpha, or following allografting. Thirteen patients with CML were sequentially examined by qPCR following myeloablative or non-myeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Five patients received donor lymphocytes and became BCR-ABL negative as confirmed by nested RT-PCR. The gradual disappearance of BCR-ABL positive cells could be monitored by qPCR following non-myeloablative transplantation. Comparison of BCR-ABL levels with the degree of donor chimerism showed that 91% of samples with complete donor chimerism were BCR-ABL negative. In 22% of BCR-ABL negative samples chimerism between 71% and 98% was observed, indicating the persistence of normal recipient's hematopoietic cells.

Immunostaining for islet hormones and cytokeratin-7 revealed that day eight monolayers consisted of approximately 70% duct cells and less than 10% beta cells. Using Ki-67 immunostaining as a proliferation marker, the fraction of beta cells in the cell cycle was shown to decrease from 20% at day three to 10% at day eight, and for duct cells from 36 to 19%. Insulin secretion increased 2.4-fold upon glucose stimulation, and 38-fold when 10 mm theophylline was added, showing the responsiveness of the neonatal beta cells. Reaggregated monolayers consisted mostly of duct cells, but 4 weeks after transplantation, grafts contained predominantly endocrine cells, with duct cells being almost absent, suggesting in vivo differentiation of duct cells to endocrine cells. Monolayer susceptibility to retroviral transduction was also investigated using a Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus-based vector. Approximately 60% of duct cells but less than 5% of beta cells expressed the transgene, indicating that precursor duct cells are better targets for transgene expression. These results show that porcine neonatal pancreatic cells can be cultured as monolayers in preparation for transplantation. Furthermore, in such a culture setting, precursor duct cells have a high rate of proliferation and are more efficiently transduced with a retrovirus-based reporter gene than are beta cells.","['Tatarkiewicz, Krystyna', 'Lopez-Avalos, Maria D', 'Yoon, Kun-Ho', 'Trivedi, Nitin', 'Quickel, Robert R', 'Bonner-Weir, Susan', 'Weir, Gordon C']","['Tatarkiewicz K', 'Lopez-Avalos MD', 'Yoon KH', 'Trivedi N', 'Quickel RR', 'Bonner-Weir S', 'Weir GC']","['Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Japan,Dev Growth Differ,"Development, growth & differentiation",0356504,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Islets of Langerhans/*physiology', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation', '*Retroviridae', 'Swine/physiology', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2003/03/13 04:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/03/13 04:00'],"['2003/03/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['673 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1440-169x.2003.00673.x [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Growth Differ. 2003 Feb;45(1):39-50. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-169x.2003.00673.x.,,,"['0 (Insulin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,"['DK-36836/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-53087/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

LPBM5 murine leukaemia virus retrovirus-infected mice were treated daily with HU, TX or DX for 4 weeks, beginning 9 weeks post-infection, after development of immunodeficiency and lymphoproliferative disease. Drug effects on disease progression were determined by evaluating spleen weight and histology. Effects on haematopoiesis were determined by measuring peripheral blood indices (white blood cells and haematocrit) and assay of femur cellularity and femoral and splenic content of colony-forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E). HU, TX and DX partially reversed late-stage retrovirus-induced disease, resulting in spleen weights significantly below pre-treatment values. Spleen histology was also improved by RR inhibitor treatment (DX>TX>HU). However, as expected, HU was significantly myelosuppressive, inducing a reduction in peripheral indices associated with depletion of femoral CFU-GM and BFU-E. In contrast, although TX and DX were moderately myelosuppressive, both drugs were significantly better tolerated than HU. In summary, short-term treatment in late-stage murine retroviral disease with HU, TX or DX induced dramatic reversal of disease pathophysiology.

METHODS: The cohort comprised 1687 persons with complete work histories, at work on 1 January 1950, and followed through 31 December 1999. For each subject, time-specific cumulative exposure (ppm-years) was calculated as the sum of the products of job-specific concentrations of benzene (ppm) and the duration (years) for each job. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were estimated using national and regional rates specific for gender, age, and period. RESULTS: The cumulative exposure ranged from 0 to >500 ppm-years. The SMR values for all hematolymphopoietic malignancies and leukemia for the men and women combined were elevated in all but the lowest exposure category. Leukemia risk was significantly elevated in the highest exposure category and the most evident among the men. The SMR values for the men were 1.4 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.2-5.0], 3.7 (95% CI 0.1-20.6), 3.0 (95% CI 0.4-10.9), and 7.0 (95% CI 1.9-18.0) for benzene, the cumulative exposure equaling <40, 40-99, 100-199, and >200 ppm-years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that leukemia mortality is associated with exposure to benzene in this factory and that the risk increases with increasing cumulative exposure. The relevance of these findings for estimating risk at much lower levels is limited because of the small study size.","['Seniori Costantini, Adele', 'Quinn, Margaret', 'Consonni, Dario', 'Zappa, Marco']","['Seniori Costantini A', 'Quinn M', 'Consonni D', 'Zappa M']","['Unit of Occupational-Environmental Epidemiology, Centro per lo Studio e la Prevenzione Oncologica, Florence, Italy. a.seniori@cspo.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Industry', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Shoes']",2003/03/13 04:00,2003/05/24 05:00,['2003/03/13 04:00'],"['2003/03/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['704 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.704 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 2003 Feb;29(1):51-9. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.704.,,,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer data obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1961 to 1998 included 1,733 cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma. The standardized incidence ratio was used to measure cancer risk. RESULTS: Only 5 families were identified in which a parent had papillary renal cell carcinoma and an offspring had kidney cancer (nonsignificant SIR 1.51 for offspring). Discordant tumor sites associated with papillary renal cell carcinoma in the 2 generations were the upper aerodigestive tract and bladder (SIR 2.53, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.58 and 2.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.68, respectively). There was an overall increase in the risk of second primary malignancies of the lung, prostate and bladder and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia in patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma. The risk for a second primary tumor of the bladder associated with papillary renal cell carcinoma during the followup of 1 to 10 years was about 15 times higher than that associated with adenocarcinoma, which is the most common histological type of kidney cancer. The SIR was significantly higher in females than in males (59.67, 95% CI 40.23 to 82.94 versus 18.76, 95% CI 14.51 to 23.56). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the familial association of these 2 cancer sites, the high risk of a second primary cancer of the bladder in patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma may reflect a common genetic alteration.","['Czene, Kamila', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Czene K', 'Hemminki K']","['Department of Biosciences at Novum, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/epidemiology/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genetics, Population', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics']",2003/03/12 04:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['2003/03/12 04:00'],"['2003/03/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.ju.0000052373.36963.12 [doi]', 'S0022-5347(05)63739-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2003 Apr;169(4):1271-5. doi: 10.1097/01.ju.0000052373.36963.12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular signals that control this neurogenesis in vivo are unknown. Using olfactory bulb ablation (OBX) in adult mice to trigger synchronous mitotic stimulation of neuronal progenitors in the OE, we show the in vivo involvement of a cytokine in the cellular events leading to the regeneration of the OE. We find that, of many potential mitogenic signals, only leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is induced before the onset of neuronal progenitor proliferation. The rise in LIF mRNA expression peaks at 8 hr after OBX, and in situ RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry indicate that LIF is upregulated, in part, in the injured neurons themselves. This rise in LIF is necessary for injury-induced neurogenesis, as OBX in the LIF knock-out mouse fails to stimulate cell proliferation in the OE. Moreover, delivery of exogenous LIF to the intact adult OE using an adenoviral vector stimulates BrdU labeling in the apical OE. Taken together, these results suggest that injured OSNs release LIF as a stimulus to initiate their own replacement.","['Bauer, S', 'Rasika, S', 'Han, Jing', 'Mauduit, C', 'Raccurt, M', 'Morel, G', 'Jourdan, F', 'Benahmed, M', 'Moyse, E', 'Patterson, P H']","['Bauer S', 'Rasika S', 'Han J', 'Mauduit C', 'Raccurt M', 'Morel G', 'Jourdan F', 'Benahmed M', 'Moyse E', 'Patterson PH']","['Unite Mixte de Recherche 5020 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universite Lyon I, 69622 Villeurbanne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Growth Inhibitors/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Olfactory Bulb/physiology/surgery', 'Olfactory Mucosa/cytology/drug effects/injuries/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2003/03/12 04:00,2003/03/26 04:00,['2003/03/12 04:00'],"['2003/03/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [medline]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['23/5/1792 [pii]'],ppublish,J Neurosci. 2003 Mar 1;23(5):1792-803.,,,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,,,,,,PMC6741956,,,,,,,,

Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) activation of gp130 in NSCs rapidly increased Notch1 expression. NOTCH1 activation, indicated by tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme (TACE)- and presenilin-mediated processing, also increased.

Examples include cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA) in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and gemcitabine to treat solid tumours. In this study, expression of dCK mRNA was measured by a competitive template reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (CT RT-PCR) in seven cell lines of different histological origin, 16 childhood and adult AML samples, 10 human liver samples and 11 human liver metastases of colorectal cancer origin. The enzyme activity and protein expression levels of dCK in the cell lines were closely related to the mRNA expression levels (r=0.75, P=0.026 and r=0.86, P=0.007). In AML samples, dCK mRNA expression ranged from 1.16 to 35.25 (x10(-3)xdCK/beta-actin). In the cell line panel, the range was 2.97-56.9 (x10(-3)xdCK/beta-actin) of dCK mRNA expression. The enzyme activity in liver metastases was correlated to dCK mRNA expression (r=0.497, P=0.05). In the liver samples, these were not correlated. dCK mRNA expression showed only a 36-fold range in liver while a 150-fold range was observed in the liver metastases. In addition, dCK activity and mean mRNA levels were 2.5-fold higher in the metastases than in the liver samples. Since dCK is associated with the sensitivity to deoxynucleoside analogues and because of the good correlation between the different dCK measurements in malignant cells and tumours, the CT-RT PCR assay will be useful in the selection of patients that can be treated with deoxycytidine analogues.","['van der Wilt, C L', 'Kroep, J R', 'Loves, W J P', 'Rots, M G', 'Van Groeningen, C J', 'Kaspers, G J', 'Peters, G J']","['van der Wilt CL', 'Kroep JR', 'Loves WJ', 'Rots MG', 'Van Groeningen CJ', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Liver/*enzymology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*enzymology/secondary', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/03/12 04:00,2003/05/23 05:00,['2003/03/12 04:00'],"['2003/03/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804902008134 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(02)00813-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2003 Mar;39(5):691-7. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(02)00813-4.,,,['EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms of TNF that influence the adaptive immune response to viral infections are poorly understood. Over recent years, there has been evidence to suggest a role for TNF in the early phase of infection of ruminants with bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). In this study, we infected TNF(-/-) mice with a plasmid encoding infectious BLV to further elucidate the role of TNF in BLV infection. TaqMan quantitative PCR showed that proviral DNA was present in genomic DNA isolated from spleen cells of TNF(-/-) mice 4 weeks post-infection, whereas it was not detected in wild-type mice. We were not able to detect differences in serum IgM or IgG levels between the TNF(-/-) and wild-type mice, or antibodies to BLV after this short period. In showing that the lack of TNF enables the plasmid encoded BLV to persist longer, and therefore rendering the mice more susceptible to an infection with BLV, the data suggest an important defence function of TNF in the early phase of BLV infection.","['Muller, Catherine', 'Coffey, Tracey J', 'Koss, Michael', 'Teifke, Jens Peter', 'Langhans, Wolfgang', 'Werling, Dirk']","['Muller C', 'Coffey TJ', 'Koss M', 'Teifke JP', 'Langhans W', 'Werling D']","['Institute of Animal Sciences, ETH Zurich, Schornenstrasse 16, CH-8603 Schwerzenbach, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'COS Cells', 'Cattle', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Spleen/immunology/virology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*deficiency/genetics/immunology', 'Virus Replication/immunology']",2003/03/12 04:00,2003/05/02 05:00,['2003/03/12 04:00'],"['2003/03/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0165242703000205 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2427(03)00020-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2003 Mar 20;92(1-2):15-22. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2427(03)00020-5.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,"['BBS/E/I/00000984/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research', 'Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,

Green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been shown to be highly active as a cancer chemopreventive agent. Certain cellular and molecular events relevant to carcinogenesis are also modified by EGCG. The present investigation was carried out to examine the effects of EGCG on the cytogenetic change and DNA damage induced by toxicant H(2)O(2) and carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in Chinese hamster V-79 cells in culture. Cytogenetic change as evident by the formation of micronuclei and DNA damage in the form of comet tail length during single cell gel electrophoresis was found to be significantly suppressed by EGCG in a dose dependent manner. Cells preincubated with EGCG were protected from subsequent damage by the genotoxic agents. Apoptosis, a highly organized physiological mechanism to eliminate injured or abnormal cells, is also implicated in multistage carcinogenesis. Initiated cells, cells at promotional stage or fully transformed cells can be eliminated through apoptosis. It was observed that EGCG suppressed growth and proliferation of K-562 cells derived from human chronic myelogenic leukemia. Morphological features of treated cells and characteristic DNA fragmentation revealed that the cytotoxicity was due to induction of apoptosis. This was mediated by activation of caspase 3 and caspase 8. Results show that EGCG not only protects normal cells against genotoxic hazard but also eliminate cancer cells through induction of apoptosis.","['Roy, Madhumita', 'Chakrabarty, Sutapa', 'Sinha, Dona', 'Bhattacharya, Rathin Kumar', 'Siddiqi, Maqsood']","['Roy M', 'Chakrabarty S', 'Sinha D', 'Bhattacharya RK', 'Siddiqi M']","['Department of Environmental Carcinogenesis and Toxicology, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, 37 SP Mukherjee Road, Kolkata 700 026, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antimutagenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Comet Assay', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Micronucleus Tests', '*Tea']",2003/03/12 04:00,2003/04/25 05:00,['2003/03/12 04:00'],"['2003/03/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0027510702003196 [pii]', '10.1016/s0027-5107(02)00319-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2003 Feb-Mar;523-524:33-41. doi: 10.1016/s0027-5107(02)00319-6.,,,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Tea)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanisms associated with this cell killing by F 11782 have been examined in P388 leukaemia cells. Treatment with F 11782 resulted in a dose-dependent DNA fragmentation coupled with the characteristic morphological features of apoptosis. Apoptosis-inducing concentrations of F 11782 induced caspases-3/7 activation accompanied by proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, which could be inhibited by the caspase inhibitor acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde. In addition, F 11782-induced apoptosis in P388 cells was associated with an increased expression of the pro-apototic Bax protein, without significant changes in the level of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, and with modification at the mitochondrial membrane function. These results indicate that F 11782 leads to apoptosis through a caspase-3/7 dependent mechanism and suggest that the so-called ""mitochondrial pathway"" is implicated in F 11782-induced apoptosis in P388 cells.","['Etievant, Chantal', 'Kruczynski, Anna', 'Barret, Jean-Marc', 'Perrin, Dominique', 'Hill, Bridget T']","['Etievant C', 'Kruczynski A', 'Barret JM', 'Perrin D', 'Hill BT']","['Division de Cancerologie Experimentale I, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, 17 Avenue Jean Moulin, F-81106 Castres Cedex 06, France. chantal.etievant@pierre-fabre.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2003/03/12 04:00,2003/03/19 04:00,['2003/03/12 04:00'],"['2003/03/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [medline]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202015642 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01564-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Mar 1;65(5):755-63. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01564-2.,,,"['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'QN043X3ZDW (tafluposide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the effects of nicotinic stimulation on lymphocyte function, however. We therefore investigated the acute effect of nicotine on [Ca(2+)](i) in CEM cells, a model of T-lymphocytes, using confocal laser scanning microscopy with fluo-3, a Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent indicator. In addition, we examined the long-term effect of nicotine on the expression of selected nAChR subunits using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. In the presence of extracellular Ca(2+), nicotine (30 microM) evoked rapid, transient increases in [Ca(2+)](i). This effect was concentration-dependently inhibited by the alpha7 nAChR subunit antagonists, alpha-bungarotoxin (0.01-10 microM) and methyllycaconitine (0.01-10 mM), suggesting that the alpha7 nAChR subunit mediates Ca(2+) signaling in T-lymphocytes. Nicotine (0.01-10 microM) also concentration-dependently down-regulated expression of mRNAs for all the nAChR subunits tested: expression of the alpha6 and alpha7 subunits was down-regulated within 1 week, while expression of the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits declined gradually throughout the 8-week experimental period.

In vascular endothelial cells, stimulation of M(3) subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) triggers NO synthesis by eNOS. Human lymphocytes express several mAChR subtypes and their stimulation increases the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration and up-regulates c-fos gene expression. While the above findings suggest involvement of the lymphocytic cholinergic system in the regulation of immune function, little is known on NOS expression and NO synthesis in T-lymphocytes. In the present study, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we found that CEM cells express mRNAs encoding iNOS and nNOS, but not for eNOS. In addition, using quantitative fluorescence microscopy and a novel NO-sensitive fluorescent indicator, DAF-2, we found that oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) (100 microM), a non-selective mAChR agonist, enhances NO production in the cells. This effect of Oxo-M was antagonized by pirenzepine (10 microM), an antagonist acting preferentially at M(1) mAChR and by atropine (10 microM).

However, this registry does not include patients from Autonomous Community of Cantabria because there is no reporting clinical center. The absence of data on childhood cancer in this region justifies this study. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical presentation, diagnostic delay and incidence of childhood cancer in Cantabria. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 89 children (aged 0-15 years) diagnosed with cancer in Cantabria from 1995-2000. RESULTS: The annual incidence of childhood cancer in the region was 198.1 cases per million inhabitants with a predominance of males (53.9 %) and children aged less than 5 years (46.1 %). The most frequent cancers were leukemia (32.6 %) and brain tumors (23.6 %). The most frequent signs and symptoms were fever (29.2 %) and decreased appetite or fatigue (19.1 %). The mean delay in diagnosis for all tumors was 5.99 weeks and delays were longest for brain tumors. There was a direct statistical relationship between non-specific clinical presentation and diagnostic delay. A total of 20.2 % of all patients received treatment outside Cantabria. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of all childhood cancers and especially that of neuroblastoma was higher in Cantabria than in other areas of Spain. In general, the major difficulties in the diagnosis of childhood cancer are its low incidence and non-specific presenting symptoms. Specialized pediatric oncology units near to patients' homes should be created to avoid problems due to treatment outside the area of residence.","['Garcia Calatayud, S', 'San Roman Munoz, M', 'Uyaguari Quezada, M', 'Perez Gil, E', 'Gonzalez Lamuno, D', 'Cantero Santamaria, P']","['Garcia Calatayud S', 'San Roman Munoz M', 'Uyaguari Quezada M', 'Perez Gil E', 'Gonzalez Lamuno D', 'Cantero Santamaria P']",['Servicio de Pediatria.

One of the mechanisms of relapse is escape from immunity. Adoptive cellular immunotherapy with effector cells has the potential to overcome this escape. In adults, the CD3+ CD56+ cell, a cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell, appears to be a promising effector cell type with the greatest cytotoxicity. This effector cell type may work in children as well. No similar studies with children have been published. We speculated that expanded CD3+ CD56+ cells obtained from pediatric cancer patients during remission would act similarly against various pediatric tumor cell lines; therefore, we undertook the present study to find support for our speculation. This study was undertaken to generate and expand CD3+ CD56+ CIK cells from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBL) obtained from 6 children with cancer (2 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 2 with large cell lymphoma, and 2 with osteosarcoma) in remission after intensive chemotherapy and to study the cytotoxic activities of these cells against chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 t(9;22), 4 pediatric tumor cell lines [infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia RS4 t(4;11), TEL/AML acute lymphoblastic leukemia REH t(12;21), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma Rh-Cr t(2;13), and Ewing sarcoma EW-Le t(11;22)], and 2 pediatric glioblastoma multiforme cultured cell lines (G74 and G77). CIK cells were generated and expanded in culture medium to which interferon gamma, monoclonal antibody against CD3, and interleukin 2 were added at appropriate times. Cells were counted by flow cytometry. Net lactate dehydrogenase release from target cells incubated with CIK cells was used as an index of CIK cell cytotoxicity against various pediatric tumor cell lines. The results show that after 21 days in culture CD3+ CD56+ CIK cells derived from the 6 pediatric patients accounted for a median of 28.3% of the entire culture (range, 10.7%-36.4%). Before expansion no such cells were found in any of the 6 children. Median lytic activity rates of CIK cells were 45.5% to 64.5%, rates that contrasted drastically to the lytic activity rates of PBL, which were only 8% to 12%. The findings of the present study are encouraging. They provide information for developing adoptive immunotherapy for future clinical trials with pediatric cancer patients, particularly those patients with minimal residual disease after intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation (especially nonmyeloablative transplantation procedures).","['Hongeng, Suradej', 'Petvises, Sawang', 'Worapongpaiboon, Surapon', 'Rerkamnuaychoke, Busaba', 'Pakakasama, Samart', 'Jootar, Saengsuree']","['Hongeng S', 'Petvises S', 'Worapongpaiboon S', 'Rerkamnuaychoke B', 'Pakakasama S', 'Jootar S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. rashe@mahidol.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adolescent', 'CD3 Complex', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/03/12 04:00,2003/06/06 05:00,['2003/03/12 04:00'],"['2003/03/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02983217 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2003 Feb;77(2):175-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02983217.,,,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deoxycoformycin (DCF, pentostatin), an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, has shown promising therapeutic efficacy for ATL. To develop a new effective therapy against aggressive ATL, we carried out a multicenter phase II study of DCF-containing combination chemotherapy. Sixty-two previously untreated patients with ATL (34, 21, and 7 patients with diseases of the acute, lymphoma, and unfavorable chronic types, respectively) were enrolled, but 2 were ineligible because they were judged to be favorable chronic types. A regimen of 1 mg/m2 vincristine intravenously on days 1 and 8, 40 mg/m2 doxorubicin intravenously on day 1, 100 mg/m2 etoposide intravenously on days 1 through 3, 40 mg/m2 prednisolone orally on days 1 and 2, and 5 mg/m2 DCF intravenously on days 8, 15, and 22 was administered every 28 days for 10 cycles unless disease progression or toxic complications occurred.

The CR rate was inferior to those of both the previous Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) study (JCOG8701, 43%), a 9-drug combination chemotherapy of the second generation, and the subsequent JCOG9303 study (35%), a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-supported, dose-intensified, 9-drug regimen. The median survival time of the 60 eligible patients in JCOG9109 was 7.4 months, and the estimated 2-year survival rate was 15.5%; these results were identical with those of JCOG8701 but inferior to those of JCOG9303. Grade 4 neutropenia and infection of grade 3 or greater were frequent (67% and 22%, respectively), and treatment-related death was observed in 4 patients (7%), septicemia in 2, and cytomegalovirus pneumonia in 2.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) by itself had no effect on NB4 cells but exerted additional enhancing effects on the respiratory burst activity in the presence of ATRA. This finding was not due to the induction of G-CSF receptor by ATRA, because NB4 cells expressed abundant G-CSF receptor with or without ATRA. Unlike ATRA, G-CSF enhanced superoxide release stimulated by the chemotactic peptide but not by phorbol ester. In addition, G-CSF but not ATRA attenuated cell death and enhanced survival during differentiation. Cell surface expression of the chemotactic peptide receptors CD33 and CD10 but not of CD11b and CD11c was up-regulated by ATRA plus G-CSF far more profoundly than by ATRA alone. Fundamentally identical but slightly different phenomena for the cell surface expression of CD33 and CD10 were observed in the normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells; G-CSF induced CD10 even in the absence of ATRA and down-regulated CD33 in normal cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The GF were used in primary cultures of mononuclear cells (MNC) and in cocultures of CD34+ cells on murine preestablished MS-5 stromal layers. GF activity was assessed as nonadherent and adherent progenitor cell production and cobblestone area formation at week 5. RESULTS: In this system, only FL, KL, and MGDF significantly stimulated early stages of hematopoiesis, whereas only G-CSF stimulated the proliferation of mature progenitor cells within the granulo-monocyte lineage and no effect was observed with LIF. FL displayed the strongest activity, and MGDF was more efficient than KL, both in primary cultures of MNC and in cocultures of CD34+ cells. However, the stimulatory effects of these GF used alone were dependent on the presence of a stromal layer. CONCLUSION: These LTMC data emphasize the particular roles for FL and MGDF in the stimulation of primitive hematopoiesis.","['Cartron, G', 'Binet, C', 'Herault, O', 'Cailliot, C', 'Bernard, M C', 'Estienne, M H', 'Clement, N', 'Colombat, Ph', 'Domenech, J']","['Cartron G', 'Binet C', 'Herault O', 'Cailliot C', 'Bernard MC', 'Estienne MH', 'Clement N', 'Colombat P', 'Domenech J']","['Laboratory of Hematology, CHRU Bretonneau, Tours, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2003/03/12 04:00,2003/06/06 05:00,['2003/03/12 04:00'],"['2003/03/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02983212 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2003 Feb;77(2):133-41. doi: 10.1007/BF02983212.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first 2 are clearly the result of the cellular defect in PNH, the lack of proteins anchored to the membrane by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The hemolytic anemia results in syndromes primarily related to the fact that the hemolysis is extracellular. Thrombosis is most significant in veins within the abdomen, although a number of other thrombotic syndromes have been described. The hematopoietic deficiency may be the same as that in aplastic anemia, a closely related disorder, and may not be due to the primary biochemical defect. The relationship to aplastic anemia suggests a nomenclature that emphasizes the predominant clinical manifestations in a patient. This relationship does not explain cases that appear to be related to myelodysplastic syndromes or the transition of some cases of PNH to leukemia.

In certain situations, lymphoma and leukemia can be difficult to distinguish from a benign reactive proliferation of lymphocytes. Because clonality is the hallmark of malignancy, we have developed an assay that uses the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes and T-cell receptor genes to detect the presence of a clonal lymphocyte population. The assay detected clonally rearranged antigen receptor genes in 91% of the 77 dogs with lymphoid malignancy. Of the 24 dogs tested, that were either healthy or had clearly defined conditions not related to lymphoid malignancy, a clonally rearranged antigen receptor gene was found in one (a dog with Ehrlichia canis infection). Gene rearrangement was appropriate for the immunophenotype (immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in B-cell leukemias and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement in T-cell leukemias). Dilution analysis showed that the clonal rearrangement could be detected when 0.1-10% of the DNA was derived from neoplastic cells, depending on the source tissue. Potential applications of this assay include the diagnosis of lymphoma or leukemia in biopsy samples, cavity fluids, fine needle aspirates, bone marrow and peripheral blood; the determination of lineage (B or T cell); staging of lymphoma; and detection of residual disease after chemotherapy.","['Burnett, R C', 'Vernau, W', 'Modiano, J F', 'Olver, C S', 'Moore, P F', 'Avery, A C']","['Burnett RC', 'Vernau W', 'Modiano JF', 'Olver CS', 'Moore PF', 'Avery AC']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Dog Diseases/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*veterinary', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/veterinary', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2003/03/12 04:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/03/12 04:00'],"['2003/03/12 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [entrez]']","['40/1/32 [pii]', '10.1354/vp.40-1-32 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2003 Jan;40(1):32-41. doi: 10.1354/vp.40-1-32.,,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fludarabine and cytarabine (ara-C) regimen is active in these patients. Resistance to gemtuzumab is associated with blast multidrug resistance (MDR). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a combination regimen of gemtuzumab, fludarabine, ara-C, and the MDR modifier (cyclosporine [CyA]) in patients with previously untreated AML, refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), or RAEB in transformation (RAEBT). METHODS: The MFAC regimen was comprised of gemtuzumab (Mylotarg trade mark ) (6 mg/m(2) intravenously [i.v.] on Day 1); fludarabine and ara-C (15 mg/m(2) and 0.5 g/m(2), respectively, twice daily on Days 2-6); and CSA (6 mg/kg loading dose before gemtuzumab, followed by 16 mg/kg continuous i.v. infusion on Days 1 and 2). RESULTS: Fifty-nine evaluable patients were treated: 39 patients (66%) had AML and 20 patients (34%) had RAEB/RAEBT. Their median age was 57 years (range, 27-76 years). The MFAC regimen induced complete remission (CR) in 27 patients (46%) and CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) in 1 patient (2%). The median survival period is 8 months. At 12 months, the survival rate is 38% and the event-free survival rate in patients with CR/CRp is 27%. Infections complicated 38% of the courses of chemotherapy. Grade 3/4 toxicity included hyperbilirubinemia in 31% and transaminitis in 7% of the patients. Four patients (7%) developed hepatic venoocclusive disease (VOD).

METHODS: Adults with untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated with a previously developed and tested chemotherapeutic regimen. Patients with CD19 positive ALL were given anti-B4-blocked ricin as 2 7-day continuous infusions 1 week apart. Patients with CD19 negative ALL received high-dose cytarabine. Serial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of BCR-ABL, immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH), and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes were used to measure the impact of lineage specific intensification treatment on minimal residual disease. RESULTS: Eighty-two adults were enrolled, and 78 were eligible. The median age was 34 years (range, 17-81 years). Sixty-six patients (85%) achieved complete remission. Forty-six patients received the anti-B4-blocked ricin, which generally was well tolerated; 80% were able to receive both courses. The most common toxicity was asymptomatic transient elevation of liver function tests in 72% of patients. Lymphopenia occurred in 46% of patients. Two patients developed antibodies to the anti-B4-blocked ricin. Molecular monitoring before and after the experimental course of intensification did not show a consistent change in the number of leukemia cells remaining, and the immediate posttreatment PCR studies did not correlate with remission duration. CONCLUSIONS: Intensification therapy with anti-B4-blocked ricin is feasible for patients with CD19 positive ALL, although there is little evidence of an additional clinical benefit from the anti-B4-blocked ricin.

In the present study, we investigated risk factors and recurrence rates in immunocompromised patients requiring surgery for medically intractable anal condyloma. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 63 consecutive patients who underwent surgical intervention for medically intractable anal condyloma at a single institution. Patient cohorts included immunosuppressed patients (e.g, HIV-seropositive, leukemia, idiopathic lymphopenic syndrome, or transplant patients; n = 45) and immunocompetent patients (n = 18). Recurrence rates and time to recurrence after surgery were determined for both groups. Preoperative CD4 count and viral load within the HIV subpopulation were also determined. The majority of the patients were male (90 percent), with a median age of 36 years. RESULTS: Anal condyloma recurred in 66 percent of the immunosuppressed patients compared with 27 percent of the immunocompetent group. Recurrence time expressed in months was shorter in immunosuppressed patients than in immunocompetent patients (6.8 +/- 1.5 vs. 15 +/- 5.7 months; P< 0.05). In the subpopulation of HIV-seropositive patients, no association was found between recurrence rates and viral loads; however, CD4 counts were significantly lower in those who had recurrence than in those who did not (226 +/- 31.7 vs. 401 +/- 51.2 cells/microl; P< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: After surgery, anal condyloma in immunosuppressed patients recurs significantly more often and within a shorter period of time than in patients with a competent immune system. Additionally, in HIV-seropositive patients, CD4 counts should be maximized to prevent early recurrence of anal condyloma.","['de la Fuente, Sebastian G', 'Ludwig, Kirk A', 'Mantyh, Christopher R']","['de la Fuente SG', 'Ludwig KA', 'Mantyh CR']","['Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dis Colon Rectum,Diseases of the colon and rectum,0372764,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anus Diseases/complications/*immunology/*surgery', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Cohort Studies', 'Condylomata Acuminata/complications/*immunology/*surgery', 'Endoscopy', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/complications/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence/immunology', '*Immunocompromised Host/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Viral Load']",2003/03/11 04:00,2003/04/25 05:00,['2003/03/11 04:00'],"['2003/03/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/11 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10350-004-6557-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Dis Colon Rectum. 2003 Mar;46(3):367-73. doi: 10.1007/s10350-004-6557-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To obtain sufficient numbers of primary macaque CD4 T lymphocytes for this purpose, we examined the culture conditions that were needed to optimize ex vivo activation and expansion of macaque primary CD4-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In this report, we compared the effects of various stimulants on cell expansion, surface expression of CCR5 and CXCR4, and levels of transduction with a Moloney leukemia virus (MoLV) vector encoding the phenotypic selection marker truncated human nerve growth factor receptor (deltaNGFR) alone or with the human anti-HIV-1 tat intrabody sFvhutat2. The use of feeder cells strikingly increased the proliferation rate of macaque CD4-enriched PBMCs in vitro. In the presence of an irradiated rhesus macaque B-lymphoblastoid cell line (BLCL), the highest cell expansion over 21 days was achieved with cells activated by Con A (9648-fold), in turn, from high to low, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (4855-fold), and anti-CD3/CD28-coated beads (2367-fold). Further studies showed that BLCL feeder cells were more effective than human PBMCs (hPBMCs) in promoting proliferation of macaque CD4-enriched PBMCs activated with Con A and anti-CD3/CD28, respectively. The combined use of both BLCL and hPBMC feeder cells did not further increase cell expansion when compared with the use of BLCL cells alone. In addition, the addition of BLCL-conditioned medium (CM) and hPBMC-CM induced cell growth at a rate higher than did the culture medium alone but not as high as with feeder cells. Con A-activated macaque CD4-enriched PBMCs retained 88% of CXCR4 and 39% of CCR5 expression over 17 days compared with PHA-activated cells (50% for CXCR4, 16% for CCR5) and anti-CD3/CD28-activated cells (34% for CXCR4, 37% for CCR5). Finally, PHA, Con A, and CD3/CD28-coated beads supported comparable levels of MoLV transduction. The results should improve the utility of the rhesus macaque model for the testing of T-cell autotransfusion and gene therapies for HIV-1 infection/AIDS.","['Zhang, Dongsheng', 'Murakami, Akikazu', 'Johnson, R Paul', 'Sui, Jianhua', 'Cheng, Jihua', 'Bai, Jirong', 'Marasco, Wayne A']","['Zhang D', 'Murakami A', 'Johnson RP', 'Sui J', 'Cheng J', 'Bai J', 'Marasco WA']","['Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),100892005,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Blood Transfusion, Autologous', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Concanavalin A', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV Infections/*therapy', '*HIV-1', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Macaca', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Receptors, CCR5/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2003/03/11 04:00,2003/04/17 05:00,['2003/03/11 04:00'],"['2003/03/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/11 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00126334-200303010-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2003 Mar 1;32(3):245-54. doi: 10.1097/00126334-200303010-00002.,,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, CCR5)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (deltaNGFr-F12Nef fusion protein, recombinant)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",,,,"['5R01 RR14447-03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00168/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The ETS (E-Twenty-Six) family member TEL (ETV6) is a transcriptional repressor that can inhibit Ras-dependent colony growth in soft agar and induce cellular aggregation of Ras-transformed cells. TEL is frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations such as the t(12;21), which is associated with nearly one-fourth of pediatric B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In the vast majority of t(12;21)-containing cases, the second allele of TEL is deleted, suggesting that inactivation of TEL contributes to the disease. Although TEL functions in the nucleus as a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor, it has also been detected in the cytoplasm. Here we demonstrate that TEL is actively exported from the nucleus in a leptomycin B-sensitive manner. TEL is posttranslationally modified by sumoylation at lysine 99 within a highly conserved domain (the ""pointed"" domain). Mutation of the sumo-acceptor lysine or mutations within the pointed domain that affect sumoylation impair nuclear export of TEL. Mutation of lysine 99 also results in an increase in TEL transcriptional repression, presumably because of decreased nuclear export. We propose that the ability of TEL to repress transcription and suppress growth is regulated by sumoylation and nuclear export.","['Wood, Lauren D', 'Irvin, Brenda J', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina', 'Luce, K Scott', 'Hiebert, Scott W']","['Wood LD', 'Irvin BJ', 'Nucifora G', 'Luce KS', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2003/03/11 04:00,2003/04/22 05:00,['2003/03/11 04:00'],"['2003/03/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0637114100 [doi]', '0637114100 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Mar 18;100(6):3257-62. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0637114100.

We used an AKR leukemia murine transplant model, analogous to human acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in which donor T cells expressed a thymidine kinase suicide gene, to test whether separation of GVL and graft-vs-host (GVH) responses was feasible by selectively eliminating alloactivated donor T cells at defined time points posttransplant. Under experimental conditions where untreated mice could not be cured of disease without dying from GVHD, mice transplanted with thymidine kinase-positive T cells and subsequently administered ganciclovir (GCV) could eliminate leukemia without lethal GVHD. Timing of GCV administration, donor T cell dose, and preexisting leukemia burden were observed to be critical variables. Eradication of leukemia without lethal GVHD in GCV-treated mice implied that the kinetics of GVL and GVH responses were asynchronous and could therefore be temporally dissociated by timely GCV administration. That this strategy was feasible in a murine leukemia model in which GVHD and GVL reactivity are tightly linked suggests that this approach may be relevant to the treatment of selected human leukemias where similar constraints exist.

The changes in the cell cycle and corresponding protein composition of the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line after treatment with BOH were evaluated and proteins differentially expressed in the BOH treated A549 cells, compared to the untreated A549 counterparts, were selected. Thirteen of these candidate proteins associated with the drug effects in vitro were identified by mass spectrometry. Many of these proteins fall into one of three functional categories: i) metabolic pathways (glycolysis, nucleic acid synthesis and NADPH production), ii) stress response and protein folding, and iii) cytoskeleton and exocytosis. Changes in protein expression patterns corresponded to a higher resistance of A549 lung carcinoma cells to BOH when compared to the CEM leukaemia cell line. These protein changes reflect a fine balance of the resistant versus the susceptible phenotype in response to the drug. Since BOH is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, changes in the protein expression pattern can be more generally associated with cell cycle regulation as evidenced by inhibition of cell cycling in A549 cells. Our conclusions further underline the importance of cell cycle control in both the cellular signalling and metabolic pathways.","['Kovarova, Hana', 'Halada, Petr', 'Man, Petr', 'Dzubak, Petr', 'Hajduch, Marian']","['Kovarova H', 'Halada P', 'Man P', 'Dzubak P', 'Hajduch M']","['Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, 277 21 Libechov, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Exocytosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', '*Proteome', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/03/11 04:00,2003/05/02 05:00,['2003/03/11 04:00'],"['2003/03/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['d=3007&c=4087&p=11171&do=detail [pii]', '10.1177/153303460200100405 [doi]']",ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2002 Aug;1(4):247-56. doi: 10.1177/153303460200100405.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (bohemine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new short-time irradiation schedule with conventional dosage (Group A: 2 Gy/fract.) was compared retrospectively with low-dose prolonged treatment schedules (Group B: < or = 1 Gy/fract.) to establish its tolerance and its efficacy in terms of relieving splenomegaly-associated symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 12/1996 and 3/2002 49 patients (6 with CLL, 14 with CML, 6 with NHL, 16 with MPD, 6 with OMF and 1 with AML) underwent 85 treatment courses (13 courses low-dose prolonged treatment and 72 courses short-time treatment).The spleens had been exposed to pretreatment doses of 3-70 Gy (mean 20.75 Gy). Splenic size was 12-35 cm (mean 22.76 cm). One treatment was done with 60Co. 9-20 MeV electron beams were used in 23 treatments and 6 MV photons in 61 treatments. Blood counts were monitored daily. Clinical improvement (pain relief, improvement of splenomegaly-associated symptoms), spleen volume reduction and effects on blood counts were evaluated and documented at the end of the treatment. RESULTS: Of the 85 treated patients, 55 (Group A: 47/72, Group B: 8/13) showed a > 10% reduction of spleen volume and 62 (Group A: 57/72, Group B: 5/13) clinical improvement. 15 of 49 patients underwent multiple irradiation (2-8 courses) without clinical or hematologic complications. The intervals between the courses were 2-19 months. Rapid response in terms of reduction in splenic size in 23 patients permitted field reduction during treatment. Significant hematologic abnormalities were absent throughout. CONCLUSION: The short-time treatment schedule ensured a rapid response with relief of pain and improvement of gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms at an overall treatment time shorter than that of low-dose prolonged treatment schedules. No differences in terms of hematologic abnormalities were found between single doses of 2 Gy and < or = 1 Gy.","['Schratter-Sehn, A U', 'Cerveny, M', 'Simmel, H', 'Schlogl, E', 'Schratter, A']","['Schratter-Sehn AU', 'Cerveny M', 'Simmel H', 'Schlogl E', 'Schratter A']","['Institute of Radio-Oncology, Kaiser-Franz-Josef Hospital, Vienna, Austria. annemarie.schratter@kfj.magwien.gv.at']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/*radiotherapy', '*Lymphatic Irradiation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenomegaly/*radiotherapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/03/08 04:00,2003/08/12 05:00,['2003/03/08 04:00'],"['2003/03/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000069859 [doi]', 'ONK26021 [pii]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2003 Feb;26(1):21-4. doi: 10.1159/000069859.,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 S.

Here, we provide the first evidence that hydrolytically activated prodrugs may overcome these problems. For this purpose, VP16 was functionally blocked by hydrolytically cleavable carbonate linkers with unique characteristics to generate 2 novel prodrugs of VP16. First, we established a more than 3-log higher efficacy of the 2 prodrugs compared with VP16 on a panel of naturally drug-resistant tumor cell lines. Second, the prodrugs did overcome VP16-induced multidrug resistance-1 gene (MDR-1)-mediated multidrug resistance in vitro in a newly established VP16-resistant T-cell leukemia cell line MOVP-3 by functionally blocking MDR-1-mediated efflux. Third, in vivo studies showed a maximum tolerated dose of ProVP16-II (> 45mg/kg), which was at least 3-fold higher than that of VP16 (15 mg/kg). Finally, tests of ProVP16-II in a multidrug-resistant xenograft model of T-cell leukemia expressing MDR-1 indicated that only the mice treated with this prodrug revealed a complete and long-lasting regression of established, drug-resistant leukemia. In summary, the hydrolytically activated etoposide prodrugs proved effective against multidrug-resistant T-cell leukemia in vitro and in vivo and provide proof of concept for a highly promising new strategy for the treatment of MDR-1 drug-resistant malignancies.","['Schroeder, Ulrike', 'Bernt, Kathrin M', 'Lange, Bjorn', 'Wenkel, Jens', 'Jikai, Jiang', 'Shabat, Doron', 'Amir, Roey', 'Huebener, Nicole', 'Niethammer, Andreas G', 'Hagemeier, Christian', 'Wiebusch, Luder', 'Gaedicke, Gerhard', 'Wrasidlo, Wolfgang', 'Reisfeld, Ralph A', 'Lode, Holger N']","['Schroeder U', 'Bernt KM', 'Lange B', 'Wenkel J', 'Jikai J', 'Shabat D', 'Amir R', 'Huebener N', 'Niethammer AG', 'Hagemeier C', 'Wiebusch L', 'Gaedicke G', 'Wrasidlo W', 'Reisfeld RA', 'Lode HN']","[""Charite Children's Hospital, Humboldt university, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Prodrugs/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2003/03/08 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/03/08 04:00'],"['2003/03/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-07-2268 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54001-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 1;102(1):246-53. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-07-2268.

It is unclear whether patients who remain sensitive to imatinib also have a significant incidence of mutations. We evaluated 144 patients treated with imatinib for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing of 40 accelerated phase (AP), 64 late chronic phase (> or = 12 months from diagnosis, late-CP), and 40 early-CP patients. Mutations were detected in 27 patients at 17 different residues, 13 (33%) of 40 in AP, 14 (22%) of 64 in late-CP, and 0 of 40 in early-CP. Acquired resistance was evident in 24 (89%) of 27 patients with mutations. Twelve (92%) of 13 patients with mutations in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding loop (P-loop) died (median survival of 4.5 months after the mutation was detected). In contrast, only 3 (21%) of 14 patients with mutations outside the P-loop died (median follow-up of 11 months). As the detection of mutations was strongly associated with imatinib resistance, we analyzed features that predicted for their detection. Patients who commenced imatinib more than 4 years from diagnosis had a significantly higher incidence of mutations (18 [41%] of 44) compared with those treated within 4 years (9 [9%] of 100), P <.0001. Lack of a major cytogenetic response (MCR) was also associated with a higher likelihood of detecting a mutation; 19 (38%) of 50 patients without a MCR had mutations compared with 8 (8.5%) of 94 with an MCR, P <.0001. In conclusion, the detection of kinase domain mutations using a direct sequencing technique was almost always associated with imatinib resistance, and patients with mutations in the P-loop had a particularly poor prognosis.","['Branford, Susan', 'Rudzki, Zbigniew', 'Walsh, Sonya', 'Parkinson, Ian', 'Grigg, Andrew', 'Szer, Jeff', 'Taylor, Kerry', 'Herrmann, Richard', 'Seymour, John F', 'Arthur, Chris', 'Joske, David', 'Lynch, Kevin', 'Hughes, Tim']","['Branford S', 'Rudzki Z', 'Walsh S', 'Parkinson I', 'Grigg A', 'Szer J', 'Taylor K', 'Herrmann R', 'Seymour JF', 'Arthur C', 'Joske D', 'Lynch K', 'Hughes T']","['Division of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, South Australia 5000, Australia. susan.branford@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis']",2003/03/08 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/03/08 04:00'],"['2003/03/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2896 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54005-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 1;102(1):276-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2896.

Abnormalities of chromosome 5, 7, or both accounted for 76% of all cases with an abnormal karyotype. Seventeen patients acquired t-MDS/t-AML after autologous stem cell transplantation, but no unique pattern of cytogenetic abnormalities was observed. Shorter latency was observed for patients with balanced rearrangements (median, 28 vs 67 months; P <.0001). Patients with acute leukemia were more likely to have balanced rearrangement than those with myelodysplasia (28% vs 4%; P <.0001). Median survival time after diagnosis of t-MDS/t-AML was 8 months; survival at 5 years was less than 10%.

Three major groups of Map kinases exist: the p38 Map kinase family, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) family, and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) family. The members of the different Map kinase groups participate in the generation of various cellular responses, including gene transcription, induction of cell death or maintenance of cell survival, malignant transformation, and regulation of cell-cycle progression. Depending on the specific family isoform involved and the cellular context, Map kinase pathways can mediate signals that either promote or suppress the growth of malignant hematopoietic cells. Over the last few years, extensive work by several groups has established that Map kinase pathways play critical roles in the pathogenesis of various hematologic malignancies, providing new molecular targets for future therapeutic approaches. In this review, the involvement of various Map kinase pathways in the pathophysiology of hematologic malignances is summarized and the clinical implications of the recent advances in the field are discussed.","['Platanias, Leonidas C']",['Platanias LC'],"['Robert H.

Here, we demonstrate that treatment of the human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells with 17-AAG attenuates the intracellular levels of a number of Hsp-90 client proteins, including Akt, c-Raf-1, and c-Src. Also, 17-AAG induced the mitochondrial release and cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c (cyt c) and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac)/DIABLO, resulting in the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and apoptosis. Treatment with 17-AAG triggered the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax) conformational change associated with apoptosis, while Bax-deficient cells were resistant to 17-AAG-induced apoptosis. In addition, in HL-60/Bcl-2 and HL-60/Bcl-xL cells, which ectopically express Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL respectively, 17-AAG-induced Bax conformational change, cytosolic accumulation of cyt c and Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis were markedly inhibited. Although the rate of 17-AAG-mediated decline in Akt, c-Raf-1, and c-Src levels was blunted, the total decline was not compromised in HL-60/Bcl-2 and HL-60/Bcl-xL cells. Cotreatment with HA14-1, a nonpeptidic ligand that can bind and inhibit the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-2, significantly overcame the resistance to 17-AAG-induced apoptosis in HL-60/Bcl-2 cells. Together, these findings indicate that although 17-AAG treatment causes the levels of a number of survival-signaling protein kinases to decline, the downstream engagement of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is regulated by the activity of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Also, neutralizing the antiapoptotic effect of Bcl-2 would further enhance the antileukemia activity of 17-AAG.","['Nimmanapalli, Ramadevi', ""O'Bryan, Erica"", 'Kuhn, Deborah', 'Yamaguchi, Hirohito', 'Wang, Hong-Gang', 'Bhalla, Kapil N']","['Nimmanapalli R', ""O'Bryan E"", 'Kuhn D', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Wang HG', 'Bhalla KN']","['Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, University of South Florida, 12902 Magnolia Drive, MRC 3 East, Rm 3056, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones', 'Blotting, Western', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Rifabutin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein', 'src-Family Kinases/analysis/biosynthesis']",2003/03/08 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/03/08 04:00'],"['2003/03/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-12-3718 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54004-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 1;102(1):269-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3718.

Here, but more lipophilic free radical initiator, 2,2'-azobis (2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (AMVN) was investigated for its effects as a possible heat sensitizer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myelogenous monocytic leukaemia U937 cells were treated with hyperthermia combined with a various concentration of AMVN for investigating its ability to induce apoptosis and various parameters to identify the pathway. RESULTS: Combined treatment of hyperthermia and AMVN induced DNA fragmentation markedly, while hyperthermia or AMVN alone induced marginal DNA fragmentation. Fractions of cells showed low mitochondrial membrane potential and increased superoxide production after the combined treatment. Experiments using various caspase inhibitors and a fluorogenic monitor of caspase 3 activities indicated that caspase acts both up- and down-stream of mitochondria. CONCLUSIONS: AMVN is suggested to be a potential heat sensitizer effective at a lower concentration than AAPH.

Chimerism analysis showed that mixed chimerism was often observed in younger (<30 years old) patients. Mixed chimerism in older (> or =30 years old) patients was associated with rejection and relapse, while this was not found in younger patients. Among the chimerism of various cell populations, donor-derived CD56-positive cells are important in early engraftment when determined in allogeneic nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (allo-NST), regardless of the proportion of donor-derived CD3-positive cells. Complementarity-determining region three (CDR3) size spectratyping in T-cell receptor (TCR) chain subfamilies (Vbeta) showed that high level of diversity in TCR Vbeta repertoire is important for a late rejection and skewed TCR Vbeta repertoire is correlated with the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) especially chronic GVHD. Expression of inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptors such as CD158b and CD94/NKG2A on peripheral CD3-negative and -positive cells were increased in parallel with GVHD. Interestingly, these cells appeared to control GVHD, while preserving graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Analysis of cytokine gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that type 1 helper T cells (Th1)-derived cytokines increased in severe GVHD, while Th2-derived cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 increased in mild GVHD.

One hundred and thirty patients were randomly assigned to receive either radiotherapy involved field doses range from 40 to 48 Gy (median 44.5 Gy) or the same radiation therapy following chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone, by six cycles. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 58 out of 61 patients (95%) of the patients whose received radiotherapy, that was no different to 91% (63 out of 69 patients) in the combined therapy arm. However, at 10-years event-free survival (EFS) was 68% (95% confidence interval (CI): 61-73%) in the radiotherapy arm that was statistical different to 90% (95% CI: 86-94%) in the combined therapy group (p < 0.01). Overall survival (OS) showed statistical differences: 72% (95% CI 67-76%) in the radiotherapy group compared to 89% (95% CI: 84-93%) in the combined therapy arm (p < 0.01).

RESULTS: To further characterize this response, we investigated the mechanism which controls serum response transcription in cultured human cells. Frequency of PML (promyelocytic leukaemia)-nuclear bodies (NBs) formation increases shortly after serum stimulation, probably facilitating the interaction of SRF and CBP acetyltransferase at the NBs. PML modulates SRF-mediated c-fos promoter activities upon addition of serum to cells or expression of constitutively active Rho family GTPases. We mapped the region in the SRF that interacts with PML to the C-terminal transactivation domain. An SRF mutant deleted of the transactivation domain neither co-localizes with CBP in NBs nor fulfills its transcriptional role. Under conditions of serum stimulation, the formation of NBs coincides with the immediate-early expression of the endogenous c-fos gene in fibroblasts and in all-trans retinoic acid-treated acute promyelocytic leukaemia NB4 cells. CONCLUSION: These data provide an insight into the involvement of NBs in modulating the transcription of serum-induced immediate-early genes.","['Matsuzaki, Kazuhito', 'Minami, Takeshi', 'Tojo, Masahide', 'Honda, Yoshiomi', 'Saitoh, Noriko', 'Nagahiro, Shinji', 'Saya, Hideyuki', 'Nakao, Mitsuyoshi']","['Matsuzaki K', 'Minami T', 'Tojo M', 'Honda Y', 'Saitoh N', 'Nagahiro S', 'Saya H', 'Nakao M']","['Department of Regeneration Medicine, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,IM,"['Blood/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2003/03/08 04:00,2003/10/09 05:00,['2003/03/08 04:00'],"['2003/03/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['632 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2443.2003.00632.x [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2003 Mar;8(3):275-86. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2443.2003.00632.x.,,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (serum response factor kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A methodology that permits the phenotypical description of cells and tissues is introduced, as well as a variety of new evaluation techniques that allow researchers and physicians to evaluate the infrared data at different levels of sophistication. The detection of cell alterations in the case of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) demonstrates the capability of infrared spectroscopy to identify and stage this type of cancer, providing new prospects for diagnosis and treatment. The pathological study of oral tissue affected by Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) illustrates the potential of Infrared Spectroscopy and Imaging for tissue diagnosis and cancer staging based in altered cell biochemistry, without using stains or any other marker technology. An example of combined fluid, cell and tissue analysis of thyroid cancers based on infrared technology is introduced to demonstrate the possibility of earlier detection of gland abnormalities and biochemical alterations in cell extracts using fine needle aspirates. Simple statistical techniques such as bivariate histogram analysis can distinguish between normal and altered cells and tissues when applied to infrared spectra and images. More complex mathematical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) provide additional evaluation capabilities that can relate spectra of an unknown sample to an infrared reference database of known cell states. It is documented how this new infrared technology could enhance the diagnoses, treatment decisions and prognoses of patients in the field of cancer medicine.","['Schultz, Christian P']",['Schultz CP'],"['Bruker Optics Inc, 19 Fortune Drive, Billerica, MA 01821, USA.

Pigment Red 3 (CAS No. 2425-85-6) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Feed Studies).,1-289,"C.I. Pigment Red 3, a yellowish red solid, is widely used for coloring paints, inks, plastics, and rubber, and in textile printing. It is used in a wide range of consumer items such as wallpaper, typewriter ribbons, carbon paper, and art materials. Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by feeding groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex diets containing C.I. Pigment Red 3 (97% pure) for 2 weeks, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. 2-Week Studies: Groups of five rats and five mice of each sex were given feed containing 0, 6,000, 12,500, 25,000, 50,000, or 100,000 ppm C.I. Pigment Red 3 for 2 weeks. No chemical-related deaths occurred in rats or mice. Final mean body weights of exposed rats and male mice were lower than controls; female mice that received 6,000 and 50,000 ppm had significantly increased final mean body weights compared to that of the controls. The feed consumption of treated rats and mice was slightly greater than that of the controls, suggesting that C.I. Pigment Red 3 had no adverse effects on the feed palatability. Dose-related decreases in erythrocyte counts and hematocrit values and an increase in reticulocyte counts were observed in rats. Changes in these parameters were observed in mice, but there were no clear, dose-related trends. 13-Week Studies: Groups of ten rats and ten mice of each sex were given feed containing 0, 3,000, 6,000, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm C.I. Pigment Red 3 for 13 weeks. No chemical-related deaths were observed in rats or mice. The final mean body weights of exposed female rats were significantly lower than that of the controls; the final mean body weights of exposed male rats and exposed mice were similar to controls. There were significant increases in relative liver and kidney weights of exposed male rats. Increases in the relative liver weights in mice did not occur with a dose-related trend and thus they were not considered related to chemical administration. Sites for the toxicity of C.I. Pigment Red 3 were the bone marrow, kidney, liver, and spleen in rats. Lesions observed in rats included bone marrow hyperplasia, congestion and hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen, and iron-positive pigmentation of the spleen, kidney, and liver. Sites for the toxicity of C.I. Pigment Red 3 in mice were the liver, kidney, and spleen in males and the liver and spleen in females. Lesions noted among mice in the spleen were hematopoietic cell proliferation and iron-positive pigmentation. In the liver, there was hematopoietic cell proliferation in male and female mice. Cytomegaly occurred in the renal tubule epithelium of the male mouse kidney. 2-Year Studies: Doses selected for the 2-year feed studies were 0, 6,000, 12,500, and 25,000 ppm for rats and 0, 12,500, 25,000, and 50,000 ppm for mice. The dose selection for rats was based on body weight changes observed for females that received 50,000 ppm; the dose selection for mice was based on the lack of body weight depression or death at the doses tested during the 13-week studies. Concentrations higher than 50,000 ppm in the feed were not used because higher levels might have adversely affected the nutritional value of the diet during the 2-year studies. Body Weight, Feed Consumption, Clinical Findings, and Survival in the 2-Year Studies: Final mean body weights for male rats that received 25,000 ppm, female rats that received 12,500 and 25,000 ppm, and male and female mice that received 50,000 ppm were more than 10% lower than those of the controls. Feed consumption of exposed rats and mice was similar to that of the controls. No clinical findings indicative of toxicity were observed in rats or mice. The survival of low-dose male rats was greater than that of the controls (0 ppm, 28/50; 6,000 ppm, 40/50; 12,500 ppm, 28/50; 25,000 ppm, 20/50). Survival of exposed female rats and exposed male mice was similar to the controls; the survival of high-dose female mice was significantly decreased compared to thcompared to that of the controls (39/50, 37/50, 31/50, 25/50). The reduced survival in this dose group may have been due to the increased incidence of ovarian abscesses. Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions in the 2-Year Studies: Benign adrenal pheochromocytomas were significantly increased in the 12,500 and 25,000 ppm groups of male rats compared to the controls (22/50, 29/50, 35/50, 34/50). However, malignant neoplasms were not increased in incidence (6/50, 7/50, 10/50, 4/50). The incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in dosed groups exceeded the range for NTP historical controls for feed studies (22&percnt;-48&percnt;), and the increased incidence of this neoplasm was attributed to C.I. Pigment Red 3 administration. Squamous cell papillomas of the skin occurred with a positive trend in male rats (0/50, 4/50, 2/50, 6/50), and the incidence in the high-dose group was significantly greater than that of the controls. A poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (diagnosed as carcinoma) was observed in a control male. The historical control rate for squamous cell papillomas in NTP feed studies is low (16/800 or 2&percnt;, range 0&percnt;-4&percnt;), and the higher incidence of this tumor in male rats may have been caused by the administration of C.I. Pigment Red 3. Hepatocellular adenomas occurred with a positive trend in female rats, with a significantly greater incidence in the high-dose group than in the control group (0/50, 0/50, 1/50, 10/50). This neoplasm has occurred in only one historical control group in NTP feed studies (3/800, range 0&percnt;-6&percnt;), and the increase in hepatocellular adenomas in female rats was attributed to chemical administration. Chemical-related nonneoplastic lesions observed in the livers of male and female rats included eosinophilic or mixed type foci of cellular alteration. Foci were often accompanied by angiectasis and cystic degeneration in males and by granulomas and cholesterol pigmentation in females. Chronic nephropathy occurred with increased severity in exposed male and female rats. The lesions were more severe in males than in females. Other lesions considered secondary to renal disease included parathyroid gland hyperplasia, fibrous osteodystrophy of the bone, and mineralization of various organs (stomach, intestine, heart, and blood vessels). The increased incidence of hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the renal papilla observed in treated rats was considered to be part of the chronic nephropathy. Zymbal's gland carcinoma incidences were marginally increased in the mid- and high-dose male rats (0/50, 0/50, 2/50, 3/50). The incidence in the high-dose group was outside the NTP historical control range (0&percnt;-4&percnt;), and the Zymbal's gland carcinomas may have been related to C.I. Pigment Red 3 administration. Mononuclear cell leukemias, mammary gland fibroadenomas, and preputial gland/clitoral gland adenomas occurred at lower incidences in exposed male and female rats. The decrease in mononuclear cell leukemia was attributed to the direct effect of C.I. Pigment Red 3 or its metabolites on the mechanism responsible for inducing leukemias in aging rats, while the decreased incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas might be attributed to decreased body weights in female rats. The cause of the decreased incidences of preputial and clitoral gland tumors is unknown. Tubule adenomas of the renal cortex occurred at a significantly higher incidence in high-dose male mice than in controls (0 ppm, 0/50; 12,500 ppm, 0/50; 25,000 ppm, 0/50; 50,000 ppm, 6/50). Because this tumor occurred only in exposed males and was outside the range for NTP historical controls in feed studies (0&percnt;-2&percnt;), renal cortical tubule adenomas in male mice were considered to be related to the administration of C.I. Pigment Red 3. Follicular cell adenoma of the thyroid gland occurred with a positive trend in male mice (0/50, 0/49, 1/50, 5/50). Theincidence in the high-dose group was significantly greater than that in the controls. This chemical-related effect is supported by the increased incidence of follicular cell hyperplasia. Because the incidence of this tumor exceeded the range of the historical controls from NTP feed studies (0&percnt;-4&percnt;), the increase of follicular cell adenoma was attributed to chemical administration. Female mice receiving C.I. Pigment Red 3 had a significant increase in follicular cell hyperplasia but showed no increase in tumor incidence at this site. Focal renal tubule hyperplasia and cystic hyperplasia occurred in exposed male mice but not in the controls. Cytomegaly (karyomegaly) of the renal tubule epithelium was seen in all treated male mice. The severity of the accompanying chronic nephropathy was increased in both male and female mice. Genetic Toxicology: C.I. Pigment Red 3 was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA98 in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation (S9); no increases in gene mutation were observed in strains TA1535 and TA1537, with or without S9. C.I. Pigment Red 3 did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells in either the presence or the absence of S9. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Pigment Red 3 in male F344/N rats as exhibited by increased incidences of benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland. The marginal increase in the incidences of squamous cell papillomas of the skin and Zymbal's gland carcinomas may have been related to C.I. Pigment Red 3 administration. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Pigment Red 3 in female F344/N rats as indicated by the increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Pigment Red 3 in male B6C3F1 mice as exhibited by the increased incidences of tubule adenomas of the renal cortex and follicular cell adenomas of the thyroid gland. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Pigment Red 3 in female B6C3F1 mice that received 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and preputial gland tumors in male rats and mononuclear cell leukemia, mammary gland fibroadenoma, and clitoral gland tumors in female rats were lower in the exposed groups. The incidences of liver foci were markedly increased in exposed male and female rats. The severity of chronic nephropathy was increased in male rats and to a lesser extent in female rats given C.I. Pigment Red 3. An increase in the severity of nephropathy was observed in male and female mice; cytomegaly (karyomegaly) of renal tubule epithelium was observed in male mice. Thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia occurred with an increased incidence in male and female mice receiving C.I. Pigment Red 3.

Pigment Red 23 (CAS No. 6471-49-4) in F344 Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Feed Studies).,1-283,"C.I. Pigment Red 23 is a bluish red commercial dye used as a coloring agent in paints, inks, rubber, plastics, lacquers, and paper. Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by feeding groups of rats and mice diets containing C.I. Pigment Red 23 (greater than 96% pure) for 17 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and in Chinese hamster ovary cells. 17-Day Studies: Groups of five rats and five mice of each sex were fed diets containing 0, 6,000, 12,500, 25,000, 50,000, or 100,000 ppm C.I. Pigment Red 23 for 15 to 17 days. All rats and all female mice lived until the end of the studies. Two male mice in the 12,500 ppm dose group died accidentally. No other deaths occurred among male mice. Final mean body weights of rats and mice receiving C.I. Pigment Red 23 were within 10% of those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed animals was similar to that of the controls. Hematocrit value, hemoglobin concentration, and erythrocyte count were decreased in the 50,000 and 100,000 ppm groups of rats. A corresponding decrease was not seen in mice. Absolute and relative organ weights of exposed animals were generally similar to those of the controls. No chemical-related gross lesions were seen in rats or mice. 13-Week Studies: Groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of each sex were fed diets containing 0, 3,000, 6,000, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm C.I. Pigment Red 23 for 13 weeks. All rats and mice lived until the end of the studies. Final mean body weights of rats and mice receiving C.I. Pigment Red 23 were within 10% of those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed animals was similar to that of the controls. In 50,000 ppm male rats, hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations and erythrocyte counts were significantly less than those of the controls. In female rats receiving 3,000, 6,000 and 50,000 ppm C.I. Pigment Red 23, lymphocyte counts were significantly higher than the control values. Leukocyte counts in 3,000 ppm females were also significantly increased. Female mice in the 6,000 ppm dose group had significantly lower hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations than did untreated females. Hematology parameters in exposed males were similar to those of untreated males. There were no biologically significant differences in organ weights among dosed and control rats. Absolute and relative liver weights of male mice receiving 12,500 ppm C.I. Pigment Red 23 were significantly increased compared to those of the controls. Absolute and relative thymus weights for all but 12,500 ppm female mice were significantly lower than those of the controls. No chemical-related gross or histopathologic lesions occurred in rats or mice. 2-Year Studies: Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings Because levels of C.I. Pigment Red 23 as high as 50,000 or 100,000 ppm in the feed did not adversely affect survival and mean body weights in the 17-day and 13-week studies, nor cause any chemical- related lesions, doses of 0, 10,000, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm were selected for the 2-year studies. Doses higher than 50,000 ppm (5%) are not used in 2-year studies because they may lead to excessive dilution of nutrients in feed which in turn could produce nutritional deficiencies. Survival rates of mid- and high-dose male and of high-dose female rats were significantly greater than those of the controls, due primarily to a chemical related decreased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in these groups (survival in male rats: control, 22/50, low-dose, 29/50, mid-dose, 36/50, high-dose, 35/51; female rats: 29/50, 34/50, 33/50, 40/50). Survival of mice was not affected by the administration of C.I. Pigment Red 23, although survival of low-dose male mice was significantly lower than that of controls (male mice: 29/51, 17/53, 27/52, 30/51; female mice: 35/50, 34/49, 36/50, 35/49). The decreased survival in the low- dose males was associated with evidence of body trauma and secondary septicemia caused by fighting. From approximately week 20 of the study, the group mean body weight, the group mean body weights of exposed female rats were consistently lower than those of controls; at week 101, mean body weights of mid- dose (25,000 ppm) and high-dose (50,000 ppm) females were 6&percnt; and 8&percnt; less, respectively. The final mean body weights of exposed male rats and male and female mice were similar to those of controls. Feed consumption values for exposed male and female rats and mice were similar to those of the controls and there were no clinical signs associated with the administration of C.I. Pigment Red 23. Pathology Findings: Renal tubule adenomas occurred in two high- dose male rats. Renal tubule carcinomas occurred in one high-dose male and one mid-dose male rat. No renal tubule neoplasms were seen in the controls. Renal tubule neoplasms are uncommon and have occurred in 8/499 (1.6&percnt;) untreated historical controls with a range of 0&percnt; to 6&percnt;. The residual halves of kidneys from control and high-dose males were step sectioned and examined; renal tubule adenomas were observed in a control male and in two additional high- dose males. Because of the low numbers of renal neoplasms, it is uncertain if they were related to chemical administration. The incidence of renal tubule hyperplasia (3/50, 6/48, 5/50, 8/50) and the mean severity of nephropathy were also slightly increased in high-dose male rats. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia occurred with a significant negative trend in exposed male and female rats. No chemical-related increases in the incidence of neoplasms were observed in mice of either sex. There was a chemical-related increase in the incidence of hyperplasia (male mice: 0/49, 1/48, 1/50, 7/48; female mice: 6/49, 14/49, 43/50, 47/49) and hyperkeratosis of the forestomach epithelium attributed to chemical administration. Genetic Toxicology: C.I. Pigment Red 23 was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1537, and TA98 with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9), but it was not mutagenic in strain TA1535. C.I. Pigment Red 23 induced sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells in the absence of S9, but not with S9 activation. The pigment was negative for the induction of chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells both in the presence and absence of S9. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Pigment Red 23 in male F344 rats as evidenced by a marginally increased incidence of renal tubule cell neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Pigment Red 23 in female F344 rats fed diets containing 10,000, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm. Mononuclear cell leukemia occurred with a decreased incidence in male and female rats receiving C.I. Pigment Red 23. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Pigment Red 23 in male and female B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 10,000, 25,000 or 50,000 ppm. The severity of kidney nephropathy was increased in exposed male rats. In mice, C.I. Pigment Red 23 caused an increase in hyperkeratosis and epithelial hyperplasia of the fore- stomach.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering furan (purity > 99%) in corn oil by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 16 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Drosophila melanogaster, mouse bone marrow cells, mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. 16-Day Studies: Groups of five male rats received doses of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg of furan per kg of body weight and groups of five female rats and five mice of each sex received doses of 0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg/kg in corn oil by gavage. All male and female mice and female rats that received 160 mg/kg, all male and female rats and all male and four female mice that received 80 mg/kg, and three male mice that received 40 mg/kg died by day 8. Final mean body weights of male rats that received 20 mg/kg and of male and female rats that received 40 mg/kg were significantly lower than controls. Final mean body weights of male mice that received 10 or 20 mg/kg were significantly greater than controls. Mottled and enlarged livers were observed at necropsy in male rats that received 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg and in females that received 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg. No lesions were observed at necropsy that were considered related to furan administration in mice. 13-Week Studies: Groups of 10 rats of each sex and groups of 10 female mice received doses of 0, 4, 8, 15, 30, or 60 mg of furan per kg of body weight, and groups of 10 male mice received doses of 0, 2, 4, 8, 15, or 30 mg/kg in corn oil by gavage. Nine male and four female rats that received 60 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. There were no chemical-related deaths in mice. Final mean body weights of male rats that received 15 or 30 mg/kg and female rats that received 60 mg/kg were significantly lower than controls. Final mean body weights of male mice that received 60 mg/kg were significantly lower than controls. Relative and absolute liver weights in both sexes of rats and mice were increased in groups that received furan, as were relative and absolute kidney weights in female rats that received furan. Thymus weights were decreased in all groups of rats that received furan. Toxic lesions of the liver (bile duct hyperplasia, cholangiofibrosis, cytomegaly and degeneration of hepatocytes, and nodular hyperplasia of hepatocytes) were associated with furan administration in all dose groups of rats; the severity of the lesions increased with dose. Kidney lesions (tubule dilatation and necrosis of tubule epithelium) were present in rats that received 30 or 60 mg/kg. Thymic atrophy and testicular or ovarian atrophy were also observed in rats exposed to 60 mg/kg furan. Toxic liver lesions (cytomegaly, degeneration, and necrosis of hepatocytes) were also present in all groups of furan-exposed mice. Bile duct hyperplasia and cholangiofibrosis were observed in groups of mice receiving 30 or 60 mg/kg. Doses selected for the 2-year studies of rats and mice were based on the hepatotoxicity associated with exposure to furan. 2-Year Studies: Groups of 70 rats of each sex were administered 2, 4, or 8 mg furan per kg body weight in corn oil by gavage 5 days per week for 2 years. After 9 and 15 months of chemical exposure, 10 rats per group were evaluated for the presence of treatment-associated lesions. Groups of 50 mice of each sex received doses of 8 or 15 mg/kg furan 5 days per week for 2 years. Body Weight and Survival: Mean body weights of male rats that received 8 mg/kg furan were lower than controls from approximately week 73 to the end of the study. Survival of male and female rats that received 8 mg/kg was lower than controls from approximately week 85 to the end of the studies as a result of moribund condition associatedassociated with liver and biliary tract neoplasms and mononuclear cell leukemia. Mean body weights of male and female mice that received 15 mg/kg furan were lower than controls during the studies. Survival of low- and high-dose male and high-dose female mice was lower than controls from approximately week 80 to the end of the studies as a result of moribund condition associated with liver neoplasms. Neoplastic and Nonneoplastic Lesions: Cholangiocarcinoma of the liver occurred in all groups of dosed rats (males: control, 0/50; low dose, 43/50; mid dose, 48/50; high dose, 49/50; females: 0/50; 49/50; 50/50; 48/50) and was present in many rats of each sex at the 9- and 15-month interim evaluations (9-month: males - 0/10, 5/10, 7/10, 10/10; females - 0/10, 4/10, 9/10, 10/10; 15-month: males - 0/10, 7/10, 9/10, 6/10; females - 0/10, 9/10, 9/10, 7/10). Hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) were significantly increased in male rats after 2 years of chemical administration (1/50, 5/50, 22/50, 35/50) and hepatocellular adenomas were significantly increased in female rats (0/50, 2/50, 4/50, 7/50); hepatocellular neoplasms were not observed at the 9- or 15-month interim evaluations. Increased incidences of numerous nonneoplastic liver lesions were present in rats administered furan. These lesions included biliary tract fibrosis, hyperplasia, chronic inflammation, and proliferation and hepatocyte cytomegaly, cytoplasmic vacuolization, degeneration, nodular hyperplasia, and necrosis. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was increased in male and female rats that received 4 or 8 mg/kg furan (males: 8/50, 11/50, 17/50, 25/50; females: 8/50, 9/50, 17/50, 21/50); the incidence in the 8 mg/kg groups of each sex exceeded the historical control ranges for corn oil gavage studies. The severity of nephropathy increased with dose and the incidence was significantly increased in all groups of dosed rats; this increased severity was accompanied by an associated increased incidence of parathyroid hyperplasia (renal secondary hyperparathyroidism). The incidence of forestomach hyperplasia was increased in male and female rats (males: 1/50, 4/49, 7/50, 6/50; females: 0/50, 2/50, 5/50, 5/50) and the incidence of subacute inflammation of the forestomach was increased in female rats (0/50, 1/50, 5/50, 6/50). No forestomach neoplasms were observed in males; a squamous papilloma was present in one low-dose female. The incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were significantly increased in mice receiving furan (males: adenoma - 20/50, 33/50, 42/50; carcinoma - 7/50, 32/50, 34/50; females: adenoma - 5/50, 31/50, 48/50; carcinoma - 2/50, 7/50, 27/50). The incidences of numerous nonneoplastic hepatocellular lesions were increased in dosed mice. These lesions included hepatocyte cytomegaly, degeneration, necrosis, multifocal hyperplasia, and cytoplasmic vacuolization and biliary tract dilatation, fibrosis, hyperplasia, and inflammation. The incidences of benign pheochromocytoma and focal hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla were increased in low- and high-dose male and in high-dose female mice (benign pheochromocytoma: males - 1/49, 6/50, 10/50; females - 2/50, 1/50, 6/50). The incidences of squamous papilloma, focal inflammation, and papillary hyperplasia of the forestomach were increased in male mice (squamous papilloma: 0/49, 1/50, 3/50; focal inflammation: 9/49, 13/50, 21/50; papillary hyperplasia: 7/49, 14/50, 22/50). Stop-Exposure Study: A separate 2-year study was conducted in which 50 male rats were administered 30 mg/kg furan in corn oil by gavage 5 days per week for 13 weeks and then maintained for the remainder of the 2 years without additional furan administration. Groups of 10 animals were evaluated for the presence of treatment-related lesions at the end of the 13-week period of furan administration and at 9 and 15 months. Neoplastic and Nonneoplastic Lesions: Cholangiocarcinoma of the liver occurred with an overall incidence of 100&percnt; (40/40) and hepatocellular carcinoma occurred with an overall incidence of 15&percnt; (6/40) in stop-exposure male rats that survived at least 9 months. Cholangiocarcinoma was observed in all 10 males at both the 9-month and 15-month interim evaluations. Hepatocellular carcinoma was first observed in 2 males at the 15-month interim evaluation. Genetic Toxicology: Furan was negative for induction of gene mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA98 in the presence and the absence of exogenous metabolic activation (S9). Furan was negative for the induction of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster when administered either by feeding or by injection. In vitro tests for genotoxicity in mammalian cells, however, were positive. Furan induced trifluorothymidine resistance in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells in the absence of S9, and sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without S9. Furan administered to male B6C3F1 mice by intraperitoneal injection induced chromosomal aberrations but not sister chromatid exchanges in bone marrow cells. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of furan in male and female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular neoplasms of the liver and on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of furan in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms of the liver and benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland. Nonneoplastic liver lesions associated with furan administration in rats and mice included biliary tract fibrosis, hyperplasia, inflammation, and proliferation, as well as hepatocellular cytomegaly, degeneration, hyperplasia, necrosis, and vacuolization. In rats, increased severity of nephropathy with an associated increased incidence of parathyroid hyperplasia was associated with exposure to furan.

Acid Red 114 (CAS No. 6459-94-5) in F344/N Rats (Drinking Water Studies).,1-236,"C.I. Acid Red 114 is one of five chemicals being evaluated in 2-year carcinogenicity and toxicity studies as part of the NTP's Benzidine Dye Initiative. This Initiative was designed to evaluate representative benzidine congeners, benzidine congener-derived dyes, and benzidine-derived dyes. C.I. Acid Red 114 was nominated for study because of the potential for human exposure during production of bisazobiphenyl dyes and because benzidine, a structurally related chemical, is a known human carcinogen. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering desalted, industrial grade C.I. Acid Red 114 in drinking water to groups of F344/N rats of each sex for 13 days, 13 weeks, 9 or 15 months, or 2 years. These studies were performed only in rats because studies of benzidine congeners were being performed in mice at the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR). Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and Drosophila melanogaster. 13-Day Studies: Rats were exposed to C.I. Acid Red 114 in drinking water at doses of 0, 10,000, 20,000, or 30,000 ppm. All control and dosed rats survived except one male rat in the 20,000 ppm dose group. Final mean body weights in the three dosed groups were 94%, 83%, or 77% of controls for males and 92%, 88%, or 80% of controls for females. Water consumption declined with increased dose. Clinical findings included red stained fur, ears, and tail in all test animals. On gross necropsy, organs and tissues were also stained red. 13-Week Studies: C.I. Acid Red 114 was administered in drinking water at doses of 0, 600, 1,200, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm. All control and dosed animals survived until the end of the study. Final mean body weights in the five dosed groups were 97%, 89%, 87%, 87%, or 85% of controls for males and 97%, 94%, 94%, 92%, or 89% of controls for females. Water consumption was decreased in dosed animals. As was seen in the 13-day studies, major organs and tissues from treated animals were stained red. Kidney toxicity characterized by regeneration and karyomegaly of tubule epithelial cells with chronic inflammation was observed in female rats at doses of 1,200 ppm or above. Treatment-related increases in relative liver weights and elevated liver enzyme levels were seen in males and females, centrilobular pallor in the liver was seen in all male dose groups. Because of these body weight differences, decreases in water consumption, and organ toxicity, the doses chosen for the 2-year studies were 70,150, and 300 ppm for males and 150, 300, and 600 for females. 2-Year Studies: Male rats received doses of 0, 70, 150, or 300 ppm of C.I. Acid Red 114, and female rats received 0, 150, 300, or 600 ppm. Seventy animals were in the control and high-dose groups, 45 in the low-dose groups, and 75 in the mid-dose groups. Ten animals were evaluated from the control and high-dose groups at 9 months, and ten animals from all dose groups were evaluated at 15 months. The average amount of compound consumed per day was 4, 8, or 20 mg/kg for males and 9, 20, or 70 mg/kg for females. Survival and Body Weights: Survival at 105 weeks for male rats receiving 0, 70, 150, or 300 ppm was 24/50, 15/35, 26/65, and 1/50; for females receiving 0, 150, or 300 ppm, survival was 36/50, 13/35, and 6/64. All female rats receiving 600 ppm died by week 89. The decreased survival in treated groups was due primarily to the development of chemical-related neoplasms. Of the surviving animals, the final mean body weights for males receiving 70 or 150 ppm were 94% and 90% of control and for females receiving 150 or 300 ppm, 99% and 84% of control. These weight differences began in the second year of the studies and were attributed in part to the development of neoplasms in the dosed groups. Histopathologic Effects in the 2-Year Studies: At 9 and 15 months, a few neoplasms were seen in the liver, lung, clitoral gland, skin, Zymbal's gland, oral cavity epithelium, and small and large intestine, and the number of neoplasms at these sites increased as gland, skin, Zymbal's gland, oral cavity epithelium, and small and large intestine, and the number of neoplasms at these sites increased as the studies progressed. At 2 years, there was a clear carcinogenic response in the skin, Zymbal's gland, and liver of male and female rats, and in the clitoral gland, oral cavity epithelium, small and large intestine, and lung in female rats. Treatment-related increases were also seen in the incidence in neoplasms of the oral cavity epithelium, adrenal gland, and lung of male rats, and in mononuclear cell leukemia and in neoplasms of the mammary gland and adrenal gland in female rats. The incidence of these neoplasms was generally lower, but was significant and considered to be marginally related to chemical treatment. The same neoplastic effects have been previously observed in some or all of the NTP studies with dimethoxybenzidine, dimethylbenzidine, or C.I. Direct Blue 15. Genetic Toxicology: In a standard preincubation protocol, C.I. Acid Red 114 was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the presence of induced hamster liver S9, and an equivocal response was noted in strain TA100 with hamster liver S9. However, no significant mutagenic activity was noted in strains TA1535 or TA1537 with or without S9 activation. In a modified S. typhimurium gene mutation test which employed reductive metabolism followed by oxidative metabolism with S9 liver enzymes, C.I. Acid Red 114 was strongly mutagenic in strain TA1538. C.I. Acid Red 114 did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells with or without S9 activation; reductive metabolism was not used in these cytogenetic tests. No increase in sex-linked recessive lethal mutations was observed in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster administered C.I. Acid Red 114 by feeding or injection. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year drinking water studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of C.I. Acid Red 114 for male F344/N rats, as indicated by benign and malignant neoplasms of the skin, Zymbal's gland, and liver. Increased incidences of neoplasms of the oral cavity epithelium, adrenal gland, and lung may have been related to chemical administration. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for female F344/N rats, as indicated by benign and malignant neoplasms of the skin, Zymbal's gland, clitoral gland, liver, oral cavity epithelium, small and large intestines, and lung. Increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia, mammary gland adenocarcinoma, and adrenal gland pheochromocytomas may have been related to chemical administration.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering g-butyrolactone (greater than 97% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex, 5 days per week for 16 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Drosophila melanogaster, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. 16-Day Studies: Groups of five rats of each sex received doses of 0, 75, 150, 300, 600, or 1,200 mg of g-butyrolactone per kg of body weight and groups of five mice of each sex received doses of 0, 87, 175, 350, 700, or 1,400 mg/kg. All male and female rats given 1,200 mg/kg and one male rat given 600 mg/kg died within 3 days. The mean body weight gain of female rats given 600 mg/kg was significantly lower than that of the controls. Mean body weight gains of the other female dose groups and all male dose groups were similar to those of the controls. All of the male and four female mice receiving 1,400 mg/kg died during the studies. Mean body weight gains of dosed mice were generally similar to those of the controls. Rats receiving 600 or 1,200 mg/kg and mice receiving 350 mg/kg or more became inactive or recumbent with irregular respiration following dosing. 13-Week Studies: Groups of 10 rats of each sex received doses of 0, 56, 112, 225, 450, or 900 mg of g-butyrolactone per kg of body weight and groups of 10 mice of each sex received doses of 0, 65, 131, 262, 525, or 1,050 mg/kg. One female and all male rats given 900 mg/kg died during the studies. The final mean body weight and mean body weight gain of male rats receiving 450 mg/kg were significantly lower than those of the controls; final mean body weights and body weight gains of all female rat dose groups were similar to those of the controls. There was an increased incidence of focal inflammation of the nasal mucosa in rats administered g-butyrolactone. Three male mice and one female receiving 1,050 mg/kg died from g-butyrolactone toxicity during the studies. The mean body weight gain and final mean body weight of high-dose male mice were lower than those of the controls; the mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of dosed female mice were similar to those of the controls. No lesions related to the administration of g-butyrolactone occurred in mice of either sex. 2-Year Studies: The doses administered to groups of 50 animals per sex were 0, 112, and 225 mg ofg-butyrolactone per kg of body weight for male rats; 0, 225, and 450 mg/kg for female rats; and 0, 262, and 525 mg/kg for male and female mice. Body Weight and Survival in the 2-Year Studies: The mean body weights of male rats administered g-butyrolactone were similar to those of the controls throughout the study. The mean body weight of high-dose females was lower than that of the controls after week 5 and was 10% to 20% lower than that of the controls throughout the second year. The survival of high-dose male rats was slightly higher than that of the controls (control, 24/50; low-dose, 27/50, high-dose, 32/50) due primarily to a lower incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in the high-dose group (16/50, 15/50, 9/50). The survival of dosed females was similar to that of the controls (28/50, 27/50, 28/50). The mean body weights of dosed male mice were lower than those of the controls throughout the study, but the differences in mean body weights decreased when male mice were housed individually at week 67. The final mean body weights of dosed male mice were 6% lower than that of the controls. Mean body weights of dosed female mice were also lower than those of the controls throughout the study, and the final mean body weights were from 14% to 17% lower than that of the controls. The survival in high-dose male mice was significantly lower than that of the controls (35/50, 30/50, 12/50) due to bite wounds and fighting in high-dose males recovering from the sedative effects of g-becovering from the sedative effects of g-butyrolactone. The survival of female dosed mice was similar to that of the controls (38/50, 34/50, 38/50). Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions in the 2-Year Studies: No increased incidences of neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions in male rats were related to the administration of g-butyrolactone for 2 years. In female rats, negative trends were observed in the incidences of cysts (42/50, 35/50, 23/50) and fibroadenomas of the mammary gland (22/50, 14/50, 6/50) and in cysts of the pituitary pars distalis (25/49, 13/37, 11/48). These decreases were considered to be related to g-butyrolactone administration. Increased incidences of proliferative lesions, primarily hyperplasia, of the adrenal medulla in low-dose male mice were associated with g-butyrolactone administration (pheochromocytoma, benign or malignant: 2/48, 6/50, 1/50; hyperplasia: 2/48, 9/50, 4/50). The incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms in both dose groups of male mice was lower than the incidence in the controls (hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma: 24/50, 8/50, 9/50). Genetic Toxicology: g-Butyrolactone was not mutagenic, with or without exogenous metabolic activation (S9), in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537, nor did it induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster when administered in feed or by injection. Positive results were obtained, however, in cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells; g-butyrolactone induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in trials conducted in the presence of S9 activation. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of g-butyrolactone in male F344/N rats given 112 or 225 mg/kg or in female F344/N rats given 225 or 450 mg/kg in corn oil. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of g-butyrolactone in male B6C3F1 mice based on marginally increased incidences of adrenal medulla pheochromocytomas and hyperplasia in the low-dose group. The sensitivity of the study in male mice to detect a carcinogenic effect was reduced by the low survival of the high-dose group associated with fighting. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of g-butyrolactone in female B6C3F1 mice given 262 or 525 mg/kg in corn oil. A decreased incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms in dosed male mice and decreased incidences of mammary gland fibroadenomas and cysts and pituitary cysts in female rats were associated with the administration of g-butyrolactone.

However, little is known about the gonadotoxic potential of the newly introduced nonmyeloablative transplants. We undertook a 24-month longitudinal study in a cohort of 32 recipients of nonmyeloablative transplantation to test whether the combined regimen of fludarabine, melphalan and CAMPATH-1H can induce damage to germ cell (GC) and Leydig cell (LC) compartments. Testicular function was assessed immediately prior to transplantation and at four time points post-transplant to compare hormonal levels before and after the procedure. Two other groups treated with BEAM- and TBI-related regimes were also included in the study group for comparative purposes. GC function was assessed by measuring basal serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). LC function was assessed by measuring basal luteinising hormone (LH) and testosterone (T) levels. LC reserve was assessed by measuring the T/LH ratio. As a group, patients who received a non myeloablative transplant sustained severe damage to the GC compartment, as evident from a substantial elevation in the FSH level post-transplant (12 IU/l vs 18.4 IU/l, P<0.001). Similar to the GC injury, patients as a group sustained significant damage to the LC compartment following the transplant (5.4 IU/l vs 9.6 IU/l, P<0.001). In general, patients had reduced LC reserve post-BMT, as evident from a diminished T/LH ratio (2.6 pretransplant vs 1.6 post-transplant P=0.05). Patients who received a nonmyeloablative transplant had a similar effect on the GC and LC compartments compared to those who had a BEAM autograft. On the other hand, patients who received a TBI-based transplant sustained more damage to their GC and LC compartments compared to those who received a nonmyeloblative transplant; however, this was not statistically significant (P=0.09). Our data suggest that this type of regimen is potentially gonadotoxic and consideration should be given to fertility counselling and testosterone replacement therapy post-transplant.","['Kyriacou, C', 'Kottaridis, P D', 'Eliahoo, J', 'McKeag, N', 'Bomford, J', 'McGarrigle, H H', 'Linch, D C', 'Mackinnon, S', 'Chatterjee, R']","['Kyriacou C', 'Kottaridis PD', 'Eliahoo J', 'McKeag N', 'Bomford J', 'McGarrigle HH', 'Linch DC', 'Mackinnon S', 'Chatterjee R']","['Department of Hematology, University College London Hospitals, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/classification/therapy', 'Leydig Cells/*pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Lymphoma/classification/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Testosterone/blood', 'Time Factors']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/08/21 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703777 [doi]', '1703777 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Jan;31(1):45-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703777.,,,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two groups of patients (by cell source) were comparable with respect to age, sex, disease status, year at transplant and graft T cell depletion. Engraftment was achieved in about 90% regardless of stem cell source or leukaemia type. Kinetics of neutrophil and platelet recovery, similar for both sources in ALL patients, were faster for PBSC in AML patients. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease was similar for both sources in AML patients, but higher for PBSC in ALL patients (74 vs 54%, P=0.05). The 1-year probability of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 40 and 45% (P=0.66) in ALL patients compared to 49 and 35% (P=0.13) in AML patients (PBSC vs BM). In AML patients, none of the following differed significantly with cell source: transplant-related mortality, relapse incidence, leukaemia-free survival and overall survival. In ALL patients, the transplant-related mortality for PBSC vs BM was 61 vs 47% (P=0.13), the relapse incidence was 47 vs 39% (P=0.17), the leukaemia-free survival was 21 vs 32% (P=0.04) and the overall survival was 24 vs 34% (P=0.04). These data suggest that the short-term outcome of allogeneic PBSC is not significantly different from that of BM in AML patients who underwent a transplant from a matched unrelated donor but, conversely, that survival with PBSC may be decreased in ALL patients. In conclusion, the source of transplant cells needs to be evaluated by disease, especially when dealing with unrelated donors.","['Garderet, L', 'Labopin, M', 'Gorin, N C', 'Polge, E', 'Fouillard, L', 'Ehninger, G E', 'Ringden, O', 'Finke, J', 'Tura, S', 'Frassoni, F']","['Garderet L', 'Labopin M', 'Gorin NC', 'Polge E', 'Fouillard L', 'Ehninger GE', 'Ringden O', 'Finke J', 'Tura S', 'Frassoni F']","['Centre International Greffes AP-HP, Institut des Cordeliers, Paris.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/08/21 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703778 [doi]', '1703778 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Jan;31(1):23-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703778.,,,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute GVHD of >or=grade II occurred in 27 of 110 (25%) patients before DLI and in 39 of 79 (49%) patients after DLI. In total, 12 of 27 (44%) patients without DLI and 44 of 72 (61%) patients who received DLI developed chronic GVHD. A total of 19 patients died of GVHD, with 17 of acute and two of chronic GVHD. Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at 5 years were 27 and 21%, respectively. The 2-year incidence of relapse was 14%. In multivariate analysis, only chronic GVHD was a good prognostic factor for both OS: hazard ratio (HR) 1.4, P=0.04, and EFS: HR 1.6, P=0.01. Both acute and chronic GVHD were favorable prognostic factors for relapse probability: HR 1.9 for both, P=0.02, 0.01, respectively. The 1-year cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM), excluding cases of GVHD, was 42%. The two most common causes of 1-year non-GVHD death were viral infection (9%) and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (12%). Although the incidence of relapse was low, the study suggests that the current scheme of DLI in unrelated TCD-BMT would not improve survival unless TRM decreases significantly.","['Lee, C-K', 'deMagalhaes-Silverman, M', 'Hohl, R J', 'Hayashi, M', 'Buatti, J', 'Wen, B-C', 'Schlueter, A', 'Strauss, R G', 'Gingrich, R D']","['Lee CK', 'deMagalhaes-Silverman M', 'Hohl RJ', 'Hayashi M', 'Buatti J', 'Wen BC', 'Schlueter A', 'Strauss RG', 'Gingrich RD']","['Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The University of Iowa, IA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'CD3 Complex/blood', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Probability', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology/*transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703803 [doi]', '1703803 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Jan;31(2):121-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703803.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most instances, these disorders are refractory to conventional treatments and have a poor prognosis. Here, we report a new treatment strategy for EBV-associated T/NK-cell LPD, consisting of immunochemotherapy, intensive combination chemotherapy, and stem cell transplantation. The five patients studied, two with T-cell and three with NK-cell LPD, lacked a human leukocyte antigen-matched, related donor, and therefore received bone marrow grafts from HLA-matched, unrelated donors. The preconditioning regimen consisted of total-body irradiation (12 Gy), etoposide (900 mg/m(2)), and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) or melphalan (210 mg/m(2)). All patients had residual LPD by a quantitative PCR technique prior to transplantation. After unrelated bone marrow transplantation (UBMT), four of the five patients remain in continuous complete remission at a median of 19 months, without detectable EBV-DNA in peripheral blood. Thus, UBMT appears to be a reasonable option for the treatment of patients with EBV-associated T/NK-cell LPD. Detection of EBV-DNA by PCR offers an important tool for assessing minimal residual disease in patients with EBV-associated T/NK-cell LPD.","['Okamura, T', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Inoue, M', 'Honda, M', 'Yamashita, N', 'Wakiguchi, H', 'Yagita, M', 'Hosoi, G', 'Sako, M', 'Yasui, M', 'Yagi, K', 'Kawa, K']","['Okamura T', 'Kishimoto T', 'Inoue M', 'Honda M', 'Yamashita N', 'Wakiguchi H', 'Yagita M', 'Hosoi G', 'Sako M', 'Yasui M', 'Yagi K', 'Kawa K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical Center, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703796 [doi]', '1703796 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Jan;31(2):105-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703796.,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study if older patients perform poorly relative to younger adults following myeloablative allogeneic transplants, we compared the outcomes of consecutive adults aged >or=50 years (n=51) to those <50 years (n=262) who received BU, CY+/-etoposide and allogeneic transplantation for AML, CML, MDS and NHL from 1984 to 2000. Median ages were 53 (range 50-66) and 35 (range 18-49) years for older and younger patients, respectively. Patients were low-risk if they had AML in CR1, CML in first chronic phase, refractory anemia, or NHL in remission or sensitive relapse at the time of transplantation. All others were high-risk. In patients with low-risk disease, there was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between older and younger adults (P=0.64), while older patients tended to have a shorter OS among high-risk patients (P=0.06). The 3-year OS was 53% (95% CI, 29-77%) compared to 60% (95% CI, 50-69%) for older and younger patients with low-risk disease, respectively. The corresponding 3-year OS were 27% (95% CI, 11-43%) and 37% (95% CI, 25-45%) for high-risk patients. In low-risk patients, the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and treatment-related mortality were similar in older and younger patients, while older patients experienced more treatment-related deaths by day 100. On multivariable analysis, age >or=50 years was a significant adverse factor only when high-risk patients were considered. We conclude that when radiation-free conditioning is used, age >or=50 years is not a significant adverse risk factor for allogeneic BMT in patients with low-risk disease, and that such patients should not be excluded from conventional myeloablative approaches until the efficacy of nonmyeloablative transplantation is better established.","['Farag, S S', 'Elder, P J', 'Marcucci, G', 'Penza, S', 'Mrozek, E', 'Molina, A', 'Lin, T', 'Avalos, B R', 'Copelan, E']","['Farag SS', 'Elder PJ', 'Marcucci G', 'Penza S', 'Mrozek E', 'Molina A', 'Lin T', 'Avalos BR', 'Copelan E']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/mortality/*physiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703785 [doi]', '1703785 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Jan;31(2):87-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703785.,,,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: The effects of IL-13 and TNF-beta, on the production of IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-8, growth-regulated oncogene alpha (GROalpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), regulated on activation, T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and eotaxin were investigated. SETTING: Research laboratory at a medical university. PATIENT(S): Thirteen endometrial specimens in the late proliferative phase were used. INTERVENTION(S): The ESC were incubated for 24 hours with recombinant human IL-13 and recombinant human TNF-beta. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The concentration of IL-6, IL-11, LIF, IL-8, GROalpha, MCP-1, RANTES, and eotaxin in the culture media was measured using ELISA. RESULT(S): The increase in levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and eotaxin in the culture media of ESC paralleled the addition of increasing amounts of IL-13 and TNF-beta, whereas the levels of IL-11 and LIF were decreased with increasing amounts of IL-13, but were increased with increasing amounts of TNF-beta. Tumor necrosis factor-beta enhanced the production of GROalpha and RANTES in dose-dependent manner; however, IL-13 did not affect the expression of GROalpha or RANTES. CONCLUSION(S): These results suggest that IL-13 and TNF-beta secreted in the cyclic endometrial tissue and in the decidua may differentially regulate the production of IL-6 family cytokines and chemokines by ESC. The controlled expression of these cytokines in the endometrium may contribute to the modulation of the immune reaction during the menstrual cycle and in early pregnancy by the regulation of leukocyte trafficking and functions.","['Nasu, Kaei', 'Fukuda, Junichiro', 'Sun, Bing', 'Nishida, Masakazu', 'Miyakawa, Isao']","['Nasu K', 'Fukuda J', 'Sun B', 'Nishida M', 'Miyakawa I']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Oita Medical University, Oita, Japan. nasu@oita-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,IM,"['Adult', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Endometrium/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13/*pharmacology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0015028202048318 [pii]', '10.1016/s0015-0282(02)04831-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2003 Mar;79 Suppl 1:821-7. doi: 10.1016/s0015-0282(02)04831-8.,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunostaining of LIF was more intense in the glandular epithelium, whereas immunostaining of LIFR was most intense in the surface epithelium. Before and after the appearance of pinopodes, LIF and LIFR immunostaining was less intense or faint. Stromal endometrial cells showed faint LIF accumulation.

Validation of a therapeutic target identified by gene expression based classification.,173-83,"We recently found that MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemias (MLL) have a unique gene expression profile including high level expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3. We hypothesized that FLT3 might be a therapeutic target in MLL and found that 5 of 30 MLLs contain mutations in the activation loop of FLT3 that result in constitutive activation. Three are a newly described deletion of I836 and the others are D835 mutations. The recently described FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 proved cytotoxic to Ba/F3 cells dependent upon activated FLT3 containing either mutation. PKC412 is also differentially cytotoxic to leukemia cells with MLL translocations and FLT3 that is activated by either overexpression of the wild-type receptor or mutation. Finally, we developed a mouse model of MLL and used bioluminescent imaging to determine that PKC412 is active against MLL in vivo.","['Armstrong, Scott A', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Mabon, Meghann E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Stam, Ronald W', 'Den Boer, Monique L', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Kersey, John H', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Fletcher, Jonathan A', 'Golub, Todd R', 'Griffin, James D', 'Korsmeyer, Stanley J']","['Armstrong SA', 'Kung AL', 'Mabon ME', 'Silverman LB', 'Stam RW', 'Den Boer ML', 'Pieters R', 'Kersey JH', 'Sallan SE', 'Fletcher JA', 'Golub TR', 'Griffin JD', 'Korsmeyer SJ']","['Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/11/01 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1535610803000035 [pii]', '10.1016/s1535-6108(03)00003-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2003 Feb;3(2):173-83. doi: 10.1016/s1535-6108(03)00003-5.,,,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",,,,"['K08 CA 92551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of MDM2, the negative regulator of p53, was upregulated in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner in growth factor-independent BCR/ABL-expressing cells, and in accelerated phase and blast crisis CML samples. Increased MDM2 expression was associated with enhanced mdm2 mRNA translation, which required the interaction of the La antigen with mdm2 5' UTR. Expression of MDM2 correlated with that of La and was suppressed by La siRNAs and by a dominant negative La mutant, which also enhanced the susceptibility to drug-induced apoptosis of BCR/ABL-transformed cells. By contrast, La overexpression led to increased MDM2 levels and enhanced resistance to apoptosis. Thus, La-dependent activation of mdm2 translation might represent an important molecular mechanism involved in BCR/ABL leukemogenesis.","['Trotta, Rossana', 'Vignudelli, Tatiana', 'Candini, Olivia', 'Intine, Robert V', 'Pecorari, Luisa', 'Guerzoni, Clara', 'Santilli, Giorgia', 'Byrom, Mike W', 'Goldoni, Silvia', 'Ford, Lance P', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Maraia, Richard J', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Calabretta, Bruno']","['Trotta R', 'Vignudelli T', 'Candini O', 'Intine RV', 'Pecorari L', 'Guerzoni C', 'Santilli G', 'Byrom MW', 'Goldoni S', 'Ford LP', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Maraia RJ', 'Perrotti D', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autoantigens', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/pharmacology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/11/01 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1535610803000205 [pii]', '10.1016/s1535-6108(03)00020-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2003 Feb;3(2):145-60. doi: 10.1016/s1535-6108(03)00020-5.,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (SS-B antigen)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,"['T32 CA 09662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA 31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were cultured in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and in the four serum-free media X-vivo 10, X-vivo 15, X-vivo 20 and Stem Span. Native ALL blasts could proliferate in all four serum-free media, but the strongest responses were usually observed with Stem Span. Native leukemia blasts were also cultured in the presence of various single cytokines or cytokine combinations. The highest proliferation was usually observed in the presence of Flt3-Ligand (Flt3-L) when single cytokines were examined, and these responses could be further increased especially by combining Flt3-L with interleukin 3 (IL3), IL7 or stem cell factor (SCF). Proliferation could also be increased when ALL blasts were cultured in the presence of two commercially available fibroblast cell lines (Hs27 and HFL1). Based on these results we suggest that in vitro culture conditions for native human ALL blasts can be standardized by using serum-free culture media supplemented with exogenous Flt3-L+IL3+SCF, and the use of accessory cells can also be standardized by using well-characterized fibroblast cell lines. Detectable ALL blast proliferation can then be observed for most patients. Our experimental model can thereby be used for in vitro evaluation of possible antileukemic treatment strategies, and it will then allow comparison of experimental results between different studies.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Glenjen, Nils', 'Ryningen, Anita', 'Ulvestad, Elling']","['Bruserud O', 'Glenjen N', 'Ryningen A', 'Ulvestad E']","['Medical Department, Division of Hematology, Institute of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cell Line, Transformed/cytology/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602002278 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00227-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 May;27(5):455-64. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00227-8.,,,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported that a positive interaction between DNA methylation and histone deacetylation takes place to inhibit transcription. Based on this observation, our working hypothesis was that a combination of inhibitors of these processes should produce an enhancement of their antineoplastic activity on leukemic cells. The cytosine nucleoside analog, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AZA), is a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation, which can activate tumor suppressor genes in leukemic cells that have been silenced by aberrant methylation. In clinical trials, 5AZA was demonstrated to be an active antileukemic agent. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDI) can also activate gene expression in leukemic cell lines by producing changes in chromatin configuration, and show antineoplastic activity in preclinical studies. In this report, we investigated the in vitro antineoplastic activity of 5AZA, alone and in combination with the HDI, trichostatin A (TSA) and depsipeptide (FR901228, depsi), on the human myeloid leukemic cell lines, HL-60 and KG1a. The results showed that the combination of 5AZA with TSA or depsi produced a greater inhibition of growth and DNA synthesis and a greater loss of clonogenicity than either agent alone. These results suggest that 5AZA used in combination with HDI may be an interesting chemotherapeutic regimen to investigate in patients with acute myeloid leukemia that is resistant to conventional chemotherapy.","['Shaker, Sepideh', 'Bernstein, Mark', 'Momparler, Louise F', 'Momparler, Richard L']","['Shaker S', 'Bernstein M', 'Momparler LF', 'Momparler RL']","['Centre de Recherche Pediatrique, Hopital Sainte-Justine, 3175 Cote Ste-Catherine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Acute Disease', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Decitabine', '*Depsipeptides', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Peptides, Cyclic', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602002229 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00222-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 May;27(5):437-44. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00222-9.,,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results demonstrated that CsA (1 microg ml(-1)) was able to induce apoptosis in all cell lines: 18.31% (+/-4.46) for LBR-, 25.96% (+/-5.24) for LBR-V160 and 27.36% (+/-4.12) for LBR-D160, while PSC 833 (1 microg ml(-1)) only induced apoptosis 21.51% (+/-5.73) in LBR-V160 cell line. The expression of Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2, Bax and Bcl-x(L)) was analyzed by flow cytometry showing high expression of the three proteins which was not significantly modified after treatment with either PSC 833 or CsA on the sensitive as well as on the resistant cell lines. Single stranded conformation polymorphisms analysis of p53 (Trp53) gene in the cell lines showed no mutation in exons 5-8 of the tumor suppressor gene. We conclude that depending on the concentration used, PSC 833 and CsA may act either by modulating the mdr-3 gene (0.1 microg ml(-1)) or by direct impact on the cells through induction of apoptosis (1 microg ml(-1)), in the latter case through a mechanism that might act independent of the Bcl-2 family proteins.","['Lopes, Eloisi C', 'Garcia, Mariana', 'Benavides, Fernando', 'Shen, Jianjun', 'Conti, Claudio J', 'Alvarez, Elida', 'Hajos, Silvia E']","['Lopes EC', 'Garcia M', 'Benavides F', 'Shen J', 'Conti CJ', 'Alvarez E', 'Hajos SE']","['Department of Immunology, School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires (UBA) IDEHU-CONICET, Junin 956 4 piso, 1113, Buenos Aires, Argentina. meclopes@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, MDR', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genes, p53', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602002163 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00216-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 May;27(5):413-23. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00216-3.,,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9EI49ZU76O (multidrug resistance protein 3)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of patients previously belonging to this category are now classified as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In the FAB-classification, patients had been assigned to the RAEB-T category if they had either (1) a medullary blast count between 20 and 30% or (2) a peripheral blast count of at least 5%, or (3) Auer rods detectable, irrespective of the blast count. We analyzed these subtypes of RAEB-T in terms of hematological characteristics, karyotype anomalies, and prognosis. Patients with more than 20% medullary blasts and patients with at least 5% peripheral blasts as the sole defining parameter for RAEB-T had a median survival of 6 months, as compared to 11 months in patients with Auer rods as the sole defining parameter. The presence of Auer rods therefore does not convey a particularly bad prognosis and does not justify placing patients in a high-risk category of MDS or even classifying them as AML. This finding supports the elimination of Auer rods as a parameter for classification in the new WHO system. On the other hand, the reclassification into RAEB II (according to WHO proposals) of previous RAEB-T patients with a peripheral blast count of at least 5% is problematic, because this feature predicts a median survival not different from that of AML patients.","['Strupp, Corinna', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Germing, Ulrich']","['Strupp C', 'Gattermann N', 'Giagounidis A', 'Aul C', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Haas R', 'Germing U']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Moorenstreet 5, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany. c.strupp@web.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/blood/*classification/mortality/pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/ultrastructure', 'Karyotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*classification/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'World Health Organization']",2003/03/07 04:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/03/07 04:00'],"['2003/03/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602002205 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00220-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 May;27(5):397-404. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00220-5.,,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",,,['Leuk Res. 2003 Jul;27(7):567-9.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were found in the sputum of the patient. Although he was given combined antibiotic therapy, there was no reduction in the fever. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample was taken and Microsporidia sp. was found upon staining with Giemsa. The patient died due to sepsis and DIC just before receiving therapy for microsporidiasis.

The symptoms developed 17 months after treatment for acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML, M2 subtype according to the French-American-British [FAB] classification) involving a chromosome abnormality at t(8;21)(q22;q22). Upon diagnosis of tMDS, spectral karyotyping analysis detected a new chromosomal translocation at t(2;8)(p23;p11.2). In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis suggested a rearrangement in the monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ) gene, located in the 8p11 region of chromosome 8. However, no partner gene on 2p23 could be identified. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tMDS associated with a rearrangement of the MOZ gene. MOZ-linked fusion proteins such as MOZ-CBP (CREB binding protein), MOZ-TIF2 (transcriptional intermediary factor 2), and MOZ-p300 (adenoviral E1A-associated protein) are associated with AML chromosomal abnormalities at t(8;16)(p11;p13), inv(8)(p11q13), and t(8;22)(p11;q13), respectively, and are thought to account for leukemogenesis occurring through the aberrant regulation of histone acetylation. Through a similar mechanism, we believe that MOZ, fused to an unidentified partner gene at 2p23, may have caused an alteration in histone acetylation, resulting in the development of tMDS in this patient.","['Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Kakazu, Naoki', 'Hibi, Shigeyoshi', 'Morimoto, Akira', 'Fukushima, Yoko', 'Ijuin, Ikuko', 'Hada, Satoshi', 'Kitabayashi, Issei', 'Abe, Tatsuo', 'Imashuku, Shinsaku']","['Imamura T', 'Kakazu N', 'Hibi S', 'Morimoto A', 'Fukushima Y', 'Ijuin I', 'Hada S', 'Kitabayashi I', 'Abe T', 'Imashuku S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kaiji-cho, Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan. imamura@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/metabolism/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2003/03/06 04:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['2003/03/06 04:00'],"['2003/03/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10172 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 Apr;36(4):413-9. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10172.,,,"['EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also analyzed eight leukemia cell lines with erythroid phenotype, performing detailed molecular cytogenetic analyses, including spectral karyotyping (SKY) in all samples.

Within MLL, almost all rearrangements cluster in an 8.3-kb restricted region and fuse 5' portions of MLL to a variety of heterologous genes in various 11q23 translocations. AF9 is one of the most common fusion partners of MLL. It spans more than 100 kb, and two breakpoint cluster regions (BCRs) have been identified in a telomeric region of intron 4 (BCR1) and within introns 7 and 8 (BCR2). We investigated 11 children's bone marrow or peripheral blood samples (3 AML, 5 t-AML, 2 ALL, 1 ALL relapse) and two cell lines (THP-1 and Mono-Mac-6) with cytogenetically diagnosed translocations t(9;11). By use of an optimized multiplex nested long-range PCR assay, a breakpoint-spanning DNA fragment from each sample was amplified and directly sequenced. In four patients and two cell lines, the AF9 breakpoints were located within BCR1 and in two patients within BCR2, respectively.

Seven immunophenotypic MCL and seven immunophenotypic MZL aspirates were evaluated for a number of cytomorphologic features in direct smears. Features favoring MCL include a relatively monomorphic cellular population, prominent nuclear membrane contour irregularities, and mitotic figures. Conversely, a polymorphic cellular population suggested MZL. However, due to extensive overlap of specific cytologic features, the two lymphomas cannot be definitively distinguished based solely on cytomorphology. Although there are cytomorphologic attributes suggestive of either MCL or MZL, considerable overlap exists.

The majority of the studies have led to the conclusion that most patients want as much information as possible about their disease and treatment. These studies have been large survey studies, and most of the patients enrolled in them have been out-patients. Very little is known about the information needs of severely ill cancer patients being treated as in-patients-such as those with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). As part of a larger study dealing with AML patients' illness narratives, this work describes the information needs from the patients' perspective and their information-seeking behaviour. In-depth ethnographic interviews were conducted with each of 21 patients on two occasions: at the time of diagnosis and again 2-5 months later. Most patients did not recall much information from the time of diagnosis, except the diagnosis itself and the feelings it had aroused in them. All patients had basic medical knowledge about their disease. However, many patients-especially the elderly-expressed no need to receive further medical details about their disease. Avoiding information, in particular about the prognosis, was explained as a strategy to maintain hope. Most patients attached more importance to information about problems affecting their everyday life and how other persons had coped with their illness. They did not seek medical information on their own, although especially younger patients expressed the feeling that they ""ought"" to do this. There was a discrepancy between their expressed attitudes regarding the need for medical information in general and their actual information-seeking behaviour. Being informed and seeking information are discussed as society's expectations of today's cancer patient.","['Friis, Lone S', 'Elverdam, Beth', 'Schmidt, Kai G']","['Friis LS', 'Elverdam B', 'Schmidt KG']","['Institute of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark, Winslowparken 19, 2, 5000 Odense C, Denmark. lfriis@health.sdu.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Health Behavior', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Information Dissemination', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*psychology', 'Male', 'Mental Recall', 'Middle Aged', 'Nurse-Patient Relations', 'Patient Education as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', '*Patient Participation', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Qualitative Research', 'Social Perception']",2003/03/06 04:00,2003/06/13 05:00,['2003/03/06 04:00'],"['2003/03/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-002-0424-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2003 Mar;11(3):162-70. doi: 10.1007/s00520-002-0424-6.

However, it is not known why NK cells cannot lyse these MHC class-Ia-deficient tumor targets. Tumors must select additional routes of escape from NK cells. An attractive hypothesis is that the aberrant expression of nonclassical HLA class Ia molecules in tumors provides the required inhibitory signal to NK cells, rendering tumor cells resistant to NK lysis. To analyze the possible role of HLA-E molecules in providing tumor cells with an NK escape mechanism, we studied the cell surface expression of this HLA class Ib molecule in a variety of tumor cell lines with well-defined HLA class Ia alterations. Tests were done with the monoclonal antibody 3D12 recognizing cell surface HLA-E molecules. Our results indicate that HLA-E was mainly detected in leukemia-derived cell lines. In addition, HLA-E was detected in tumor cell lines of different origin. This expression was related with the availability of free beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. Expression was detected in tumor cell lines showing an imbalance in heavy chain/beta(2)m expression, particularly in tumor cell lines with alterations in the expression of heavy-chain genes. Several lines of evidence favor these conclusions: (1) In the FM55 and NW145 melanoma tumor systems, the reduction in HLA class Ia expression paralleled the increased cell surface detection of HLA-E. (2) A cervical tumor (808) and a melanoma cell line (R22.2) expressing a single HLA-A1 allele also expressed HLA-E. (3) The addition of human beta(2)m to tumor cell lines that expressed the HLA-E(G) allele increased HLA-E cell surface expression. (4) There was no HLA-E cell surface expression in tumor cell lines with total loss of HLA class Ia expression, including cell lines with low transcription of HLA class I heavy chains or with beta(2)m mutations. Our findings suggest that the biological consequences of these cumulative genetic and molecular changes in tumor cells lead to the appearance of HLA-E in a limited number of tumor cell lines with peculiar phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, namely: HLA-class Ia downregulation, free beta(2)m and HLA-E(G) genotype. The aberrant HLA-E expression might be of particular biological relevance in those HLA tumor phenotypes that express a single HLA-A allele when NK inhibition is markedly reduced due to the downregulation of HLA-B and -C alleles.","['Marin, Rosario', 'Ruiz-Cabello, Francisco', 'Pedrinaci, Susana', 'Mendez, Rosa', 'Jimenez, Pilar', 'Geraghty, Daniel E', 'Garrido, Federico']","['Marin R', 'Ruiz-Cabello F', 'Pedrinaci S', 'Mendez R', 'Jimenez P', 'Geraghty DE', 'Garrido F']","['Departmento de Analisis Clinicos, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Universidad de Granada, Avda. fuerzas Armadas no.2, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,IM,"['Alleles', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics']",2003/03/06 04:00,2003/04/29 05:00,['2003/03/06 04:00'],"['2002/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2002/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00251-002-0526-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunogenetics. 2003 Feb;54(11):767-75. doi: 10.1007/s00251-002-0526-9.

Paricalcitol has recently been reported to have anticancer activity in prostate cancer. In order to explore paricalcitol as a potential agent against leukemia, we tested its effects on HL-60 and U937 leukemia cell lines. METHODS: We studied cellular differentiation via expression of CD11b and CD14 surface antigens using flow cytometry, and via the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) assay. Cell cycle was analyzed using propidium iodide staining. Apoptosis was assessed with the annexin V assay. Cellular proliferation was determined via colony inhibition on semisolid medium. RESULTS: Paricalcitol induced the maturation of HL-60 and U937 cells, as shown by increased expression of CD11b differentiation surface antigen. CD14 showed increased expression in HL-60 but not in U937 cells. After exposure to paricalcitol at 10(-8) M for 72 h, the ability of HL-60 cells to reduce NBT was markedly increased. Conversely, U937 cells were unchanged. Paricalcitol inhibited colony formation of both HL-60 and U937 cell lines in semisolid medium after a 10-day incubation (estimated IC(50) of 3x10(-8) M in HL-60 cells and 4x10(-8) M in U937 cells). Paricalcitol at 10(-8) M and 10(-7) M caused a significant dose- and time-dependent increase of apoptosis in HL-60 cells ( P<0.05). In both HL-60 and U937 cells, exposure to 10(-7) M paricalcitol for 72 h increased the number of cells in G(0)/G(1) phase, and decreased the number of cells in S phase. CONCLUSIONS: Paricalcitol inhibits colony formation, induces maturation and causes cell cycle arrest in HL-60 and U937 cells. Additionally, paricalcitol induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells.

In conclusion, cell proliferation differs between leukaemia subgroups and increased proliferation is associated with increased in vitro sensitivity to several anticancer agents in initial ALL.","['Kaaijk, P', 'Kaspers, G J L', 'Van Wering, E R', 'Broekema, G J', 'Loonen, A H', 'Hahlen, K', 'Schmiegelow, K', 'Janka-Schaub, G E', 'Henze, G', 'Creutzig, U', 'Veerman, A J P']","['Kaaijk P', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Van Wering ER', 'Broekema GJ', 'Loonen AH', 'Hahlen K', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Henze G', 'Creutzig U', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

The national rail network, 1966-1987, was digitised and the numbers of cases in each ward were related to two measures of environmental exposure to railways: a proximity and a density function, contributions to these functions being weighted by the frequency of use and time in use of each stretch of railway. Poisson regression was used to derive rate ratios in relation to these measures of exposure to railways, both unadjusted and adjusted for population mixing. We found no association between risk of leukaemia and railway proximity (unadjusted rate ratio for trend from the lowest to the median value=1.006, 95% CI: 0.998 - 1.013, P=0.14) and a very small association with railway density, of marginal statistical significance (rate ratio for trend=1.001, 95% CI: 1.000 - 1.003, P=0.05). This effect depended on two deprived, urban wards with high railway density and high population mixing and became nonsignificant (P=0.09) after allowing for population mixing. The very weak association between railway density and risk of childhood leukaemia is likely to be a consequence of the association between population mixing and proximity to railways in very deprived, urban wards.","['Dickinson, H O', 'Hammal, D M', 'Dummer, T J B', 'Parker, L', 'Bithell, J F']","['Dickinson HO', 'Hammal DM', 'Dummer TJ', 'Parker L', 'Bithell JF']","[""North of England Children's Cancer Research Unit, Child Health, University of Newcastle, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Child', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', '*Railroads', 'Wales/epidemiology']",2003/03/06 04:00,2003/04/18 05:00,['2003/03/06 04:00'],"['2003/03/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600762 [doi]', '6600762 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2003 Mar 10;88(5):695-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600762.,,,,,,,,,,PMC2376356,,,,,,,,

One of these translocations, t(11;15)(q23;q14), occurs rarely in both ALL and AML. The gene on chromosome 15, AF15q14, was cloned recently in a patient with AML-M4. We have identified the same gene in a de novo T-ALL patient. However, both the MLL and AF15q14 breakpoints in these patients differed: in the previously reported AML-M4, both gene breaks were within exons, while in our ALL case the MLL break is intronic and the AF15q14 break is exonic. The MLL-AF15q14 fusion described previously shares no AF15q14 residues in common with the chimera reported here. The fusion proteins also differ with respect to MLL--the previously described fusion contains 55 extra amino acids as its MLL break is in exon 11, while the chimera we report breaks in intron 9. Contrary to the originally described normal AF15q14 (5925-bp cDNA encoding a 1833-aa protein), we identify a 7542-bp cDNA and a 2342-aa AF15q14 protein. AF15q14 appears identical to an mRNA previously found to be expressed in melanoma rendered nontumorigenic by microcell-mediated introduction of normal chromosome 6, suggesting the gene may function normally to suppress cell growth and/or enhance maturation.","['Kuefer, Martin U', 'Chinwalla, Vandana', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J', 'Behm, Frederick G', 'Naeve, Clayton W', 'Rakestraw, Karen M', 'Mukatira, Suraj T', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Morris, Stephan W']","['Kuefer MU', 'Chinwalla V', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ', 'Behm FG', 'Naeve CW', 'Rakestraw KM', 'Mukatira ST', 'Raimondi SC', 'Morris SW']","['Landratsamt Ostallgau, Abteilung Gesundheitswesen, Marktoberdorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/genetics', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Melanoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/03/06 04:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['2003/03/06 04:00'],"['2003/03/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206272 [doi]', '1206272 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Mar 6;22(9):1418-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206272.,,,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Knl1 protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF15q14 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",,,,"['CA21756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76301/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF173994'],,

Since the new sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist immunosuppressive drug FTY720 leads to trapping of T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues, we evaluated the possibility that this drug could diminish GvHD, a disease involving epithelial target tissues, while permitting a beneficial alloresponse to take place within the lymphohematopoietic system, leading to graft-versus-lymphoma effects. We demonstrate here that FTY720 markedly reduces GvHD in a clinically relevant, haploidentical strain combination, while permitting antitumor effects against a T cell lymphoma of unshared host MHC haplotype to proceed unhindered.

Some patients with persistent disease also have circulating PR1-specific T cells, however, suggesting the likelihood of immune tolerance. Here we show that both high- and low-avidity PR1-specific T cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors can be identified and selectively expanded in vitro. Although high-avidity PR1-specific T cells killed CML more effectively than low-avidity T cells, only high-avidity T cells underwent apoptosis when stimulated with high PR1 peptide concentration or when exposed to leukemia that overexpressed proteinase 3. No high-avidity PR1-specific T cells could be identified or expanded from newly diagnosed leukemia patients, whereas low-avidity T cells were readily expanded. Circulating high-avidity PR1-specific T cells were identified in IFN-sensitive patients in cytogenetic remission, however.

The clinical application of microarray data will require marker genes whose expression patterns are sufficiently well understood to allow accurate predictions on disease subclass membership. Commonly used methods of analysis include hierarchical clustering algorithms, t-, F-, and Z-tests, and machine learning approaches. We describe an approach called the maximum difference subset (MDSS) algorithm that combines classification algorithms, classical statistics, and elements of machine learning and provides a coherent framework. By integrating prediction accuracy, the MDSS algorithm learns the critical threshold of statistical significance (the alpha or P-value), eliminating the arbitrariness of setting a threshold of statistical significance and minimizing the effect of the normality assumptions. To reduce the false positive rate and to increase external validity of the predictive gene set, a jackknife step is used. This step identifies and removes genes in the initial MDSS with low combined predictive utility. The overall MDSS provides a prediction that is less dependent on an arbitrary study design (sample inclusion or exclusion) and should thus have high external validity. We demonstrate that this approach, unlike other published methods, identifies biomarkers capable of predicting the outcome of anthracycline-cytarabine chemotherapy in cases of acute myeloid leukemia. By incorporating two criteria-statistical significance and predictive utility-the approach learns the significance level relevant for a given data set. The MDSS approach can be used with any test and classifier operator pair.","['Lyons-Weiler, James', 'Patel, Satish', 'Bhattacharya, Soumyaroop']","['Lyons-Weiler J', 'Patel S', 'Bhattacharya S']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Lowell, Massachusetts 01854, USA. lyonsweilerj@msx.upmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Algorithms', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Classification/*methods', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/drug therapy/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Reference Standards', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/03/06 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/03/06 04:00'],"['2003/03/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gr.104003 [doi]'],ppublish,Genome Res. 2003 Mar;13(3):503-12. doi: 10.1101/gr.104003.,,,,,,,,,,PMC430281,,,,,,,,

Peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) expressed in monocytes/macrophages may have a role in cell differentiation. Since the expression of thrombomodulin (TM) by monocytes is upregulated during differentiation into macrophages, we investigated the effect of pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD) that is a synthetic ligand of PPARgamma, on the expression of TM by a human monocyte/macrophage cell line; human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells. Pioglitazone dose-dependently upregulated TM antigen expression by THP-1 cells accompanied by an upregulation of TM cofactor activity for thrombin-dependent protein C activation. Thrombomodulin mRNA expression in THP-1 cells was also upregulated by pioglitazone, whereas tissue factor (TF) mRNA expression was not induced at all. Treatment cells with a natural PPARgamma ligand, 15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin J(2) (PGJ2), also enhanced TM protein expression. PGF(2alpha) an agent known to inactivate PPARgamma, diminished the stimulatory effect of pioglitazone and PGJ2 on TM protein expression. In contrast, pioglitazone had no effect on TM antigen expression by human umbilical vein ECs. These results suggest that PPARgamma activation in macrophages may counteract potentially prothrombotic and putative inflammatory properties in activated macrophages.","['Kanehara, Hideo', 'Tohda, Gen', 'Oida, Koji', 'Suzuki, Jinya', 'Ishii, Hidemi', 'Miyamori, Isamu']","['Kanehara H', 'Tohda G', 'Oida K', 'Suzuki J', 'Ishii H', 'Miyamori I']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Pioglitazone', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', '*Thiazolidinediones', 'Thrombomodulin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2003/03/06 04:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/03/06 04:00'],"['2003/03/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0049384803000562 [pii]', '10.1016/s0049-3848(03)00056-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2002 Nov 25;108(4):227-34. doi: 10.1016/s0049-3848(03)00056-2.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'X4OV71U42S (Pioglitazone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is potentially curative, but treatment-related mortality and rate of disease recurrence are substantial. With the advent of the ABL-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (imatinib mesylate, Glivec), it has become apparent that the understanding of crucial leukaemogenic pathways at the molecular level can lead to the development of specific and selective agents. In recent clinical trials, imatinib has demonstrated significant anti-leukaemic efficacy in patients with advanced Ph(+) ALL, in conjunction with a remarkably favourable safety profile. Clinical resistance to imatinib develops rapidly, highlighting the limitations of using imatinib as a single agent; however, the value of imatinib as an element of treatment has become apparent. Resistance mechanisms have already been identified that will enable the development of rational strategies to prevent or overcome resistance. On the basis of available clinical results, combinations of imatinib with established anti-leukaemic agents, as well as with novel, molecularly targeted treatment modalities, will need to be evaluated in advanced Ph(+) ALL. Incorporation of imatinib in the first-line treatment of de novo Ph(+) ALL and in the setting of minimal residual disease is a promising therapeutic approach which is currently being studied in clinical trials. Better understanding of targeted therapies, including strategies based on recruitment of host immune functions, as well as the prudent use of active chemotherapy agents, may eventually improve the outlook for patients with Ph(+) ALL.","['Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Wassmann, Barbara']","['Ottmann OG', 'Wassmann B']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, D-60590, Frankfurt, Germany. ottmann@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Ways to improve patients' outcome, using high-dose therapy followed by autologous/allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in first complete remission (CR1) rather than consolidation/maintenance chemotherapy, have been investigated. However, prospective studies are small and results are inconclusive. The largest prospective trial ever being performed in adult ALL patients, the ongoing UKALL 12/ECOG 2993 trial, is assigning all patients who have a sibling donor to receive allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) in CR1, whereas all other patients are randomized to continue chemotherapy versus autologous SCT. An interim analysis of this trial seems to support an alloSCT in first CR in adult ALL patients (reflected by a significantly reduced relapse rate with an improved disease-free survival). However, less than 30% of the patients have a matched sibling donor, the majority of the patients are over 40 years old, which makes them less suitable for conventional allograft, and even in those who have a matched sibling donor and are young and fit enough to receive it the treatment-related mortality (TRM) is about 20%. Strategies for expanding donor availability, meanwhile, to reduce the TRM, remain challenges. Data regarding the efficacy of reduced-intensity regimens in ALL patients are still scanty. Another way of improving patient outcome is to select patients for allograft more carefully. There are enough data to suggest now that children who achieved a clinical remission but failed to obtain a molecular/immunological remission are more prone to relapse. Similar data have recently been published for adult ALL. However, data are still limited, and the significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) has never been studied prospectively in adult ALL patients. A reasonable approach is to assign all patients with a matched related donor who has failed to achieve a molecular/immunological remission to receive a conventional alloSCT, whereas all others might be randomized to receive alloSCT versus chemotherapy/autologousSCT.

Futhermore, it was demonstrated that level and course of MRD are significantly correlated with relapse risk in childhood and in adult ALL. In clinical practice MRD evaluation may serve for several purposes such as follow-up of individual course of disease, identification of new prognostic factors or evaluation of single treatment elements. We discuss these options as well as general considerations for MRD-based risk stratification and treatment options for risk groups. Practical applications are analysed because prospective MRD-based clinical trials have been recently started. Finally, future options for application of MRD evaluation and also limitations and pitfalls of this method are reviewed.","['Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Kneba, Michael', 'Raff, Thorsten', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Scheuring, Urban', 'Reutzel, Regina', 'Hoelzer, Dieter']","['Gokbuget N', 'Kneba M', 'Raff T', 'Bruggemann M', 'Scheuring U', 'Reutzel R', 'Hoelzer D']","['J.W.

Polymerase chain reaction-based (PCR-based) detection of MRD by immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements can be applied in more than 90-95% of cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Accordingly, several retrospective studies of MRD in childhood ALL have used one of the different PCR approaches for the detection of antigen-receptor gene rearrangements. The promising results on the predictivity of MRD evaluation at the end of induction treatment has raised the need of a new definition of remission. Until now, most PCR-based MRD studies have used semiquantitative methods for the detection of Ig and TCR gene rearrangements. The introduction of real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) has resulted in the improvement of sensitivity and specificity and has given better quality control of the MRD data. There is an urgent need to incorporate MRD data in clinical studies, properly designed to address treatment questions. In this context several ongoing co-operative study groups have adopted an MRD-based risk group classification to explore whether a better tailored treatment would result in further improvement in cure rates for children with ALL.","['Cazzaniga, Giovanni', ""d'Aniello, Elisabetta"", 'Corral, Lilia', 'Biondi, Andrea']","['Cazzaniga G', ""d'Aniello E"", 'Corral L', 'Biondi A']","['Centro Ricerca M.

Diagnosis relies on traditional cytomorphological and immunohistochemical evaluation of the leukaemic blasts.

The major chromosomal abnormalities in ALL are t(9;22)(q34;q11), t(12;21)(p13;q22), t(4;11)(q21;q23), t(1;19)(q23;p13), 8q24 translocations and hyperdiploidy. Generally, hyperdiploidy, occurring most frequently in paediatric cases, is associated with a good prognosis, while hypodiploidy confers a poor prognosis. Among structural chromosomal abnormalities, the t(9;22)(q34;q11) resulting in the BCR/ABL fusion protein, and rearrangements of the MLL gene, confer a poor prognosis in both children and adults, while t(12;21)(p13;q22), resulting in the TEL/AML1 fusion protein, and del (12p) confer a good prognosis.

Opioid agonists vary in their potency and pharmacokinetic properties as well as in their affinity for distinct opioid receptors. The fentanyl opiate analogues are an important group of analgesics that interact with the mu opioid receptor. Remifentanil (GI87084) is a particularly interesting member of this group of opioids because its action is especially short in duration. This report examines the genetic toxicology of remifentanil. Remifentanil was not genotoxic in an Ames test, an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, an in vivo micronucleus assay in rat erythrocytes, or an in vivo/in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rat hepatocytes. In the in vitro L5178Y tk(+/-) mouse lymphoma assay, remifentanil produced a genotoxic response at dose levels >or=308 microg/mL only in the presence of rat liver S9 metabolic activation; primarily tiny and small mutant colonies were produced. This pattern of activity in a battery of genetic toxicology assays is not unique to remifentanil, but has also been observed for other pharmaceuticals, including the opioid fentanyl. A weight-of-evidence analysis, taking into consideration genotoxic mechanisms, in vivo results, and the conditions of clinical use, suggests remifentanil does not pose a genotoxic risk to patients.","['Allen, Jane S', 'Campbell, James A', 'Cariello, Neal F', 'Kutz, Stephen A', 'Thilagar, Arul', 'Xu, Jing', 'Ham, Andrea L', 'Mitchell, Ann D']","['Allen JS', 'Campbell JA', 'Cariello NF', 'Kutz SA', 'Thilagar A', 'Xu J', 'Ham AL', 'Mitchell AD']","['GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA. lmw2024@gsk.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Teratog Carcinog Mutagen,"Teratogenesis, carcinogenesis, and mutagenesis",8100917,IM,"['Analgesics, Opioid/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Chromosome Aberrations/chemically induced', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/genetics', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hepatocytes/drug effects', 'Leukemia L5178/genetics/metabolism', 'Liver Extracts/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Micronucleus Tests/methods', 'Mutagenicity Tests/methods', 'Piperidines/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Remifentanil', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tcm.10069 [doi]'],ppublish,Teratog Carcinog Mutagen. 2003;Suppl 1:137-49. doi: 10.1002/tcm.10069.,,,"['0 (Analgesics, Opioid)', '0 (Liver Extracts)', '0 (Piperidines)', 'P10582JYYK (Remifentanil)']",,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of Pd(C(7)H(16)N(2)O(2))Cl(2) to retard X-ray induced DNA migration was more pronounced than its platinum analogue and CDDP (see Fig. 6).

In long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents, the level of dietary fat is altered by using oil as a vehicle to administer unpalatable or volatile chemicals. Control male rats receiving a corn oil vehicle have a higher incidence of pancreatic proliferative lesions and a lower incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia than untreated control males. Therefore, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) designed studies to evaluate the role of several oils in altering cancer rates in male rats. The NTP study reported here was part of a larger program that included cooperative agreements with Dartmouth Medical School, Northwestern Medical School, and the University of Missouri. The program was designed to study the mechanisms by which corn oil induces pancreatic cancer. To evaluate corn oil as well as two other gavage vehicles for potential toxicity, corn oil, safflower oil, and tricaprylin were administered by gavage to male F344/N rats for 2 years. The rats that received corn oil were also made available to the university investigators for study of the corn oil-induced pancreatic lesions. Each vehicle was administered by gavage at volumes of 2.5, 5, or 10 mL/kg body weight once daily for 5 days per week. In the corn oil study, a control of 10 mL saline/kg was also included. To evaluate the potential role of corn oil in promoting a pancreatic proliferative effect, 500 mg dichloromethane/kg body weight was administered in 2.5, 5, or 10 mL corn oil/kg body weight for 2 years to male F344/N rats. Dichloromethane was chosen because the chemical appeared to cause pancreatic proliferative lesions when administered by gavage in a corn oil vehicle but not when the exposure was by inhalation. In each of these studies, the term ""dose"" refers to the volume of gavage vehicle administered. 2-YEAR STUDIES OF CORN OIL, SAFFLOWER OIL, AND TRICAPRYLIN: Survival and Body Weights: Two-year survival was increased in male rats receiving corn oil (untreated control, 26/50; saline control, 32/50; 2.5 mL/kg, 33/50; 5 mL/kg, 38/50; 10 mL/kg, 40/50) primarily due to a dose-related decreased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia. The mean body weights of all dosed groups were at least 5% higher than those of the untreated and saline controls by week 48, but the mean body weights of groups receiving 2.5 or 5 mL corn oil/kg decreased during the final weeks of the study (after week 89) and were similar to those of the controls at the end of the study. Two-year survival was slightly increased in male rats receiving safflower oil relative to that of the controls (untreated control, 30/50; 2.5 mL/kg, 33/50; 5 mL/kg, 40/50; 10 mL/kg, 36/50). The mean body weight of male rats receiving 10 mL safflower oil/kg was at least 5% greater than that of the controls after week 45 and was 16% greater by the end of the study. Two-year survival of high-dose tricaprylin males was lower than that of the controls (untreated control, 31/50; 2.5 mL/kg, 30/50; 5 mL/kg, 31/50; 10 mL/kg, 23/53) due to moribund kills and deaths that appeared to be related to toxicity. The mean body weight of the high-dose group was lower than that of the controls throughout the study, although the difference was less than 5% after week 61. Pathology Findings: In the corn oil study, there were significant dose-related increased incidences of pancreatic exocrine hyperplasia and adenoma (hyperplasia: 8/50, 28/47, 28/50, 35/50; adenoma: 1/50, 8/47, 10/50, 23/50; carcinoma: 0/50, 0/47, 1/50, 0/50 in the untreated control, 2.5, 5, and 10 mL/kg groups, respectively). The incidence and severity of nephropathy decreased with dose (incidence [mean severity grade]: 47/50 [2.1], 43/48 [1.8], 45/50 [1.4], 40/49 [1.2]). The incidences of pheochromocytomas (benign, malignant, or complex) of the adrenal medulla were also decreased in dosed rats (23/49, 21/50, 5/50, 9/50). The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was significantly decreased in rats dosed with corn oil (27/50, 16/50, 11h corn oil (27/50, 16/50, 11/50, 7/50). In rats receiving safflower oil, the incidences of pancreatic exocrine hyperplasia and adenoma increased significantly with dose (hyperplasia: 8/50, 14/50, 29/49, 30/50; adenoma: 1/50, 7/50,15/49, 28/50; carcinoma: 0/50, 0/50, 0/49, 1/50 in the untreated control, 2.5, 5, and 10 mL/kg groups, respectively). There was a decrease in the severity, but not in the incidence, of nephropathy, a common lesion in aging F344/N rats (incidence [mean severity grade]: 49/50 [2.0], 50/50 [1.8], 47/50 [1.1], 49/49 [1.1]). There were decreased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia (33/50, 19/50, 18/50, 7/51). In the tricaprylin study, there were significant dose-related increased incidences of pancreatic exocrine hyperplasia and adenoma (hyperplasia: 8/49, 9/49, 18/49, 28/50; adenoma: 2/49, 6/49,13/49,18/50 in the untreated control, 2.5, 5, and 10 mL/kg groups, respectively). The incidence of proliferative lesions of the forestomach increased significantly with dose (basal cell hyperplasia: 4/50, 7/50, 12/49, 21/52; squamous cell papilloma: 0/50, 0/50, 3/50, 10/53). The incidence of nephropathy was significantly decreased in high-dose rats, and the severity of nephropathy decreased with dose (incidence [mean severity grade]: 46/50 [2.0], 42/50 [1.5], 45/50 [1.7], 27/49 [0.9]). In high-dose rats, the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was decreased (23/50, 28/50, 22/50, 9/53). 2-YEAR STUDY OF DICHLOROMETHANE IN CORN OIL: Survival and Body Weights: Two-year survival increased slightly with dose in the three groups receiving 500 mg dichloromethane/kg in 2.5, 5, or 10 mL corn oil/kg (23/50, 28/50, 31/50) due to a dose-related decrease in the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia. The rats receiving 500 mg dichloromethane/kg without corn oil were sacrificed within the first 3 weeks of the study due to the severe toxicity of dichloromethane. The final mean body weight of the high-dose rats was greater than the final mean body weights of groups receiving dichloromethane in 2.5 or 5 mL corn oil/kg. Pathology Findings: There was a dose-related increase in the incidence of pancreatic proliferative exocrine lesions in rats receiving dichloromethane in 2.5, 5, and 10 mL corn oil/kg (hyperplasia: 28/50, 38/50, 44/50; adenoma: 9/50,19/50, 41/50; carcinoma: 0/50,1/50, 3/50). The incidences of pancreatic exocrine hyperplasia and adenoma in rats receiving dichloromethane in 5 or 10 mL, but not 2.5 mL, corn oil were increased compared to the incidences in rats receiving comparable volumes of corn oil alone (hyperplasia: 2.5 mL, 28/47; 5 mL, 28/50;10 mL, 35/50; adenoma: 8/47,10/50, 23/50; carcinoma: 0/47,1/50, 0/50). There were significantly increased incidences of pituitary gland pars distalis adenoma in rats receiving dichloromethane in corn oil (20/50, 18/49, 16/49) when compared to those in rats receiving comparable volumes of corn oil alone (10/50, 6/49, 7/50). The incidence of mammary gland adenoma and fibroadenoma (combined) was significantly increased in rats receiving dichloromethane in 10 mL corn oil/kg (7/50) when compared to rats receiving dichloromethane in 2.5 mL corn oil/kg (1/50), but was not significantly increased when compared to the group receiving 10 mL of corn oil alone (3/50). The incidences of mammary gland adenoma and fibroadenoma (combined) were 7/50 for the untreated safflower oil controls and 6/50 for the untreated tricaprylin controls. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia decreased in the group receiving dichloromethane in 10 mL corn oil/kg (13/50,14/50, 5/50). GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Neither safflower oil nor corn oil was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535, with or without S9. Tricaprylin, in contrast, was mutagenic in strain TA1535 with, but not without, S9. Tricaprylin did not induce mutations in strains TA97, TA98, or TA100, with or without S9. SUMMARY: These studies were designed to evaluate the effects of various concentrations of an oil very high in polyunsaturated fat (safflower oil), an oil containing high levels of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats (corn oil), and an oil containing saturated medium-chain fatty acids (tricaprylin) on the incidence and pattern of neoplasms in the F344/N rat. In addition, safflower oil and tricaprylin were evaluated as replacements for the corn oil vehicle. These studies demonstrate that safflower oil and tricaprylin do not offer significant advantages over corn oil as a gavage vehicle in long-term rodent studies. Corn oil, safflower oil, and tricaprylin each caused hyperplasia and adenoma of the exocrine pancreas, decreased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia, and reduced incidences or severity of nephropathy in male F344/N rats. There was an increased incidence of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach in F344/N rats receiving 10 mL tricaprylin/kg. Further, the use of corn oil as a gavage vehicle may have a confounding effect on the interpretation of chemical-induced proliferative lesions of the exocrine pancreas and mononuclear cell leukemia in male F344/N rats.

The chronic dermal toxicity of diethylphthalate was evaluated in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice in 2-year studies. In a series of special studies, the tumor initiation or promotion potential of diethylphthalate or dimethylphthalate was evaluated in male Swiss (CD-1(R)) mice by an initiation/promotion model of skin carcinogenesis. The genetic toxicity of diethylphthalate and dimethylphthalate in Salmonella typhimurium and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells was also evaluated. 4-WEEK STUDY IN F344/N RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were dermally administered diethylphthalate at volumes of 0, 37.5, 75, 150, or 300 &mgr;L (0, 46, 92, 184, or 369 &mgr;g) applied neat, 5 days per week for 4 weeks. All male and female rats survived to the end of the study. No evidence of dermatotoxicity was observed, with no adverse clinical signs observed and no effects on weight gain or feed consumption. Relative liver weights of 300 &mgr;L males and females and 150 &mgr;L females were greater than those of controls. Relative kidney weights of 150 and 300 &mgr;L males and 150 &mgr;L females were greater than those of controls. No other adverse effects were observed in this study. 4-WEEK STUDY IN B6C3F1 MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were dermally administered diethylphthalate at volumes of 0, 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 &mgr;L (0, 15, 31, 62, or 123 &mgr;) applied neat, five days per week for 4 weeks. One control female died before the end of the study; all other mice survived. No evidence of dermatotoxicity or other adverse clinical signs were observed, and no clear adverse effects on weight gain or feed consumption were seen. Absolute and relative liver weights of 25 and 100 &mgr;L females were greater than those of the controls. Based on these 4-week study results, doses of 0, 35, and 100 &mgr;L diethylphthalate were recommended for the 2-year mouse studies. A chronic study in male and female B6C3F1 mice at 0, 35, and 100 &mgr;L (applied neat, once per day, 5 days per week) was started and subsequently stopped after 32 weeks when significant body weight reductions were noted in treated animals (males and females, 100 &mgr;L groups: 19% lower; males, 35 &mgr;L group: 12% lower; females, 35 &mgr;L group: 10% lower than controls). Based on these body weight reductions, doses of 0, 7.5, 15, and 30 &mgr;L in 100 &mgr;L acetone were recommended for the restart of the 2-year mouse study. 2-YEAR STUDY IN F344/N RATS: Based upon the results of the 4-week study, doses of 0, 100, or 300 &mgr;L diethylphthalate (0, 123, or 369 &mgr;) were chosen for the 2-year rat study. Groups of 60 male and 60 female rats received the doses applied neat 5 days per week for 103 weeks and up to 10 animals per group were evaluated after 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: Survival of dosed rats during the first 15 months was similar to that of controls. However, 2-year survival was significantly reduced in all groups of male rats (survival probabilities, males: 0 &mgr;L, 8%; 100 &mgr;L, 12%; and 300 &mgr;L, 12%). The mean body weights of 300 &mgr;L males were slightly less than those of the controls throughout the study. No adverse clinical signs were observed, including no evidence of dermatotoxicity. Pathology Findings: No morphological evidence of dermal or systemic toxicity was observed in male or female rats. Skin neoplasms were not observed in female rats and were only rarely observed in male rats. A high incidence of anterior pituitary adenoma occurred in all groups of male and female rats. The incidence of anterior pituitary adenomas in the 0, 100, and 300 &mgr;L groups were: males, 39/44, 41/49, 41/49; females, 38/50, 33/49, 33/48. The incidence of this benign tumor in control males (84%) exceeded the historical control mean incidence [feed controls, (28.7%)] and range (12% to 60%). Anterior pituitary adenomas were considered a primary contributing factor in the increased mortality observed in all grtor in the increased mortality observed in all groups, regardless of treatment. A dose-related decreasing trend in the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was observed in female rats (21/50, 12/48, 7/50). The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in male rats in this study was lower than the historical incidence and may be attributable to the shortened life span of male rats. Similarly, the incidence of interstitial cell tumors of the testes was markedly decreased in all groups of males (4/50, 3/50, 8/50), relative to historical control rates (90.1&percnt;; range 74&percnt;-98&percnt;). The incidence of fatty liver degeneration was notably lower in dosed rats than in controls (males: 26/50, 8/50, 4/51; females: 23/50, 11/50, 3/50). 2-YEAR STUDY IN B6C3F1 MICE: Groups of 60 male and 60 female mice received doses of 0, 7.5, 15, or 30 &mu;L diethylphthalate (0, 9, 18, or 37 &mu;) in 100 &mu;L acetone 5 days per week for 103 weeks with a 1 week recovery period, and up to 10 animals per group were evaluated after 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: Two-year survival of dosed mice was similar to that of controls: 43/50, 41/48, 46/50, and 43/50 (males), and 41/50, 38/51, 37/49, and 36/49 (females). Mean body weights of dosed male and female mice were similar to those of the controls throughout the study. No adverse clinical signs were observed in mice, including no gross evidence of dermatotoxicity. Feed consumption by male and female mice was similar to or up to 13% greater than that by controls. Pathology Findings: No morphological evidence of dermal toxicity was observed in male or female mice. No skin neoplasms were observed in dosed male mice. In female mice receiving 30 &mu;L, one squamous cell carcinoma and one basal cell carcinoma were seen at the site of application. An increased incidence of liver neoplasms was observed in dosed male and female mice. The incidence of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in B6C3F1 mice in the 0, 7.5, 15, and 30 &mu;L groups were: (males) 9/50, 14/50, 14/50, and 18/50; (females) 7/50, 16/51, 19/50, and 12/50. The incidence of adenoma or carcinoma (combined) was increased in 30 &mu;L male mice and the incidences of adenoma and of adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were increased in 7.5 and 15 &mu;L females. A positive dose-related trend in the incidence of adenoma or carcinoma (combined) was also observed in male mice. The incidence of basophilic hepatic foci was increased in 15 &mu;L male mice (0/50, 1/50, 9/50, 3/50). The increased incidence of liver neoplasms in this study was considered equivocal because the incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms in control and dosed males was within the historical range and because there was no clear dose-response relationship in females. No other treatment-related findings were observed in this study. 1-YEAR INITIATION/PROMOTION STUDY IN MALE SWISS (CD-1&reg;) MICE: Groups of 50 male mice were dosed dermally with diethylphthalate or dimethylphthalate to study their effect as initiators and promoters. Diethylphthalate and dimethylphthalate were tested as initiators with and without the known skin tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Diethyl phthalate and dimethylphthalate were tested as promoters with and without the known skin tumor initiator 7,12-dimethylbenzanthrancene (DMBA). Comparative control groups used during the study of diethylphthalate and dimethylphthalate included: vehicle control (acetone/acetone); initiation/promotion control (DMBA/TPA); initiator control (DMBA/acetone); and promoter control (acetone/TPA). Based on the incidence of skin neoplasms diagnosed histologically and the multiplicity of skin neoplasms, there was no suggestion that either diethylphthalate or dimethylphthalate was able to initiate skin carcinogenesis when chronically promoted by TPA. Further, there was no evidence that either diethylphthalate or dimethylphthalate was able to promote skin carcinogenesis in skin previously initiated with DMBA. High incidences of both squamous cell papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas occurred among the initiation/promotion control animals initiated with DMBA and promoted with TPA. All TPA-dosed groups had significantly greater incidences of dermal acanthosis, ulceration, exudation, and hyperkeratosis than controls. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Neither diethylphthalate (10-10,000 &mu;/plate) nor dimethylphthalate (33-6,666 &mu;/plate) induced gene mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537, with or without rat and hamster liver S9. In cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, both diethylphthalate and dimethylphthalate induced sister chromatid exchanges in the presence of S9. Neither induced sister chromatid exchanges in the absence of S9. Neither chemical induced chromosomal aberrations, with or without S9, in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year dermal studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of diethylphthalate in male or female F344/N rats receiving 100 or 300 &mu;L. The sensitivity of the male rat study was reduced due to low survival in all groups. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of diethylphthalate in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms, primarily adenomas. In an initiation/promotion model of skin carcinogenesis, there was no evidence of initiating activity of diethylphthalate or dimethylphthalate in male Swiss (CD-1&reg;) mice. Further, there was no evidence of promotion activity of diethylphthalate or dimethylphthalate in male Swiss (CD-1&reg;) mice. The promoting activity of TPA following DMBA initiation was confirmed in these studies. Minor dermal acanthosis was observed following dermal application of diethylphthalate in male and female F344/N rats dosed for 2 years and in male Swiss (CD-1&reg;) mice dosed for 1 year.

Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering barium chloride dihydrate (99% pure) in drinking water to F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice for 15 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse lymphoma cells. 15-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five males and five females received barium chloride dihydrate in the drinking water at concentrations of 0, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 ppm for 15 days, corresponding to average daily doses of 10, 15, 35, 60, or 110 mg barium/kg body weight to males and females. No chemical-related deaths, differences in final mean body weights, or clinical findings of toxicity were observed. Water consumption by male and female rats exposed to 2,000 ppm was slightly less (S16%) than controls during week 2. There were no significant differences in absolute or relative organ weights between exposed and control rats. No biologically significant differences in hematology, clinical chemistry, or neurobehavioral parameters occurred in rats. 15-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five males and five females received barium chloride dihydrate in the drinking water at concentrations of 0, 40, 80,173, 346, or 692 ppm for 15 days, corresponding to average daily doses of 5,10, 20, 40, or 70 mg barium/kg body weight to males and 5, 10, 15, 40, or 85 mg barium/kg body weight to females. No chemical-related deaths, differences in mean body weights or in water consumption, or clinical findings of toxicity were observed in mice. The relative liver weight of males receiving 692 ppm was significantly greater than that of the controls. The absolute and relative liver weights of females that received 692 ppm were significantly greater than those of the controls. No histopathologic evidence of toxicity was observed in mice. 13-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 males and 10 females received barium chloride dihydrate in the drinking water at concentrations of 0, 125, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm for 13 weeks, corresponding to average daily doses of 10, 30, 65, 110, or 200 mg barium/kg body weight to males and 10, 35, 65, 115, or 180 mg barium/kg body weight to females. Three males and one female in the 4,000 ppm groups died during the last week of the study. The final mean body weights of male and female rats receiving 4,000 ppm were significantly lower (13% and 8%) than those of the controls. Water consumption by male and female rats in the 4,000 ppm groups was approximately 30% lower than that by the controls. No clearly chemical-related clinical findings of toxicity or neurobehavioral or cardiovascular effects were noted. Serum phosphorus levels in 2,000 and 4,000 ppm male and female rats were significantly higher than those in controls, but there were no biologically significant differences in hematology parameters or in serum sodium, potassium, or calcium levels. Renal tubule dilatation in the outer stripe of the outer medulla and cortex occurred in male and female rats receiving 4,000 ppm. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 males and 10 females received barium chloride dihydrate in the drinking water at concentrations of 0, 125, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm for 13 weeks, corresponding to average daily doses of 15, 55, 100, 205, or 450 mg barium/kg body weight to males and 15, 60, 110, 200, or 495 mg barium/kg body weight to females. Six males and seven females that received 4,000 ppm and one male that received 125 ppm died during the study. Final mean body weights of male and female mice receiving 4,000 ppm were significantly lower (>30%) than those of controls. Water consumption by male mice in the 4,000 ppm group was 18% lower than that by the controls; water consumption by other exposed groups of male and female mice was similar to thatd groups of male and female mice was similar to that by the controls. Clinical findings of toxicity were limited to debilitation in the surviving male and female mice receiving 4,000 ppm. The absolute and/or relative liver weights of mice receiving 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 ppm were significantly lower than those of the controls. Multifocal to diffuse nephropathy characterized by tubule dilatation, regeneration, and atrophy occurred in 4,000 ppm male and female mice. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 60 males and 60 females received barium chloride dihydrate in the drinking water at concentrations of 0, 500, 1,250, or 2,500 ppm for 104 (males) or 105 weeks (females), corresponding to average daily doses of 15, 30, or 60 mg barium/kg body weight for males and 15, 45, or 75 mg barium/kg body weight for females. The high dose of 2,500 ppm was selected based on decreased final mean body weights, mortality, decreased water consumption, and chemical-related kidney lesions observed in the 4,000 ppm groups in the 13-week study. Survival, Body Weights, Water Consumption, and Clinical Findings: Two-year survival of exposed male and female rats was similar to that of the controls. The final mean body weights of male and female rats that received 2,500 ppm were (5&percnt; and 11&percnt;) lower than those of controls. Beginning as early as week 5, water consumption by male and female rats receiving 2,500 ppm was substantially lower than that by controls (male: 11&percnt; to 30&percnt;; female: 19&percnt; to 33&percnt;). There were no chemical-related clinical findings. Hematology and Clinical Chemistry: There were no chemical-related differences in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters in male or female rats. Special Studies: At the 15-month interim evaluation, the plasma barium concentrations (mg/ml) were significantly increased in males receiving 1,250 and 2,500 ppm and in all exposed groups of females (male: 0 ppm, 0.98; 500 ppm, 1.00; 1,250 ppm, 1.23; 2,500 ppm, 1.68; female: 0 ppm, 0.74; 500 ppm, 0.99; 1,250 ppm, 0.97; 2,500 ppm, 1.43). Barium levels in bone in rats from the 2,500 ppm groups were about 400 times greater than those in the controls. Pathology Findings: At the end of 2 years, there were no increased incidences of neoplasms or nonneoplastic lesions that could be attributed to barium chloride dihydrate. However, there were dose-related decreased incidences of adrenal medulla pheochromocytomas and mononuclear cell leukemia in male rats. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 males and 60 females received barium chloride dihydrate in the drinking water at concentrations of 0, 500, 1,250, or 2,500 ppm for 103 (males) or 104 weeks (females), corresponding to average daily doses of 30, 75, or 160 mg barium/kg body weight for males and 40, 90, or 200 mg barium/kg body weight for females. The high dose of 2,500 ppm was selected based on decreased final mean body weights, mortality, decreased water consumption, and chemical-related kidney lesions observed in the 4,000 ppm groups in the 13-week study. Survival, Body Weights, Water Consumption, and Clinical Findings: Two-year survival of male and female mice receiving 2,500 ppm was significantly lower than that of the controls due to renal toxicity. Final mean body weights of 2,500 ppm males and females were 9% and 12% lower than those of controls. Water consumption by male and female mice receiving barium chloride was similar to that by the controls. There were no chemical-related clinical findings. Hematology and Clinical Chemistry: There were no differences in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters measured at the 15-month interim evaluation. Special Studies: At the 15-month interim evaluation, plasma barium concentrations (mg/mL) were significantly increased in all exposed groups of mice (male: 0 ppm, 0.62; 500 ppm, 0.77; 1,250 ppm, 0.89; 2,500 ppm, 1.49; female: 0 ppm, 0.52; 500 ppm, 0.74; 1,250 ppm, 1.01; 2,500 ppm, 1.35). Pathology Findings: At the end of the 2-year study, there were increased incidences of nephropathy in male and female mice (male: 1/50, 0/50, 2/48, 19/50; female: 0/50, 2/53, 1/50, 37/54). There were no chemical-related increased incidences of neoplasms in male or female mice. The incidence of hepatocellular adenoma was significantly decreased in male mice receiving 2,500 ppm. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Barium chloride dihydrate was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537, with or without exogenous metabolic activation (S9). It was mutagenic in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells in the presence of S9, but it did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year drinking water studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of barium chloride dihydrate in male or female F344/N rats that received 500, 1,250, or 2,500 ppm. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of barium chloride dihydrate in male or female B6C3F1 mice that received 500, 1,250, or 2,500 ppm.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering o-nitroanisole (>99% pure) in the diet to groups of male and female F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice for 14 days, 13 weeks, and 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse lymphoma cells. 14-DAY STUDIES: Groups of five male and five female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 583, 1,166, 2,332, 4,665, or 9,330 ppm o-nitroanisole. Mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of males in the 4,665 and 9,330 ppm groups were lower than those of the controls. Absolute liver weights were significantly increased in males receiving 1,166 ppm or more and in females receiving 583 ppm or more. Groups of five male and five female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Mean body weight gains and final mean body weights of males that received 250 ppm and females that received 4,000 ppm were significantly lower than those of the controls. No other chemical-associated effects were observed. 13-WEEK STUDIES: Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 200, 600, 2,000, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Final mean body weights and feed consumption by male and female rats receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values were significantly lower and methemoglobin levels significantly higher in males in the 6,000 and 18,000 ppm groups than in controls. Absolute liver weights were significantly increased in females that received 200, 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm, absolute kidney weights were significantly increased in males that received 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm, and absolute spleen weights were significantly increased in males and females that received 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 60, 200, 600, 2,000, or 6,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Final mean body weight gains, final mean body weights, and feed consumption by male and female mice receiving 6,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values in males and females that received 2,000 or 6,000 ppm were significantly lower than those in the controls. The absolute and relative liver weights of females in the 600 ppm group and relative liver weights of males and females in the 2,000 and 6,000 ppm groups were significantly greater than those of controls. Lesions associated with exposure to o-nitroanisole were present in the urinary bladder, spleen, kidney, liver, testis, and uterus of rats. Diffuse hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder occurred in all male and female rats that received 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. A transitional cell papilloma occurred in one male and transitional cell carcinomas occurred in two males and three females receiving 18,000 ppm. Congestion of the red pulp and capsular hyperplasia of the spleen and hepatocellular hypertrophy of the liver were present in males and females from the 18,000 ppm groups. Multifocal degeneration and necrosis of the renal tubule epithelium with infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells were present in male rats that received 600, 2,000, and 6,000 ppm. At the 18,000 ppm level, degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium accompanied by loss of spermatogenic cells and decreased numbers of spermatozoa were observed in the testes of male rats, while uterine atrophy was observed in female rats. Hepatocyte hypertrophy of the centrilobular and midzonal regions of liver lobules was present in mice that received 200 ppm and increased in severity at higher exposure levels. 2-YEAR STUDIES: The doses selected for the 2-year study of o-nitroanisole in rats were based on lower mean body weights, reduced feed consumption, and increased severity of regenerative anemia in male and female rats receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm during the 13-week study. Groups of 6roups of 60 male and 60 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. Groups of 60 male and 60 female B6C3F1 mice received diets containing 0, 666, 2,000, or 6,000 ppm o-nitroanisole. After 15 months, up to 10 animals from each group were evaluated for chemical-related lesions. Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings: Survival of male rats receiving 2,000 ppm was significantly lower than that of the controls due to increased severity of nephropathy. Survival of 222 and 666 ppm male rats and all exposed female rats was similar to that of the controls. Survival of groups of exposed male and female mice was similar to that of the controls. The final mean body weight of male rats receiving 2,000 ppm was lower than that of the controls. Final mean body weights of male and female mice that received 2,000 and 6,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls. Feed consumption by male and female rats was similar to that by the controls. The only clinical finding in male or female mice attributable to chemical administration was discolored urine. Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions: The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was significantly increased in male rats that received 666 and 2,000 ppm and in female rats that received 2,000 ppm (males: 0 ppm, 26/50; 222 ppm, 25/50; 666 ppm, 42/50; 2,000 ppm, 34/50; females: 14/50, 11/50, 14/50, 26/50). Nephropathy occurred in all male rats; the severity increased with exposure level. Focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium was present in three males receiving 222 ppm and two males receiving 2,000 ppm. Renal tubule adenomas occurred in one male from each of the 222, 666, and 2,000 ppm groups, and renal tubule carcinomas occurred in two males from the 2,000 ppm group. Focal hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder was present in one female rat that received 222 ppm and two male rats and six female rats that received 2,000 ppm. A transitional cell papilloma occurred in the urinary bladder of one female rat from the 2,000 ppm group, and a transitional cell carcinoma occurred in another female from the 2,000 ppm group. The incidence of forestomach ulcers increased in male rats that received 2,000 ppm, and the incidence of focal hyperplasia of the forestomach increased with exposure level in male and female rats. In addition, squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach were present in one female receiving 222 ppm, one male receiving 666 ppm, and one male and one female receiving 2,000 ppm, while squamous cell carcinomas were present in one male receiving 666 ppm and one male and one female receiving 2,000 ppm. The incidences of pituitary gland adenomas in male rats and mammary gland fibroadenomas in female rats decreased with exposure level. The incidence of cellular alteration in the liver was significantly increased in exposed groups of male and female mice. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined), and hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma (combined) were significantly increased in male mice receiving 2,000 and 6,000 ppm. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma were significantly increased in female mice that received 2,000 ppm. STOP-EXPOSURE STUDY: Groups of 60 male and 60 female F344 rats received diets containing 0, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 27 weeks and were then maintained on control feed without further chemical exposure for up to an additional 77 weeks. Up to 10 rats from each group were evaluated for the presence of chemical-related lesions at 3, 6, 9, and 15 months. Survival and Body Weights: Survival of exposed male and female rats was significantly lower than that of the controls as a result of moribund deaths associated with significantly increased incidences of urinary bladder neoplasms, primarily transitional cell carcinomas. All male rats that received 18,000 ppm were dead by week 48 and all females that received 18,000 ppm were dead by week 61. Mean body weights of exposed male and female rats were lower than those of the controls throughout the study. Neoplasms and Nonneoplastic Lesions: Hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder was present in nearly all exposed male and female rats examined at the interim evaluations. A transitional cell carcinoma was first observed at the 3-month interim evaluation in a male rat that received 18,000 ppm. At the 6- and 9-month interim evaluations, transitional cell papillomas or carcinomas were observed in both exposed groups of male rats. Transitional cell carcinomas were observed at the 6-month interim evaluation in females receiving 18,000 ppm and at the 9-month interim evaluation in females receiving 6,000 and 18,000 ppm. Adenomatous polyps of the large intestine were observed in a small number of exposed rats at the 6-, 9-, and 15-month interim evaluations. At the end of the study, the incidence of adenomatous polyps of the large intestine was significantly increased in all exposed groups and carcinomas of the large intestine were present in four males and two females from the 18,000 ppm groups. The incidence of hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis was significantly increased in exposed male and female rats and transitional cell papillomas were present in three males and one female that received 18,000 ppm. Transitional cell carcinomas of the kidney were present in one male receiving 6,000 ppm and six males and one female receiving 18,000 ppm. Transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder were seen in nearly all exposed male and female rats. Of the males and females receiving 6,000 ppm which were without carcinomas, three males and one female had transitional cell papillomas. Generalized centrilobular hypertrophy, focal hepatocellular necrosis, multifocal hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolation, and Kupffer cell pigmentation were observed in the livers of male and female rats at the 3- and 6-month interim evaluations; however, only Kupffer cell pigmentation was observed at the end of the study. Congestion of the red pulp of the spleen was observed in nearly all exposed male and female rats at the 3-, 6-, and 9-month interim evaluations but the incidence was only slightly increased in the 18,000 ppm groups at the end of the study. Degeneration and atrophy of the seminiferous tubule epithelium of the testes were observed at the 3- and 6-month interim evaluations in all male rats receiving 18,000 ppm. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: o-Nitroanisole was tested in two laboratories for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 with and without exogenous metabolic activation (S9). Positive responses were observed at both laboratories in TA100 with and without S9 activation. One laboratory found no increase in mutations, while the second laboratory detected a weakly positive response in TA1535 without S9. No mutagenic activity was observed in the other tester strains. o-Nitroanisole was positive in the mouse lymphoma assay for induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y cells without S9 activation. In cytogenetic tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells, o-nitroanisole induced a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations at the highest dose tested in the presence of S9 activation; sister chromatid exchanges were induced both with and without S9. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these feed studies there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in male and female F344 rats that received diets containing 6,000 or 18,000 ppm for 6 months based on overall increased incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms of the urinary bladder, transitional cell neoplasms of the kidney, and benign and malignant neoplasms of the large intestine. There was a chemical-related increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats receiving diets containing 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 2 years. Marginally increased incidences of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms in male rats and forestomach neoplasms in male and female rats were considered uncertain findings. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of benign and malignant hepatocellular neoplasms. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas. Increased severity of nephropathy in male rats, and increased incidences of focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium and forestomach ulcers in male rats, and of transitional cell hyperplasia of the urinary bladder, focal hyperplasia of the forestomach, and hyperplasia of transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis in male and female rats were associated with exposure to o-nitroanisole.

Whereas some patients with B-CLL have an indolent course and die after many years from unrelated causes, others progress very rapidly and succumb within a few years from this currently incurable leukemia. Over the past decade studies of the structure and function of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) used by these leukemic cells have helped redefine the nature of this disease. In this review we summarize and reinterpret several aspects of these BCR-related studies and how they might relate to the disease. In particular, we address the ability of antigens to select out and drive B cell clones from the normal state to overt leukemic cells by binding to BCRs that are relatively unique and characteristic of B-CLL cells. The differential capacity of some B-CLL cases to continue to transduce signals through the BCR during the leukemic phase and the consequences for the in vivo biology of the leukemic clone is also considered. Finally, we discuss current and emerging views of the cellular origin of B-CLL cells and the differentiation pathways down which we believe these cells progress.","['Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Ferrarini, Manlio']","['Chiorazzi N', 'Ferrarini M']","['North Shore-Long Island Jewish Research Institute, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA. nchizzi@nshs.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Immunol,Annual review of immunology,8309206,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Preleukemia/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/08/28 05:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1146/annurev.immunol.21.120601.141018 [doi]', '120601.141018 [pii]']",ppublish,Annu Rev Immunol. 2003;21:841-94. doi: 10.1146/annurev.immunol.21.120601.141018.

It was also thought to be functionally redundant with IL-4. However, studies conducted with knockout mice, neutralizing antibodies, and novel antagonists demonstrate that IL-13 possesses several unique effector functions that distinguish it from IL-4. Resistance to most gastrointestinal nematodes is mediated by type-2 cytokine responses, in which IL-13 plays a dominant role. By regulating cell-mediated immunity, IL-13 modulates resistance to intracellular organisms including Leishmania major, Leishmania mexicana, and Listeria monocytogenes. In the lung, IL-13 is the central mediator of allergic asthma, where it regulates eosinophilic inflammation, mucus secretion, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Manipulation of IL-13 effector function may also prove useful in the treatment of some cancers like B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Hodgkin's disease, where IL-13 modulates apoptosis or tumor cell growth. IL-13 can also inhibit tumor immunosurveillance. As such, inhibitors of IL-13 might be effective as cancer immunotherapeutics by boosting type-1-associated anti-tumor defenses. Finally, IL-13 was revealed as a potent mediator of tissue fibrosis in both schistosomiasis and asthma, which indicates that it is a key regulator of the extracellular matrix. The mechanisms that regulate IL-13 production and/or function have also been investigated, and IL-4, IL-12, IL-18, IFN-gamma, IL-10, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and the IL-4/IL-13 receptor complex play important roles. This review highlights the effector functions of IL-13 and describes multiple pathways for modulating its activity in vivo.","['Wynn, Thomas A']",['Wynn TA'],"['Immunopathogenesis Section, Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. twynn@niaid.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Immunol,Annual review of immunology,8309206,IM,"['Animals', 'Asthma/immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Fibrosis', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13/*immunology', 'Lung Diseases, Parasitic/immunology', 'Mice', 'Nematode Infections/immunology', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Respiratory Hypersensitivity/immunology']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/08/28 05:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1146/annurev.immunol.21.120601.141142 [doi]', '120601.141142 [pii]']",ppublish,Annu Rev Immunol. 2003;21:425-56. doi: 10.1146/annurev.immunol.21.120601.141142.

An unfavourable environment within the uterus might be a contributory factor to such recurrent implantation failure. This question was addressed by measuring cytokine concentrations and matrix metalloproteinase activities in fluid derived from uterine irrigation of such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The uterine cavities of 22 patients who had previously undergone embryo transfer of at least 10 embryos without ongoing pregnancy were irrigated during the luteal phase. The resultant fluid was assayed for the concentration of interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-10 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -2 and -9 activity. The results were compared with those of a control population of women known to be previously fertile (n = 16) and also with women with recurrent spontaneous abortion (n = 13). In the recurrent implantation failure group, the MMP score and IL-1beta concentration were significantly higher than those in the control group, whereas concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL-10 were significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: In IVF patients with recurrent implantation failure, an altered pattern of intra-uterine cytokine concentration and MMP activity was observed.","['Inagaki, N', 'Stern, C', 'McBain, J', 'Lopata, A', 'Kornman, L', 'Wilkinson, D']","['Inagaki N', 'Stern C', 'McBain J', 'Lopata A', 'Kornman L', 'Wilkinson D']","[""Reproductive Biology Unit, The Royal Women's Hospital, 132 Grattan Street, Carlton, Victoria 3053, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,IM,"['Abortion, Habitual/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', '*Embryo Transfer', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/metabolism/*therapy', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Failure', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/10/31 05:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humrep/deg139 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2003 Mar;18(3):608-15. doi: 10.1093/humrep/deg139.,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NQO1 deficiency in humans is associated with an increased risk of leukemia, specifically acute myelogenous leukemia, and benzene poisoning. We examined the importance of NQO1 in benzene-induced toxicity by hypothesizing that NQO1-deficient (NQO1-/-) mice are more sensitive to benzene than mice with wild-type NQO1 (NQO1+/+; 129/Sv background strain). Male and female NQO1-/- and NQO1+/+ mice were exposed to inhaled benzene (0, 10, 50, or 100 ppm) for 2 weeks, 6 h/day, 5 days/week. Micronucleated peripheral blood cells were counted to assess genotoxicity. Peripheral blood counts and bone marrow histology were used to assess hematotoxicity and myelotoxicity. p21 mRNA levels in bone marrow cells were used as determinants of DNA damage response. Female NQO1-/- mice were more sensitive (6-fold) to benzene-induced genotoxicity than the female NQO1+/+ mice. Female NQO1-/- mice had a 9-fold increase (100 versus 0 ppm) in micronucleated reticulocytes compared with a 3-fold increase in the female NQO1+/+ mice. However, the induced genotoxic response in male mice was similar between the two genotypes (> or = 10-fold increase at 100 ppm versus 0 ppm). Male and female NQO1-/- mice exhibited greater hematotoxicity than NQO1+/+ mice. p21 mRNA levels were induced significantly in male mice (>10-fold) from both strains and female NQO1-/- mice (> 8-fold), which indicates an activated DNA damage response. These results indicate that NQO1 deficiency results in substantially greater benzene-induced toxicity. However, the specific patterns of toxicity differed between the male and female mice.","['Bauer, Alison K', 'Faiola, Brenda', 'Abernethy, Diane J', 'Marchan, Rosemarie', 'Pluta, Linda J', 'Wong, Vicki A', 'Roberts, Kay', 'Jaiswal, Anil K', 'Gonzalez, Frank J', 'Butterworth, Byron E', 'Borghoff, Susan', 'Parkinson, Horace', 'Everitt, Jeffrey', 'Recio, Leslie']","['Bauer AK', 'Faiola B', 'Abernethy DJ', 'Marchan R', 'Pluta LJ', 'Wong VA', 'Roberts K', 'Jaiswal AK', 'Gonzalez FJ', 'Butterworth BE', 'Borghoff S', 'Parkinson H', 'Everitt J', 'Recio L']","['CIIT Centers for Health Research, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA. bauer1@niehs.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/metabolism', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced/pathology', 'Inactivation, Metabolic/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver/enzymology', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/04/02 05:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Mar 1;63(5):929-35.,,,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,,"['F32 ES011424/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 ES011424-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', '1F32 ES11424-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES07943/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we found that sodium arsenite (NaAsO(2)) also triggers the signal for activation of Akt and downstream glycogen synthase 3beta (GSK3beta). Such Akt/GSK3beta activation was abrogated completely by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI-3 kinase, and greatly by pertussis toxin, a G-protein inhibitor. Arsenite-induced Akt phosphorylation also was inhibited by sequestrating membrane cholesterol with beta cyclodextrin. Reducing reagents/reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers reduced arsenite-induced Akt phosphorylation and beta cyclodextrin reduced arsenite-mediated ROS production, suggesting that arsenite-induced G-protein/Akt/GSK3beta pathway is membrane raft dependent and redox linked. We also found that a combination of a low concentration (1 microM) of arsenite and wortmannin triggers the signal for caspase activation, whereas neither of these elements alone did so. These results suggested that selective blockade of the arsenite-provoked PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway can promote the arsenite-triggered pathway for caspase activation, and this may open a new study area for wider applications of arsenic as a drug for treating various kinds of leukemia.","['Hossain, Khaled', 'Akhand, Anwarul A', 'Kawamoto, Yoshiyuki', 'Du, Jun', 'Takeda, Kozue', 'Wu, Jianghong', 'Yoshihara, Motoi', 'Tsuboi, Hideo', 'Kato, Masashi', 'Suzuki, Haruhiko', 'Nakashima, Izumi']","['Hossain K', 'Akhand AA', 'Kawamoto Y', 'Du J', 'Takeda K', 'Wu J', 'Yoshihara M', 'Tsuboi H', 'Kato M', 'Suzuki H', 'Nakashima I']","['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Cyclodextrins/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sodium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Sulfhydryl Reagents', 'Wortmannin', '*beta-Cyclodextrins']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S089158490201359X [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(02)01359-x [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2003 Mar 1;34(5):598-606. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(02)01359-x.,,,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Cyclodextrins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Reagents)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Glycogen Synthase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'JV039JZZ3A (betadex)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Observational case report. METHODS: A complete ophthalmic and systemic evaluation was performed. RESULTS: Ophthalmic examination revealed peripheral retinal nonperfusion with retinal neovascularization in both eyes. Fluorescein angiography of both eyes showed a marked midperipheral and peripheral avascular retina temporally with arteriovenous anastomosis and seafan neovascularizations. Blood work showed no abnormalities, although marked leucocytosis (up to 750 x 10(9)/l) and thrombocytosis (646 x 10(9)/l) were present in 1998 when the patient was diagnosed with leukemia. Following treatment, the patient has been in remission. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral retinal nonperfusion with retinal neovascularization may occur as a complication of chronic myeloid leukemia. In contrast to other studies describing this association, our patient had a bilateral peripheral retinal nonperfusion with seafan neovascularizations without relapse of the myeloid leukemia and without any of the other retinal signs associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, such as tortuosity of veins, intraretinal or preretinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool exudates.","['Nobacht, Siamak', 'Vandoninck, Kathleen F K', 'Deutman, August F', 'Klevering, B Jeroen']","['Nobacht S', 'Vandoninck KF', 'Deutman AF', 'Klevering BJ']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. s.nobacht@ohk.azn.nl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Ophthalmol,American journal of ophthalmology,0370500,IM,"['Adult', 'Arteriovenous Fistula/etiology/physiopathology/surgery', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Humans', 'Laser Coagulation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/physiopathology', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Retinal Diseases/*etiology/physiopathology/surgery', 'Retinal Neoplasms/*complications/physiopathology', 'Retinal Neovascularization/etiology/physiopathology/surgery', 'Retinal Vessels/*physiopathology']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/03/18 04:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0002939402019566 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9394(02)01956-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ophthalmol. 2003 Mar;135(3):404-6. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9394(02)01956-6.,,,,,['Copyright 2003 by Elsevier Science Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To circumvent this problem, we have developed a modified replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) that is capable of transducing human glioma cell lines A-172, U-87, T-98G, U-373, and U-138 and rat glioma cell lines C6 and 9L, over multiple infection cycles in vitro, resulting in a tremendous enhancement in transduction efficiency over conventional replication-defective retroviral vectors at the same dose. Whereas the transduction efficiency of conventional retroviral vectors injected into preestablished subcutaneous U-87 tumors at a dose of 1.0 x 10(5) transducing units (TU) was only 0.2% at 6 weeks postinjection, the same dose of RCR vector resulted in up to 97.2% transduction. When RCR vectors at a dose of 1.0 x 10(4) TU were injected into preestablished intracranial U-87 tumors, transduction efficiency at 2 and 3 weeks was 74 and 98.1%, respectively. Notably, however, intracranial injection of RCR vectors did not result in detectable infection of normal brain cells. Furthermore, using a sensitive polymerase chain reaction assay, no detectable RCR signal could be observed in any extracerebral tissues, including lung, liver, kidney, upper gastrointestinal tract (esophagus and stomach), lower gastrointestinal tract (colon and small intestine), skin, spleen, and bone marrow. Treatment of U-87 intracranial gliomas with RCR vectors carrying the yeast cytosine deaminase suicide gene followed by 5-fluorocytosine prodrug administration resulted in 100% survival over a 60-day follow-up period, compared with 0% survival of control groups receiving vector alone or prodrug alone. Our results demonstrate that RCR vectors can achieve therapeutically significant levels of transduction in malignant human gliomas, and that RCR vector spread after intratumoral injection is restricted to the tumor itself.","['Wang, Wei Jun', 'Tai, Chien-Kuo', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki', 'Chen, Thomas C']","['Wang WJ', 'Tai CK', 'Kasahara N', 'Chen TC']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics/physiology', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glioma/*genetics/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303403321070810 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2003 Jan 20;14(2):117-27. doi: 10.1089/104303403321070810.,,,,,,,"['P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA59318-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC8295717,,,,,,,['NIHMS1710135'],

Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative method for restoring normal haematopoiesis, and survival is improved if the transplant is carried out before severe complications occur. However, the evolution of FA is difficult to predict because of the absence of known prognostic factors and the unknown function of the genes involved. In studying 71 FA patients, a correlation was found between severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) and the individual annual telomere-shortening rate (IATSR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P < 10(-3)). Spontaneous apoptosis was highest in SAA patients or patients with high IATSR (> 200 bp/year) (P < 0.01, n = 18). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that significant relative risks for evolution towards SAA were high IATSR (P < 10(-4)), and that a high number of chromosome breakages occurred in the presence of nitrogen mustard (P < 0.001). A high IATSR was also associated with an increased frequency of malignancy (P < 0.01). Thus, these biological parameters were related to the spontaneous evolution of FA and could be used as prognostic factors.

By light microscopy, the myeloperoxidase reaction was positive in three patients in an unusual coarse granular pattern. Ultrastructural demonstration of peroxidase in the granules, nuclear membrane and profiles of endoplasmic reticulum was observed in all eight patients. The reaction in the granules showed a particular speckled pattern. The outcome was unfavourable in six of our eight patients.

We investigated the secretion of the angiogenic growth factor, basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF), from primary tissue cultures of 15 LN with SLL and 10 reactive LN. bFGF was detected from the resulting conditioned media (CM) in 13/15 SLL samples (mean 92 +/- 30, range 5-420 pg/ml) but was undetectable in CM from all reactive lymph nodes. CM was also used in a 72-h human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation assay. HUVEC proliferation increased in the presence of SLL CM (70 +/- 17%, range -4-194%), proportional to secreted levels of bFGF (R2 = 0.95), and was reversed by depleting bFGF from CM. Previous SLL studies have examined either patient serum samples or paraffin-embedded lymph node tissue sections. This is the first study to examine the secretion of an angiogenic growth factor from primary cultures of lymph node cells.

Conventional therapy results in a median survival of 3-5 years. Patients with B-cell disorders and coexistent HER-2/neu overexpression in solid tumors have a poorer prognosis than those without an underlying B-cell disorder. This, and the recent success of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate in chronic myelogenous leukemia, led us to evaluate the incidence and role of c-kit (CD117) and HER-2/neu overexpression in MM. We conducted a retrospective study to determine the incidence of HER-2/neu and c-kit overexpression in MM. HER-2/neu overexpression was evaluated using the DAKO Hercep test and c-kit overexpression was assessed using conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC); 69 patients with a diagnosis of MM were identified, of whom, 31 patients (19 males and 12 females) had an adequate pathological specimen available for IHC testing; 4 out of 31 patients (12.9%) showed HER-2/neu overexpression, while 5/31 (16.13%) showed CD117 expression. Two patients (6.45%) showed both HER-2/neu and c-kit overexpression. Although both HER-2/neu and c-kit are not expressed very frequently in patients with MM, there appears to be a subgroup of patients in whom, either one or both these oncogenes is overexpressed. Given our small sample size, it is difficult to comment on the effect of CD117 and/or HER-2/neu overexpression on survival. Future larger studies are needed to define the association in MM and to determine if the presence of one (CD117 or HER-2/neu) has an effect on overexpression of the other oncoprotein. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to identify the molecular nature of the interplay between HER-2/neu and c-kit, if any. Target-directed signal transduction inhibition therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, may be a distinct possibility in a select group of patients with MM.","['Potti, Anil', 'Ganti, Apar Kishor', 'Koch, Michael', 'Levitt, Ralph', 'Mehdi, Syed A']","['Potti A', 'Ganti AK', 'Koch M', 'Levitt R', 'Mehdi SA']",,['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000040198 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Dec;43(12):2427-30. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000040198.,,,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of rhGM-CSF to AML LTMC resulted in a significant increase in the number of total nucleated cells (1.3-4.3-fold, as compared to untreated cultures). However, a simultaneous decrease in the numbers of myeloid progenitor cells (CFU) was observed. Interestingly, there was a selective stimulation of the growth of leukemic progenitors (AML-CFU). Indeed, whereas on day 0 these cells were detected in only 2 patients, between weeks 1 and 5 they were detected in 10 of the 14 patients included in the study. It is noteworthy that around 50% of the cells detected in the non-adherent fraction of rhGM-CSF-treated AML LTMC were blasts, whereas in untreated cultures, blasts corresponded to only 23% of the non-adherent cells, and the majority corresponded to cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. These results indicate that rhGM-CSF is a cytokine with a significant stimulatory activity for the in vitro growth of AML progenitor andblast cells, and, together with previous reports in the literature, suggest that the use of rhGM-CSF in clinical settings must be taken with caution since this cytokine, although beneficial in reducing the risk of infections after chemotherapy, may induce the reappearance of the disease after treatment.

The highest frequency was observed in AML-non acute promyelocytic leukemia(APL) cases (47.2% of the cases). The disappearance of this expression was associated with the status of complete remission of AML. Renin is expressed in some myeloid human leukemia cell lines such as K562, KU812 and MEG-01. However, when K562 cells were treated with inducers of growth inhibition and/or differentiation, the expression did not disappear, indicating that renin expression is associated with a blastic phenotype rather than with cell proliferation.

The gene for Jak3 has been mapped to human chromosome 19p12-13.1 and encompasses 23 exons. Constitutively high levels of JAK3 activity may contribute to drug resistance and enhanced clonogenicity of leukemic B-cell precursors from children and infants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). As part of a systematic effort to accurately determine the genomic sequence of Jak3 gene in normal and leukemic B-cell precursors, we sequenced a relatively short region of Jak3 spanning two introns, originally termed introns 10 and 11. This genomic sequence appeared in certain RT-PCR products from our analysis of Jak3 gene expression in pediatric, as well as infant, primary ALL cells. Unexpectedly, a gap in the original Jak3 genomic sequence was found in intron 10 across the sequence matching to an Alu element. Furthermore, the sequence obtained from intron 11 did not match at all to that previously reported, and the length of the intron was much larger than expected at 1.1 kb. Homology to Alu elements (three regions, 699 bp total) and a LINE2 element (one region, 189 bp total) were seen across the entire region covering exons 10-12 (2.1 kb total). Two potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed in intron 11.

A special type of this phenomenon is crystal-storing histocytosis or the so-called pseudo-pseudo Gaucher cells (PPGC) in which crystalline protein storage in macrophages is induced by paraproteinemia. Here we describe a 54-year-old man with an initial suspicion of Gaucher disease and monoclonal IgA gammopathy in whom a correct diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) with massive infiltration of bone marrow and spleen by PPGC was confirmed by immunological, ultrastructural and molecular characterisation. The activity of leukocyte beta-glucocerebrosidase was only slightly elevated (7.3 nmol/mg protein/1 h) which ruled out the diagnosis of classic Gaucher's disease. The patient received two courses of CHOP without improvement and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) with only temporary stabilisation. Subsequently, he underwent splenectomy because of prolonged severe pancytopenia and a suspicion of hypersplenism. After splenectomy significant haematological improvement was observed. Following anti-CD20 therapy, changes in immunoprofile and morphology of tumour cells were evident. Before treatment the population of LPL was more divergent, with expression of LCA, CD20, CD38 and CD138. However, after the treatment, there were more mature plasma cells which no longer expressed CD20 antigen-this picture was more consistent with the diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma. Similarly, in the spleen there were no CD-20-positive cells evident. Finally, the patient received two courses of VAD vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone) with further haematological improvement but complete response was not achieved.","['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Urbanska-Rys, Halina', 'Jerzmanowski, Piotr', 'Bartkowiak, Jacek', 'Liberski, Pawel', 'Kordek, Radzislaw']","['Robak T', 'Urbanska-Rys H', 'Jerzmanowski P', 'Bartkowiak J', 'Liberski P', 'Kordek R']","['Department of Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, 93-513 Lodz, ul.

However, approximately 40-50% of Rituximab treated patients will recur. It is not clear whether these recurrent diseases have the same immunophenotype as that of the original tumors. At the City of Hope, we treated 91 cases of CD20-positive B-cell neoplasms with Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between August 1999 and December 2000. Thirty-five of 91 patients (38%) experienced recurrence during the time period within one year from treatment. Tumor cells from all of the recurrent patients expressed one or more B cell antigens (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD45RA, or CD79a). However, thirteen of 35 recurrent cases showed aberrant loss of CD20 expression (37%) by immunohistochemical or flow cytometric studies. Pre- and post-Rituximab treated tumor cell DNA was successfully extracted from archival paraffin sections, hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stained slides, smears, or frozen cells in 10 of 13 CD20 negative recurrent cases. PCR studies for immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene rearrangements were performed in all these cases. Five cases showed identical Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements in the paired specimens. PCR assay for Ig kappa (kappa) gene rearrangement was performed in the five paired specimens lacking detectable Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements; 2 of them showed identical Igkappa gene rearrangements. Three pairs showed unmatched Ig heavy chain and Igkappa gene rearrangements, probably due to poor quality of recovered DNA. Aberrant loss of CD20 antigens may be a mechanism of treatment resistance and should be considered in the immunophenotyping of recurrent Rituximab-treated B-cell neoplasms; therefore, a panel of B cell markers is recommended for the immunologic diagnosis of recurrent B cell malignancies after Rituximab therapy. Seven of ten pairs of recurrent CD20-negative cases showed identical Ig heavy chain and Igkappa gene rearrangements by PCR assay, strongly suggesting that the pre- and post-Rituxan treated B cell neoplasms are clonally-related.","['Chu, Peiguo G', 'Chen, Yuan-Yuan', 'Molina, Arturo', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Weiss, Lawrence M']","['Chu PG', 'Chen YY', 'Molina A', 'Arber DA', 'Weiss LM']","['Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/classification/*pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Failure']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000040044 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Dec;43(12):2335-41. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000040044.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serial bone marrow cytogenetics and peripheral blood BCR/ABL mRNA levels were measured in 17 patients [9 with chronic phase (CP) and 8 with accelerated phase or blast crisis (AP/BC)] during 1 year of treatment. Overall, quantitative PCR BCR/ABL transcript level decreased by a median of 0.9 log during the first 3 months, and by 1.6 logs by 12 months. Among cytogenetic responders (6 CP and 2 AP/BC), median BCR/ABL copy number was 0.9 and 2.1 logs lower than baseline after 3 and 12 months of treatment, respectively. No patient became PCR-negative for BCR/ABL. Among cytogenetic non-responders, BCR/ABL transcript level decreased by 0.4 logs after 3 months, with no subsequent reductions. At study entry, BCR/ABL expression in cytogenetic responders and non-responders was similar. However, BCR/ABL expression became significantly different 3 months after treatment (p = 0.02), and increasingly different with continued therapy (p = 0.04, 0.005, 0.0008 at 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively).

An initial treatment with two cycles of CHOP was added to reduce initial tumoral burden, followed by antiretroviral (ARV) therapy associated with etoposide. We report the characteristics and outcomes of 29 patients diagnosed with an ATLL between 1990 and 1999. The overall median survival was 8 months. A striking improvement of survival was observed when comparing the periods between 1990-1994 and 1995-1999 (17 months versus 3 months, p = 0.004). During the second period, seven patients received a therapy with oral etoposide, antinucleoside and IFN, among which, six patients received an initial induction CHOP chemotherapy. No major toxicity was observed with this strategy. In conclusion, the progression of survival since 1995 suggests that a therapeutic approach combining initial polychemotherapy with CHOP followed by ARV drugs, IFN and oral etoposide is an interesting option in treating patients with ATLL.","['Besson, Caroline', 'Panelatti, Gerard', 'Delaunay, Christine', 'Gonin, Claire', 'Brebion, Alain', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Plumelle, Yves']","['Besson C', 'Panelatti G', 'Delaunay C', 'Gonin C', 'Brebion A', 'Hermine O', 'Plumelle Y']","['Service de Medecine Interne, CHU Pierre Zobda-Quitman, BP 632, 97261 Fort de France, Martinique, French West Indies, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Zalcitabine/administration & dosage', 'Zidovudine/administration & dosage']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000039983 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Dec;43(12):2275-9. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000039983.,,,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6L3XT8CB3I (Zalcitabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these patients, serum tryptase levels are elevated (> 15 ng/ml) and reflect the total burden of leukemic cells. In most cases, myeloblasts express alpha-tryptase mRNA in excess over beta-tryptase mRNA, and secrete the respective protein (= pro-alpha-tryptase) in a constitutive manner. It was also found that these AML blasts frequentlyco-express tryptase with additional mast cell lineage- and/or basophil-related differentiation antigens including KIT (CD117), histamine, and 2D7.

It is expressed at high levels in the G2/M phase and is rapidly down-regulated after cell-cycle arrest. It was suggested that survivin plays a pivotal role in linking cell death and cell proliferation. Although present during fetal development, survivin disappears in terminally differentiated adult tissues. Its expression is aberrantly enhanced in transformed cell lines, and in all the most common human cancers. Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), which is abundant with Fas (Apo-1/CD95), has the characteristic feature of high tumor burden, suggesting that ATL cells probably prolong their lives as a result of escape from apoptosis. Survivin is prominently and consistently expressed in all cases of ATL and ATL cell lines. Its mRNA expression levels among the subtypes of ATL and ATL cell lines are characteristic and informative, low in chronic type, low to high in acute type and extremely high in ATL cell lines. In addition, when the survivin mRNA expression is higher, the survival of the patient is shorter. Its overexpression may account for a growth advantage in vivo and subsequently the malignant behavior of ATL. So quantification of survivin mRNA is important for clinical laboratory examinations. Among all of the current clinical tests for survivin mRNA quantification, the real time PCR is desirable. Despite some technological problems of standardization, quantification of survivin mRNA was shown to be a biological marker for clinical stages or minimal residual disease (MRD).","['Nakayama, Katsushi', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Nakayama K', 'Kamihira S']","['Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Division of Laboratory Medicine, 1-7-1, Sakamoto, Nagasaki 852-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Survivin']",2003/03/05 04:00,2003/10/04 05:00,['2003/03/05 04:00'],"['2003/03/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000039956 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Dec;43(12):2249-55. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000039956.,,65,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Purified 1 x 10(4) circulating CD34+ cells isolated from rHuEPO-hyporesponsive HD patients (EPO-H; n = 10), rHuEPO-responsive non-HD patients with CRF (EPO-R; n = 8), nonanemic HD patients without rHuEPO therapy (EPO-W/O; n = 10), and healthy volunteer controls (CON; n = 10) were subjected to a methylcellulose culture system supplemented with rHuEPO, recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3), recombinant human stem cell factor (SCF), and recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for 14 days. RESULTS: The average number of burst-forming units of erythroids (BFU-Es) was significantly less in the EPO-H group compared with the CON and EPO-W/O groups. Furthermore, colony size also was significantly smaller in the EPO-H group. Total RNAs were extracted from approximately 100 colonies/patient and subjected to complementary DNA expression array studies of 268 growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors. A characteristic cluster upregulated in the EPO-R and EPO-W/O groups and downregulated in the EPO-H group was identified that contained various cytokines and growth factors, including IL-6, GM-CSF, vascular endothelial growth factor B, IL-9, IL-3, leukemia inhibitory factor, and interferon alpha-2, and such receptors as thrombopoietin receptor, IL-9 receptor, and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the cross-talk network or autocrine/paracrine regulatory loop is critically impaired in BFU-E-derived cells in EPO-H patients, and investigation of these cluster genes would facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for such patients.","['Nakao, Kazushi', 'Wada, Jun', 'Ota, Kosuke', 'Ichikawa, Haruo', 'Akagi, Shigeru', 'Okamoto, Akira', 'Hida, Kazuyuki', 'Nagake, Yoshio', 'Makino, Hirofumi']","['Nakao K', 'Wada J', 'Ota K', 'Ichikawa H', 'Akagi S', 'Okamoto A', 'Hida K', 'Nagake Y', 'Makino H']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Kidney Dis,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,8110075,IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Autocrine Communication/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay/statistics & numerical data', 'Computer Systems/statistics & numerical data', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/chemistry/*drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/blood/drug therapy/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/statistics & numerical data', 'Paracrine Communication/*drug effects/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', '*Renal Dialysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/statistics & numerical data']",2003/03/04 04:00,2003/03/15 04:00,['2003/03/04 04:00'],"['2003/03/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [medline]', '2003/03/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/ajkd.2003.50124 [doi]', 'S0272638602692315 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Kidney Dis. 2003 Mar;41(3):624-36. doi: 10.1053/ajkd.2003.50124.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,"['Copyright 2003 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most such cancers have the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP+) with methylation and transcriptional silencing of the mismatch repair gene MLH1. The p14 (ARF) gene on chromosome 9p is deleted and/or silenced by hypermethylation in a subset of human malignancies. There is evidence suggesting that p14 suppresses tumorigenicity by stabilizing the p53 protein. METHODS: We investigated the role of p14 in colorectal cancer by determining its methylation status in cancers that were studied previously for microsatellite instability, CIMP, and mutations of p53 and K-RAS. RESULTS: p14 methylation was present in 21 of 94 cases overall (22%) and was frequent particularly in the subgroups with MSI-H (52% [11 of 21] vs. 14% [10 of 72], P = 0.004), in CIMP+ cases (40% [19 of 48] vs. 4% [2 of 46], P < 0.001), and in cases without p53 alterations (36% [17 of 47] vs. 7% [3 of 44], P = 0.004). Of 91 fully characterized cases, 41 (45%) had p53 mutations alone, 17 (19%) had p14 methylation alone, 30 (33%) had neither, but only 3 (3%) had both p53 mutations and p14 methylation. p14 methylation is an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis, being detectable in normal aging epithelium by using sensitive assays. CONCLUSIONS: In colorectal cancer, p14 methylation is associated with the presence of microsatellite instability and with absence of p53 mutations. The results provide a possible explanation for the paucity of p53 mutations in colon cancers with microsatellite instability.","['Shen, Lanlan', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Hamilton, Stanley R', 'Rashid, Asif', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Shen L', 'Kondo Y', 'Hamilton SR', 'Rashid A', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas at M.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a more recently developed bone assessment technique which does not use radiation, tibial ultrasonometry, can be used for the detection of short-term changes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1997 to February 2001, 37 patients (25 boys, 12 girls, mean age 9.0 years, range 3.0-16.8 years) were included in a longitudinal study to assess changes in bone status induced by the disease itself and/or treatment. Of these 37 patients, 35 had a measurement at the start of therapy (t0), 26 at 6 months (t6), 24 at 12 months (t12), 11 at 24 months (t24) and 9 at 36 months (t36). For assessment of bone mass, the tibial ultrasound (US) device SoundScan Compact was used, which measures the speed of sound (SOS) along the cortex of the tibia over a fixed length of 5 cm at the mid-tibial point. RESULTS. The SOS standard deviation (SD) scores were significantly lower at t6, t12, t24 and t36 than at baseline (t0). The biggest change was found between t0 and t6. During follow-up, no significant correlation was found between changes from baseline of height SD scores and SOS SD scores, indicating that tibial ultrasonometry was not measuring growth. After ending therapy (t36), no further growth retardation was found. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term changes of SOS SD scores in children with ALL can be detected by tibial ultrasonometry. Tibial ultrasonometry measures a change in bone status, not growth.","['Lequin, Maarten H', 'van der Sluis, Inge M', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Hop, Wim J', 'van Rijn, Rick R', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama, Sabine F', 'van Kuijk, Cees']","['Lequin MH', 'van der Sluis IM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Hop WJ', 'van Rijn RR', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama SF', 'van Kuijk C']","[""Department of Paediatric Radiology, Sophia Children's Hospital, University Hospital, Dr. Molewaterplein 60, 3015 GJ Rotterdam, The Netherlands. lequin@rons.azr.nl""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Anthropometry', 'Bone Density/*physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tibia/*diagnostic imaging', 'Ultrasonography']",2003/03/04 04:00,2003/06/27 05:00,['2003/03/04 04:00'],"['2001/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/03/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00247-002-0814-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 2003 Mar;33(3):162-7. doi: 10.1007/s00247-002-0814-4.

METHODS: The 1994 and 1995 National Health Interview Survey and Disability Interview Supplement samples provide International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision medical impairment codes for children with functional limitations or school activity limitations in a nationally representative US sample. Functional limitations were distributed as follows: mobility 12.4/1000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.1-13.6), self-care 8.8/1000 (95% CI: 7.7-9.8), communication 52.9/1000 (95% CI: 50.2-55.5), and learning 104.6/1000 (95% CI: 100.7-108.4). Functional disability status was classified as 4.1% mild, 5.9% major, and 1.9% multiple. School activity limitations included 4.1% needing or receiving special education, 0.7% unable to attend, and 0.9% limited attendance. We categorized International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision impairment codes reported in conjunction with medical usage as physical disorders (n = 1251; eg, leukemia, diabetes), asthma (n = 916), neurodevelopmental disorders (n = 802; eg, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, blindness, deafness), and learning-behavior disorders (n = 806; eg, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, learning disability, anxiety) for children with functional or school activity limitations. Of children with multiple functional disabilities, 29.9% had neurodevelopmental disorders, 27.1% had learning-behavior disorders, 18.1% had physical disorders, 4.2% had asthma, and 20.8% did not have an identified medical impairment because they had not received medical services in the past year. Among children requiring special education, physical disorders accounted for 9.4%, neurodevelopmental disorders for 16.7%, learning and behavior disorders for 17%, asthma for 3.4%, and 53.4% did not have an identified medical impairment because they had not received medical services in the past year. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic health impairments, neurodevelopmental disorders, learning-behavior disorders, and functional limitations in essential activities are required to understand the complexity of disability in school-age children. A large number of children with functional disability or school activity limitations have not received ongoing medical services.","['Msall, Michael E', 'Avery, Roger C', 'Tremont, Michelle R', 'Lima, Julie C', 'Rogers, Michelle L', 'Hogan, Dennis P']","['Msall ME', 'Avery RC', 'Tremont MR', 'Lima JC', 'Rogers ML', 'Hogan DP']","['Child Development Center, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island 02903, USA. michael_msall@brown.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease/*epidemiology', 'Delivery of Health Care/standards', 'Developmental Disabilities/epidemiology', 'Disabled Children/*statistics & numerical data', 'Education, Special/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Health Services/statistics & numerical data', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/epidemiology', 'Learning Disabilities/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Students/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology']",2003/03/04 04:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/03/04 04:00'],"['2003/03/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1542/peds.111.3.548 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatrics. 2003 Mar;111(3):548-53. doi: 10.1542/peds.111.3.548.,,,,,,,"['1 R03 HD35376/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '1U01 HD37614/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '5T-77 MC 00016-04/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

While the CRE-2-binding complex contains the CREB protein and is activated by IL-3 through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent pathway, the identity and cytokine activation pathway of the SIE-binding complex remains unclear. In this report, we demonstrated that PU.1 is one component of the SIE-binding complex. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay further confirmed that PU.1 binds to the mcl-1 promoter region containing the SIE motif in vivo. While IL-3 stimulation does not significantly alter the SIE-binding activity of PU.1, it markedly increases PU.1's transactivation activity. The latter effect coincides with the increased phosphorylation of PU.1 following IL-3 activation of a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38(MAPK))-dependent pathway. A serine-to-alanine substitution at position 142 significantly weakens PU.1's ability to be phosphorylated by the p38(MAPK) immunocomplex. Furthermore, this S142A mutant is impaired in the ability to be further stimulated by IL-3 to transactivate the mcl-1 reporter through the SIE motif. Taken together, our results demonstrate that IL-3 stimulation of mcl-1 gene transcription through the SIE motif involves phosphorylation of PU.1 at serine 142 by a p38(MAPK)-dependent pathway.","['Wang, Ju-Ming', 'Lai, Ming-Zong', 'Yang-Yen, Hsin-Fang']","['Wang JM', 'Lai MZ', 'Yang-Yen HF']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, 128 Yen-Jiou Yuan Road, Section 2, Nankang, Taipei 11529, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genes, Immediate-Early/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Wortmannin', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2003/03/04 04:00,2003/04/16 05:00,['2003/03/04 04:00'],"['2003/03/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.6.1896-1909.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Mar;23(6):1896-909. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.6.1896-1909.2003.,,,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,,,,,,PMC149468,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the nature of the killing action of oh(8)dG on KG-1 was investigated. Signs observed in oh(8)dG-treated KG-1 cells indicated that death was due to apoptosis, as demonstrated by: increased sub-G(1) hypodiploid (apoptotic) cells, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation; loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, and the down-regulation of bcl-2; and the activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3, and the efficient inhibition of the apoptotic process by caspases inhibitors. This apoptosis appears not to be associated with Fas/Fas ligand because the expressions of these proteins were unchanged. Apoptotic KG-1 cells showed a high concentration of oh(8)Gua in DNA. Moreover, the increased concentration of oh(8)Gua in DNA, and the apoptotic process were not suppressed by the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, and thus the process is independent of reactive oxygen species. Of the 18 cancer cell lines treated with oh(8)dG, 3 cell lines (H9, CEM-CM3, and Molt-4) were found to be committed to apoptosis, and all of these showed very low OGG1 activity and a marked increase in the concentration of oh(8)Gua in DNA.

In this study, we investigated whether power-line frequency EMF could act as an environmental insult to invoke stress responses in human keratinocytes using the 27-kDa heat shock protein (HSP27) as a stress marker. After exposure to 1 gauss (100 micro T) EMF from 20 min to 24 hr, the isoform pattern of HSP27 in keratinocytes remained unchanged, suggesting that EMF did not induce the phosphorylation of this stress protein. EMF exposure also failed to induce the translocation of HSP27 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Moreover, EMF exposure did not increase the abundance of HSP27 in keratinocytes. In addition, we found no evidence that EMF exposure enhanced the level of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) in breast or leukemia cells as reported previously.

Detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) after allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is important to schedule therapeutic intervention, e.g. donor lymphocyte infusion. We asked, whether chimerism analysis in circulating CD34+ cells might be a feasible method to monitor MRD in patients after allogeneic SCT. Eighty-seven patients undergoing allogeneic SCT were prospectively analyzed. CD34+ cells were prepared from peripheral blood samples and sorted after immunomagnetic preenrichment. Results were correlated to overall chimerism and results of nested RT-PCR for the bcr-abl rearrangement in Ph1-cases. In the 87 patients a median of 8 analyses (range 2-22) covering a median period of 295 days (range 28-1152) were performed. A hematological relapse was observed in 22/84 engrafting patients (26%). In twenty patients, the relapse was detected in the CD34+ fraction, in 14 of these patients, donor chimerism in CD34+ cells decreased 12-97 days (median 52 days) before the clinical diagnosis. In two cases, CD34+ chimerism failed to demonstrate the relapse. In patients with relapsing CML, the decrease of donor CD34+ cells was associated with reappearance of bcr-abl transcripts. Treatment (reduction of immunosuppression, DLI or STI571) was associated with an increase of donor derived CD34+ cells and clearance of bcr-abl positive cells. Sequential chimerism analysis in CD34+ cells is feasible and sensitive, allowing early detection of relapse and monitoring of therapeutic intervention. This method appears especially useful in patients with high risk leukemia lacking other markers for detection of MRD.","['Thiede, Ch', 'Lutterbeck, K', 'Oelschlagel, U', 'Kiehl, M', 'Steudel, Ch', 'Platzbecker, U', 'Brendel, C', 'Fauser, A A', 'Neubauer, A', 'Ehninger, G', 'Bornhauser, M']","['Thiede Ch', 'Lutterbeck K', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Kiehl M', 'Steudel Ch', 'Platzbecker U', 'Brendel C', 'Fauser AA', 'Neubauer A', 'Ehninger G', 'Bornhauser M']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Technischen Universitat Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307 Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*blood', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recurrence', '*Transplantation Chimera']",2003/03/04 04:00,2003/03/15 04:00,['2003/03/04 04:00'],"['2003/03/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [medline]', '2003/03/04 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2002;81 Suppl 2:S27-8.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is considerable debate over the incidence or risk of tMDS/AML in NHL patients treated with any particular modality and the factors that contribute to malignant transformation. DESIGN: Conclusions were based on thorough analysis of data reported in the peer-reviewed literature and careful examination of the statistical methodology and methods for identifying cases of tMDS/AML. Unless noted, data are reported only for NHL patients, excluding Hodgkin's disease patients. RESULTS: Despite differences in methods used to identify cases and to estimate the cumulative incidence over time (actuarial v cumulative calculations), up to 10% of NHL patients treated with either conventional-dose chemotherapy or high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation may develop tMDS/AML within 10 years of primary therapy. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the actuarial incidence, which are based on censoring of patients who died without developing tMDS/AML, can lead to artificially high estimates with large confidence intervals at later time points. Although there is much debate about the cause(s) of tMDS/AML, there is compelling evidence that alkylating agents, certain other leukemogenic agents, and total-body irradiation (TBI) cause chromosomal damage that can lead to tMDS/AML. CONCLUSION: Limiting exposure to alkylating agents and eliminating TBI from transplantation conditioning regimens may reduce the relative risk of tMDS/AML.","['Armitage, James O', 'Carbone, Paul P', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Levine, Alexandra', 'Bennett, John M', 'Kroll, Stewart']","['Armitage JO', 'Carbone PP', 'Connors JM', 'Levine A', 'Bennett JM', 'Kroll S']","['University of Nebraska College of Medicine, Omaha, NE 68198-3332, USA. joarmita@unmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Radiotherapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/03/29 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.07.113 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Mar 1;21(5):897-906. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.07.113.,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapy for HCL includes splenectomy, interferon alfa-2a and alfa-2b, pentostatin, and cladribine. The purpose of this article was to report the extended follow-up of HCL patients treated with cladribine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred nine patients with HCL who were treated with cladribine had at least 7 years of follow-up. A course of cladribine constituted a 7-day continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/d. RESULTS: Of the 207 assessable patients who had at least 7 years of follow-up, 196 (95%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 11 (5%) achieved a partial response (PR) after a single course of cladribine (overall response rate, 100%). The median first-response duration for all responders was 98 months. Seventy-six patients (37%) experienced relapse after their first course of cladribine. The median time to first relapse for all responders was 42 months. Time to treatment failure of CRs compared with PRs was statistically significant (P <.0005). The overall survival rate was 97% recorded at 108 months. Forty-seven patients developed 58 second malignancies. The observed-to-expected ratio for second malignancies was 2.03 (95% confidence interval, 1.49 to 2.71). CONCLUSION: These results confirm previous observations that single courses of cladribine administered to patients with HCL induce high response rates, the majority of which are CRs. Most patients enjoy long-lasting complete remissions, and those patients who experience relapse can be successfully re-treated with cladribine.","['Goodman, Grant R', 'Burian, Carol', 'Koziol, James A', 'Saven, Alan']","['Goodman GR', 'Burian C', 'Koziol JA', 'Saven A']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA. saven.alan@scrippshealth.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Splenectomy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/03/29 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.05.093 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Mar 1;21(5):891-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.05.093.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of the French FRALLE-93 and LALA-94 trials.,774-80,"PURPOSE: To compare pediatric and adult therapeutic practices in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adolescents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 1993 to September 1994, 77 and 100 adolescents (15 to 20 years of age) were enrolled in the pediatric FRALLE-93 and adult LALA-94 protocols, respectively. Among the different prognostic factors, we retrospectively analyzed the effect of the trial on achieving complete remission (CR) and event-free survival (EFS). RESULTS: Patients were younger in the FRALLE-93 than in the LALA-94 protocol (median age, 15.9 v 17.9 years, respectively), but other characteristics were similar, including median WBC count (18 x 10(9) cells/L v 16 x 10(9) cells/L), B/T-lineage (54 of 23 v 72 of 28 patients), CD10-negative ALL (13% v 15%), and poor-risk cytogenetics (t(9;22), t(4;11), or hypodiploidy less than 45 chromosomes: 6% v 5%). The CR rate depended on WBC count (P =.005) and trial (94% v 83% in FRALLE-93 and LALA-94, respectively; P =.04). Univariate analysis showed that unfavorable prognostic factors for EFS were as follows: the trial (estimated 5-year EFS, 67% v 41% for FRALLE-93 and LALA-94, respectively; P <.0001), an increasing WBC count (P <.0001), poor-risk cytogenetics (P =.005), and T-lineage (P =.01). The trial and WBC count remained significant parameters for EFS in multivariate analysis (P <.0001 and P =.0004). Lineage subgroup analysis showed an advantage for the FRALLE-93 trial for CR achievement (98% v 81%; P =.002) and EFS (P =.0002) in B-lineage ALL and for EFS (P =.05) in T-lineage ALL. Age was not a significant prognostic factor in this population of adolescents. CONCLUSION: This study's findings indicate that adolescents should be included in intensive pediatric protocols and that new trials should be designed, inspired by pediatric protocols, for the treatment of young adults with ALL.","['Boissel, Nicolas', 'Auclerc, Marie-Francoise', 'Lheritier, Veronique', 'Perel, Yves', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Gabert, Jean', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Piguet, Christophe', 'Huguet-Rigal, Francoise', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Boiron, Jean-Michel', 'Pautas, Cecile', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Fiere, Denis', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Baruchel, Andre']","['Boissel N', 'Auclerc MF', 'Lheritier V', 'Perel Y', 'Thomas X', 'Leblanc T', 'Rousselot P', 'Cayuela JM', 'Gabert J', 'Fegueux N', 'Piguet C', 'Huguet-Rigal F', 'Berthou C', 'Boiron JM', 'Pautas C', 'Michel G', 'Fiere D', 'Leverger G', 'Dombret H', 'Baruchel A']","[""Services d'Hematologie Pediatrique et Adulte, Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comment', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Lineage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'France', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neprilysin/metabolism', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/03/29 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.02.053 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.02.053 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Mar 1;21(5):774-80. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.02.053.

Previous indirect-immunofluorescence studies observed that the HSV-1 transcriptional regulator ICP4 has a mainly diffuse nuclear distribution early in infection and is later recruited into viral replication compartments. We have constructed HSV-1 variants expressing ICP4 and ICP0 linked to ECFP and EYFP, respectively, both singly and in combination. Coupled with an efficient method of expressing autofluorescent PML in ND10, we have studied the dynamics of ICP0, ICP4, and ND10 in live, infected cells. The greater sensitivity and lower background signals in live cells revealed that early in infection, ICP4 forms discrete foci, some of which are juxtaposed to ND10, while ICP0 was found to colocalize precisely with PML. As expected from these results, using a double-labeled virus, we observed that foci of ICP0 and ICP4 were also juxtaposed but not colocalized early in infection. Some of the ICP4 foci must have contained parental viral genomes, because they developed into replication compartments. We propose that a proportion of the ND10-associated ICP4 foci represent ICP4 molecules being recruited onto parental viral genomes, a process likely to be a critical step early in lytic infection. These results may be analogous to the localization of IE1 and IE2 during human cytomegalovirus infection, suggesting a principle common to the alpha- and betaherpesviruses.","['Everett, Roger D', 'Sourvinos, George', 'Orr, Anne']","['Everett RD', 'Sourvinos G', 'Orr A']","['MRC Virology Unit, Glasgow G11 5JR, Scotland, United Kingdom. r.everett@vir.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus Structures', 'DNA Replication', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Virus Replication']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.6.3680-3689.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Mar;77(6):3680-9. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.6.3680-3689.2003.,,,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (herpes simplex virus, type 1 protein ICP4)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",,,,,,,PMC149519,,,,,,,,

The murine mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) viruses with this property have acquired characteristic changes in the N-terminal domain of their envelope glycoprotein that specify binding to a different receptor than the parental ecotropic virus. In this report, we show that MCF virus infection occurs through binding to this receptor (termed Syg1) and, remarkably, by a second mechanism that does not utilize the Syg1 receptor. By the latter route, the N-terminal domain of the ecotropic virus glycoprotein expressed on the cell surface in a complex with its receptor activates the fusion mechanism of the MCF virus in trans. The rate of MCF virus spread through a population of permissive human cells was increased by establishment of trans activation, indicating that Syg1 receptor-dependent and -independent pathways function in parallel. Also, trans activation shortened the interval between initial infection and onset of cell-cell fusion associated with repeated infection of the same cell. Our findings indicate that pathogenic retrovirus infection may be initiated by virus binding to cell receptors or to the virus envelope glycoprotein of other viruses expressed on the cell surface. Also, they support a broader principle: that cooperative virus-virus interactions, as well as virus-host interactions, shape the composition and properties of the retrovirus quasispecies.","['Wensel, David L', 'Li, Weihua', 'Cunningham, James M']","['Wensel DL', 'Li W', 'Cunningham JM']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.6.3460-3469.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Mar;77(6):3460-9. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.6.3460-3469.2003.,,,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,PMC149514,,,,,,,,

To investigate this effect further, we examined the budding of other retroviruses from proteasome inhibitor-treated cells. The viruses tested differed in their Gag organization, late (L) domain usage, or assembly site from those previously examined. We found that proteasome inhibition decreased the budding of murine leukemia virus (plasma membrane assembly, PPPY L domain) and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (cytoplasmic assembly, PPPY L domain), similar to the reduction observed for HIV-1. Thus, proteasome inhibitors can affect the budding of a virus that assembles within the cytoplasm. However, the budding of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV; cytoplasmic assembly, unknown L domain) was unaffected by proteasome inhibitors, similar to the proteasome-independent budding previously observed for equine infectious anemia virus (plasma membrane assembly, YPDL L domain). Examination of MMTV particles detected Gag-ubiquitin conjugates, demonstrating that an interaction with the ubiquitination system occurs during assembly, as previously found for other retroviruses. For all of the cell lines tested, the inhibitor treatment effectively inactivated proteasomes, as measured by the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitination system was also inhibited, as evidenced by the loss of monoubiquitinated histones from treated cells. These results and those from other viruses show that proteasome inhibitors reduce the budding of viruses that utilize either a PPPY- or PTAP-based L domain and that this effect does not depend on the assembly site or the presence of monoubiquitinated Gag in the virion.","['Ott, David E', 'Coren, Lori V', 'Sowder, Raymond C 2nd', 'Adams, Julian', 'Schubert, Ulrich']","['Ott DE', 'Coren LV', 'Sowder RC 2nd', 'Adams J', 'Schubert U']","['AIDS Vaccine Program, SAIC-Frederick, Inc., National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA. ott@ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/physiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Retroviridae/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.6.3384-3393.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Mar;77(6):3384-93. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.6.3384-3393.2003.,,,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,"['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC149504,,,,,,,,

We used sympathetic neurons and SK-N-BE(2)M17 neuroblastoma cells to investigate CDF down-regulation of the norepinephrine synthetic enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). LIF and CNTF activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 but not p38 or Jun N-terminal kinases in both cell types. Preventing ERK activation with PD98059 blocked CNTF suppression of DBH protein in sympathetic neurons but did not prevent the loss of DBH mRNA. CNTF decreased transcription of a DBH promoter-luciferase reporter construct in SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells, and this was also ERK-independent. Cytokine inhibition of DBH promoter activity did not require a silencer element but was prevented by overexpression of the transcriptional activator Phox2a. Inhibiting ERK activation increased basal DBH transcription in SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells, and DBH mRNA in sympathetic neurons. Transfection of Phox2a into PD98059-treated M17 cells resulted in a synergistic increase in DBH promoter activity compared with Phox2a or PD98059 alone. These data suggest that CDFs down-regulate DBH protein via an ERK-dependent pathway but inhibit DBH gene expression through an ERK-independent pathway. They further suggest that ERK activity inhibits basal DBH gene expression.","['Dziennis, Suzan', 'Habecker, Beth A']","['Dziennis S', 'Habecker BA']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Oregon Health & Science University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*pharmacology', 'Dopamine beta-Hydroxylase/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Neuroblastoma/enzymology/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/06/18 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M212480200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)58275-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 May 2;278(18):15897-904. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M212480200.

We have previously generated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines resistant to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI571), and one line (LAMA84-r) showed overexpression not only of the Bcr-Abl protein but also of Pgp. In the present study, we investigated this phenomenon in other cell lines overexpressing exclusively Pgp. Thus, cells from the K562/DOX line, described as resistant to doxorubicin due to MDR1 gene overexpression, grew continuously in the presence of 1 microM imatinib, but died in 4 to 5 days if the Pgp pump modulators verapamil or PSC833 were added to the imatinib-treated culture. Analysis of cell proliferation by the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium) assay confirmed the differential sensitivity of K562/DOX to imatinib, which was also reversed by verapamil or PSC833. Flow cytometric analysis of the total phosphotyrosine content by intracytoplasmic staining after a 2-hour incubation with escalating doses of imatinib showed that the inhibitory concentrations of 50% (IC(50)) for inhibition of cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation were 15, 10, and 5 microM for K562/DOX, K562/DOX plus verapamil, and K562, respectively. Retroviral-mediated transfection of the BCR-ABL(+) AR230 cell line with the MDR1 gene decreased its sensitivity to imatinib, an effect that was also reversed by verapamil. The possible role of MDR overexpression in clinical resistance to imatinib remains to be defined. We therefore confirm that imatinib should be added to the extensive list of drugs that can be affected by the MDR phenomenon.","['Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Belloc, Francis', 'Lagarde, Valerie', 'Chollet, Claudine', 'Moreau-Gaudry, Francois', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Goldman, John M', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Mahon FX', 'Belloc F', 'Lagarde V', 'Chollet C', 'Moreau-Gaudry F', 'Reiffers J', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Laboratoire Greffe de Moelle, Universite Victor Segalen, Bordeaux, France. francois-xavier.mahon@umr5540.u-bordeaux2.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, MDR/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphotyrosine/analysis', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/04/08 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.V101.6.2368 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)57358-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Mar 15;101(6):2368-73. doi: 10.1182/blood.V101.6.2368.,,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",,,['Blood. 2003 Aug 1;102(3):1142.

We previously reported that GATA-1 and ETS-1 regulate the rat PF4 promoter and transactivate the PF4 gene. For the present study, we investigated the regulatory elements and their transcription factors responsible for the lineage-specific expression of the PF4 gene. The promoter activities of deletion constructs were evaluated, and a novel regulatory element termed TME (tandem repeat of MEIS1 binding element) (-219 to -182) was defined. Binding proteins to TME were strongly detected in HEL nuclear extracts by electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA), and they were purified by DNA affinity chromatography. By performing Western blottings and supershift assays, the binding proteins were identified as homeodomain proteins, MEIS1, PBX1B, and PBX2. These factors are expressed in megakaryocytes differentiated from CD34+ cells in human cord blood. MEIS1 and PBXs bind to the TME as MEIS1/PBX complexes and activate the PF4 promoter. In nonmegakaryocytic HepG2 cells, GATA-1 and ETS-1 activate the PF4 promoter approximately 10-fold. Surprisingly, we found that additional expression of both MEIS1 and PBX2 multiplied this major activation another 2-fold. This activation was not observed when MEIS1 binding sites in the TME were disrupted. Furthermore, inhibition of the binding of endogenous MEIS1/PBX complexes to the TME decreased the promoter activity by almost one half, in megakaryocytic HEL cells. Thus, these studies demonstrate that the homeodomain proteins, MEIS1, PBX1B, and PBX2, play an important role in megakaryocytic gene expression.","['Okada, Yoshiaki', 'Nagai, Ryohei', 'Sato, Takahiro', 'Matsuura, Eri', 'Minami, Takashi', 'Morita, Ikuo', 'Doi, Takefumi']","['Okada Y', 'Nagai R', 'Sato T', 'Matsuura E', 'Minami T', 'Morita I', 'Doi T']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, 1-6 Yamadaoka, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Platelet Factor 4/*genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/03/01 04:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-02-0380 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50635-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 15;101(12):4748-56. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-02-0380.

Despite its potent apoptotic mechanism, As(2)O(3) is not equally effective in all leukemic cells, which has prompted a search for agents enhancing As(2)O(3) efficacy. Recently, evidence has been gathered that the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may sensitize tumor cells to ROS-inducing anticancer agents. The aim of our investigation was to evaluate whether DHA enhances As(2)O(3)-mediated apoptosis in As(2)O(3)-resistant HL-60 cells. While 1 microM As(2)O(3) or 25 microM DHA reduced cell viability to 85.8% +/- 2.9% and 69.2% +/- 3.6%, combined treatment with As(2)O(3) and DHA reduced viability to 13.0% +/- 9.9% with a concomitant increase of apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death was preceded by collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased expression of proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma protein-2-associated X protein (Bax), and caspase-3 activation. Importantly, the combined effect of As(2)O(3) and DHA was associated with increased production of intracellular ROS and toxic lipid peroxidation products and was abolished by the antioxidant vitamin E or when oleic acid (a nonperoxidizable fatty acid) was used in place of DHA. Intracellular ROS and toxic lipid peroxidation products most likely constitute the key mediators contributing to the combined effect of As(2)O(3) and DHA. Our data provide the first evidence that DHA may help to extend the therapeutic spectrum of As(2)O(3) and suggest that the combination of As(2)O(3) and DHA could be more broadly applied in leukemia therapy.","['Sturlan, Sanda', 'Baumgartner, Melanie', 'Roth, Erich', 'Bachleitner-Hofmann, Thomas']","['Sturlan S', 'Baumgartner M', 'Roth E', 'Bachleitner-Hofmann T']","['Surgical Research Laboratories, Department of Surgery, University Hospital Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/ultrastructure', 'Oleic Acid/pharmacology', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2003/03/01 04:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2391 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50669-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 15;101(12):4990-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2391.

In this report, we demonstrate that the more distal of the 2 promoters for the LMO2 gene is highly restricted in its pattern of expression, directing the hematopoietic-specific expression of this gene. Deletion and mutation analyses have identified a critical cis element in the first untranslated exon of the gene. This element is a consensus-binding site for a small family of basic leucine zipper proteins containing a proline and acidic amino acid-rich (PAR) domain. Although all 3 members of this family are produced in erythroid cells, only 2 of these proteins, thyrotroph embryonic factor and hepatic leukemia factor, can activate transcription from this LMO2 promoter element.

Following sensitization with IgE from a subset of allergic human donors, these cells can be triggered by exposure to anti-IgE or to very low concentrations of specific allergens. We examined 18 sera from patients who were highly sensitive to peanuts by history and had anti-peanut IgE by in vitro testing. The ability of these sera to sensitize the RBL SX-38 cells for degranulation with peanut allergens correlates very well with the absolute amount of anti-peanut IgE (r=0.95; p<0.001). The most effective sera contained at least 50 kU/l of total IgE and at least 15 kU/l of peanut-specific IgE. RBL SX-38 cells sensitized with these sera degranulated optimally upon exposure to anti-IgE (net degranulation of 40+/-8%, means+/-S.D.; n=8) and to a 10(5)-10(6) dilution of crude peanut extract (CPE) (37+/-7% net degranulation; 93+/-13% of that seen with anti-IgE). This assay is quite sensitive. Cells sensitized with selected sera are activated by exposure to a 1:10(7) dilution of the CPE containing picogram amounts of peanut allergens. This assay is also quite specific. Cells sensitized with sera from patients with anti-peanut IgE and no detectable IgE against soybean, walnut or grass pollen did not degranulate following exposure to these latter antigens. The converse was also true; cells sensitized with sera from patients without anti-peanut IgE did not react to peanut. These data demonstrate that RBL cells expressing human Fc epsilon RI form the basis of a useful model system for the detection of allergens and for the study of IgE-allergen interactions.","['Dibbern, Donald A Jr', 'Palmer, G William', 'Williams, P Brock', 'Bock, S Allan', 'Dreskin, Stephen C']","['Dibbern DA Jr', 'Palmer GW', 'Williams PB', 'Bock SA', 'Dreskin SC']","['Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Medical School Building, Room 4627, 4200 East 9th Avenue, Denver, CO 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,"['Adult', 'Allergens/*immunology', 'Arachis/*immunology', '*Cell Degranulation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood/*immunology', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Infant', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Peanut Hypersensitivity/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/04/10 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0022175902003691 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(02)00369-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2003 Mar 1;274(1-2):37-45. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(02)00369-1.,,,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cytokines have direct effects on testicular cell functions, and a number of these are produced within the testis even in the absence of inflammation or immune activation events. There is compelling evidence that cytokines, in fact, play an important regulatory role in the development and normal function of the testis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 have direct effects on spermatogenic cell differentiation and testicular steroidogenesis. Stem cell factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor, cytokines normally involved in haematopoiesis, also play a role in spermatogenesis. Anti-inflammatory cytokines of the transforming growth factor-beta family are implicated in testicular development. Consequently, local or systemic up-regulation of cytokine expression during injury, illness or infection may contribute to the disruption of testicular function and fertility that frequently accompanies these conditions. The aim of this review is to provide a very brief summary of the extensive literature dealing with cytokines in testicular biology, and to follow this with some speculation concerning the significance of these molecules in interactions between the immune system and the testis.","['Hedger, Mark P', 'Meinhardt, Andreas']","['Hedger MP', 'Meinhardt A']","['Monash Institute of Reproduction and Development, Monash University, 27-31 Wright Street, Clayton, Melbourne, Victoria 3168, Australia. mark.hedger@med.monash.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,J Reprod Immunol,Journal of reproductive immunology,8001906,IM,"['Animals', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/immunology', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Growth Inhibitors/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Interferons/immunology', 'Interleukin-1/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/immunology', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Spermatogenesis/immunology', 'Stem Cell Factor/immunology', 'Testis/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/10/31 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0165037802000608 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-0378(02)00060-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Reprod Immunol. 2003 Feb;58(1):1-26. doi: 10.1016/s0165-0378(02)00060-8.,,154,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: By injecting tumor cells (Walker256 rat carcinosarcoma) through the iliac artery (experimental group) and the tail vein (control group), animal models of blood-borne metastases were established. The quadriceps femoris muscle and lungs were observed grossly and microscopically. Immunohistochemistry was applied to investigate the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in the microvascular endothelium of these organs. Primary culture of rat skeletal muscle cells was established and conditioned medium (MCM) was collected. Effects of MCM on several tumor cell lines and the biochemical characteristics of skeletal muscle delivered tumor factor(s) were tested by MTT assay. Apoptosis and morphological examination were carried out to investigate the antitumor mechanisms of MCM. RESULTS: In the experimental group, there were no definite metastases observed in muscle cells. In the control group, lung metastases were present in the lungs of all rats that were sacrificed at the 14th day or died spontaneously (17 rats in all). There was no significant difference between the increase in VCAM-1 in quadriceps femoris muscle 7 days after iliac artery injection and that in lungs 7 days after tail vein injection (P > 0.05). In vitro studies showed that the proliferation of tumor cell lines of mouse SP2/0 myeloma, rat Walker256 carcinosarcoma or human chronic granulocytic leukemia K562, human acute lymphatic leukemia HL-60, LS-174-T colon adenocarcinoma, PC3-M prostatic carcinoma and lung giant cell carcinoma with different metastatic potency (PLA801-C with low metastatic potency, PLA801-D with high metastatic potency) was significantly inhibited when cultured with MCM (P < 0.01 - 0.05). Proliferation of malignant cells showed a dose-dependent decrease, to a certain degree. Proliferation of normal rabbit joint epiphysial disk cells (RGP-2) were not affected by MCM. Proliferation of lung giant cell carcinoma cells with high metastatic potency showed a significant decrease even when cultured in highly diluted MCM (6.25% of primary MCM), when compared with the strain of low metastatic potency. Following ultrafiltration, boiling at 100 degrees C, and treatment with trypsin, skeletal muscle delivered tumor factor(s) were found to be a low molecular weight (MW <or= 10.0 KDa) component which was trypsin resistant but not heat resistant. The factor(s) did not induce apoptosis in K562 cells but caused direct destruction of the cytoplasmic membrane. CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of metastases in skeletal muscles, generally accepted in the clinical setting, can be reproduced in an animal model. It does not seem to be related to VCAM-1 expression in the microvessels of these organs. Skeletal muscle delivered factor(s) play a key role in the mechanism of the rarity of metastases in skeletal muscle.","['Luo, Chenghua', 'Jiang, Yanyong', 'Liu, Yongxue', 'Li, Xianghong']","['Luo C', 'Jiang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Li X']","['Department of General Surgery, 301 Hospital, Beijing 100853, China. chenghua-L@301hospital.com.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Muscle Neoplasms/pathology/*secondary', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2002 Nov;115(11):1645-9.,,,['0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of gonadal dysfunction in prepubertal children has been hampered by the absence of a sensitive marker. Inhibin B is secreted by small antral follicles and Sertoli cells in females and males, respectively, and may be a marker of gonadal function in prepubertal children. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate inhibin B in relation to sensitive measurements of gonadotrophins as markers of the early gonadotoxic effects of chemotherapy in prepubertal children treated for cancer. STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Twenty-five prepubertal children (9 females), median age 4.5 years (range 1.2-12.8 years) with cancer (16 solid tumours, nine acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, ALL) were studied longitudinally. Blood samples were collected before and during chemotherapy (solid tumours) or immediately following induction and first intensification (ALL). Post-treatment (1-6 months) samples were collected in 12 of the patients (5 females). MEASUREMENTS: Dimeric inhibin B was measured by double antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). FSH and LH were measured by sensitive time-resolved immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Girls: Pretreatment inhibin B was slightly high in one girl but normal for age and sex in all others: median 16.1 (range 9.4-186.2) ng/l, median SD score +0.2 (-1.3 to +2.6). Inhibin B decreased to undetectable levels (< 8 ng/l) in 8/9 girls during treatment (P = 0.03), with no accompanying rise in FSH or LH. Post-treatment recovery of inhibin B was variable: median 16.1 (range < 8.0-44.2) ng/l, median SD score +0.1 (range < -2.4 to +1.8). Sustained undetectable inhibin B levels were observed in 2/5 girls with correspondingly elevated FSH concentrations (11.8 and 10.9 U/l). Boys: Inhibin B was normal for age and sex in all boys before treatment with no significant change during or after treatment (medians 93 ng/l, 85 ng/l and 94 ng/l, SD scores -0.3, -0.6 and -0.2, respectively). Inhibin B decreased to undetectable levels in one boy post-treatment with no accompanying increase in FSH or LH. CONCLUSIONS: In prepubertal girls with cancer, chemotherapy is associated with suppression of inhibin B, usually transient, which may indicate arrest of follicle development. Sustained suppression of inhibin B following treatment may be indicative of permanent ovarian damage. In prepubertal boys, chemotherapy had little immediate effect on Sertoli cell production of inhibin B, although one boy showed a delayed effect. Inhibin B, together with sensitive measurements of FSH, may be a potential marker of the gonadotoxic effects of chemotherapy in prepubertal children with cancer.","['Crofton, P M', 'Thomson, A B', 'Evans, A E M', 'Groome, N P', 'Bath, L E', 'Kelnar, C J H', 'Wallace, W H B']","['Crofton PM', 'Thomson AB', 'Evans AE', 'Groome NP', 'Bath LE', 'Kelnar CJ', 'Wallace WH']","['Section of Child Life and Health, Department of Reproductive and Developmental Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK. patricia.crofton@luht.scot.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inhibins/*blood', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy', 'Ovarian Follicle/*drug effects', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy', 'Sertoli Cells/*drug effects', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Time Factors']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/05/31 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['1712 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2265.2003.01712.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2003 Mar;58(3):296-301. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2265.2003.01712.x.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (inhibin B)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, monoclonal rearrangement of HTLV-I proviral DNA was detected from the lymph node by Southern blot analysis. Taken together, we diagnosed the patient as having ATL (lymphoma type). His condition has improved well with systemic chemotherapy. We report a rare case of lymphoma type ATL with initial massive cardiac involvement, although ATL cells sometimes involve the heart at the end of the disease course.","['Toyama, Takanori', 'Kubuki, Yoko', 'Okamoto, Masashi', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Ishizaki, Jyunichi', 'Tsubouchi, Hirohito']","['Toyama T', 'Kubuki Y', 'Okamoto M', 'Hidaka T', 'Ishizaki J', 'Tsubouchi H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,"['Heart Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2003/03/01 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2003/03/01 04:00'],"['2003/03/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2002 Dec;43(12):1055-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Type 1 (T1) T-cell cytokines play a major role in this antileukemic immune effect. Studies in cancer patients have demonstrated a decreased T1 cytokine production, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This observation of malignancy-related suppressed T1 cytokines also occurs in untreated chronic-phase (CP) CML, raising the question of the influence of different CML treatment regimens on this immunosuppression. Intracellular flow cytometry (ICF) has facilitated the evaluation of cytokines on a single-cell level. This study analyzed T1 (interferon-gamma) cytokine production in purified peripheral blood T cells by ICF, comparing different therapy approaches for CML. Twenty-one newly diagnosed CP CML patients were compared with 24 patients treated with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and to 30 allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients (BCR-ABL negative by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and free of, or having only limited graft-versus-host disease at the time of study). Thirty-seven healthy controls were included. Our results showed a significantly decreased T-cell IFN-gamma synthesis in CP CML patients in relation to healthy controls (P = 0.0007). Treatment with IFN-alpha resulted in a shift from immunosuppression--documented for the group of untreated patients--to immunopotentiation, with an increase of T-cell IFN-gamma production (P = 0.0266). Notably, BMT enhanced IFN-gamma production of T cells to a level not only exceeding untreated patients (P < 0.0001) but also healthy volunteers (P < 0.0001). The observation of T1 cytokine up-regulation with IFN-alpha therapy indicates that enhanced T-cell function may be achievable in patients with CML, even in the absence of an allo-response.","['Aswald, Jorg M', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Messner, Hans A']","['Aswald JM', 'Lipton JH', 'Messner HA']","['Department of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology), Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. jaswald@uhnres.utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther,"Cytokines, cellular & molecular therapy",9713367,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD3 Complex/biosynthesis', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interferon-alpha/blood', 'Interferon-gamma/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2003/02/28 04:00,2003/08/16 05:00,['2003/02/28 04:00'],"['2003/02/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/13684730412331302063 [doi]', 'E5NXK4GMNK2MWB2W [pii]']",ppublish,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther. 2002 Dec;7(2):75-82. doi: 10.1080/13684730412331302063.,,,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment of perforation, respiratory fistula, and necrosis due to transmural esophageal infection is guided by anecdote. We wish to determine treatment and outcome of local complications of necrotizing esophagitis. METHODS: We report our experience over a 7-year period and review published reports since 1976. We treated 4 patients and found 21 reported patients with perforation (11/25), fistula (8/25), and necrosis (6/25) at a mean age of 35 years. Twenty-one patients were immunodeficient (84%) due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in 8, acute leukemia in 6, renal transplant in 3, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and corticosteroids in 1 each. Pathogenic organisms were fungal in 15 cases, viral in 7, and bacterial in 7. RESULTS: Treatment consisted of antibiotic therapy in 13 patients and surgical intervention combined with antibiotic therapy in 12: esophagectomy in 6, esophageal stenting and drainage in 2, drainage alone in 2, and salivary diversion in 2. Overall mortality was 48% (12/25). Mortality without surgical intervention was 90% (9/10) and with surgical intervention 27% (3/11). One of 6 patients undergoing esophagectomy (17%) died. The difference in mortality was due to sepsis, which was the cause of death in 8 patients treated with medical intervention and only 1 treated with surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Local complications of necrotizing esophagitis have a high mortality due to sepsis. Surgical intervention, in particular esophagectomy, controls sepsis in published case reports and should be considered in selected patients. Further study is required to determine the true prevalence of these complications and the outcome of intervention.","['Gaissert, Henning A', 'Roper, Charles L', 'Patterson, G Alexander', 'Grillo, Hermes C']","['Gaissert HA', 'Roper CL', 'Patterson GA', 'Grillo HC']","['Thoracic Surgical Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. hgaissert@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Ann Thorac Surg,The Annals of thoracic surgery,15030100R,IM,"['Adult', 'Esophageal Fistula/etiology', 'Esophageal Perforation/etiology', 'Esophagitis/complications/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Esophagus/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Necrosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/02/28 04:00,2003/03/18 04:00,['2003/02/28 04:00'],"['2003/02/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-4975(02)04343-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0003-4975(02)04343-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Thorac Surg. 2003 Feb;75(2):342-7. doi: 10.1016/s0003-4975(02)04343-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to the pivotal role of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in these responses, we tested the hypothesis that adenosine mediates its effects through suppression of NF-kappaB activation. We investigated the effects of adenosine on NF-kappaB activation induced by various inflammatory agents in human myeloid KBM-5 cells. The treatment of these cells with adenosine suppressed TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation, but had no effect on activation of another redox-sensitive transcription factor, AP-1. These effects were not restricted to myeloid cells, as NF-kappaB activation in other lymphocytic and epithelial cell types was also inhibited. The effect on TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation was selective as adenosine had minimal effect on NF-kappaB activation induced by H(2)O(2), PMA, LPS, okadaic acid, or ceramide, suggesting differences in the pathway leading to NF-kappaB activation by different agents. Adenosine also suppressed NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression activated by TNF or by overexpression of TNFR1, TRAF 2, NIK, and p65 subunit of NF-kappaB. The suppression of TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation by adenosine was found not to be because of inhibition of TNF-induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation or IkappaBalpha kinase activation. The suppression of TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation was unique to adenosine, as neither its metabolites (inosine, AMP, and ATP) nor pyrimidines (thymidine and uridine) had any effect. Overall, our results clearly demonstrate that adenosine selectively suppresses TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation, which may contribute to its role in suppression of inflammation and of the immune system.","['Majumdar, Sekhar', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Majumdar S', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adenosine/*pharmacology', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ceramides/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'I-kappa B Proteins/physiology', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Kidney/cytology/embryology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Uridine/pharmacology']",2003/02/28 04:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['2003/02/28 04:00'],"['2003/02/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206184 [doi]', '1206184 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Feb 27;22(8):1206-18. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206184.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates the regulation and expression of Mcl-1 in human melanoma cells, which was recently found to be induced by betulinic acid, a compound with anti-melanoma and apoptosis-inducing potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mcl-1 phosphorthioate antisense oligonucleotides were used to investigate the effect of downregulating the expression of Mcl-1. Regulation of Mcl-1 expression was analyzed with the specific PI3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin and the inhibitor of MAP-kinase activation, PD98059. Western blot analysis was performed with anti ERK1/2, Mcl-1, Bak, Bcl-x and Bax antibodies. Activation status of PI-3 kinase and MAP-kinase pathways was investigated using phospho-Akt and phosphorylation-state independent Akt as well as phospho-MAP kinase, phospho-MEK and phospho-GSK-3alpha/beta antibodies. RESULTS: Upregulation of Mcl-1 in human melanoma cells by betulinic acid is mediated via a signal-transduction pathway that is inhibited by LY294002 and wortmannin. Betulinic acid-induced phosphorylation and activation of the Akt protein kinase was inhibited by LY294002. The inhibitor PD98059 reduced expression levels of Mcl-1 in melanoma cells and this effect was counteracted by betulinic acid. Downregulation of Mcl-1 by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides in combination with betulinic treatment led to a synergistic effect regarding growth inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in human melanoma cells Mcl-1 is (i) of functional relevance for survival and (ii) subject to dual regulation by the MAP- kinase pathway and a pathway involving protein kinase B/Akt, the latter of which is modulated in response to betulinic acid. This study provides an experimental foundation for future therapeutic strategies using anti-Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides in human melanoma.","['Selzer, Edgar', 'Thallinger, Christiane', 'Hoeller, Christoph', 'Oberkleiner, Philipp', 'Wacheck, Volker', 'Pehamberger, Hubert', 'Jansen, Burkhard']","['Selzer E', 'Thallinger C', 'Hoeller C', 'Oberkleiner P', 'Wacheck V', 'Pehamberger H', 'Jansen B']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Section of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Pharmacology, University Hospital Vienna, Austria.

A switch in integrin expression occurs during this differentiation and is accompanied by changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Alteration of EVT behavior is also modulated by cytokines. To investigate the molecular interactions involved in the EVT differentiation, we examined the effects of cytokines and ECM on the human EVT cell line, TCL1 cells. We found that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) induced apoptosis in TCL1 cells but not in JEG3 cells derived from choriocarcinoma while the addition of interleukin-1beta, leukemia inhibitory factor, or transforming growth factor had no effect on TCL1 cells. This apoptosis was suppressed when TCL1 cells were seeded on fibronectin (Fn), collagen type I (C1), collagen type IV (C4), or laminin (Ln). Wortmannin, a specific PI3 kinase inhibitor, inhibited this suppression. Spreading assays and adhesion blocking assays indicated that TCL1 cells express integrin-alpha5 and -alpha6 and beta1 and beta4 subunits. Adhesion on Fn is mediated by alpha5beta1, and adhesion on C1, C4, or Ln is mediated by alpha6beta1 integrins. TNFalpha suppressed alpha6 integrin expression and enhanced alpha1 integrin expression in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, aggregation of beta1 subunits on C4 was detected after addition of TNFalpha. Taken together, these results suggest that TNFalpha and ECM, through activation of PI3 kinase mediated by beta1 integrin signaling, might collaboratively regulate differentiation of trophoblast cells through integrin signaling in establishing and maintaining successful pregnancy.","['Fukushima, Kotaro', 'Miyamoto, Shingo', 'Komatsu, Hajime', 'Tsukimori, Kiyomi', 'Kobayashi, Hiroaki', 'Seki, Hiroyuki', 'Takeda, Satoru', 'Nakano, Hitoo']","['Fukushima K', 'Miyamoto S', 'Komatsu H', 'Tsukimori K', 'Kobayashi H', 'Seki H', 'Takeda S', 'Nakano H']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Extracellular Matrix/physiology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Integrins/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Trophoblasts/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2003/02/28 04:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2003/02/28 04:00'],"['2003/02/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1095/biolreprod.102.010314 [doi]', 'biolreprod.102.010314 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2003 May;68(5):1771-8. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.102.010314.

In the present study, FAS expression was examined in primary leukemic cells from infants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The cells were resistant to apoptosis induction by an anti-FAS antibody and expressed nearly undetectable amounts of FAS protein. Molecular analysis of FAS transcripts in these cells revealed no detectable expression of full-length Fas mRNA after a single round of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification (RT-PCR). However, a more sensitive nested RT-PCR analysis revealed alternatively spliced Fas transcripts in three of five infants (60%) with the remaining two infants showing no detectable Fas mRNA expression. The primary sequence variation of Fas mRNA seen in the samples was a previously described variant lacking exon 6 encoding soluble FAS. However, we also detected the presence of several novel alternatively spliced FAS transcripts in the ALL cells. In one patient, we observed a novel spliced form of soluble Fas, which not only lacked exon 6 but also contained an insertion of an alternative exon 7 (exon 7B). In another, a novel exon 4Del FAS mRNA variant was observed, which contained an additional 4-bp deletion at the exon 5/6-splice junction. These variants lack intact transmembrane domains and thus are predicted to encode soluble FAS variants. The low level of expression of functional full length FAS transcripts with corresponding low level of FAS protein expression in the ALL cells contribute to their resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis.","['Wood, Carla M', 'Goodman, Patricia A', 'Vassilev, Alexei O', 'Uckun, Fatih M']","['Wood CM', 'Goodman PA', 'Vassilev AO', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Parker Hughes Institute, St Paul, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Solubility', 'fas Receptor/analysis/*genetics']",2003/02/28 04:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/02/28 04:00'],"['2003/02/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['024 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00024.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2003 Mar;70(3):156-71. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00024.x.,,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virtually all cells expressed muscle-specific proteins. Proliferation of satellite cells increased as the concentration of fetal calf serum (FCS) was increased from 1 to 10% of the basal medium. The addition of mitogenic growth factors resulted in greater proliferation than that of cells cultured in basal medium alone. Maximum proliferation was obtained when fibroblast growth factor-basic (FGF2) was added to the medium, but differences existed between sources or types. Proliferation did not plateau when the concentration of recombinant human FGF2 was 75 ng/ml but reached maximum levels when 50 ng/ml of bovine FGF2 or 10 ng/ml of growth hormone or insulin-like growth factor-1 were added to the medium. Proliferation of satellite cells decreased when more than 5 ng/ml of transforming growth factor-alpha was included in the medium. Exposure of canine satellite cells to chemically defined media induced greater fusion of total nuclei (ODM-34%; 4F, ITT-CF, and SFG-23%) than exposure to other treatments, such as basal medium plus 2 mg/ml of 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, 5% chick embryo extract, 1% horse serum (average 9% fused nuclei), or 1% FCS (2% fused nuclei).

Leukemic cells were classified according to the French-American-British classification. M4 AML cells from two patients produced some O(2) (-) upon stimulation with opsonized zymosan (OZ), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), but less than normal granulocytes or monocytes. M5b AML cells from one patient produced as much O(2) (-) in response to these stimulants as normal monocytes. No O(2) (-) generation was induced in other types of leukemic cells. Total SOD activity in AML cells was significantly greater in normal granulocytes, but was only half of the activity in ALL cells. Mn-SOD in AML cells was very low or undetectable. These results suggest that except in M5b cells, decreased O(2) (-) production may contribute to susceptibility to infections in AML patients. Decreased Mn-SOD activity in AML cells may predispose them to oxidative stress.","['Kato, Masahiko', 'Minakami, Hisanori', 'Kuroiwa, Minoru', 'Kobayashi, Yasuyuki', 'Oshima, Shigeru', 'Kozawa, Kunihisa', 'Morikawa, Akihiro', 'Kimura, Hirokazu']","['Kato M', 'Minakami H', 'Kuroiwa M', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Oshima S', 'Kozawa K', 'Morikawa A', 'Kimura H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Adult', 'Anions', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Leukocytes/enzymology/metabolism', 'Manganese/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/enzymology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate/pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/blood/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Zymosan/chemistry']",2003/02/28 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2003/02/28 04:00'],"['2003/02/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.699 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2003 Mar;21(1):11-6. doi: 10.1002/hon.699.,,,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '118877-07-9', '(2-methyl-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo(1,2-alpha)pyrazin-3-one)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,"['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and forty-five newly diagnosed ALL patients were treated by the HKALL 93 protocol. Patients were stratified into three risk groups according to age, presenting white cell count, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic study. The patients received the same induction and early and late intensification at week 5 and week 20. Fifty-eight standard risk (SR) patients received regular intrathecal methotrexate as CNS preventive therapy, while 49 intermediate risk (IR) patients received high dose intravenous methotrexate and regular intrathecal methotrexate. Thirty-eight high risk (HR) patients were treated with prophylactic cranial irradiation and an additional intensification block at week 35. The induction remission rate was 97.2% with 2% induction death. Two patients died during first complete remission. Relapse occurred in 20.7, 42.9 and 42.1% of SR, IR and HR patients respectively. By multivariate logistic regression, age> or =10 years and white cell count> or =100 x 10(9)/l were the two significant variables accounting for mortality. The 5-year overall and event-free survival of the whole group was 81.3 and 62.6% respectively. According to risk groups, the event-free survival was 79, 49 and 61% for SR, IR and HR patients respectively, while the overall survival was 96, 73 and 68% for SR, IR and HR patients respectively. In conclusion, the treatment protocol had low treatment-related mortality but was associated with a rather high relapse rate, especially in IR patients. Salvage therapy achieved sustained second remission in some patients. More intensive treatment especially a late intensification is required to improve the outcome.","['Li, C K', 'Chik, K W', 'Chan, G C F', 'Yuen, H L', 'Lee, A C W', 'Li, C Keung', 'Shing, M M K', 'Ha, S Y', 'Luk, C W', 'Ling, S C', 'Cheung, A Y K']","['Li CK', 'Chik KW', 'Chan GC', 'Yuen HL', 'Lee AC', 'Li CK', 'Shing MM', 'Ha SY', 'Luk CW', 'Ling SC', 'Cheung AY']","['Department of Paediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. ckli@cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Time Factors']",2003/02/28 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2003/02/28 04:00'],"['2003/02/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.698 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2003 Mar;21(1):1-9. doi: 10.1002/hon.698.,['Hong Kong Paediatric Haematology & Oncology Study Group'],,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],,"['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many patients are treated for long periods, and there is concern about the long-term immune effects of its use. Autoimmune disorders in patients treated with IFN-alpha may be related to the direct immunomodulating properties of IFN or may be linked to a possible toxic effect in target organs, triggering autoimmunity. On the other hand, the immune effects of IFN may play a role in its therapeutic actions. The aims of our study were to assess the incidence of autoimmune phenomena in these patients, and to measure the possible association between the generation of autoimmune phenomena and the antileukemic effect of IFN alpha. Therefore, 46 patients with Ph1(+) CML in the first chronic phase were studied for the appearance of immune complications, their connection to IFN dose, time of appearance, and the possible association with the response to treatment. Autoimmune abnormalities have been found in 28% of our patients. Moreover, a significant association was found between autoimmune alterations and female sex (P = 0.02, OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.13-17.9) and a longer treatment time (1.6 vs. 4.1 years) (P = 0.02; OR 1.01, 95% CI 1-1.02). The Kaplan-Meier estimated probability of obtaining a cytogenetic response was significantly higher in patients who developed autoimmune alterations (P = 0.049), and this difference was also evident in Cox's analysis when controlling with other potentially confounding variables (P = 0.078). We conclude that CML patients treated with IFN alpha have a high incidence of autoimmune phenomenon.","['Steegmann, J L', 'Requena, M J', 'Martin-Regueira, P', 'De La Camara, R', 'Casado, F', 'Salvanes, F Rodriguez', 'Fernandez Ranada, J M']","['Steegmann JL', 'Requena MJ', 'Martin-Regueira P', 'De La Camara R', 'Casado F', 'Salvanes FR', 'Fernandez Ranada JM']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain. fundsteeg@nexo.es']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Autoimmune Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Coombs Test', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Thyroiditis, Autoimmune/epidemiology/etiology', 'Time Factors']",2003/02/28 04:00,2003/03/22 04:00,['2003/02/28 04:00'],"['2003/02/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10282 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2003 Mar;72(3):170-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10282.,,,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify pathways in the pathogenesis of MCL and the blastoid variant (MLC-BV), we compared the gene-expression profiles of microdissected normal mantle cells, MCL, and MCL-BV by oligonucleotide microarrays and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (QRT-PCR). We identified and confirmed the overexpression of several genes in MCL-BV that are involved in the cell cycle control at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints or inhibit apoptotic cell death. The highly expressed cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is a cell cycle kinase that associates with cyclin D1 for the progression through the G1/S checkpoint, whereas overexpression of cdc28 protein kinase 1 (CKS1) blocks the inhibition of the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex by the CDK inhibitor p27/Kip1. Other highly expressed genes in MCL-BV that promote the cells through the G1/S-checkpoint include the oncogenes B-Myb, PIM1, and PIM2, and passage through the G2/M-checkpoint is enhanced by high levels of cdc25B. Furthermore, two highly expressed genes that inhibit apoptosis are defender against cell death (DAD1) and RSK1. In summary, our microarray and QRT-PCR analyses identified several candidate genes whose expression increased when comparing normal follicular mantles with MCL and MCLBV, suggesting a potential pathogenic role in the evolution of MCL-BV.","['de Vos, Sven', 'Krug, Utz', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Pinkus, Geraldine S', 'Swerdlow, Steven H', 'Wachsman, William', 'Grogan, Thomas M', 'Said, Jonathan W', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['de Vos S', 'Krug U', 'Hofmann WK', 'Pinkus GS', 'Swerdlow SH', 'Wachsman W', 'Grogan TM', 'Said JW', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90095-7059, USA. devos@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,IM,"['Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2003/02/27 04:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/02/27 04:00'],"['2003/02/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00019606-200303000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2003 Mar;12(1):35-43. doi: 10.1097/00019606-200303000-00005.,,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,"['U0ICA66533-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, these cells are also a potential target for viral integration in patients receiving somatic cell gene therapy. But the factors influencing retroviral transduction into spermatogonia are not well understood. Because retroviral transduction is affected in part by the proliferative status of the host cell, we developed an improved cell culture system in which spermatogonia survive and proliferate for several days. We used this system to test the ability of a variety of murine and avian retroviruses to infect spermatogonia. We investigated the factors influencing retroviral transduction of spermatogonia, including the proliferative status of the infected cell, the type of viral envelope, the type of retroviral long terminal repeat, and the method of viral delivery. Here we show that many of the widely used retroviral vector systems can be used to successfully transduce spermatogonia at high efficiency. Moreover, we show that retroviral delivery of MDM2, the major downregulator of p53, promotes spermatogonial survival in culture, suggesting that p53 plays a role in regulating spermatogonial apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation.

We examined the associations between susceptibility to malignant lymphoma and these polymorphisms. DESIGN AND METHODS: A hospital-based prevalent case-control study was conducted in Aichi Cancer Center. One hundred and eight patients with histologically confirmed lymphoma and 494 control subjects without cancer were evaluated. RESULTS: In a risk estimation of each genotype, those who harbored at least one TS 2 repeat (2R) allele had a 1.6-fold increase in the risk of malignant lymphoma (OR=1.63; 95%CI, 1.05-2.53, p=0.030) when using those without the TS 2R allele as a reference. For the SHMT1 C1420T polymorphism, those harboring at least one T allele showed a 2.2-fold decrease in risk (OR =0.46; 95% CI, 0.23-0.93, p=0.031). Moreover, combined analysis of TS and SHMT1 polymorphisms revealed that the OR for lymphoma in patients with SHMT1 1420 CC and the TS 2R allele, which might be expected to provide the basis for the highest susceptibility, was 2.88 (95% CI, 1.26-6.58, p=0.013). INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that genetic traits involving low penetrance polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing genes may modulate the risk of malignant lymphoma.","['Hishida, Asahi', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Hamajima, Nobuyuki', 'Ito, Hidemi', 'Ogura, Michinori', 'Kagami, Yoshitoyo', 'Taji, Hirofumi', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Tajima, Kazuo']","['Hishida A', 'Matsuo K', 'Hamajima N', 'Ito H', 'Ogura M', 'Kagami Y', 'Taji H', 'Morishima Y', 'Emi N', 'Tajima K']","['Division of Epidemiology and Prevention, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan. a-hishi@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*genetics']",2003/02/27 04:00,2003/06/11 05:00,['2003/02/27 04:00'],"['2003/02/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Feb;88(2):159-66.,,,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.1.2.1 (Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD40 triggering, however, rescues CLL B-cells from their anergic state and upregulates the FAS receptor. We therefore studied whether CD40 triggering enhances CLL B-cell sensitivity to fludarabine, and receptors or cytokines potentially involved in apoptosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: CD40-activation of CLL B-cells was carried out by co-culture with CD40L-transfected cells. After fludarabine treatment, apoptosis was evaluated by propidium iodide (PI), annexin-V/PI or DiOC6 staining and flow cytometry analysis. Modulation of Bcl-2, of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFRI/II) and release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha/interferon (IFN)gamma was also analyzed. Furthermore, addition of caspase-inhibitors or anti-TNFalpha/-IFNgamma monoclonal antibodies to fludarabine-treated cells allowed us to determine the mediators of apoptosis. Student's t tests or ANOVA variance statistical analysis were performed to evaluate whether any differences observed might be considered significant. RESULTS: CD40 triggering enhanced fludarabine sensitivity of CLL B-cells, downmodulated Bcl-2 and upregulated TNFRI/II. Caspases 1 and 6 were the major caspases involved in fludarabine apoptosis induction in resting B cells, while only anti-TNFalpha/-IFNgamma monoclonal antibodies reduced apoptosis in activated cells. In agreement with this observation, autocrine production of TNFalpha and IFNgamma by CD40-activated CLL B cells was found. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: B-cells from a considerable proportion of CLL cases studied (11/20) are more prone to fludarabine-induced apoptosis after CD40 triggering; accordingly Bcl-2 expression was lower in activated cells. Moreover, upregulation of TNFRI/II, release of TNFalpha and IFNgamma, and inhibition of apoptosis by anti-TNFalpha/-IFNgamma monoclonal antibodies in CD40-activated cells strongly suggest that these cytokines may play a role in sensitizing B-cells to fludarabine treatment.","['de Totero, Daniela', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Capaia, Matteo', 'Montera, Maria Pina', 'Clavio, Marino', 'Balleari, Enrico', 'Foa, Robin', 'Gobbi, Marco']","['de Totero D', 'Tazzari PL', 'Capaia M', 'Montera MP', 'Clavio M', 'Balleari E', 'Foa R', 'Gobbi M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Italy. detotero@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Autocrine Communication/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'CD40 Antigens/*metabolism/physiology', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2003/02/27 04:00,2003/06/11 05:00,['2003/02/27 04:00'],"['2003/02/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Feb;88(2):148-58.,,,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABC-transporters P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance protein (MRP), are thought to contribute to treatment failure, while it is unknown whether breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) does so. However, whether up-regulation of pump activity or selection of subpopulations with higher pump activity occurs during chemotherapy is unclear. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether ABC-transporter function changes during the course of disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: MRD cells were identified using leukemia-associated phenotypes combined with a fluorescent probe assay with substrate/modulator: Syto16/ PSC833 (Pgp), calcein-AM/probenecid (MRP) and BODIPY-prazosin/Ko143 (BCRP); efflux profiles were directly compared with blasts at diagnosis and relapse from the same patient. RESULTS: At diagnosis BCRP activity was undetectable in AML blasts from 23/26 cases, while Pgp activity was present in 36/45 and MRP activity in 26/44 of the cases. Furthermore, no subpopulations of blasts with considerably higher drug efflux capacities were found. Overall, no consistent changes were observed at follow-up [during chemotherapy (n=20), MRD (n=37), relapse (n=26))] in forty-five patients, the mean activities (as percentages of values at diagnosis) were 97% (Pgp), 103% (MRP) and 102% (BCRP). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Emergence of MRD is thus not accompanied by either upregulation of ABC-transporter function during or after chemotherapy or by selection of pre-existing highly resistant subpopulations. The prognostic value of Pgp and MRP is, therefore, likely related to drug efflux capacity homogeneously distributed in the whole blast population, while BCRP probably has a limited function in drug efflux-related resistance in AML.","['van der Pol, Marjolein A', 'Broxterman, Henk J', 'Pater, Jennie M', 'Feller, Nicole', 'van der Maas, Martin', 'Weijers, Geert W D', 'Scheffer, George L', 'Allen, John D', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'van Loevezijn, Arnold', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J']","['van der Pol MA', 'Broxterman HJ', 'Pater JM', 'Feller N', 'van der Maas M', 'Weijers GW', 'Scheffer GL', 'Allen JD', 'Scheper RJ', 'van Loevezijn A', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/metabolism/physiology', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism/physiology', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism/*physiology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis']",2003/02/27 04:00,2003/06/11 05:00,['2003/02/27 04:00'],"['2003/02/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Feb;88(2):134-47.,,,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a group of patients for which repeated CSF collection have been performed for the follow up of acute leukemia, wide and unpredictible individual variations (up to 400 %) of CSF 5-HIAA and HVA concentrations have been observed. These large interindividual and individual variations may explain the numerous discrepancies found in studies investigating the CNS monoamine metabolism, especially when small groups of patients are used.

Since autoantibodies are present in their sera, env-pX rats are considered to be a prototype model for autoimmune diseases. Adoptive transfers of spleen cells from syngenic non-transgenic rats decreased the incidence of diseases in env-pX rats, thus suggesting that normal spleen contains cells, which suppress autoimmune diseases. Murine peripheral CD25(+)CD4(+)T cells play roles in maintaining immunological self-tolerance. To examine if alterations of immunoregulatory cells may be evident in env-pX rats, quantitative and qualitative analyses of splenic CD25(+)CD4(+)T cells were done before these rats developed autoimmune diseases. Env-pX and non-transgenic rats had equivalent number of CD25(+)CD4(+)T cells. However, CD25(+)CD4(+)T cells from env-pX rats did not suppress proliferation of T cells stimulated by anti-CD3 antibodies (Ab) in vitro, whereas those from non-transgenic rats did. Additionally, env-pX CD25(+)CD4(+)T cells showed autologous and anti-CD3 Ab-mediated proliferation, in contrast to the anergic features in non-transgenic rats.

In this study, we investigated the NADPH-dependent reductases and polyol pathway in commonly utilized human leukemia cell lines. The relative amounts of aldose and aldehyde reductases were estimated by separating two enzymes with chromatofocusing. The flux of glucose through the polyol pathway was examined by 19F-NMR using 3-fluoro-3-deoxy-D-glucose (3FG) as substrate. Sugar alcohol analysis was conducted by gas chromatography. In myelocytic leukemia cells, the major reductase was aldehyde reductase, and levels of aldose reductase were extremely low. Although lymphocytic cells also contained both aldose and aldehyde reductases, the levels of aldose reductase appeared to be higher in lymphocytic cells than myeolcytic cells. In two lymphocytic cells MOLT-4 and SKW6.4, aldose reductase is clearly dominant. When incubated in medium containing D-galactose, all cell lines quickly accumulated galactitol. There was correlation between galactitol levels and aldose reductase levels. The aldose reductase inhibitor FK 366 significantly reduced the formation of galactitol. 19F-NMR of the cells cultured with 3FG as substrate demonstrated the formation of 3-fluoro-3-dexoy-sorbitol in all the cell lines examined in this study. The relative amounts of sorbitol and fructose varied significantly among the cells. The data confirm that the polyol pathway is present in both myelocytic and lymphocytic leukemia cell lines. However, there is a large variation among the cell lines in the levels of enzymes and flux of glucose through the polyol pathway.","['Sato, Sanai', 'Secchi, E Filippo', 'Sakurai, Shinichi', 'Ohta, Nobuo', 'Fukase, Shigeru', 'Lizak, Martin J']","['Sato S', 'Secchi EF', 'Sakurai S', 'Ohta N', 'Fukase S', 'Lizak MJ']","['Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Oklahoma, PO Box 26901, BSEB 331, Oklahoma City, OK 73190-3048, USA. sanai-sato@ouhsc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,IM,"['Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'NADP/*metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases/*metabolism', 'Polymers/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/27 04:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/02/27 04:00'],"['2003/02/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0009279702002090 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-2797(02)00209-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2003 Feb 1;143-144:363-71. doi: 10.1016/s0009-2797(02)00209-0.,,,"['0 (Polymers)', '0 (polyol)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1 is the most frequent target of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias. Several chimeric proteins such as AML1-MTG8 and TEL-AML1 have transdominant properties for wild-type AML1 and acts as transcriptional repressors. The transcriptional repression in AML1 fusion proteins is mediated by recruitment of nuclear corepressor complex that maintains local histone deacetylation. Inhibition of the expression of AML1-responsive genes leads to a block in hematopoietic cell differentiation and consequent leukemic transformation. On the other hand, mutations in the Runt domain of the AML1 are identified in both sporadic acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) without AML1 translocation and familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML. These observations indicate that a decrease in AML1 dosage resulting from chromosomal translocations or mutations contributes to leukemogenesis. Furthermore, dysregulated chromatin remodeling and transcriptional control appears to be a common pathway in AML1-associated leukemias that could be an important target for the development of new therapeutic agents.","['Asou, Norio']",['Asou N'],"['Department of Internal Medicine II, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Honjo, 860-8556, Kumamoto, Japan. ktcnasou@kaiju.medic.kumamoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Point Mutation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",2003/02/27 04:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/02/27 04:00'],"['2003/02/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1040842802000033 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(02)00003-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2003 Feb;45(2):129-50. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(02)00003-3.,,286,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,['Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2006 Oct;60(1):87'],,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Although correlations between mother and survivor ratings were largely moderate to good, further analyses showed that mothers reported QOL to be worse than survivors. Both mothers and survivors rated physical health worse than psychological health, and survivors of a CNS tumour had poorer QOL than survivors of ALL.

Various machine learning and data mining methods are currently used for classifying gene expression data. However, these methods have not been developed to address the specific requirements of gene microarray analysis. First, microarray data is characterized by a high-dimensional feature space often exceeding the sample space dimensionality by a factor of 100 or more. In addition, microarray data exhibit a high degree of noise. Most of the discussed methods do not adequately address the problem of dimensionality and noise. Furthermore, although machine learning and data mining methods are based on statistics, most such techniques do not address the biologist's requirement for sound mathematical confidence measures. Finally, most machine learning and data mining classification methods fail to incorporate misclassification costs, i.e. they are indifferent to the costs associated with false positive and false negative classifications. In this paper, we present a probabilistic neural network (PNN) model that addresses all these issues. The PNN model provides sound statistical confidences for its decisions, and it is able to model asymmetrical misclassification costs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of the PNN for multiclass gene expression data sets. Here, we compare the performance of the PNN with two machine learning methods, a decision tree and a neural network. To assess and evaluate the performance of the classifiers, we use a lift-based scoring system that allows a fair comparison of different models. The PNN clearly outperformed the other models. The results demonstrate the successful application of the PNN model for multiclass cancer classification.","['Berrar, Daniel P', 'Downes, C Stephen', 'Dubitzky, Werner']","['Berrar DP', 'Downes CS', 'Dubitzky W']","['School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulster at Coleraine, BT521SA, Northern Ireland. dp.berrar@ulster.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pac Symp Biocomput,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

For lack of stability it could not so far be generally supplied in total parenteral nutrition. The development of dipeptides consisting of glutamine and a second amino acid offers a solution to this problem. METHODS: In vitro effects of the dipeptide L-alanyl-L-glutamine on different cells of the immune system are assessed and compared to those of glutamine on its own. RESULTS: T-lymphocyte proliferation stimulated with mitogens and alloantigens increased significantly and dose-dependently after addition of L-alanyl-L-glutamine or glutamine. Maximal effects were observed with a concentration of 2 mmol/l of either substance. The stimulatory effects were partly attributed to enhanced cytokine production following glutamine or L-alanyl-L-glutamine treatment. In contrast, the activity of natural killer and cytotoxic T-cells was not influenced by neither amino acid at concentrations of 0.2 and 2 mmol/l, and suppressed at 20 mmol/l. In all experiments, early addition of the amino acids to the cultures proved crucial. CONCLUSION: In this series of in vitro experiments the dipeptide L-alanyl-L-glutamine exerted almost identical immunostimulatory activities to glutamine alone. Its provision in parenteral nutrition appears commendable.","['Kircher, Brigitte', 'Eibl, Gunther', 'Enrich, Barbara', 'Latzer, Karla', 'Herold, Manfred', 'Niederwieser, Dietger']","['Kircher B', 'Eibl G', 'Enrich B', 'Latzer K', 'Herold M', 'Niederwieser D']","['Clinical Immunobiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria. brigitte.eibl@uklibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,IM,"['Cytokines/*blood', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects/immunology', 'Dipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutamine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects', 'Immunity, Cellular/*drug effects', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', '*Parenteral Nutrition', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/27 04:00,2003/05/23 05:00,['2003/02/27 04:00'],"['2003/02/27 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/27 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2002 Aug 30;114(15-16):702-8.,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'U5JDO2770Z (alanylglutamine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: K562 and HL60 cells were treated with Ubenimex at different concentrations, and the growth inhibition was analysed by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by light microscopy, agrose gel electrophoresis, TUNEL labeling method and flow cytometry (FCM) assay. RESULTS: (1)Treatment with Ubenimex remarkably inhibited the growth of HL60 cells, the IC(50) of Ubenimex for HL60 cells was 13.03&mgr;g/ml. But K562 cells were less sensitive than HL60. Ubenimex inhibited the growth of HL60 and K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. (2)Apoptosis of leukemic cells was induced by Ubenimex, which was shown by the changes in morphology, DNA ladder on agrose gel, TUNEL labeling,typical peak before G1 phase of cell cycle and the positive of Annexin V(FITC) on the cells membrane with FCM. (3)Ubenimex induced apoptosis of K562 and HL60 cells in a dose-and-time-dependent manner. (4)The cell cycle analysis by FCM showed that the HL60 cells were blocked in G1 phase after treated by Ubenimex. Conclution Ubenimex can efficiently induce apoptosis of HL60 and K562 cells, this may be one of the mechanisms for inhibiting effect of Ubenimex on leukemia.","['He, Jingi-Song', 'Lin, Mao-Fang', 'Mai, Wen-Yuan', 'Qian, Wen-Bin']","['He JS', 'Lin MF', 'Mai WY', 'Qian WB']","['The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310031, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

There was no significant difference in the incidence of HSF between the patients with acute myeloid leukemia and those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or between the patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and those with conventional or low-dose chemotherapy. Candida tropicalis was the leading pathogen, followed by Candida albicans. The computed tomography scan showed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver (89%), spleen (70%), and kidney (27%). Eighteen patients were initially treated with fluconazole and 19 with amphotericin B. Nineteen patients received the planned chemotherapy after the diagnosis of HSF. Among them, eight patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and seven patients survived more than 100 days post-transplantation; none of these patients had relapse of prior HSF. Twenty-three patients (62%) died during a median follow up of 10 months, but only seven died due to HSF.

Thus, the external validity of study results cannot per se be taken for granted. The representativity of the admitted patients is the most relevant determinant for external validity and has to be assessed. As an example we examined the representativity of the patients recruited for the German multicenter study group for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (GMALL). Lacking nationwide ALL incidence figures available in Germany, a methodology was developed to estimate incidence figures, too. All relevant study groups, hospitals, and diagnostic labs were asked to provide data about patients with ALL newly diagnosed between 1997 and 1998. A matching procedure was developed, as heterogeneous databases had to be pooled and checked for duplicates. Age- and sex-specific incidences of ALL were estimated and compared with the number of patients recruited for the GMALL in the same time period. The purpose was to develop a methodology for estimating incidence figures and evaluating the representativity of patients of the GMALL. The combination of various data sources allowed estimation of reliable incidence data for ALL in Germany. Comparisons with the incidence figures for ALL in other countries and crosschecks within Germany confirm our results. Sixty-two percent of all ALL patients in Germany were admitted to the GMALL study. The recruitment rate of more than 60% of the annual incidence of ALL to the GMALL suggests a high external validity as well as an impact of the study on the patterns of treatment and referral of ALL in adults in Germany. There is no selection bias of patients admitted to the GMALL compared to those patients not included in the study.","['Dugas, M', 'Messerer, D', 'Hasford, J', 'Haferlach, T', 'Heinze, B', 'Ludwig, W', 'Rieder, H', 'Schoch, R', 'Schwartz, S', 'Thiel, E']","['Dugas M', 'Messerer D', 'Hasford J', 'Haferlach T', 'Heinze B', 'Ludwig W', 'Rieder H', 'Schoch R', 'Schwartz S', 'Thiel E']","['Institut fur Medizinische Informationsverarbeitung, Biometrie und Epidemiologie, Universitat Munchen, Marchioninistr. 15, Germany. dug@ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bias', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/standards', 'Data Collection/*methods/standards', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Registries']",2003/02/26 04:00,2003/05/08 05:00,['2003/02/26 04:00'],"['2002/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-002-0585-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2003 Feb;82(2):83-7. doi: 10.1007/s00277-002-0585-x.

The hematopoiesis-restricted minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs) HA-1 or HA-2 expressed on malignant cells of the recipient may serve as target antigens for alloreactive donor T cells. Recently we treated three mHAg HA-1- and/or HA-2-positive patients with a relapse of their disease after alloSCT with DLI from their mHAg HA-1- and/or HA-2-negative donors. Using HLA-A2HA-1 and HA-2 peptide tetrameric complexes we showed the emergence of HA-1- and HA-2-specific CD8(+) T cells in the blood of the recipients 5-7 weeks after DLI. The appearance of these tetramer-positive cells was followed immediately by a complete remission of the disease and restoration of 100% donor chimerism in each of the patients. Furthermore, cloned tetramer-positive T cells isolated during the clinical response specifically recognized HA-1 and HA-2 expressing malignant progenitor cells of the recipient and inhibited the growth of leukemic precursor cells in vitro. Thus, HA-1- and HA-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes emerging in the blood of patients after DLI demonstrate graft-versus-leukemia or myeloma reactivity resulting in a durable remission. This finding implies that in vitro generated HA-1- and HA-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes could be used as adoptive immunotherapy to treat hematological malignancies relapsing after alloSCT.","['Marijt, W A Erik', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M', 'Kloosterboer, Freke M', 'Goulmy, Els', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'van der Hoorn, Menno A W G', 'van Luxemburg-Heys, Simone A P', 'Hoogeboom, Manja', 'Mutis, Tuna', 'Drijfhout, Jan Wouter', 'van Rood, Jon J', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Marijt WA', 'Heemskerk MH', 'Kloosterboer FM', 'Goulmy E', 'Kester MG', 'van der Hoorn MA', 'van Luxemburg-Heys SA', 'Hoogeboom M', 'Mutis T', 'Drijfhout JW', 'van Rood JJ', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, PO Box 9600, 2300 RC, Leiden, The Netherlands. w.a.f.marijt@lumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'CD8 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'Chromosomes, Human, X', 'Chromosomes, Human, Y', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'Genetic Markers', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*pharmacology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Phenotype', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2003/02/26 04:00,2003/05/14 05:00,['2003/02/26 04:00'],"['2003/02/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0530192100 [doi]', '0530192100 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Mar 4;100(5):2742-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0530192100.

The ectodomain of gp190 is among the most complex in the hematopoietin receptor family, because it contains two typical cytokine receptor homology domains separated by an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain. Human and murine gp190 proteins share 76% homology, but murine gp190 binds human LIF with a much higher affinity, a property attributed to the Ig-like domain. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the Ig-like domain, we mapped a LIF binding site at its carboxyl terminus, mainly involving residue Phe-328. Mutation of selected residues into their orthologs in the murine receptor (Q251E and N321D) significantly increased the affinity for human LIF. Interestingly, these residues, although localized at both the amino and carboxyl terminus, make a spatially unique LIF binding site in a structural model of the Ig-like module. These results demonstrate definitively the role of the Ig-like domain in LIF binding and the potential to modulate receptor affinity in this family with very limited amino acid changes.","['Bitard, Juliette', 'Daburon, Sophie', 'Duplomb, Laurence', 'Blanchard, Frederic', 'Vuisio, Patricia', 'Jacques, Yannick', 'Godard, Anne', 'Heath, John K', 'Moreau, Jean-Francois', 'Taupin, Jean-Luc']","['Bitard J', 'Daburon S', 'Duplomb L', 'Blanchard F', 'Vuisio P', 'Jacques Y', 'Godard A', 'Heath JK', 'Moreau JF', 'Taupin JL']","['CNRS UMR 5540, Universite de Bordeaux 2, 146 rue Leo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CHO Cells', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*chemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",2003/02/26 04:00,2003/06/18 05:00,['2003/02/26 04:00'],"['2003/02/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M207193200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)58320-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 May 2;278(18):16253-61. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M207193200.

Some tumor cells, including Daudi cells that are known to be susceptible to killing by Vdelta2(+) T-cells, were resistant to 3-D killing, implicating distinct pathways for tumor cell control by Vdelta1(+) and Vdelta2(+) T-cells. The 3-D T-cell receptor (TCR):CD3 complex reconstituted in TCR-deficient Jurkat cells was capable of transmitting signals, evidenced by activation of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene following ligation with anti-CD3 antibody, yet the TCR-reconstituted cells failed to produce IL-2 in response to the target cells.

PCR analysis of virion DNA produced by NERT revealed that the first strand transfer reaction (1stST) was inefficient in intact virions, with minus strand (-) strong stop DNA (ssDNA) copy numbers up to 200 times higher than post-1stST products measured using primers in U3 and U5. This was in marked contrast to the efficiency of 1stST observed in single-round cell infection assays, in which (-) ssDNA and U3-U5 copy numbers were indistinguishable. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the reasons for the discrepancy in first strand transfer efficiency between intact cell-free virus and the infection process. STUDY DESIGN: Alterations of both NERT reactions and the conditions of cell infection were used to test whether uncoating and/or entry play a role in the discrepancy in first strand transfer efficiency. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The difference in 1stST efficiency could not be attributed simply to viral uncoating, since addition of very low concentrations of detergent to NERT reactions removed the viral envelope without disrupting the reverse transcription complex, and these conditions resulted in no improvement in 1stST efficiency. Virus pseudotyped with surface glycoproteins from either vesicular stomatitis virus or amphotrophic murine leukaemia virus also showed low levels of 1stST in low detergent NERT assays and equivalent levels of (-) ssDNA and 1stST in single-round infections of cells, demonstrating that the gp120-mediated infection process did not select for virions capable of carrying out 1stST. These data indicate that a post-entry event or factor may be involved in efficient HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo.","['Hooker, C William', 'Harrich, David']","['Hooker CW', 'Harrich D']","[""HIV-1 Research Unit, Sir Albert Sakzewski Virus Research Centre, Royal Children's Hospital, Herston, Qld 4029, Australia. b.hooker@mailbox.uq.edu.au""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'HIV Infections/virology', 'HIV-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2003/02/26 04:00,2003/05/28 05:00,['2003/02/26 04:00'],"['2003/02/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['S138665320200121X [pii]', '10.1016/s1386-6532(02)00121-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2003 Feb;26(2):229-38. doi: 10.1016/s1386-6532(02)00121-x.,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the authors investigated the effects and mechanism of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in cell signal transduction of chronic myelogenous leukemia(CML). METHODS: After MAPK antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) was introduced into K562 cell line by liposomal transfection, the effects of ASO on K562 cell were evaluated by cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, MAPK protein content and MAPK activity. RESULTS: The cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, MAPK protein content and MAPK activity were significantly inhibited by MAPK ASO, the inhibitory rates were 51.8%, 57.1%, 45.3%, and 61.6%, respectively,with significant difference in comparison to the control (P<0.05).

The KIT tyrosine kinase is abnormally expressed in gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), a rare neoplasm for which there has been no effective systemic therapy. In a randomised, nonblind, multicentre study that evaluated imatinib 400 or 600mg once daily in 147 patients with advanced GIST, confirmed partial responses were achieved in 54% of patients overall (median duration of follow-up was 288 days). Stable disease was experienced by 28% of patients and the estimated 1-year survival rate was 88%. Similar response rates were reported in a smaller, dose-escalation study, in which objective tumour response was a secondary endpoint. Although nearly all patients with GIST treated with imatinib experienced adverse events, most events were mild or moderate in nature. Severe or serious adverse events occurred in 21% of patients in the larger study, and included gastrointestinal or tumour haemorrhage. The control of cellular processes, such as cell growth, division and death, involves signal transduction, which commonly involves the transfer of phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to tyrosine residues on substrate proteins, by tyrosine kinase enzymes. Activation of oncogenes coding for kinase proteins can lead to the production of kinases that are continually active in the absence of a normal stimulus,leading to increased cell proliferation and/or decreased apoptosis. A major focus of cancer research in recent years has been to identify oncogenic molecules and the signal transduction pathways in which they are involved, in order to develop specifically targeted drugs. One such drug is imatinib mesylate (imatinib, Glivic/Gleevec), an orally administered 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative that is a competitive inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases associated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, the Abelson (ABL) protein and the KIT protein (also known as stem cell factor [SCF] receptor). Imatinib was initially evaluated for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) [reviewed previously in Drugs]. More recently, imatinib has been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), in which KIT, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is abnormally expressed. GISTs are soft tissue gastrointestinal sarcomas probably arising from mesenchymal cells. They are rare neoplasms, with between 5000 and 10 000 new cases being diagnosed each year in the US. GISTs occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract but the stomach and small intestine are the most common sites. Symptoms depend on the site and size of the tumour, and may include abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding or signs of obstruction; small tumours may be asymptomatic. The diagnosis of GIST is made by immunohistochemical staining for CD117, a cell surface antigen on the extracellular domain of KIT, in conjunction with pathological examination of tissue with light microscopy. All GISTs may have some degree of malignant potential. They are unresponsive to standard chemotherapy and to radiotherapy, and the mainstay of treatment in the past has been surgery. However, recurrence rates are high, and there has been no effective systemic treatment for unresectable GIST or metastatic disease. For patients in whom complete resection is not possible, or in patients with metastatic or recurrent disease, the median duration of survival is 9-12 months, and 10-19 months, respectively. Gain-of-function mutations of the KIT proto-oncogene occur in up to 90% of GISTs, allowing constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase (i.e. auto-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues independent of ligand-receptor binding), leading to aberrant cell division and tumour growth. Imatinib selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity associated with KIT, which forms the rationale for evaluating its effects in GIST. Subsequent to initial evidence of the clinical efficacy of imatinib in a single patient with progressive, metastatic, CD117-positive GIST, formal studies of imatinib in this new indication were initiated. This article summarises the pharmacology, efficacy and tolerability profile of imatinib in the treatment of patients with advanced GIST.","['Croom, Katherine F', 'Perry, Caroline M']","['Croom KF', 'Perry CM']","['Adis International Limited, 41 Centorian Drive, PB 65901, Mairangi Bay, Auckland 10, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', '*Piperazines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/02/26 04:00,2003/06/19 05:00,['2003/02/26 04:00'],"['2003/02/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['630505 [pii]', '10.2165/00003495-200363050-00005 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2003;63(5):513-22; discussion 523-4. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200363050-00005.,,45,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain commercial purification modules, such as nanofiltration and low-pH inactivation, have been observed to reliably clear greater than 4 log(10) of large enveloped viruses, including endogenous retrovirus. The concept of ""bracketed generic clearance"" has been proposed for these steps if it could be prospectively demonstrated that viral log(10) reduction value (LRV) is not impacted by operating parameters that can vary, within a reasonable range, between commercial processes. In the case of low-pH inactivation, a common step in mAb purification processes employed after protein A affinity chromatography, these parameters would include pH, time and temperature of incubation, the content of salts, protein concentration, aggregates, impurities, model protein pI, and buffer composition. In this report, we define bracketed generic clearance conditions, using a prospectively defined bracket/matrix approach, where low-pH inactivation consistently achieves >or=4.6 log(10) clearance of xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MLV), a model for rodent endogenous retrovirus.

To assess the feasibility of developing a nationwide childhood cancer registry, the authors attempted to determine whether COG could serve as a resource for identifying all children with cancer. METHODS: A consolidated file of children age < 20 years who were diagnosed with cancer between 1992-1997 and registered with either CCG or POG was linked with records from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program. Age-specific registration rates and age-adjusted registration rates (AARR) were calculated overall and by year of diagnosis, gender, race/ethnicity, stage of disease at diagnosis, and type of cancer. RESULTS: Of 10,108 children age < 20 years with cancer who were identified by the 11 SEER registries between 1992-1997, 5796 were registered with CCG or POG. The AARR was 71% for children age < 15 years, 24% for adolescents ages 15-19 years, and 57% for children age < 20 years. Registration rates were stable over the years studied, varied by geographic region, and were found to be higher among children with more advanced disease. Registration rates were highest for children with leukemia, hepatic tumors, and renal tumors, and were lowest for carcinoma and retinoblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that not all children with cancer are registered by the cooperative groups; however, a national registry program can be achieved by supplementing cases identified through COG with data collected by statewide population-based cancer registries. Such a partnership would be mutually beneficial, allowing COG to achieve 100% registration of children with cancer and, for the statewide cancer registries, improving the timeliness of case-finding and follow-up information for cancer outcomes.","['Liu, Lihua', 'Krailo, Mark', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Bernstein, Leslie']","['Liu L', 'Krailo M', 'Reaman GH', 'Bernstein L']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'SEER Program', 'United States']",2003/02/25 04:00,2003/05/30 05:00,['2003/02/25 04:00'],"['2003/02/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11192 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Mar 1;97(5):1339-45. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11192.,"['Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Childhood Cancer Linkage Group']",,,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.'],,"['N01-CN-05230/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CN-65064/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CN-77001/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-65107/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-67000/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-67001/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-67005/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-67006/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-67007/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-67008/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-67010/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA13539-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA30969-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Radiotherapy may provide additional benefits in the treatment of NB, with moderate side effects such as hematologic and thyroid toxicity. However, with longer follow-up, other complications might occur. We describe our experience with second cancers occurring in children treated with (131)I-MIBG and chemotherapy. METHODS: The clinical records of 119 consecutive NB cases treated with (131)I-MIBG at a single institution between 1984 and 2001 were reviewed for the occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm (SMN). RESULTS: Overall, five cases of SMN occurred in the study patients. In particular, two cases of myeloid leukemia, one of angiomatous fibrous histiocytoma, one of malignant schwannoma, and one case of rhabdomyosarcoma were detected. The schwannoma and the rhabdomyosarcoma developed within the residual neuroblastic mass after first-line therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Should (131)I-MIBG treatment become more broadly employed in the therapeutic strategy for neuroblastoma, the risk of second cancer will have to be taken into consideration. The organization of an international registry of subjects treated with (131)I-MIBG might better define the frequency and features of second malignancies following this radiometabolic approach.","['Garaventa, Alberto', 'Gambini, Claudio', 'Villavecchia, Giampiero', 'Di Cataldo, Andrea', 'Bertolazzi, Luigi', 'Pizzitola, Maria Rosa', 'De Bernardi, Bruno', 'Haupt, Riccardo']","['Garaventa A', 'Gambini C', 'Villavecchia G', 'Di Cataldo A', 'Bertolazzi L', 'Pizzitola MR', 'De Bernardi B', 'Haupt R']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, G.

However, the impact of elevated TA on the course of patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) is unknown. METHODS: Using a modified polymerase chain reaction-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay, the authors measured TA in bone marrow samples from 93 patients with CP-CML and correlated it with patient characteristics and survival. TA also was measured in bone marrow samples from 29 patients with accelerated/blastic phase CML. RESULTS: Patients with accelerated/blastic phase CML were found to have somewhat higher levels of TA compared with patients with CP-CML (P = 0.07). Among patients with CP-CML, those with high TA progressed to advanced stages of disease sooner (P = 0.05) and had a significantly shorter survival (P = 0.04) than patients with low TA. No correlation was found between TA and patient age, hemoglobin, platelet and leukocyte counts, percentage of peripheral or bone marrow blasts or basophils, or bone marrow cellularity. On multivariate analysis, high TA retained its significance as a factor associated with shorter patient survival (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The current study data suggest that TA plays a role in the propagation of CP-CML and that the potential of telomerase inhibitors in patients with CML should be explored, even in those with early phase disease.","['Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Keating, Michael', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Verstovsek S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Manshouri T', 'Cortes J', 'Faderl S', 'Giles FJ', 'Keating M', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

METHODS: Recent studies have suggested that antibodies against CD117 or c-kit are not essential for the assignment of blast lineage by flow cytometry, even though CD117 appears to be a very specific marker for myeloid lineage acute leukemias. We report a case of acute myeloid leukemia M2 subtype with an 8:21 translocation, where the leukemic blasts expressed CD117, CD19, and CD15 but did not show definitive expression of the myeloid markers CD13 or CD33. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of CD117 when evaluating acute leukemias by flow cytometry, which was necessary in this case to suggest that the blasts were phenotypically abnormal myeloblasts. In addition, this case presented an unusual acute myeloid leukemia phenotype that will likely be encountered by others and could be difficult to interpret.","['Newell, James O', 'Cessna, Melissa H', 'Greenwood, Jay', 'Hartung, Leah', 'Bahler, David W']","['Newell JO', 'Cessna MH', 'Greenwood J', 'Hartung L', 'Bahler DW']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Utah, and the ARUP Institute of Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

We introduce a new technique for cell dissociation of hematopoietic malignancies that preserves tissue for histology. This is especially important with small specimens for which this type of correlation is critical. METHODS: Fresh tissue from lymph node, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, skin, and other soft tissue biopsies, in addition to cores of inaspirable bone marrows, were briefly vortexed until the RPMI cell culture medium became cloudy. Larger specimens such as lymph nodes were sectioned before disaggregating, whereas smaller ones were vortexed in toto. Resultant flow cytometric analyses were compared with the histology and, in some cases, the immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine whether the data were concordant. Cell suspensions of 104 specimens-composed of 48 lymph nodes, 19 bone marrow cores (BMCs), 11 GI biopsies, 11 skin/soft tissue biopsies, and 15 miscellaneous specimens-were prepared via vortex disaggregation. RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis of 96 specimens (92.3%) showed adequacy of material and diagnostic correlation with the histology and IHC. Of the eight cases (7.7%) that were discordant, seven were attributable to significant specimen fibrosis or necrosis. With respect to tissue type, this method produced diagnostic cell suspensions for most lymph nodes (95.8%), GI biopsies (90.9%), and BMCs (89.5%); however, it was less useful for skin/soft tissue samples (81.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Disaggregation of tissue for flow cytometric analysis by vortexing appears to provide adequate and representative cellular material. This technique is ideal for inaspirable bone marrows and small biopsies where tissue preservation for histology is paramount.","['Vos, Jeffrey A', 'Simurdak, Jerry H', 'Davis, Brad J', 'Myers, Jerome B', 'Brissette, Mark D']","['Vos JA', 'Simurdak JH', 'Davis BJ', 'Myers JB', 'Brissette MD']","['Department of Pathology, Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, Washington, USA.

Familial BCLL can be used as a model to study the early pathogenesis of this disease. METHODS: We examined nine kindreds from the National Cancer Institute's Familial BCLL Registry, consisting of 19 affected members with BCLL and 33 clinically unaffected first-degree relatives. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping to detect a B-cell monoclonal lymphocytosis (BCML) was performed. Monoclonality was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of whole blood DNA. Cell cycle analysis for aneuploidy was conducted. RESULTS: In all affected individuals, we observed the classic BCLL CD5/CD19/CD20/CD23 immunophenotypic patterns. Six of the 33 unaffected individuals (18%) had evidence of BCML. Additional individuals (13/33, 39%) showed some other abnormality, whereas 14 individuals (42%) were normal. Based on an estimated prevalence of 0.7% for BCML in the general population, the finding of six subjects (18%) with clonal abnormalities in this relatively modest sample was significantly greater than expected (i.e., 18% vs. 0.7%, P < 5.7 x 10(-9)). CONCLUSIONS: Individual components of BCML and other B-cell abnormalities were observed in almost half of the apparently unaffected individuals. Our findings suggested that BCML may be an early detectable abnormality in BCLL. The spectrum of some of these observed abnormalities suggested the involvement of different B-cell subpopulations or different pathways in clonal evolution. Population-based, longitudinal studies will be required to determine the incidence of BCML and other B-cell abnormalities and their relation to disease progression in BCLL and other closely related B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Marti, Gerald E', 'Carter, Patricia', 'Abbasi, Fatima', 'Washington, Glennelle C', 'Jain, Nisha', 'Zenger, Vincent E', 'Ishibe, Naoko', 'Goldin, Lynn', 'Fontaine, Laura', 'Weissman, Nancy', 'Sgambati, Maria', 'Fauget, Guy', 'Bertin, Pablo', 'Vogt, Robert F Jr', 'Slade, Barbara', 'Noguchi, Philip D', 'Stetler-Stevenson, M A', 'Caporaso, Neil']","['Marti GE', 'Carter P', 'Abbasi F', 'Washington GC', 'Jain N', 'Zenger VE', 'Ishibe N', 'Goldin L', 'Fontaine L', 'Weissman N', 'Sgambati M', 'Fauget G', 'Bertin P', 'Vogt RF Jr', 'Slade B', 'Noguchi PD', 'Stetler-Stevenson MA', 'Caporaso N']","['Flow and Image Cytometry Section, Laboratory Stem Cell Biology, Division of Cell and Gene Therapies, Center for Biologics Research and Evaluation, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Maryland20892, USA. gemarti@helix.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

We wished to compare the approaches of specific binding to leukaemic blasts and non-specific binding to benign red marrow cells, which results in a myeloablative ""cross-fire"" effect. Therefore, we prospectively evaluated the biodistribution and biokinetics of the anti-CD45 mAb YTH 24.5 and the anti-CD66 mAb BW 250/183 with regard to their suitability for myeloablative RIT. The red marrow selective anti-CD66 mAb BW 250/183 (IgG1) binds to normal granulopoietic cells. In contrast, the anti-CD45 mAb YTH 24.5 (IgG2b) binds to 85-90% of acute leukaemic blasts and almost all haematopoietic white cells. Patients with leukaemic blast infiltration of the marrow <25% and assigned for RIT and SCT were included. Twelve patients (eight male, four female; median age 46+/-7 years) with AML (5), CML (5) or ALL (2) were examined. Both mAbs were labelled with technetium-99m. Within 48 h, 906+/-209 MBq (99m)Tc-anti-CD66 mAb and 760+/-331 MBq (99m)Tc-anti-CD45 mAb were injected consecutively. Scintigraphic and urinary measurements were performed 1, 2, 4 and 24 h after injection. Serum activities were evaluated 2, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min and 2, 4 and 24 h after injection. Compared with the anti-CD45 mAb, the anti-CD66 mAb showed an approximately fourfold higher accumulation in the red marrow, a 2.5-fold lower accumulation in the liver and similar accumulation in the kidneys. The serum activity (% of the injected dose) initially decreased faster for the anti-CD45 mAb but was similar for the two mAbs 24 h after injection: 3.3%+/-1.2% (anti-CD66 mAb) and 2.4%+/-1.1% (anti-CD45 mAb). The cumulated urinary excretion was 17%+/-6.6% (anti-CD66 mAb) and 27.3%+/-7.9% (anti-CD45 mAb) 24 h after application. In these patients with low tumour load, the anti-CD66 mAb BW 250/183 showed more favourable properties in terms of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. Thus, it appears superior to anti-CD45 mAb YTH 24.5 in selectively increasing the marrow dose and avoiding extramedullary organ toxicity.","['Buchmann, Inga', 'Kull, Thomas', 'Glatting, Gerhard', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Hale, Geoffrey', 'Kotzerke, Jorg', 'Rattat, Dirk', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Reske, Sven N']","['Buchmann I', 'Kull T', 'Glatting G', 'Bunjes D', 'Hale G', 'Kotzerke J', 'Rattat D', 'Dohner H', 'Reske SN']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital, Ulm, Germany, buchmann@nuklear.klinik.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/urine', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/blood/pharmacokinetics/urine', 'Organ Specificity', 'Organotechnetium Compounds/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/urine', 'Radioimmunotherapy/methods', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/urine', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Whole-Body Counting/*methods']",2003/02/25 04:00,2004/04/14 05:00,['2003/02/25 04:00'],"['2002/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00259-002-1106-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2003 May;30(5):667-73. doi: 10.1007/s00259-002-1106-9.

METHODS: The whole of Genoa and one of its 25 districts (Rivarolo) were selected as controls. The trend of risk around the coke oven was evaluated via Stone's method, while the geographic pattern of such risks across the Cornigliano district was evaluated by computing full Bayes estimates of standardised incidence ratio (FBE-SIR). RESULTS: In males, elevated relative risks (RR) were observed for all lymphohaematopoietic cancers (RR 1.7 v Rivarolo and 1.6 v Genoa), for NHL (RR 2.4 v Rivarolo and 1.7 v Genoa), and for leukaemia (RR 2.4 v Rivarolo and 1.9 v Genoa). In females, statistically non-significant RR were observed. In males no excess of risk was found close to the coke oven. In females, a rising risk for NHL was observed approaching the plant, although statistical significance was not reached, while the risk for leukaemia was not evaluable due to the small number of cases. Analysis of the geographic pattern of risk suggested the presence of a cluster of NHL in both sexes in the eastern part of the district, where a foundry had been operational until the early 1980s. A cluster of leukaemia cases was observed in males in a northern part of the area, where no major sources of benzene seemed to be present. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated risks seem to be slightly or not at all related to the distance from the coke oven. The statistically significant higher risks observed in males for NHL and leukaemia, and the clusters of leukaemia in males and of NHL in both sexes deserve further investigations in order to trace the exposures associated with such risks.","['Parodi, S', 'Vercelli, M', 'Stella, A', 'Stagnaro, E', 'Valerio, F']","['Parodi S', 'Vercelli M', 'Stella A', 'Stagnaro E', 'Valerio F']","['Environmental Epidemiology Department, National Cancer Research Institute, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"['Benzene/*adverse effects', '*Coke', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Industry', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Risk', 'Sex Distribution', 'Urban Population']",2003/02/25 04:00,2003/04/29 05:00,['2003/02/25 04:00'],"['2003/02/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.60.3.187 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2003 Mar;60(3):187-93. doi: 10.1136/oem.60.3.187.,,,"['0 (Coke)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,,,,,PMC1740491,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 21,357 servicemen and male civilians from the UK who participated in the tests and a control group of 22,333 male controls were followed over the period 1952-98. Analyses were conducted of mortality from various causes, and of mortality and incidence for 27 types of cancer. RESULTS: Rates of mortality from all causes continued to be similar among test participants and controls with the longer follow up, with standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) of 89 and 88 respectively over the full follow up period. For all cancers, the corresponding SMRs were 93 for participants and 92 for controls. Mortality from multiple myeloma was consistent with national rates both for participants and controls, and the relative risk (RR) of myeloma incidence among participants relative to controls was 1.14 (90% CI 0.74 to 1.74) over the full follow up period and 0.79 (90% CI 0.45 to 1.38) during the extended period of follow up (1991-98). Over the full follow up period, leukaemia mortality among participants was consistent with national rates, while rates among controls were significantly lower, and there was a suggestion of a raised risk among test participants relative to controls (RR 1.45, 90% CI 0.96 to 2.17); the corresponding RR for leukaemia incidence was 1.33 (90% CI 0.97 to 1.84). After excluding chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL), which is not thought to be radiation inducible, the RR of leukaemia mortality increased to 1.83 (90% CI 1.15 to 2.93), while that for incidence was little changed. Analysis of subgroups of participants with greater potential for exposure provided little evidence of increased risks, although the numbers of men involved were smaller and the statistical power was therefore less. Among other types of cancer, only for liver cancer incidence was there evidence of differences in rates between participants and controls in both the earlier and in the additional period of follow up. Mortality rates among test participants from causes other than cancer were generally similar to those among the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Overall levels of mortality and cancer incidence in UK nuclear weapons test participants have continued to be similar to those in a matched control group, and overall mortality has remained lower than expected from national rates. There was no evidence of an increased raised risk of multiple myeloma among test participants in recent years, and the suggestion in the first analysis of this study of a raised myeloma risk is likely to have been a chance finding. There was some evidence of a raised risk of leukaemia other than CLL among test participants relative to controls, particularly in the early years after the tests, although a small risk may have persisted more recently. This could be a chance finding, in view of low rates among the controls and the generally small radiation doses recorded for test participants. However, the possibility that test participation caused a small absolute risk of leukaemia other than CLL cannot be ruled out.","['Muirhead, C R', 'Bingham, D', 'Haylock, R G E', ""O'Hagan, J A"", 'Goodill, A A', 'Berridge, G L C', 'English, M A', 'Hunter, N', 'Kendall, G M']","['Muirhead CR', 'Bingham D', 'Haylock RG', ""O'Hagan JA"", 'Goodill AA', 'Berridge GL', 'English MA', 'Hunter N', 'Kendall GM']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 0RQ, UK. colin.muirhead@nrpb.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/mortality', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Military Personnel/*statistics & numerical data', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality', '*Radioactive Fallout', 'Risk', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2003/02/25 04:00,2003/04/29 05:00,['2003/02/25 04:00'],"['2003/02/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.60.3.165 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2003 Mar;60(3):165-72. doi: 10.1136/oem.60.3.165.,,,['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],,,,,,,PMC1740497,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our aim was to study the serum levels of s-ICAM-1 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and to correlate them with clinical characteristics and outcome. We analyzed the serum levels of s-ICAM-1 in a series of 55 patients with DLBCL diagnosed in a single institution. s-ICAM-1 levels were quantified by an immunoenzymatic assay. Median age was 62 years (range 22-96); 29 (53%) were male. Twenty-eight (51%) presented with advanced clinical stage (III/IV), 32 (58%) had extranodal involvement, 28 (51%) had high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 23 (43%) had high beta2-microglobulin levels. All patients received anthracycline-containing regimens. Correlation between clinical variables and s-ICAM-1 levels were tested with the Mann-Whitney U-test and survival was plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method, and curves compared with the log-rank test. RESULTS: Serum levels of s-ICAM-1 were significantly increased in patients with DLBCL compared with normal controls (589 +/- 487 versus 279 +/- 65 ng/ml, respectively; P <0.001). Higher levels of s-ICAM-1 were present in patients with B symptoms, advanced stage and increased LDH and beta2-microglobulin. s-ICAM-1 levels also correlated with achievement of a complete response. Patients with s-ICAM-1 over 668 ng/ml had a shorter time to treatment failure (TTF) (3-year TTF, 59% versus 20%, respectively; P = 0.01) and overall survival (OS) (3-year OS, 58% versus 22%, respectively; P = 0.04) than the remainders. When only low and low-intermediate risk patients in the international prognostic index score were considered, those with s-ICAM-1 over 668 ng/ml also had worse TTF and OS. CONCLUSIONS: In DLBCL, s-ICAM-1 levels correlated with high tumor burden and lymphoma dissemination and may contribute to assessment of prognosis.","['Terol, M J', 'Tormo, M', 'Martinez-Climent, J A', 'Marugan, I', 'Benet, I', 'Ferrandez, A', 'Teruel, A', 'Ferrer, R', 'Garcia-Conde, J']","['Terol MJ', 'Tormo M', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Marugan I', 'Benet I', 'Ferrandez A', 'Teruel A', 'Ferrer R', 'Garcia-Conde J']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinico Universitario, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain. terol39@mail.ono.es']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*blood', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/02/25 04:00,2004/02/28 05:00,['2003/02/25 04:00'],"['2003/02/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdg057 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)47821-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2003 Mar;14(3):467-74. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdg057.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated gemcitabine as a radiosensitizer for human TCC cells. METHODS: Monolayer cultures of RT112 (G1, p53 wild type), RT4 (G1-G2, p53 wild type), T24 (G3, p53, mutant type), and SUP (G4, p53 mutant type) cells were incubated in medium with gemcitabine. Electron beam radiation was applied alone, simultaneous, or 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after gemcitabine. Jurkat leukemia cells were used as controls for radiation toxicity. Cell survival was determined 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after radiation by microculture tetrazolium assay. DNA damage was evaluated by flow cytometric assessment of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and apoptosis was determined by terminal-deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling and flow cytometric assessment after annexin-V and propidium iodide labeling. RESULTS: In all TCC cell lines, radiation alone caused only little and insignificant growth inhibitory effects at 10 Gy. Gemcitabine alone had a dose-dependent cytotoxic and apoptosis inducing effect on all TCC cell lines independent of p53 status. Assays combining radiation with gemcitabine in different dose and time schedules demonstrated no radiosensitizing effect in TCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine is effective in TCC cell lines independent of p53 status. A radiosensitizing effect could not be demonstrated. Again, p53 status was not predictive of the radioresponse in the bladder cancer cell lines. Clinical studies with gemcitabine and radiotherapy might nevertheless yield different results but should be performed with utmost caution.","['Fechner, G', 'Perabo, F G E', 'Schmidt, D H', 'Haase, L', 'Ludwig, E', 'Schueller, H', 'Blatter, J', 'Mller, S C', 'Albers, P']","['Fechner G', 'Perabo FG', 'Schmidt DH', 'Haase L', 'Ludwig E', 'Schueller H', 'Blatter J', 'Mller SC', 'Albers P']","['Department of Urology, Bonn University, Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Urology,Urology,0366151,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*radiotherapy', 'Cell Division/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, p53/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Mutation', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Conformal', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*radiotherapy']",2003/02/25 04:00,2003/04/17 05:00,['2003/02/25 04:00'],"['2003/02/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0090429502021568 [pii]', '10.1016/s0090-4295(02)02156-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Urology. 2003 Feb;61(2):468-73. doi: 10.1016/s0090-4295(02)02156-8.,,,"['0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These viruses establish persistent infections with a broad spectrum of pathogenic potential, ranging from highly pathogenic to nonpathogenic, depending on various host, virus, and environmental factors. Latent or subclinical infections are common, and various procedures associated with experimental protocols may lead to virus reactivation and disease. Adverse effects on toxicologic research by undetected retroviral infections can occur in several ways, including loss of experimental subjects (and statistical power) due to increased morbidity and mortality. In addition, results may be confounded by virus-induced clinical abnormalities, histologic lesions, alteration of physiologic parameters and responses, and interference with in vitro assays and/or destruction of primary cell cultures. Key clinical and epidemiological features of several important retroviruses are reviewed, with emphasis on viruses infecting species of macaques most commonly used as research subjects in primate toxicology studies. Examples of actual and potential confounding of toxicologic studies by retroviruses are discussed, including altered cytokine profiles in healthy STLV carriers, and clinical and pathological abnormalities induced by SRV infection. Adequate prestudy viral screening is critical to exclude retrovirus-infected primates from toxicologic research protocols and prevent potential confounding of research results.","['Lerche, Nicholas W', 'Osborn, Kent G']","['Lerche NW', 'Osborn KG']","['Simian Retrovirus Laboratory, California National Primate Research Center, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA. nwlerche@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Toxicol Pathol,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,IM,"['Animals', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Models, Animal', 'Primates/*microbiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*epidemiology/pathology/*physiopathology/virology', 'Retroviruses, Simian/isolation & purification', 'Toxicology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*epidemiology/pathology/*physiopathology/virology']",2003/02/25 04:00,2003/08/07 05:00,['2003/02/25 04:00'],"['2003/02/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01926230390174977 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Pathol. 2003 Jan-Feb;31 Suppl:103-10. doi: 10.1080/01926230390174977.,,64,,,,,['RR00169/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that the agent might also be effective against other malignancies. This study was done to explore the efficacy of As2O3 in the treatment of human nasopharyngeal cancer xenografts in SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice. METHODS: Human nasopharyngeal cancer cells from the CSNE-1 cell line were implanted subcutaneously into SCID mice to produce tumors. The tumor inhibitory rate in vivo was assessed after intraperitoneal administration of As2O3. Histopathological changes in the tumor tissues and the toxicity of As2O3 to the liver, heart and kidneys of the host mice were also investigated. RESULTS: At doses of 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg As2O3 induced apoptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. At 5 mg/kg As2O3 also induced cancer cell differentiation, it reduced the PCNA expression, and inhibited tumor growth. The tumor growth inhibitory rate in this experimental group was 76.02%. No nephrotoxicity was observed histologically at these dose levels but some pathological changes in liver and cardiac tissues were found. As2O3 proved lethal to the SCID mice at a dose of 10 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: As2O3 has an inhibitory effect on human nasopharyngeal carcinoma xenografts in SCID mice. The mechanism of antitumor activity may be due, at least in part, to the induction of apoptosis and differentiation in cancer cells.","['Li, Derui', 'Du, Caiwen', 'Lin, Yingchen', 'Wu, Mingyao']","['Li D', 'Du C', 'Lin Y', 'Wu M']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong, China. deruili@pub.shantou.gd.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2003/02/25 04:00,2003/03/12 04:00,['2003/02/25 04:00'],"['2003/02/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 2002 Nov-Dec;88(6):522-6.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They represent the first line of defense against invading microorganisms and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases. In response to various factors, the pluripotent stem cells in bone marrow differentiate into mature neutrophils, enter the blood stream, and die within 24 hr via apoptosis. Numerous defects can occur during the process of neutrophils' differentiation that can manifest in the form of a variety of clinical disorders. Retinoids (Vitamin A and analogues), in general, and all-trans retinoic acid (tRA), in particular, play a critical role during differentiation of neutrophils. tRA can directly modulate gene expression via binding to its nuclear receptors, which in turn, can activate transcription of genes that are essential for differentiation of immature cells to neutrophils. Involvement of retinoic acid receptor in pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), reflects an important role played by this receptor in differentiation of immature myeloid cells to neutrophils.

Identification of the receptor(s) that mediate cell entry by these viruses is crucial to understanding the oncogenic activity of Env and for the development of gene therapy vectors based on these viruses that are capable of targeting airway cells. To identify the viral receptor(s) and to further study the biology of JSRV and ONAV, we developed retroviral vectors containing Moloney murine leukemia virus components and the Env proteins of JSRV or ONAV. We used a new technique involving positional cloning by phenotypic mapping in radiation hybrid cells to identify and clone the human receptor for JSRV, Hyal2, which also serves as the receptor for ONAV. Hyal2 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface protein that has low hyaluronidase activity and is a member of a large family that includes sperm hyaluronidase (Spam) and serum hyaluronidase (Hyal1). Hyal2 is located in a region of human chromosome 3p21.3 that is often deleted in lung cancer, suggesting that it may be a tumor suppressor. However, its role in JSRV or ONAV tumorigenesis, if any, is still unclear. JSRV vectors are capable of transducing various human cells, and are being further evaluated for gene therapy purposes.","['Miller, A D']",['Miller AD'],"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. dmiller@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/veterinary/virology', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronoglucosaminidase/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus/genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Models, Genetic', 'Nose Neoplasms/veterinary/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Pulmonary Adenomatosis, Ovine/pathology/virology', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Retroviridae Infections/veterinary/virology', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/*virology', 'Transfection']",2003/02/25 04:00,2003/04/18 05:00,['2003/02/25 04:00'],"['2003/02/25 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-55638-8_7 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2003;275:179-99. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-55638-8_7.,,28,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', 'EC 3.2.1.25 (Hyal2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.1.35 (Hyaluronoglucosaminidase)']",,,,"['DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although the clinical efficacy of anthracyclines is limited by a high incidence of severe cardiac toxicity, our understanding of IDA transport into the heart is still limited. In a previous study, we demonstrated that IDA is transported into the heart by a saturable mechanism. Based on in vitro data suggesting an enhancement by methylxanthines of IDA influx in leukemia cells, this study was designed to test the hypothesis that a commonly used methylxanthine, caffeine, might influence the myocardial uptake of IDA. In the Langendorff rat heart, after infusion of 0.5 mg IDA during 10 min, the presence of caffeine (1 microM) in perfusate enhanced the residual amount of IDA in the heart by 30% due to a 2.7-fold increase in the maximal uptake rate V(max). Theophylline (3 micro M), in contrast, did not influence the uptake process but caused a slight decrease of fractional myocardial sequestration rate (19% reduction). Caffeine reversed the cardiodepressive action of IDA (49% decrease in left ventricular developed pressure at the end of infusion) to a positive inotropic effect (18% increase of basal level). Theophylline significantly attenuated the negative inotropic effect of IDA (only 21% decrease) and led to positive inotropism in the washout phase (21% increase at the end of experiment). We speculate that co-administration of caffeine may enhance the chronic cardiotoxicity of IDA by increasing its accumulation in the heart.","['Kang, Wonku', 'Weiss, Michael']","['Kang W', 'Weiss M']","['Department of Pharmacology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06097, Halle, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Caffeine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Heart Rate/drug effects', 'Idarubicin/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Myocardial Contraction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Theophylline/pharmacology', 'Vascular Resistance/drug effects', 'Vasodilator Agents/*pharmacology', 'Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects', 'Ventricular Pressure/drug effects']",2003/02/22 04:00,2003/12/24 05:00,['2003/02/22 04:00'],"['2002/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2002/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00210-002-0683-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2003 Feb;367(2):151-5. doi: 10.1007/s00210-002-0683-2.

Groups of male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to p-nitrobenzoic acid (>99% pure) in feed for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years for toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in in vitro assays with Salmonella typhimurium and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in studies of erythrocyte micronucleus formation in mice in the 13-week study. 14-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were given 0, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, or 40,000 ppm p-nitrobenzoic acid in feed for 14 days. All rats survived until the end of the study. Male and female rats given 20,000 and 40,000 ppm lost weight. The final mean body weights of 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000 ppm males were 82%, 60%, or 52% that of the controls, and the final mean body weights of 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000 ppm females were 87%, 68%, and 65% that of the controls. There were no clinical findings that were characteristic of organ-specific toxicity. Absolute and relative spleen weights were significantly increased in rats exposed to 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000 ppm. There were decreases in erythrocyte count and hemoglobin and hematocrit values and increases in reticulocyte count, nucleated erythrocytes, and methemoglobin concentration that were most pronounced in the 20,000 and 40,000 ppm groups. Congestion of the spleen occurred in 10,000 ppm males and in 20,000 and 40,000 ppm females. Hypertrophy of the follicular epithelium of the thyroid gland was present in male and female rats exposed to 10,000, 20,000, or 40,000 ppm p-nitrobenzoic acid, while follicular hyperplasia was observed in the 40,000 ppm males and females. Atrophy of the testis was observed in 20,000 and 40,000 ppm males. Other lesions observed in 20,000 and 40,000 ppm rats included atrophy of the thymus in males and atrophy of the ovary, bone marrow, and thymus in females. 14-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were given 0, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, or 40,000 ppm p-nitrobenzoic acid in feed for 14 days. Three males and two females given 40,000 ppm died during the study. All other animals survived until the end of the study. Male mice given 20,000 and 40,000 ppm and females given 20,000 ppm lost weight. Mean body weight gains of 20,000 and 40,000 ppm males and 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000 ppm females were significantly lower than those of the controls. There were no clinical findings related to organ-specific toxicity although lethargy and ataxia were observed in 40,000 ppm mice. Relative liver weights were significantly increased in 20,000 and 40,000 ppm males and females and in 10,000 ppm females. Absolute and relative thymus weights of 20,000 and 40,000 ppm males and of 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000 ppm females were reduced. No significant differences in hematology parameters occurred in exposed mice. Testicular degeneration was observed in three 20,000 ppm and two 40,000 ppm males. Bone marrow hemorrhage and atrophy occurred in 40,000 ppm females. 13-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were given 0, 630, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm pnitrobenzoic acid in feed for 13 weeks resulting in approximate daily doses of 40, 70, 160, 310, or 660 mg/kg to males and 40, 80, 170, 340, or 680 mg/kg to females. All rats survived until the end of the study. Mean body weight gains and final mean body weights were significantly less than those of the controls in 2,500, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm males and in 5,000 and 10,000 ppm females. There were no clinical findings related to organ-specific toxicity. Differences in spleen weights and hematology parameters characteristic of regenerative anemia were observed in males and females, primarily in groups given 10,000 ppm. The absolute and relative spleen weights were significantly increased in 10,000 ppm males and females and the relative spleen weights were significantly increased in 5,000 ppm males hts were significantly increased in 5,000 ppm males and females. Methemoglobin, Heinz bodies, and reticulocyte counts were increased and erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values were decreased in 10,000 ppm males and females. Congestion, pigmentation, and accumulation of macrophages in the spleen and pigmentation in the kidney occurred in 2,500, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm males. Congestion and pigmentation of the spleen occurred in 10,000 ppm females. A yellowish brown pigment (hemosiderin) in the spleen and kidney was associated with hemolytic anemia. Mild cytoplasmic hyaline droplet accumulation was present in renal tubule epithelial cells in 10,000 ppm males while karyomegaly was present in male and female rats exposed to 2,500, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm p-nitrobenzoic acid. A chemical-related testicular lesion, consisting of atrophy of the seminiferous tubules, occurred in 10,000 ppm males. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were given 0, 1,250, 5,000, 10,000, or 20,000 ppm pnitrobenzoic acid in feed for 13 weeks resulting in approximate daily doses of 170, 330, 670, 1,900, or 4,000 mg/kg body weight to males and 240, 460, 970, 2,500, or 4,900 mg/kg to females. All mice survived until the end of the study, except one 1,250 ppm female that was killed accidentally. Final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of all exposed males and of 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 ppm females were significantly lower than those of the controls. No clinical findings or differences in organ weights or histopathology related to organ-specific toxicity were observed in exposed mice. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 60 male and 60 female rats were given 0, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm p-nitrobenzoic acid in feed for 2 years. Ten males and 10 females from each exposure group were evaluated at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings: Two-year survival rates of 1,250 and 2,500 ppm males were similar to that of the controls. Two-year survival of 5,000 ppm males was marginally greater than that of the controls and was attributed in part to a decrease in the severity of nephropathy and a decrease in the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia. Survival of exposed females was similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of 5,000 ppm males were 2&percnt; to 8&percnt; lower than those of the controls through week 80. Final mean body weights of exposed males were similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of 5,000 ppm females were 2&percnt; to 9&percnt; lower than those of the controls during the first year of the study and were 10&percnt; to 16&percnt; lower during the second year of the study. Final mean body weights of exposed females were 97&percnt; (1,250 ppm), 92&percnt; (2;500 ppm), and 84&percnt; (5,000 ppm) that of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed males and females was similar to that by the controls. Dietary levels of 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm p-nitrobenzoic acid delivered approximately 50, 100, or 210 mg/kg body weight per day to males and 60, 125, or 250 mg/kg per day to females. There were no clinical findings attributable to organ-specific toxicity. Pathology Findings: There were increases in the incidences of clitoral gland adenoma and of clitoral gland adenoma or carcinoma (combined) (4/50, 14/49, 15/49, 15/50) in exposed females. The incidences of clitoral gland adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in the exposed groups (29&percnt; to 31&percnt;) exceeded the historical control mean incidence (11&percnt;) and range (2&percnt; to 21&percnt;) in female F344/N rats in recent 2-year NTP feed studies. The increased incidences of clitoral gland neoplasms were considered to be some evidence of carcinogenic activity in female rats exposed to p-nitrobenzoic acid. The incidences of hyperplasia of the clitoral gland in exposed females were marginally lower than that of the controls (10/50, 6/49, 6/ 49, 7/50). There was a chemical-related decrease in the severity of nephropathy in male rats. Male rat kidneys were examined using both single and step-section analyses, and the incidences of renal tubule neoplasms were not statistically greater than those of the controls. Mild hyaline droplet accumulation was observed in renal tubule epithelial cells in 10,000 ppm males in the 13-week study, but this effect was not severe enough to lead to a chemical-related neoplastic response in the 2-year study as has been observed with other chemicals. At the 15-month interim evaluation, hematologic parameters characteristic of a mild regenerative anemia and significant differences in spleen weights were noted in 5,000 ppm females. These differences included decreases in erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, increases in spleen weights, and hemosiderin accumulation in splenic macrophages. At 2 years, significant decreases in the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were observed in 5,000 ppm males and 2,500 and 5,000 ppm females (males: 29/50, 35/50, 26/50, 2/50; females: 17/50, 11/50, 3/50, 0/50). While the mechanism for this decrease is unknown, decreases in the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia have also been observed in 2year studies with other amine/nitro compounds. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male and 60 female mice were given 0, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm p-nitrobenzoic acid in feed for 2 years. Ten males and 10 females from each exposure group were evaluated at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings: Two-year survival rates of exposed mice were similar to those of the controls. Mean body weights of 5,000 ppm males were 6&percnt; to 12&percnt; lower than those of the controls after week 17, and mean body weights of 5,000 ppm females were 12&percnt; to 24&percnt; lower than those of the controls after week 16. The final mean body weight of 5,000 ppm females was 19&percnt; less than that of the controls; final mean body weights of males were similar to that of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed mice was similar to that by the controls. Dietary levels of 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm p-nitrobenzoic acid delivered approximately 150, 300, or 675 mg/kg per day to males and 170, 365, or 905 mg/kg per day to females. There were no clinical findings of organ-specific toxicity. No chemical-related effects on hematology parameters were noted at the 15-month interim evaluation. Pathology Findings: There were no increases or decreases in neoplasms in male or female mice that were considered to be related to chemical administration. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: p-Nitrobenzoic acid was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 with and without S9. No mutagenic activity was noted in strains TA98, TA1535, or TA1537, with or without S9. p-Nitrobenzoic acid induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in the absence of S9; with S9, results of both tests were negative. In vivo, no increase in micronuclei was observed in peripheral blood erythrocytes of male or female mice administered p-nitrobenzoic acid in dosed feed for 13 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of p-nitrobenzoic acid in male F344/N rats exposed to 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of p-nitrobenzoic acid in female F344/N rats based on increases in the incidences of clitoral gland adenoma and of clitoral gland adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of p-nitrobenzoic acid in male or female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm. There were chemical-related decreases in the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in exposed male and female rats. p-Nitrobenzoic acid caused mild hematologic toxicity in female rats.

Variable combinations of autoimmune endocrine diseases such as Addison's disease, hypoparathyroidism, and type 1 diabetes characterize APECED. The AIRE protein has several domains indicative of a transcriptional regulator. AIRE contains two PHD (plant homeodomain) type zinc fingers, four nuclear receptor binding LXXLL motifs, a putative DNA-binding domain named SAND and, in addition, a highly conserved N-terminal domain similar to the homogenously staining region domain of the Sp100 protein. At the subcellular level, AIRE is expressed in nuclear dots resembling promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, which are associated with several transcriptionally active proteins. AIRE is primarily expressed in thymic medullary epithelial cells and monocyte-dendritic cells in the thymus but also in a rare subset of cells in the lymph nodes, spleen and fetal liver. The disease, caused by mutations in AIRE, its function as a protein involved in transcription, and its restricted expression in cells important in negative selection, all together suggest that AIRE is a central protein in the maintenance of immune tolerance. In this review of the recent literature we discuss the results of these studies with particular attention on the AIRE expression pattern and its function as a transcriptional regulator, as well as the effects of patient mutations on the molecular characteristics of the protein.","['Pitkanen, J', 'Peterson, P']","['Pitkanen J', 'Peterson P']","['Institute of Medical Technology, University of Tampere and Tampere Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",2003/02/22 04:00,2003/07/08 05:00,['2003/02/22 04:00'],"['2003/02/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.gene.6363929 [doi]', '6363929 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2003 Jan;4(1):12-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.gene.6363929.,,98,"['0 (APECED protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have explored the role of Daxx in regulating the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Overexpression of Daxx suppressed GR-mediated activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in COS-1, HeLa, and 293T cells. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that Daxx could directly bind to GR. The mapping analysis further demonstrated that the C-terminal region of Daxx-(501-740) mediates the interaction and transcriptional repression of GR. The repressive effect of Daxx and Daxx-(501-740) on GR could be alleviated by co-expression of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis showed that overexpression of wild-type PML results in the translocation of Daxx and Daxx-(501-740) to the PML oncogenic domains (PODs). By contrast, a PML sumoylation-defective mutant failed to recruit Daxx to PODs and to reverse the Daxx repression effect on GR. Accordingly, As(2)O(3) treatment rendered the sequestration of endogenous Daxx to the PODs, leading to an enhancement of GR transactivation in COS-1 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that recruitment of Daxx into the subnuclear POD structures sequesters it from the GR/co-activators complex, thereby alleviating its repressive effects. Our present studies provide the important link between Daxx/PML interaction and GR transcriptional activation.","['Lin, Ding-Yen', 'Lai, Ming-Zong', 'Ann, David K', 'Shih, Hsiu-Ming']","['Lin DY', 'Lai MZ', 'Ann DK', 'Shih HM']","['Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, 128 Sec2 Yen-Chiu-Yuan Road, Taipei 11529, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/genetics', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2003/02/22 04:00,2003/06/18 05:00,['2003/02/22 04:00'],"['2003/02/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M300387200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)58284-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 May 2;278(18):15958-65. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M300387200.

We report here on 131 consecutive chronic-phase CML patients treated with allogeneic related BMT using a TBU/CY preparative regimen, where the busulfan dose was targeted to achieve a steady-state plasma concentration of at least 900 ng/mL. The median age of the patients was 43 years (range, 14-66 years). Estimates of the probabilities of nonrelapse mortality, relapse, survival, and disease-free survival 3 years after transplantation were 14%, 8%, 86%, and 78%, respectively. Age had no statistically significant effect on survival. Although approximately 60% of the patients developed clinically extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease, the median Karnofsky score at last contact date among survivors was 95%. Of surviving patients, 11% were molecularly positive for the bcr-abl mRNA at last contact, with a median level of bcr-abl transcripts of 4.6 copies/microg RNA.

Patients whose leukemic cells express unmutated IgVH regions (Ig-unmutated CLL) often have progressive disease, whereas patients whose leukemic cells express mutated IgVH regions (Ig-mutated CLL) more often have an indolent disease. Given the difficulty in performing IgVH sequencing in a routine diagnostic laboratory, this prognostic distinction is currently unavailable to most patients. Pilot gene expression profiling studies in patients with CLL identified genes that were differentially expressed between the Ig-unmutated and Ig-mutated CLL subtypes. Here, we have profiled an expanded cohort of 107 patients and show that ZAP-70 is the gene that best distinguishes the CLL subtypes. Ig-unmutated CLL expressed ZAP-70 5.54-fold more highly than Ig-mutated CLL (P < 10(-21)). ZAP-70 expression correctly predicted IgVH mutation status in 93% of patients. ZAP-70 expression and IgVH mutation status were comparable in their ability to predict time to treatment requirement following diagnosis. In 7 patients, ZAP-70 expression and IgVH mutation status were discordant: 4 Ig-mutated CLLs had high ZAP-70 expression and 3 Ig-unmutated CLLs had low ZAP-70 expression. Among these ZAP-70 ""outliers,"" those with Ig-mutated CLL had clinical features that are uncharacteristic of this CLL subtype: 2 required early treatment and 2 used a mutated VH3-21 gene, an IgVH gene that has been associated with progressive disease.

The goal of this work was to determine whether generation and recycling of MPO-catalyzed phenoxyl radicals of a vitamin E homologue, 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-hydroxychromane (PMC), by physiologically relevant intracellular reductants such as ascorbate/lipoate could be demonstrated in intact MPO-rich human leukemia HL-60 cells. A model system was developed to show that MPO/H(2)O(2)-catalyzed PMC phenoxyl radicals (PMC*) could be recycled by ascorbate or ascorbate/dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) to regenerate the parent compound. Absorbance measurements demonstrated that ascorbate prevents net oxidation of PMC by recycling the phenoxyl radical back to the parent compound. The presence of DHLA in the reaction mixture containing ascorbate extended the recycling reaction through regeneration of ascorbate. DHLA alone was unable to prevent PMC oxidation. These conclusions were confirmed by direct detection of PMC* and ascorbate radicals formed during the time course of the reactions by EPR spectroscopy. Based on results in the model system, PMC* and ascorbate radicals were identified by EPR spectroscopy in ascorbate-loaded HL-60 cells after addition of H(2)O(2) and the inhibitor of catalase, 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). The time course of PMC* and ascorbate radicals was found to follow the same reaction sequence as during their recycling in the model system. Recycling of PMC by ascorbate was also confirmed by HPLC assays in HL-60 cells. Pre-loading of HL-60 cells with lipoic acid regenerated ascorbate and thus increased the efficiency of ascorbate in recycling PMC*. Lipoic acid had no effect on PMC oxidation in the absence of ascorbate. Thus PMC phenoxyl radical does not directly oxidize thiols but can be recycled by dihydrolipoate in the presence of ascorbate. The role of phenoxyl radical recycling in maintaining antioxidant defense and protecting against cytotoxic and genotoxic phenolics is discussed.","['Kagan, V E', 'Kuzmenko, A I', 'Shvedova, A A', 'Kisin, E R', 'Li, R', 'Martin, I', 'Quinn, P J', 'Tyurin, V A', 'Tyurina, Y Y', 'Yalowich, J C']","['Kagan VE', 'Kuzmenko AI', 'Shvedova AA', 'Kisin ER', 'Li R', 'Martin I', 'Quinn PJ', 'Tyurin VA', 'Tyurina YY', 'Yalowich JC']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Pittsburgh, 3343 Forbes Ave, PA 15260, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Ascorbic Acid/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromans/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Free Radicals/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Phenols/metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Substrate Cycling/drug effects', 'Thioctic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism']",2003/02/22 04:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/02/22 04:00'],"['2003/02/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0304416502005093 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-4165(02)00509-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2003 Mar 17;1620(1-3):72-84. doi: 10.1016/s0304-4165(02)00509-3.,,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Phenols)', '3229-70-7 (phenoxy radical)', '73Y7P0K73Y (Thioctic Acid)', '7NV2KHU5JA (dihydrolipoic acid)', '950-99-2 (2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-1-hydroxychroman)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",,,,"['CA 90787-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77468/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL64145-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

It is naturally found in legumes, wheat bran, and soy foods. It is believed to be the active ingredient that gives these substances their cancer fighting abilities. Proposed mechanisms of action include gene alteration, enhanced immunity, and anti-oxidant properties. METHODS: A Medline search from 1966 to May 2002 using the keywords phytic acid and cancer, and limiting the search to the subheadings of therapeutic uses, prevention, and adverse effects revealed 28 studies. These studies were included in the review. RESULTS: A great majority of the studies were done in animals and showed that phytic acid had anti-neoplastic properties in breast, colon, liver, leukemia, prostate, sarcomas, and skin cancer. There were no human studies. Side effects included chelation of multivalent cations, and an increase in bladder and renal papillomas. This increase in papilloma formation only occurred with the sodium salt of phytic acid. It did not occur with either the potassium or magnesium salts. CONCLUSIONS: There is a large body of animal evidence to show that phytic acid may have a role in both the prevention and treatment of many forms of cancer. There is clearly enough evidence to justify the initiation of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in humans.","['Fox, C H', 'Eberl, M']","['Fox CH', 'Eberl M']","['Department of Family Medicine, State University of New York at Buffalo, ECMC, Clinical Center, Buffalo, 14215, USA. cfox@buffalo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Scotland,Complement Ther Med,Complementary therapies in medicine,9308777,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Phytic Acid/*pharmacology']",2003/02/22 04:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/02/22 04:00'],"['2003/02/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0965229902000924 [pii]', '10.1016/s0965-2299(02)00092-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Complement Ther Med. 2002 Dec;10(4):229-34. doi: 10.1016/s0965-2299(02)00092-4.,,48,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7IGF0S7R8I (Phytic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate how the TL/CD8alphaalpha interaction influences TCR signaling, we characterized the structure of the TL/CD8alphaalpha complex using X-ray crystallography. Unlike antigen-presenting molecules, the TL antigen-binding groove is occluded by specific conformational changes. This feature eliminates antigen presentation, severely hampers direct TCR recognition, and prevents TL from participating in the TCR activation complex. At the same time, the TL/CD8alphaalpha interaction is strengthened through subtle structure changes in the TL alpha3 domain. Thus, TL functions to sequester and redirect CD8alphaalpha away from the TCR, modifying lck-dependent signaling.","['Liu, Yiwei', 'Xiong, Yi', 'Naidenko, Olga V', 'Liu, Jin-huan', 'Zhang, Rongguang', 'Joachimiak, Andrzej', 'Kronenberg, Mitchell', 'Cheroutre, Hilde', 'Reinherz, Ellis L', 'Wang, Jia-huai']","['Liu Y', 'Xiong Y', 'Naidenko OV', 'Liu JH', 'Zhang R', 'Joachimiak A', 'Kronenberg M', 'Cheroutre H', 'Reinherz EL', 'Wang JH']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Immunity,Immunity,9432918,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CD8 Antigens/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2003/02/22 04:00,2003/03/26 05:00,['2003/02/22 04:00'],"['2003/02/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1074-7613(03)00027-X [pii]', '10.1016/s1074-7613(03)00027-x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunity. 2003 Feb;18(2):205-15. doi: 10.1016/s1074-7613(03)00027-x.,,,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 antigen, alpha chain)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",,,,"['AI45022/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI50263/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM56008/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical and sonographic records of all patients seen at our clinic from July 1985 through December 2000 to identify patients with a sonographic diagnosis of spontaneous nontraumatic splenic rupture. We then examined the features of the resulting cases to identify patients in whom NTISPs were revealed by color Doppler sonography. RESULTS: In total, 41 patients were identified. Among those patients, 5 (12%) had NTISPs. Three of those 5 patients had an underlying malignant disorder (1 case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 2 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia), and the other 2 had an inflammatory disease (1 case of endocarditis and 1 case of pancreatitis). Three of the patients also had splenic infarctions. Three patients underwent splenectomy; in 2 of them, secondary delayed splenic rupture occurred before or during splenectomy. In 2 other patients, spontaneous thrombosis of the aneurysms occurred (after 16 hours in 1 and 15 days in the other). CONCLUSIONS: NTISPs may occur in about 12% of patients with sonographically detected nontraumatic spontaneous splenic rupture. NTISPs appear to be associated with an increased risk of secondary delayed splenic rupture, although spontaneous thrombosis may occur. Short-term follow-up sonographic examinations, particularly with color Doppler imaging, are recommended for early recognition of progression of NTISPs, which can guide treatment decisions.","['Gorg, Christian', 'Colle, Julia', 'Wied, Mathias', 'Schwerk, Wolf B', 'Zugmaier, Gerhard']","['Gorg C', 'Colle J', 'Wied M', 'Schwerk WB', 'Zugmaier G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Philipps University, Baldingerstrasse, 35043 Marburg/Lahn, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Ultrasound,Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,0401663,IM,"['Aneurysm, False/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rupture, Spontaneous/diagnostic imaging', '*Splenic Artery/diagnostic imaging', 'Splenic Infarction/complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Splenic Rupture/complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color']",2003/02/21 04:00,2003/06/20 05:00,['2003/02/21 04:00'],"['2003/02/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcu.10145 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Ultrasound. 2003 Mar-Apr;31(3):129-34. doi: 10.1002/jcu.10145.,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two fusion genes are created by this translocation: bcr/abl and abl/bcr. The fusion regions of both translocation products are unique and strictly limited to leukemia cells, giving rise to potential tumor-specific antigens. Although several studies on the immunogenicity of peptides spanning the bcr/abl fusion region have been reported, little is known about the corresponding reciprocal translocation product abl/bcr. Here we report that synthetic peptides representing the fusion region of the abl/bcr forms a1bb3 and a1bb4 can be specifically recognized by HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes from healthy donors. Furthermore, HLA-matched a1bb3-expressing CML cells can be recognized by a1bb3-specific HLA-A2-restricted T cells, indicating natural processing and presentation of abl/bcr protein by leukemia cells. Moreover, a 19-mer peptide encompassing this class I-binding sequence also elicited a1bb3-specific class II-restricted T-cell responses. Thus, both class I- and class II-restricted T-cell responses can be stimulated in healthy donors by abl/bcr peptides in vitro. Because abl/bcr is expressed in the majority of CML patients, it may represent a highly leukemia-specific antigen with potential use in immunotherapy.","['Wagner, Wolfgang M', 'Ouyang, Qin', 'Pawelec, Graham']","['Wagner WM', 'Ouyang Q', 'Pawelec G']","['Section for Transplantation Immunology and Immunohaematology, Second Department of Internal Medicine, Tubingen University Medical School, Tubingen, Germany. w.wagner@uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2003/02/21 04:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['2003/02/21 04:00'],"['2002/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-002-0362-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2003 Feb;52(2):89-96. doi: 10.1007/s00262-002-0362-7.

Its major use is in transdermal patches for the treatment of motion sickness. Scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate was selected for study because of considerable human exposure resulting from its use in prescription and over-the-counter preparations. Scopolamine was a suspect carcinogen because it contains an aliphatic epoxide moiety which may act as a biological alkylating agent. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice received scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate (89% pure) in distilled water by gavage for 16 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were administered 0, 75, 150, 300, 600, or 1,200 mg scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate/kg body weight in distilled water by gavage for 16 days. All rats survived to the end of the study. The final mean body weights and body weight gains of males receiving 600 and 1,200 mg/kg and the mean body weight gain of males receiving 300 mg/kg were significantly lower than those of the control group. Clinical findings included bilateral pupillary dilation in all dosed animals and red eyelids in males and females receiving 1,200 mg/kg. There were no significant treatment-related gross or microscopic lesions. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were administered 0, 150, 250, 450, 900, or 1,800 mg scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate/kg body weight in distilled water by gavage for 16 days. One male and two females receiving 1,800 mg/kg and one female receiving 150 mg/kg died during the study. The final mean body weights and body weight gains of dosed mice were similar to those of the control groups. Clinical findings related to scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate administration included bilateral pupillary dilation and squinting in all dosed males and females. The relative liver weights of males receiving 1,800 mg/kg and of females in all dosed groups were significantly greater than those of the control groups. There were no significant treatment-related gross or microscopic lesions. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered 0, 15, 45, 135, 400, or 1,200 mg scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate/kg body weight in distilled water by gavage for 14 weeks. One female receiving 45 mg/kg, one male and one female receiving 135 mg/kg, six males and one female receiving 400 mg/kg, and eight males and seven females receiving 1,200 mg/kg died during the study. The final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of all dosed males and females were significantly lower than those of the control groups. Clinical findings included bilateral pupillary dilation in all dosed males and females and reddening of the eyes in 15 mg/kg males and 135, 400, and 1,200 mg/kg males and females. Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and/or erythrocyte count in male and female rats receiving 45 mg/kg or greater were slightly higher than those of the control groups. In general, these changes were most prominent in rats in the 400 and 1,200 mg/kg groups. Higher hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and erythrocyte count were likely due to hemoconcentration from dehydration (relative erythrocytosis). A minimal to mild mature neutrophilia, evidenced by higher segmented neutrophil numbers than in the control group, occurred in all dosed male rats. Sperm morphology and vaginal cytology parameters in dosed rats were similar to those in the control groups. Nine male and five female dosed rats died from esophageal obstructions consisting of feed and bedding material in the posterior pharynx. Tracheal obstruction occurred concurrently with esophageal obstruction as a result of food build-up in the oropharyngeal region. This condition is considered to be secondary to the inhibitory effects of scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate on salivary gland secretions and on esopon esophageal smooth muscle involved in swallowing. There were no other significant treatment-related gross or microscopic findings. 14-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were administered 0, 15, 45, 135, 400, or 1,200 mg scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate/kg body weight in distilled water by gavage for 14 weeks. One male receiving 135 mg/kg and two males and one female receiving 1,200 mg/kg died during the study. The final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of all dosed male groups and females receiving 45 mg/kg and above were significantly lower than those of the control groups. Clinical observations included bilateral pupillary dilation, hyperactivity, and hypoactivity. A minimal to mild mature neutrophilia, similar to that which occurred in the 14-week rat study, occurred in male mice receiving 45 mg/kg or greater. As in the rat study, there was no microscopic evidence of inflammation that could account for the neutrophilia. The estrous cycle length of 1,200 mg/kg females was significantly greater than that in the control group. There were no significant treatment-related gross or microscopic lesions. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 60 male and 60 female rats were administered 0, 1, 5, or 25 mg scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate/kg body weight in distilled water by gavage for 104 weeks. Ten males and ten females from each dose group, excluding the 1 mg/kg female group, were evaluated at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, Clinical Findings, and Ophthalmic Examination Findings: The survival rates of female rats receiving 1 and 25 mg/kg were significantly lower than that of the control group. Mean body weights of 1 and 5 mg/kg males and females were similar to those of the controls throughout the study. However, mean body weights of 25 mg/kg males and females were generally lower than those of the control groups after about week 25. Clinical findings included bilateral pupillary dilation in all dosed males and females. Ophthalmic examination revealed no significant findings. Hematology: Compared to controls, hematocrit was slightly higher in the 25 mg/kg male rats, similar to the effects observed in the 14-week study; this is consistent with dehydration resulting in hemoconcentration. Reticulocyte numbers in the 25 mg/kg female rats were slightly lower than those in the controls. This result is consistent with the lower body weights, and thus a decreased nutritional status, exhibited by these animals. Plasma Scopolamine Determinations: The serum scopolamine concentrations were 6 ng scopolamine/mL serum for the 5 mg/kg female sample and 12 and 28 ng/mL for the 25 mg/kg male and female samples, respectively. The amounts of scopolamine in the other serum samples were below the minimum detection limit (4 ng/mL) of the analysis method. Neurobehavioral Findings: Horizontal motor activity of 25 mg/kg females was significantly greater than that of the control group on days 90, 180, and 360. Startle response of 5 and 25 mg/kg females was significantly lower than that of the control group on day 90. On day 180, passive avoidance of 25 mg/kg males was significantly lower than that of the control group. Pathology Findings: The incidences of adenoma of the pituitary gland pars distalis decreased with increasing dose in both male and female rats; however, this trend was only significant in males (males: vehicle control, 19/49; 1 mg/kg, 17/49; 5 mg/kg, 13/50; 25 mg/kg, 10/50; females: 20/50, 13/60, 14/50, 10/50). The incidences of adenoma of the pituitary gland pars distalis in 25 mg/kg males and all groups of dosed females were below the NTP historical control range. The incidences of hyperplasia were not significantly different from those in the control groups. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in 25 mg/kg males and females were significantly lower than those of the control groups (males: 33/50, 21/50, 26/50, 24/50; females: 20/50, 6/60, 13/50, 4/50). The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in females receiving 25 mg/kg was well below the NTP historical range. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 70 male and 70 female mice were administered 0, 1, 5, or 25 mg scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate/kg body weight in distilled water by gavage for 104 to 105 weeks. Ten control animals and ten animals from each dose level were evaluated at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, Clinical Findings, and Ophthalmic Examination Findings Survival of dosed males and females was similar to that of the controls. The mean body weights of males and females receiving 1 mg/kg were similar to those of the control groups throughout the majority of the study. The mean body weights of 5 mg/kg males and females were slightly lower than those of the controls. The mean body weights of males and females receiving 25 mg/kg were lower than those of the control groups after week 13. Clinical findings included bilateral pupillary dilation in all dosed male and female groups. Ophthalmic examination revealed no significant findings. Hematology: Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and erythrocyte count in 25 mg/kg female mice were slightly lower than those in the control group. These results are consistent with development of a minimal normocytic, normochromic nonresponsive anemia. The anemia may be related to the lower body weights exhibited by these animals and are presumed to be due to a decreased nutritional status. Pathology Findings: The combined incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms (adenoma or carcinoma) occurred with a significant negative trend in males and females (males: vehicle control, 30/50; 1 mg/kg, 33/50; 5 mg/kg, 14/50; 25 mg/kg, 15/50; females: 22/51, 21/50, 16/50, 9/51). The combined incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms in 5 and 25 mg/kg males were within the NTP historical control range. The incidences of clear cell foci and eosinophilic foci in dosed male groups, and eosinophilic foci in 25 mg/kg females, were significantly lower than those of the control groups. The incidences of many spontaneously occurring nonneoplastic lesions were significantly lower in dosed mice than in the control groups and usually decreased with increasing dose. These included kidney nephropathy, alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, hyperplasia of the pancreatic islets, bone marrow myelofibrosis, hyperplasia of the pituitary gland pars distalis, cystic hyperplasia of the uterus, and hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen. The decreased incidences of these spontaneous lesions were most likely a result of lower body weights in dosed animals. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate did not induce mutations in any of five strains of Salmonella typhi murium, with or without S9 metabolic activation enzymes, nor did it induce sister chromatid exchanges in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9. A weakly positive response was obtained, however, in a chromosomal aberrations test conducted in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells with very high doses of scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate in the presence of S9; without S9, no increase in aberrations was noted. Despite the evidence for chromosomal damage observed in vitro, no increase in the frequencies of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes was observed in peripheral blood samples of male or female mice exposed to scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate for 14 weeks by gavage. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate in male or female F344/N rats or B6C3F1 mice administered 1, 5, or 25 mg/kg.

It is also an ingredient of various incenses or room odorizers and is used as a euphoric. The chemical has also been used as a jet propellant and in the preparation of fuels. Isobutyl nitrite was nominated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to the NTP for toxicology and carcinogenicity studies because of its possible contribution to the high incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma among male homosexual acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients and because of the lack of available data on the potential carcinogenicity of isobutyl nitrite. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to isobutyl nitrite (purity of 93% or greater) by inhalation for 16 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse peripheral blood. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 100, 200, 400, 600, or 800 ppm (approximately 420, 840, 1,700, 2,500, or 3,300 mg/m(3)) isobutyl nitrite by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for a total of 12 exposures during a 16-day period. All males and females exposed to 600 or 800 ppm and one 400 ppm female died on the first day of the study. Final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of 400 ppm males and females were significantly lower than those of the controls. Clinical findings observed in 400 ppm males and females included ocular discharge, lethargy, hunched posture, and rough coats. Absolute and relative lung weights of all exposed groups of males and of 200 and 400 ppm females were less than those of the controls. Chemical-related hyperplasia of the bronchial epithelium was observed in 200 and 400 ppm males and females and hyperplasia of the nasal turbinate epithelium was observed in rats exposed to 400 ppm or less. Hemosiderin pigmentation was observed in the spleen of 200 and 400 ppm males and females and bone marrow hematopoietic hyperplasia was observed in rats exposed to 400 ppm or less. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 100, 200, 400, 600, or 800 ppm (approximately 420, 840, 1,700, 2,500, or 3,300 mg/m(3)) isobutyl nitrite by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for a total of 12 exposures during a 16-day period. Three males and four females exposed to 800 ppm died before the end of the study. Final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of 600 and 800 ppm males and females were significantly lower than those of the controls. Mice exposed to 400 ppm or greater were lethargic and exhibited hunched posture and rough coats. Absolute and relative lung weights of 600 and 800 ppm males and the relative lung weight of 600 ppm females were significantly greater than those of the controls. Chemical-related hyperplasia of the bronchiolar epithelium was observed in all exposed groups of males and females. Lymphocytic atrophy of the spleen and thymus was observed in males and females exposed to 400 ppm or greater. 13-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 10, 25, 75, 150, or 300 ppm (approximately 42, 105, 315, 630, or 1,260 mg/m(3)) isobutyl nitrite by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 13 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of 300 ppm males and females were significantly lower than those of the controls, as was the mean body weight gain of 150 ppm females. Clinical findings observed during the study included ruffled fur in 300 ppm males and females, hypoactivity in 300 ppm males, and hyperactivity in 150 and 300 ppm females. A very mild chemical-related methemoglobinemia and anemia occurred in male and female rats in the 75, 150, and 300 ppm groups. Hematopoietic hyperplasia occurred in the bone marrow of all exposed groups of males and females and was considered to be a secondary response to the anemia and methed methemoglobinemia. There was minimal hemosiderin pigment accumulation in the spleens of males and females exposed to 75 ppm or greater, mild to moderate epithelial cell hyperplasia of the nasal mucosa was observed in 300 ppm males and females, and minimal hyperplasia occurred in 150 ppm males and females. Hyperplasia of the bronchial epithelium was observed in 300 ppm males and females. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 10, 25, 75, 150, or 300 ppm (approximately 42, 105, 315, 630, or 1,260 mg/m(3)) isobutyl nitrite by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 13 weeks. There were no chemical-related deaths. Final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of 150 and 300 ppm females were significantly less than those of the controls. Final mean body weights and mean body weight gains of exposed groups of males were similar to those of the controls. There were no chemical-related clinical findings. A very mild chemical-related methemoglobinemia occurred in male and female mice in the 150 and 300 ppm groups. A very mild anemia occurred in the 300 ppm groups. In the lung, increased incidences of mild to moderate hyperplasia of the bronchiolar epithelium occurred in males and females exposed to 300 ppm. Minimal hyperplasia occurred in males exposed to 75 ppm or greater and in females exposed to 150 ppm. Minimal epithelial cell hyperplasia of the nasal mucosa was observed in 300 ppm males. Increased hematopoiesis of the spleen, secondary to the hematotoxicity, occurred in males exposed to 75 ppm or greater and in females exposed to 150 or 300 ppm. Increased hemosiderosis of the spleen occurred in males exposed to 300 ppm and in females exposed to 75 ppm or greater. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Based on the low final mean body weights, anemia, and the mild to moderate nasal mucosal lesions and the hyperplastic bronchial lesions observed in 300 ppm males and females, isobutyl nitrite exposure concentrations selected for the 2-year inhalation study in rats were 37.5, 75, and 150 ppm. Groups of 56 male and 56 female rats were exposed to 0, 37.5, 75, or 150 ppm (equivalent to 0, 158, 315, or 630 mg/m(3)) isobutyl nitrite by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 103 weeks. Ten male and 10 female rats from each group were evaluated at 15 months for clinical pathology and histopathology. Survival, Body Weights, Clinical Findings, Hematology, and Clinical Chemistry: Survival rates of exposed groups of rats were greater than those of the controls, and the survival rates of 75 and 150 ppm males were significantly greater than that of the control. Mean body weights of 150 ppm males and females were 3&percnt; to 11&percnt; lower than those of the controls throughout the course of the study. There were no clinical findings considered to be related to isobutyl nitrite exposure. A very mild methemoglobinemia and anemia occurred in male and female rats exposed to 75 or 150 ppm. Pathology Findings: Incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) occurred with significant positive trends in exposed males and females, and the incidences of these neoplasms in 75 ppm males and in 150 ppm males and females were significantly greater than those in the controls. The incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinoma was significantly greater in 150 ppm male rats than that in the controls. The incidences of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia were also increased in 75 and 150 ppm males and in all exposed groups of females. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in exposed groups of males and females were significantly less than those in the controls. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Based on the low final mean body weight of 300 ppm females and the mild to moderate bronchiolar hyperplasia observed in 300 ppm males and females, isobutyl nitrite exposure concentrations selected for the 2-year inhalation study in mice were 37.5, 75, and 150 ppm. Groups of 60 male and 60 female mice were exposed to 0, 37.5, 75, or 150 ppm (equivalent to 0, 158, 315, or 630 mg/m(3)) isobutyl nitrite by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 103 weeks. As many as 10 male and 10 female mice from each group were evaluated at 15 months for clinical pathology and histopathology. Survival, Body Weights, Clinical Findings, and Hematology and Clinical Chemistry: Survival rates of exposed groups of males were similar to those of the controls. Survival rates of exposed groups of females were greater than those of the controls, and the survival rate in 37.5 ppm females was significantly greater than that of the controls. Mean body weights of exposed groups of males and of 37.5 and 75 ppm females were similar to those of the controls throughout the study. Mean body weights of 150 ppm females were lower than those of the controls from week 20 until the end of the study. There were no biologically significant clinical findings noted in the 2-year study in mice. A very mild methemoglobinemia and anemia occurred in male and female mice exposed to 75 or 150 ppm. Pathology Findings: Incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) occurred with significant positive trends in exposed males and females, and the incidences of these neoplasms were significantly greater than those in the controls in 75 ppm males and in 150 ppm males and females. Incidences of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia were significantly increased in 75 and 150 ppm male and female mice. Thyroid gland follicular cell adenoma occurred with a significant positive trend in male mice; the incidences of thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia were increased in all exposed groups of males, and the incidences in males exposed to 37.5 or 150 ppm were significantly greater than those in the controls. Incidences of serous exudate and olfactory epithelium atrophy in the nose of 150 ppm females were significantly greater than those in the controls. Incidences of minimal to mild hemosiderin pigment in the spleen of 75 and 150 ppm male mice were significantly greater than those in the controls. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Isobutyl nitrite was found to be mutagenic in vitro and in vivo. It induced base-pair substitution mutations in Salmonella typhimurim strains TA100 and TA1535 and sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Positive responses in the S. typhimurium tests required S9 activation, but isobutyl nitrite induced chromosomal effects in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells with and without S9. In vivo, no induction of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations was noted in the germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster exposed to isobutyl nitrite via feeding or injection. However, significant increases in micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes were observed in the peripheral blood of male and female mice treated with isobutyl nitrite for 90 days by inhalation. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of isobutyl nitrite in male and female F344/N rats based on the increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of isobutyl nitrite in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on the increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in males and females. The increased incidence of thyroid gland follicular cell adenoma in male mice may have been related to isobutyl nitrite exposure. Exposure of rats and mice to isobutyl nitrite by inhalation for 2 years resulted in increased incidences of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia (male and female rats and mice), thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia and splenic hemosiderin pigmentation (male mice), and serous exudate and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium of the nose (female mice). Exposure of rats to isobutyl nitrite by inhalation for 2 years resulted in decreased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in males and females.",,,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser,National Toxicology Program technical report series,8500747,,,1996/07/01 00:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser. 1996 Jul;448:1-302.,['National Toxicology Program'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tetrafluoroethylene was nominated by the National Cancer Institute for toxicity and carcinogenicity studies based on the potential for human exposure to the chemical due to the large production volume and on the lack of adequate data for tetrafluoroethylene in the literature. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to tetrafluoroethylene (98% to 99% pure) by whole body inhalation exposure for 16 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicity studies were conducted in mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 312, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm tetrafluoroethylene by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for a total of 12 exposures during a 16-day period. All rats survived to the end of the study. The final mean body weights and body weight gains of males and females exposed to 5,000 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls. The mean body weight gain of females exposed to 2,500 ppm was also significantly less than that of the controls. There were no exposure-related clinical findings in male or female rats. There were no significant differences in hematology parameters that were considered to be related to tetrafluoroethylene exposure. Absolute and relative kidney weights of all exposed groups of males were significantly greater than those of the controls, as were those of females in the 2,500 and 5,000 ppm groups. The absolute kidney weight of females exposed to 1,250 ppm was also significantly greater than that of the controls. The relative liver weights of all exposed groups of males and the absolute liver weights of males in the 625 and 2,500 ppm groups were significantly greater than those of the controls. Increased incidences of renal tubule degeneration occurred in males and females exposed to 625 ppm or greater; this lesion was located predominantly at the corticomedullary junction. The severity of degeneration increased with increasing exposure concentration and was slightly greater in males than females. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 312, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm tetrafluoroethylene by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for a total of 12 exposures during a 16-day period. All mice survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights and body weight gains of all exposed groups of mice were similar to those of the controls. There were no exposure-related clinical findings in male or female mice. There were no significant differences in hematology parameters that were considered to be related to tetrafluoroethylene exposure. The absolute and relative liver weights of females exposed to 5,000 ppm were significantly greater than those of the controls, as was the absolute kidney weight of females in that group and the absolute liver weight of females in the 2,500 ppm group. Renal tubule karyomegaly was observed in male and female mice in the 1,250, 2,500, and 5,000 ppm groups, and the severity of this lesion increased with increasing exposure concentration. Karyomegaly was located predominantly in the inner renal cortex. 13-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 9 or 10 female F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 312, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm tetrafluoroethylene by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 13 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. The final mean body weight and body weight gain of males exposed to 5,000 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls, as was the mean body weight gain of females in this exposure group. There were no clinical findings attributed to exposure to tetrafluoroethylene. Exposure of rats to tetrafluoroethylene resulted in a concentration-dependent normocytic, normochromic, nonresponsive anemia consistent with a secondary hypoproliferative anemia. An exposure concentration-dependent proteinuria also occurred, consistent with renal tubule th renal tubule degeneration observed histopathologically. The absolute and relative liver weights of all exposed groups of males and of females in the 5,000 ppm group were significantly greater than those of the controls. The absolute and relative right kidney weights of males and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and of females in the 625 ppm group were also significantly greater than those of the controls. There were no differences in sperm morphology or vaginal cytology parameters between control and exposed groups of rats. Incidences of renal tubule degeneration in males exposed to 625 ppm or greater and in females exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm were significantly greater than those in the controls. Renal lesions were similar to those observed in the 16-day study and were located predominantly at the corticomedullary junction. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 312, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm tetrafluoroethylene by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 13 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights and body weight gains of all exposed groups of male and female mice were generally similar to those of the controls. There were no clinical findings that were considered to be related to tetrafluoroethylene exposure. Exposure of mice to tetrafluoroethylene resulted in a concentration-dependent normocytic, normochromic, nonresponsive anemia, consistent with a secondary hypoproliferative anemia, and in polyuria. Differences in sperm morphology parameters and estrous cycle lengths were not considered to be exposure related. Incidences of karyomegaly of the renal tubule epithelial cells in male and female mice exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater were significantly greater than those in the controls. Karyomegaly was similar to that observed in the 16-day study and was observed primarily in the inner renal cortex. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 60 male rats were exposed to 156, 312, or 625 ppm and groups of 60 female rats were exposed to 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm tetrafluoroethylene by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 104 weeks, with an observation period of 11 days following the final exposure. Ten male and ten female rats from each exposure group were evaluated at 15 months for organ weights and clinical pathology. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: Survival rates of males in the 625 ppm group and of all exposed groups of females were significantly less than those of the controls. Mean body weights of males exposed to 625 ppm were lower than those of the controls from week 81 until the end of the study, and the mean body weight of 1,250 ppm females was slightly lower than that of the controls at the end of the study. The only clinical finding associated with exposure to tetrafluoroethylene was opacity of the eyes in exposed groups of female rats; this change was observed microscopically as cataracts. Hematology, Clinical Chemistry, and Urinalysis: At the 15-month interim evaluation, there were no differences in hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis parameters that were considered to be related to tetrafluoroethylene exposure. Pathology Findings: The absolute and relative kidney weights of males exposed to 625 ppm and females exposed to 1,250 ppm and the absolute kidney weight of females exposed to 625 ppm were significantly greater than those of the controls at the 15-month interim evaluation. At 15 months, renal tubule hyperplasia was observed in one male exposed to 312 ppm and one male and one female exposed to 625 ppm; oncocytic hyperplasia was observed in one female exposed to 1,250 ppm. At the end of the study, incidences of renal tubule adenoma were greater in males and females exposed to 312 ppm or greater than those in the controls. This exposure-related increase was confirmed by examination of step sections (extended evaluations). At the end of the study, the incidences of renal tubule hyperplasia in males exposed to 625 ppm and females exposed to 1,250 ppm were significantly greater than those in the controls. The incidences of renal tubule adenoma and renal tubule adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in the extended evaluations and in the standard and extended evaluations (combined) in the 1,250 ppm female group and the 625 ppm male group were significantly greater than those in the controls, and the incidences occurred with significant positive trends. Oncocytic hyperplasia was observed at the end of the study in one male exposed to 312 ppm and in three females exposed to 1,250 ppm. At 15 months and at the end of the study, the incidences of renal tubule degeneration in all exposed groups of males and in females in the 625 and 1,250 ppm groups were greater than those in the controls. Renal tubule degeneration was similar to that observed in the 13-week study and was located predominantly at the corticomedullary junction. The severity of nephropathy generally increased with increasing exposure concentration in male rats at 15 months and 2 years. The absolute and relative liver weights of females in the 1,250 ppm group and the absolute liver weight of females exposed to 625 ppm were significantly greater than those of the controls at the 15-month interim evaluation. At 2 years, the incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in males exposed to 312 ppm, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in females in all exposed groups, and the incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma in females exposed to 312 or 625 ppm were significantly greater than those in the controls. Also at 2 years, the incidence of hemangiosarcoma in females exposed to 625 ppm was significantly greater than that in the controls. In all exposed groups of males, the incidences of clear cell foci at 15 months were greater than those in the controls; at 2 years, the incidences of eosinophilic foci in all exposed groups of males and the incidences of basophilic and mixed cell foci in males in the 312 and 625 ppm groups were greater than those in the controls. The incidences of mixed cell foci at 15 months in females exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm and at 2 years in females exposed to 1,250 ppm were also significantly greater than those in the controls. At the end of the 2-year study, increased incidences of cystic degeneration occurred in the liver of all exposed groups of males, and increased incidences of hepatic angiectasis were observed in exposed groups of females. Incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in males exposed to 156 ppm and in all exposed groups of females were significantly greater than those in the controls. Incidences of cataracts in females exposed to 1,250 ppm were greater than those in the controls at the end of the 2-year study. At the end of the study, there were slight increases in the incidences of testicular interstitial cell adenoma in rats exposed to 312 or 625 ppm. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 58 male and 58 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm tetrafluoroethylene by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 95 to 96 weeks. Ten male and ten female mice from each exposure group were evaluated at 15 months for organ weights. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: The survival rates of all exposed groups of males and females were significantly less than those of the controls. Because of the reduced survival due to exposure-related liver neoplasms, the study was terminated during week 96. Mean body weights of exposed groups of males and females were generally similar to those of the controls, except at the end of the study, when they were somewhat less than those of the controls. There were no clinical findings related to tetrafluoroethylene exposure. Pathology Findings: At the 15-month interim evaluation, there were no differences in absolute or relative kidney, liver, or lung weights between exposed and control groups of mice. At the end of the study, the incidences of multifocal coagulative necrosis of the liver were increased in males in the 625 and 1,250 ppm groups. Also at the end of the study, females in all exposed groups had greater incidences of hematopoietic cell proliferation in the liver than the controls. Angiectasis occurred in all exposed groups of males and females at 15 months and at the end of the study. At the 15-month interim evaluation, hemangiosarcomas were observed in three males exposed to 1,250 ppm and in one female exposed to 312 ppm. The incidences of hemangiosarcoma in all exposed groups of males and females at the end of the study were significantly greater than those in the controls and exceeded the historical chamber control ranges. Also at the end of the study, the incidences of hemangioma in males and females exposed to 312 ppm and in males exposed to 625 ppm were also significantly greater than those in the controls and exceeded the range in historical chamber controls. At 15 months, hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas occurred in control males and all exposed groups of males and females. Females exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm had significantly greater incidences of eosinophilic foci than the controls at the 15-month interim evaluation. At the end of the study, the incidences of eosinophilic foci in males exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm and in females exposed to 312 or 625 ppm were significantly greater than those in the controls. In male and female mice, increased incidences of a variety of hepatocellular neoplasms, including adenomas, multiple adenomas, carcinomas, and multiple carcinomas, were considered related to tetrafluoroethylene exposure. At the end of the study, the incidences of histiocytic sarcoma (all organs) in all exposed groups of males and females were significantly greater than those in the controls and exceeded the historical control ranges for all organs. The greatest incidences of histiocytic sarcomas were observed in the liver and lung, but these neoplasms were also observed in the spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and kidney. Significantly increased incidences of renal tubule dilatation (males) and karyomegaly (males and females), located predominantly in the inner cortex, were observed in mice exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm at 15 months. At the end of the study, the increased incidences of dilatation and karyomegaly in all exposed groups of males and of karyomegaly in 1,250 ppm females were generally significant. Incidences of hematopoietic cell proliferation in the spleen of all exposed groups of males and females were significantly greater than those in the controls at the end of the study. Additionally, the severity of this lesion increased with increasing exposure concentration. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: No increases in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes were observed in peripheral blood samples obtained from male and female mice at the end of the 13-week inhalation study of tetrafluoroethylene. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of tetrafluoroethylene in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule neoplasms (mainly adenomas) and hepatocellular neoplasms. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of tetrafluoroethylene in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule neoplasms, liver hemangiosarcomas, hepatocellular neoplasms, and mononuclear cell leukemia. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of tetrafluoroethylene in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of liver hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas, hepatocellular neoplasms, and histiocytic sarcomas. Slight increases in the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and testicular interstitial cell adenomas in male rats may have been related to exposure to tetrafluoroethylene.

Groups of male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to technical grade 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol (78.6% pure) in feed for 13 weeks or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, mouse bone marrow, and mouse peripheral blood. 13-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, or 20,000 ppm 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)- 1,3-propanediol for 13 weeks. These levels corresponded to approximately 100, 200, 400, 800, or 1,700 mg 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol/kg body weight (males) and 100, 200, 400, 800, or 1,600 mg/kg (females). No rats died during the studies. The final mean body weights and weight gains of 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 ppm males and females were significantly lower than those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed animals was lower than that by controls at week 1, but was generally similar to or slightly higher than that by controls at week 13. No chemical-related clinical findings were observed. Chemical-related differences in clinical pathology parameters included increased urine volumes accompanied by decreased urine specific gravity and minimally increased protein excretion in 10,000 and 20,000 ppm males. In females, urine parameters were less affected than males. Water deprivation tests demonstrated that male and female rats were able to adequately concentrate their urine in response to decreased water intake. Serum protein and albumin concentrations in female rats exposed to 2,500 ppm and higher were slightly lower than those of the controls. Renal papillary degeneration was present in 5,000 and 10,000 ppm males, and in 20,000 ppm males and females. Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was present in 20,000 ppm males. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 625, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol for 13 weeks. These levels corresponded to approximately 100, 200, 500, 1,300, or 3,000 mg 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol/kg body weight (males) and 140, 300, 600, 1,200, or 2,900 mg/kg (females). One control female, two males and one female receiving 625 ppm, one female receiving 1,250 ppm, one female receiving 2,500 ppm, one female receiving 5,000 ppm, and three males receiving 10,000 ppm died during the study. The final mean body weights and body weight gains of males and females receiving 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm and of females receiving 625 ppm were significantly lower than those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed mice was generally higher than that by controls throughout the study. Clinical findings included abnormal posture and hypoactivity in 10,000 ppm male and female mice. Blood urea nitrogen concentrations of 5,000 ppm females and 10,000 ppm males and females were greater than those of controls. Also, urine specific gravity was lower in 10,000 ppm females. Differences in organ weights generally followed those in body weights. Papillary necrosis, renal tubule regeneration, and fibrosis were observed in the kidneys of 2,500 and 5,000 ppm males and 10,000 ppm males and females. Urinary bladder hyperplasia was observed in 5,000 and 10,000 ppm males and females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 60 male and 60 female rats received 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)- 1,3-propanediol in feed for 104 to 105 weeks. Groups of 70 males and 60 females received 0 ppm 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol in feed for 104 to 105 weeks. A stop-exposure group of 70 male rats received 20,000 ppm 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol in feed for 3 months, after which animals received undosed feed for the remainder of the 2-year styear study. Average daily doses of 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol were 100, 200, or 430 mg/kg body weight for males and 115, 230, or 460 mg/kg for females. Stop-exposure males received an average daily dose of 800 mg/kg. Ten animals from the 0 ppm male group and the 20,000 ppm stop-exposure group were evaluated at 3 months; nine or 10 control animals and five to nine animals from each of the continuous-exposure groups were evaluated at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings: Survival of 5,000 and 10,000 ppm continuous-exposure study males and females and 20,000 ppm stop-exposure males was significantly lower than that of the controls. Mean body weights of exposed male and female rats receiving 10,000 ppm and stop-exposure males receiving 20,000 ppm were lower than those of the controls throughout most of the study. In the continuous-exposure study, feed consumption by exposed rats was generally similar to that by controls throughout the study. In 20,000 ppm stop-exposure males, the feed consumption was lower than that by controls. Clinical findings included skin and/or subcutaneous masses on the face, tail, and the ventral and dorsal surfaces of exposed rats. Pathology Findings: In the 2-year continuous and stop-exposure studies in male rats, exposure to 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol was associated with neoplastic effects in the skin, mammary gland, Zymbal's gland, oral cavity, esophagus, forestomach, small and large intestines, mesothelium, urinary bladder, lung, thyroid gland, hematopoietic system, and seminal vesicle. Nonneoplastic effects in the kidney, lung, thyroid gland, seminal vesicle, pancreas, urinary bladder, and forestomach were also observed. In females, 2-year exposure to 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol was associated with neoplastic effects in the oral cavity, esophagus, mammary gland, and thyroid gland. Nonneoplastic effects in the kidney were also observed. These findings are outlined in the two summary tables. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male and 60 female mice received 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol in feed for 104 to 105 weeks. Average daily doses of 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol were 35, 70, or 140 mg/kg (males) and 40, 80, or 170 mg/kg (females). Eight to 10 animals from each group were evaluated at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings: Survival of 1,250 ppm males and females was significantly lower than that of the controls. Mean body weights of exposed male and female mice were similar to controls throughout the study. Final mean body weights were also generally similar to those of controls. Feed consumption by exposed male and female mice was similar to that by controls. Clinical findings included tissue masses involving the eye in exposed mice. Pathology Findings: Exposure of male mice to 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol for 2 years was associated with neoplastic effects in the harderian gland, lung, and kidney. Exposure of female mice to 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol was associated with increased incidences of neoplasms of the harderian gland, lung, and skin. Nonneoplastic effects in the lung were also observed in exposed females. These findings are outlined in the two summary tables. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: 2,2-Bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 when tested in the presence of induced 30&percnt; hamster liver S9; all other strain/activation combinations gave negative results. In cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol induced chromosomal aberrations only in the presence of S9; no induction of sister chromatid exchanges was observed in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells after treatment with 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol, with or without S9. In vivo, 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol induced significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes in male and female mice. Significant increases in micronuclei were observed in peripheral blood samples from male and female mice exposed to 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol for 13 weeks via dosed feed. Results of a bone marrow micronucleus test in male mice, where 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol was administered by gavage, were considered to be equivocal due to inconsistent results obtained in two trials. An additional bone marrow micronucleus test was performed with male and female mice and 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol was administered as a single intraperitoneal injection; results of this test were positive in females and negative in males. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,2-bis-(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol (FR-1138) in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, mammary gland, Zymbal's gland, oral cavity, esophagus, forestomach, small and large intestines, mesothelium, urinary bladder, lung, thyroid gland, and seminal vesicle, and the increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the oral cavity, esophagus, mammary gland, and thyroid gland. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the harderian gland, lung, and kidney. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the harderian gland, lung, and subcutaneous tissue. Slight increases in the incidences of neoplasms of the pancreas and kidney in male rats; forestomach in male mice; and forestomach, mammary gland, and circulatory system in female mice may have also been related to treatment. Exposure of male and female rats to 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol was associated with alveolar/bronchiolar hyperplasia in the lung (males only); focal atrophy, papillary degeneration, transitional epithelial hyperplasia (pelvis), and papillary epithelial hyperplasia in the kidney; follicular cell hyperplasia in the thyroid gland (males only); hyperplasia in the seminal vesicle and pancreas (males only); mucosal hyperplasia in the forestomach (males only); and urinary bladder hyperplasia (males only). Exposure of mice to 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol was associated with hyperplasia of the alveolar epithelium in females.

They present as myofibroblastic cell proliferations accompanied by plasmocytes and lymphocytes. Recent cytogenetic and molecular observations showed non-random abnormalities of chromosomal band 2p23 resulting in a rearrangement of the ALK gene. This finding of a specific gene alteration suggests a neoplastic rather than a reactive inflammatory process for IMT tumorigenesis. ALK is a tyrosine kinase oncogene initially found to be rearranged in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCL). Of note, the breakpoints within ALK, and also within some of the ALK fusion gene partners, such as TPM3 or CLTC, are similar in IMT and ALCL. The consistent involvement of ALK, together with the diversity of partner genes, underlines the central role of ALK constitutive activation in IMT development, as well as the importance of homodimerization mechanisms of the chimeric fusion proteins in this activation. Immunohistochemical analyses performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections have shown positive ALK expression with cytoplasmic localization in half of the IMT cases containing the molecular ALK rearrangement. In conclusion, these novel molecular data have defined a group of IMT of neoplastic origin characterized by the presence of ALK alterations. The description of ALK gene rearrangements in IMT and ALCL is the second example, after the observation of ETV6-NTRK3 in congenital fibrosarcoma and in a case of chronic myeloid leukemia, of identical gene fusions occurring in two different cell lines: hematopoietic and mesenchymal. The search for rearrangement of ALK by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a useful complementary tool for IMT diagnosis.","['Sirvent, Nicolas', 'Coindre, Jean-Michel', 'Pedeutour, Florence']","['Sirvent N', 'Coindre JM', 'Pedeutour F']","[""Service de Pediatrie, Hopital de l'Archet, CHU de Nice, 06202 Nice Cedex 3.""]",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Pathol,Annales de pathologie,8106337,IM,"['Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Karyotyping', 'Neoplasms, Muscle Tissue/*genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases']",2003/02/21 04:00,2003/03/26 05:00,['2003/02/21 04:00'],"['2003/02/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['MDOI-AP-12-2002-22-6-0242-6498-101019-ART3 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Pathol. 2002 Dec;22(6):453-60.,,38,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,Tumeurs myofibroblastiques inflammatoires.,,,,,,,

Clinical resistance formation to the BCR-ABL inhibitor STI571 has been observed in patients with advanced chronic myeloid leukemia and was frequently caused by a C to T single nucleotide change in the Abl kinase domain, which substituted Thr-315 with isoleucine and rendered BCR-ABL resistant to STI571 inhibition. The corresponding mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase replaced Thr-766 of the EGFR by methionine and dramatically reduced the sensitivity of EGFR to inhibition by selective 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitors such as PD153035. Inhibitor-resistant EGFR exhibited the same signaling capacity as wild-type receptor in vivo and provides a useful tool for analyzing EGFR-mediated signal transduction.

Role of signal strength and receptor desensitization.,15867-73,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry into CD4(+) cells requires the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 as co-fusion receptors. We have previously demonstrated that chemokine receptors are capable of cross-regulating the functions of each other and, thus, affecting cellular responsiveness at the site of infection. To investigate the effects of chemokine receptor cross-regulation in HIV-1 infection, monocytes and MAGIC5 and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell lines co-expressing the interleukin-8 (IL-8 or CXCL8) receptor CXCR1 and either CCR5 (ACCR5) or CXCR4 (ACXCR4) were generated. IL-8 activation of CXCR1, but not the IL-8 receptor CXCR2, cross-phosphorylated CCR5 and CXCR4 and cross-desensitized their responsiveness to RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) (CCL5) and stromal derived factor (SDF-1 or CXCL12), respectively. CXCR1 activation internalized CCR5 but not CXCR4 despite cross-phosphorylation of both. IL-8 pretreatment also inhibited CCR5- but not CXCR4-mediated virus entry into MAGIC5 cells. A tail-deleted mutant of CXCR1, DeltaCXCR1, produced greater signals upon activation (Ca(2+) mobilization and phosphoinositide hydrolysis) and cross-internalized CXCR4, inhibiting HIV-1 entry. The protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine prevented phosphorylation and internalization of the receptors by CXCR1 activation. Taken together, these results indicate that chemokine receptor-mediated HIV-1 cell infection is blocked by receptor internalization but not desensitization alone. Thus, activation of chemokine receptors unrelated to CCR5 and CXCR4 may play a cross-regulatory role in the infection and propagation of HIV-1. Since DeltaCXCR1, but not CXCR1, cross-internalized and cross-inhibited HIV-1 infection to CXCR4, the data indicate the importance of the signal strength of a receptor and, as a consequence, protein kinase C activation in the suppression of HIV-1 infection by cross-receptor-mediated internalization.","['Richardson, Ricardo M', 'Tokunaga, Kenzo', 'Marjoram, Robin', 'Sata, Tetsutaro', 'Snyderman, Ralph']","['Richardson RM', 'Tokunaga K', 'Marjoram R', 'Sata T', 'Snyderman R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Meharry Medical College, 1005 Dr. D.B.

To identify genes involved in beta-HIVS-induced apoptotic process, we performed cDNA array analysis and found that beta-HIVS suppresses the expression of the gene for a polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) that is involved in control of the cell cycle. When U937 and HL60 cells were treated with 10(-6) M beta-HIVS for 0.5 h, both the amount of PLK1 itself and the kinase activity of this enzyme were decreased. By contrast, Bcr-Abl-positive K562 cells were resistant to the induction of apoptosis by beta-HIVS and this compound did not suppress the kinase activity of PLK1 in these cells. However, simultaneous treatment of K562 cells with both beta-HIVS and STI571, which selectively inhibits the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity of Bcr-Abl, strongly induced apoptosis. Moreover, beta-HIVS increased the inhibitory effect of STI571 on PTK activity. Treatment of K562 cells with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) specific for PLK1 sensitized these cells to the beta-HIVS-induced fragmentation of DNA. These results suggest that suppression of the activity of PLK1 via inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity by beta-HIVS might play a critical role in the induction of apoptosis.","['Masuda, Yutaka', 'Nishida, Ayano', 'Hori, Kouichi', 'Hirabayashi, Takahiro', 'Kajimoto, Sachiko', 'Nakajo, Shigeo', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Asaka, Masahiro', 'Nakaya, Kazuyasu']","['Masuda Y', 'Nishida A', 'Hori K', 'Hirabayashi T', 'Kajimoto S', 'Nakajo S', 'Kondo T', 'Asaka M', 'Nakaya K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo 142-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*pathology', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/enzymology']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/03/15 04:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206200 [doi]', '1206200 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Feb 20;22(7):1012-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206200.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (beta-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases with unmutated V(H) genes, considered to evolve from pregerminal centre (GC) cells, have a worse outcome compared to cases showing mutated V(H) genes, that is, post-GC derived. Also, telomere length has been reported to be of prognostic significance in CLL. Interestingly, telomerase becomes activated during the GC reaction and an elongation of the telomeres occurs in GC B cells. We performed telomere length and V(H) gene analysis in a series of 61 CLL cases, in order to investigate if the unique telomere lengthening shown in GC B cells could reflect the telomere status in the two subsets of mutated and unmutated CLL. A novel association was found between V(H) gene mutation status and telomere length, since significantly shorter telomeres were demonstrated in the unmutated group compared to the mutated group (mean length 4.3 vs 6.3 kbp). Shorter telomeres also constituted a subgroup with a worse prognosis than cases with longer telomeres (median survival 59 vs 159 months). Furthermore, the Ig gene sequence data revealed that samples with high mutations frequency (>6%) had long telomeres ( approximately 8 kbp). Thus, both the telomere and V(H) gene mutation status in CLL appear linked, which may reflect the proliferative history of the clonal cells with regard to the GC reaction.","['Hultdin, M', 'Rosenquist, R', 'Thunberg, U', 'Tobin, G', 'Norrback, K-F', 'Johnson, A', 'Sundstrom, C', 'Roos, G']","['Hultdin M', 'Rosenquist R', 'Thunberg U', 'Tobin G', 'Norrback KF', 'Johnson A', 'Sundstrom C', 'Roos G']","['Department of Medical Biosciences, Pathology, Umea University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Telomere/genetics/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/05 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600763 [doi]', '6600763 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2003 Feb 24;88(4):593-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600763.,,,,,,,,,,PMC2377180,,,,,,,,

Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI) were developed to prevent Ras processing and induce cancer cell death. Several FTIs are in phase II and one is in phase III clinical trials. Preclinically, most of the focus has been on solid tumors, and the effects of FTIs in multiple myeloma have not been investigated. In this study we examined the cytotoxic activity and inhibition of Ras processing in three myeloma cell lines with differing Ras mutation status. H929 cells with activated N-Ras were more sensitive to FTI-277 treatment than 8226 and U266 cells with activated K-Ras or wild-type Ras, respectively. A combination of FTI-277 and a geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor (GGTI)-2166 inhibited K-Ras processing and enhanced cell death in 8226 cells. U266 cells and Bcl-x(L) transfectants were equally sensitive to FTI-277 treatment. Similarly, 8226 cells selected for resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents, which resulted in either P-glycoprotein overexpression, altered topoisomerase II activity, or elevated glutathione levels, were equally sensitive to FTI-277. These preclinical studies suggest that prenylation inhibitors may represent new therapeutic agents for the treatment of refractory or drug-resistant multiple myeloma.","['Bolick, S C E', 'Landowski, T H', 'Boulware, D', 'Oshiro, M M', 'Ohkanda, J', 'Hamilton, A D', 'Sebti, S M', 'Dalton, W S']","['Bolick SC', 'Landowski TH', 'Boulware D', 'Oshiro MM', 'Ohkanda J', 'Hamilton AD', 'Sebti SM', 'Dalton WS']","['Clinical Investigations, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Genes, ras/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Methionine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402832 [doi]', '2402832 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):451-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402832.,,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FTI 277)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)']",,,,"['CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA67771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Nitric oxide (NO) is an important regulator of apoptosis, and the viability of cultured B-CLL cells may be dependent on the autocrine production of nitric oxide by inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2). We performed this study to determine whether cytokine factors that prevent spontaneous in vitroapoptosis of B-CLL cells induce B-CLL cell NOS2 enzyme activity. B-CLL cells expressed NOS enzyme activity and NOS2 protein and mRNA. IL-4 and IFN-gamma increased B-CLL cell NOS2 enzyme activity and protein expression during in vitro culture. IFN-gamma, but not IL-4, increased NOS2 mRNA expression in cultured B-CLL cells suggesting that IL-4-mediated changes of NOS2 protein expression occurred at the post-transcriptional level. We were unable to detect increased concentrations of nitrite or nitrate (NO(x)) as surrogate markers of NO production in B-CLL cell cultures treated with IL-4 or IFN-gamma. IL-4 and IFN-gamma diminished NOS inhibitor-induced B-CLL cell death. In summary, we found that B-CLL cells expressed NOS2 and that IL-4 and IFN-gamma increased B-CLL NOS2 expression. Cytokine-mediated expression of NOS2 by B-CLL cells may promote their survival, and therapeutic strategies that target NOS2 or quench NO may be beneficial in patients with B-CLL.","['Levesque, M C', 'Misukonis, M A', ""O'Loughlin, C W"", 'Chen, Y', 'Beasley, B E', 'Wilson, D L', 'Adams, D J', 'Silber, R', 'Weinberg, J B']","['Levesque MC', 'Misukonis MA', ""O'Loughlin CW"", 'Chen Y', 'Beasley BE', 'Wilson DL', 'Adams DJ', 'Silber R', 'Weinberg JB']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Duke University and Durham VA Medical Centers, Durham, NC 27705, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*genetics', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2001/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402783 [doi]', '2402783 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):442-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402783.,,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Collection was performed between days +9 and +12 and the median number of CD34(+) cells collected was 9.9 x 10(6)/kg (1.1-53.1) and 6.6 x 10(6)/kg (1.4-33.8) for the first and second apheresis, respectively. Despite being previously treated patients, the target CD34(+) cell dose required for SCT was obtained in all patients. SCT was associated with rapid neutrophil and platelet engraftment and a highly significant correlation was observed between the number of CD34(+) cells infused and engraftment. Treatment with SCF plus filgrastim was well tolerated, with mild to moderate local skin rash being the most frequently reported adverse event. In conclusion, addition of r-metHuSCF induces mobilization of a large number of CD34(+) cells which results in shortening of time to engraftment and hospitalization.","['Prosper, F', 'Sola, C', 'Hornedo, J', 'Arbona, C', 'Menendez, P', 'Orfao, A', 'Lluch, A', 'Cortes-Funes, H', 'Lopez, J J', 'Garcia-Conde, J']","['Prosper F', 'Sola C', 'Hornedo J', 'Arbona C', 'Menendez P', 'Orfao A', 'Lluch A', 'Cortes-Funes H', 'Lopez JJ', 'Garcia-Conde J']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia, Hospital Clinico, Universidad de Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Factor/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402750 [doi]', '2402750 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):437-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402750.,,,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'PYB4Q6JG41 (ancestim)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the cell lines are used as in vitro model systems in lieu of primary cell material, it is crucial that the cells in the culture flasks faithfully correspond to the purported objects of study. Obviously, proper authentication of cell line derivation and precise characterization are indispensable requirements to use as model systems. A number of studies has shown an unacceptable level of LL cell lines to be false. We present here the results of authenticating a comprehensively large sample (n = 550) of LL cell lines mainly by DNA fingerprinting and cytogenetic evaluation. Surprisingly, near-identical incidences (ca 15%) of false cell lines were observed among cell lines obtained directly from original investigators (59/395: 14.9%) and from secondary sources (23/155: 14.8%) implying that most cross-contamination is perpetrated by originators, presumably during establishment. By comparing our data with those published, we were further able to subclassify the false cell lines as (1) virtual: cross-contaminated with and unretrievably overgrown by other cell lines during initiation, never enjoying independent existence; (2) misidentified: cross-contaminated subsequent to establishment so that an original prototype may still exist; or (3) misclassified: unwittingly established from an unintended (often normal) cell type. Prolific classic leukemia cell lines were found to account for the majority of cross-contaminations, eg CCRF-CEM, HL-60, JURKAT, K-562 and U-937. We discuss the impact of cross-contaminations on scientific research, the reluctance of scientists to address the problem, and consider possible solutions. These findings provide a rationale for mandating the procurement of reputably sourced LL cell lines and their regular authentication thereafter.","['Drexler, H G', 'Dirks, W G', 'Matsuo, Y', 'MacLeod, R A F']","['Drexler HG', 'Dirks WG', 'Matsuo Y', 'MacLeod RA']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Cell Lineage', 'DNA Fingerprinting/*methods', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphoma', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research/standards', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402799 [doi]', '2402799 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):416-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402799.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten cases of CLL showed no histologic alteration in the second biopsy, and nine cases of CLL underwent morphologic transformation to DLBL in the second biopsy. Using eight microsatellite loci, high level of MSI was associated with Richter's transformation in four cases of CLL, but none of the CLLs displayed this level of MSI without transformation. Mutations of the hMLH1 or hMSH2 genes were not detected in any of the lymphoma samples. In five cases of Richter's transformation the hMLH1 promoter was hypermethylated in both CLL and DLBL samples. Hypermethylation of the hMLH1 promoter associated with high-level of MSI in four cases, and low-level of MSI in one case. These results suggest that in certain cases of Richter's transformation the DNA mismatch-repair defect-initiated genetic instability may play a role in tumor progression.","['Fulop, Z', 'Csernus, B', 'Timar, B', 'Szepesi, A', 'Matolcsy, A']","['Fulop Z', 'Csernus B', 'Timar B', 'Szepesi A', 'Matolcsy A']","['1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Biopsy', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402792 [doi]', '2402792 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):411-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402792.,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that mononuclear cells (MNC) and granulocytes of children with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) suffered minimal telomere shortening throughout therapy (less than 1 kbp; average follow-up, 20 months), while those of children with solid tumors showed greater and more heterogenous telomere attrition (0.5-2.8 kbp, average follow-up, 9 months). In addition, we evaluated the role of telomerase, the enzyme commonly up-regulated in pediatric leukemic and solid tumor cells for telomere length maintenance, as a disease marker.

Differentiated neutrophils are short-lived and die rapidly by apoptosis, while monocytic cells are longer-lived. In this report we used the HL-60 cell line as a model system to identify differences in apoptotic pathways which might account for the differing lifespans of granulocytic vs monocytic cells. We observed that induction of granulocytic differentiation by retinoic acid led to robust activation of the executioner protease caspase-3, and early onset of apoptosis. By contrast, caspase-3 was not appreciably activated during phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced monocytic differentiation, and apoptosis was delayed in these cells. Since the activation of caspase-3 is inhibited by members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) and Bcl-2 protein families, we investigated the expression of anti-apoptotic members of these families. Induction of monocytic differentiation led to marked upregulation of the IAP protein XIAP, as well as the Bcl-2 family member Bcl-X(L). During granulocytic differentiation the levels of XIAP progressively declined, while Bcl-X(L) levels remained unchanged. A different IAP protein, survivin, was downregulated during differentiation along either lineage, as was expression of Bcl-2. The upregulation of Bcl-X(L) during monocytic differentiation coincided with phosphorylation/activation of STAT3, a known activator of bcl-X gene transcription. Moreover, Bcl-X(L) upregulation was dependent on MEK/ERK signaling. Upregulation of XIAP proceeded in a MEK/ERK-independent fashion. Treatment with antisense Bcl-X(L) or XIAP oligonucleotides resulted in significant loss of viability in cells differentiating along the monocytic lineage. Together, these findings indicate that the levels of XIAP and Bcl-X(L) are regulated by distinct pathways during monocytic differentiation, and that upregulation of these proteins contributes to the increased longevity of cells in the monocytic lineage.","['Miranda, M B', 'Dyer, K F', 'Grandis, J R', 'Johnson, D E']","['Miranda MB', 'Dyer KF', 'Grandis JR', 'Johnson DE']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bcl-X Protein']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2001/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402779 [doi]', '2402779 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):390-400. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402779.,,,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '20839-06-9 (phorbol-12-myristate)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Akt1 promotes cell survival and blocks apoptosis. The scope of this paper was to investigate whether a HL60 human leukemia cell clone (named AR) with constitutively active Akt1 was resistant to TRAIL. We found that parental (PT) HL60 cells were very sensitive to a 6 h incubation in the presence of TRAIL and died by apoptosis. In contrast, AR cells were resistant to TRAIL concentrations as high as 2 microg/ml for 24 h. Two pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K, Ly294002 and wortmannin, restored TRAIL sensitivity of AR cells. AR cells stably overexpressing PTEN had lower Akt1 activity and were sensitive to TRAIL. Conversely, PT cells stably overexpressing a constitutive active form of Akt1 became TRAIL resistant. TRAIL activated caspase-8 but not caspase-9 or -10 in HL60 cells. We did not observe a protective effect of Bcl-X(L) or Bcl-2 against the cytotoxic activity of TRAIL, even though TRAIL induced cleavage of BID. There was a close correlation between TRAIL sensitivity and intranuclear presence of the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB. Higher levels of the FLICE inhibitory protein, cFLIP(L), were observed in TRAIL-resistant cells. Both the cell permeable NF-kappaB inhibitor SN50 and cycloheximide lowered cFLIP(L)expression and restored sentivity of AR cells to TRAIL. Our results suggest that Akt1 may be an important regulator of TRAIL sensitivity in HL60 cells through the activation of NF-kappaB and up-regulation of cFLIP(L) synthesis.","['Bortul, R', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Cappellini, A', 'Tabellini, G', 'Billi, A M', 'Bareggi, R', 'Manzoli, L', 'Cocco, L', 'Martelli, A M']","['Bortul R', 'Tazzari PL', 'Cappellini A', 'Tabellini G', 'Billi AM', 'Bareggi R', 'Manzoli L', 'Cocco L', 'Martelli AM']","['Dipartimento di Morfologia Umana Normale, Universita di Trieste, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cytosol/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402793 [doi]', '2402793 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):379-89. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402793.,,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tyrosine phosphatase HePTP was recently demonstrated to regulate ERK activity and changes in HePTP expression have been associated with hematopoietic malignancies. Here, we have studied the function of HePTP during PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. Overexpression of HePTP or inhibition of HePTP expression with antisense cDNA had no effect on PMA-induced cell cycle arrest or upregulation of cyclin D in K562 cells. The expression of megakaryocytic markers such as CD41 and IL6, however, were highly reduced in cells overexpressing HePTP, due to reduced ERK activation, and the cells were impaired in their ability to differentiate. Compared to control cells, HePTP antisense expressing cells did not show increased basal or PMA-induced ERK activity. However, antisense inhibition of HePTP enhanced nuclear translocation of ERK and the expression of the megakaryocytic markers CD41 and IL-6. Interestingly, like cells overexpressing HePTP, morphological differentiation was also impaired in HePTP antisense expressing cells. The results for the first time demonstrate that different aspects of megakaryocytic differentiation have distinct requirements for ERK activity.

The novel combination of genetic material leads to the production of active oncoproteins that depend on the contributions of both constituents.

Of all constructs tested, only MLL-VP16 was able to transform primary bone marrow cells and to induce a block of early myeloid differentiation like an authentic MLL fusion. Interestingly, the transformation capability of the artificial MLL fusions was correlated with the transcriptional potential of the resulting chimeric protein but it was not related to the strength of the isolated transactivation domain that was joined to MLL. These results prove for the first time that a general biological function - transactivation - might be the common denominator of many MLL fusion partners.","['Zeisig, B B', 'Schreiner, S', 'Garcia-Cuellar, M-P', 'Slany, R K']","['Zeisig BB', 'Schreiner S', 'Garcia-Cuellar MP', 'Slany RK']","['Department of Genetics, University of Erlangen, Staudtstrasse 5, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402804 [doi]', '2402804 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):359-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402804.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that depsipeptide (FR901228), a novel HDAC inhibitor evaluated in ongoing clinical trials, restores gene transcription and cell differentiation in AML1/ETO-positive cells. A dose-dependent increase in H3 and H4 histone acetylation was noted in depsipeptide-treated AML1/ETO-positive Kasumi-1 cells and blasts from a patient with t(8;21) AML. Consistent with this biological effect, we also showed a dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity, expression of IL-3, here used as read-out for silenced AML1-target genes, upregulation of CD11b with other morphologic changes suggestive of partial cell differentiation in Kasumi-1 cells. Some of these biologic effects were also attained in other myeloid leukemia cell lines, suggesting that depsipeptide has differentiation and cytotoxic activity in AML cells, regardless of the underlying genomic abnormality. Notably, the activity of depsipeptide was enhanced by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMT). These two agents in combination resulted in enhanced histone acetylation, IL-3 expression, and cytotoxicity, suggesting HDAC and DNMT activities as a potential dual target in future therapeutic strategies for AML1/ETO and other molecular subgroups of AML.","['Klisovic, M I', 'Maghraby, E A', 'Parthun, M R', 'Guimond, M', 'Sklenar, A R', 'Whitman, S P', 'Chan, K K', 'Murphy, T', 'Anon, J', 'Archer, K J', 'Rush, L J', 'Plass, C', 'Grever, M R', 'Byrd, J C', 'Marcucci, G']","['Klisovic MI', 'Maghraby EA', 'Parthun MR', 'Guimond M', 'Sklenar AR', 'Whitman SP', 'Chan KK', 'Murphy T', 'Anon J', 'Archer KJ', 'Rush LJ', 'Plass C', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC', 'Marcucci G']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Depsipeptides', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Histones/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Peptides, Cyclic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402776 [doi]', '2402776 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):350-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402776.,,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)']",,,,"['K08-CA90469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a mutational analysis of the C/EBPalpha gene in the myelodysplastic syndromes and AML with antecedent MDS. No mutations were found in patients with refractory anemia (0/27), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (0/7), refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB 0/16) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML 0/5). One out of 13 patients with RAEB-T/AML secondary to MDS showed a mutation in the C/EBPalpha gene. In this patient a 4 bp insertion disrupted codon 69 in one allele. This novel +1 frame shift is predicted to result in a truncated protein of 107 amino acids. However, the dominant protein translated was the C/EBPalpha isoform p30, which was previously shown to inhibit the DNA-binding and transactivation properties of C/EBPalpha p42. Interestingly this mutation could not be detected at diagnosis in the initial RAEB and RAEB-T stage. The mutation appeared at relapse after chemotherapy for RAEB-T. We conclude that the C/EBPalpha mutation was not essential for the initial blast accumulation. The emergence of a bast clone carrying a C/EBPalpha mutation at relapse indicates that this mutation may confer a growth advantage in a myeloid cell with an established differentiation block.","['Kaeferstein, A', 'Krug, U', 'Tiesmeier, J', 'Aivado, M', 'Faulhaber, M', 'Stadler, M', 'Krauter, J', 'Germing, U', 'Hofmann, W K', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Ganser, A', 'Verbeek, W']","['Kaeferstein A', 'Krug U', 'Tiesmeier J', 'Aivado M', 'Faulhaber M', 'Stadler M', 'Krauter J', 'Germing U', 'Hofmann WK', 'Koeffler HP', 'Ganser A', 'Verbeek W']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2001/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402805 [doi]', '2402805 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):343-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402805.,,,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Very few studies have evaluated the activity of CPT-11 in hematological malignancies. We conducted a phase II trial of CPT-11 in 26 patients with high-risk MDS (RAEB 1: n = 4; RAEB 2: n = 9; MDS having progressed to AML: n = 10; CMML: n = 3) who could not receive anthracycline/cytarabine intensive chemotherapy. Induction therapy consisted of four courses of CPT-11 given intravenously at 200 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks. Patient characteristics were: median age, 71 (range 51-77); sex, (M/F), 21/5, median % marrow blasts cells, 13.5 (range 7-52). Cytogenetics according to IPSS were: low-risk n = 13, intermediate-risk n = 6, high-risk n = 3, failure or not done n = 4. Six patients stopped treatment after only one or two courses of CPT-11 due to severe infection (n = 2), progressive disease (n = 3), acute lysis syndrome with renal failure (n = 1). In the 20 patients who received at least three cycles of CPT-11, complete remission was achieved in one case, partial remission in four cases, and hematological improvement in three cases with an overall response rate of 33% in the 26 patients. Duration of response was short (median 4 months, range 1-6 months) and median survival was 8 months (range 1-23 months). Digestive toxicity (diarrhea) occurred in 26/89 (29%) courses, but was mild (grade 1, 20% courses; grade 2 or 3, 9% courses). Hematological toxicity was difficult to assess in non-responders because of initial pancytopenia, but all the patients who responded had grade 3/4 hematological toxicity associated with grade >/=2 infection requiring hospitalization in 18% of the courses. No other major toxicity was observed. Thus CPT-11 has an interesting activity in MDS with excess of blasts; toxicity is easily managed and most patients can be treated in the out-clinic setting. These results suggest that further evaluation of CPT-11 in MDS is warranted.","['Ribrag, V', 'Suzan, F', 'Ravoet, C', 'Feremans, W', 'Guerci, A', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Damaj, G', 'Vantelon, J M', 'Bourhis, J H', 'Fenaux, P']","['Ribrag V', 'Suzan F', 'Ravoet C', 'Feremans W', 'Guerci A', 'Dreyfus F', 'Damaj G', 'Vantelon JM', 'Bourhis JH', 'Fenaux P']","['Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Irinotecan', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2002/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402726 [doi]', '2402726 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):319-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402726.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with stable or responding disease received two additional cycles on days 29-32 and 43-46. HuM195 was given as first salvage therapy in 24 patients and as second or subsequent salvage therapy in 26 patients.

No hepatic, renal or cardiac toxicities were observed and other adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, mucositis and diarrhea were uncommon or felt to be unrelated to HuM195. In addition, anti-HuM195 responses were not detected. HuM195 as a single agent has minimal, but observable, anti-leukemic activity in patients with relapsed or refractory AML and activity is confined to patients with low burden disease. No significant differences in clinical efficacy or toxicity were seen between the two dose levels of antibody.

Six scoring systems were applied to the patients, and the FAB and WHO classifications were compared. The patients' median age was 57 years. The median survival time was 21 months, and age, dysgranulopoiesis and the IPSS cytogenetic groups were independent prognostic factors for survival. Acute leukemia occurred in 34 patients, and the cumulative incidence was 27.1% at 3 years. Marrow blast percentage was the only independent prognostic factor for acute leukemia evolution. Most scoring systems successfully discriminated risk groups for survival and acute leukemia evolution, but patient distribution into risk groups varied according to the scoring systems. Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and RAEB II seemed to have different prognoses from RA or RARS and RAEB I, respectively. In summary, our MDS patients had different disease natures from those of Western countries regarding clinical features, prognostic factors and cytogenetic profiles. Although the WHO classification seems to improve the FAB classification, further studies are warranted to validate the utility of the WHO classification before it is accepted for routine clinical use. Our study has the limitations of retrospective analysis, and our results should be verified in future prospective studies.","['Lee, J-H', 'Lee, J-H', 'Shin, Y-R', 'Lee, J-S', 'Kim, W-K', 'Chi, H-S', 'Park, C-J', 'Seo, E-J', 'Lee, K-H']","['Lee JH', 'Lee JH', 'Shin YR', 'Lee JS', 'Kim WK', 'Chi HS', 'Park CJ', 'Seo EJ', 'Lee KH']","['Department of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Y', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Korea', 'Leukemia/*classification/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/complications/mortality', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Trisomy', 'World Health Organization']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402798 [doi]', '2402798 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):305-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402798.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inactivating mutations of either SCF or c-kit have been described in mice and lead to increased sensitivity to treatment with ionising radiation. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with high affinity for c-Abl, PDGFR and c-kit. In this study we investigated the effect of concomitant administration of imatinib and idarubicin, an anthracycline with haematosuppressive activity, in nu/nu mice and murine bone marrow cells. Double-treated animals showed significantly increased mortality compared to mice that received imatinib or idarubicin alone only when idarubicin and imatinib were given simultaneously. The combined treatment induced a more severe neutropenia with a slower recovery when compared to mice treated with idarubicin alone. The myeloid metaplasia usually observed in the spleen after idarubicin treatment was absent in mice co-treated with imatinib. Bone marrow from double-treated animals also showed decreased numbers of megakaryocytes and myeloid precursor cells. In vitro culture of murine bone marrow cells in the presence of imatinib inhibited SCF-induced proliferation and recovery from treatment with idarubicin. Our results indicate that the simultaneous administration of imatinib enhances idarubicin-induced haematopoietic toxicity in vivo and in vitro.","['Ruchatz, H', 'Puttini, M', 'Cleris, L', 'Pilotti, S', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, C', 'Formelli, F']","['Ruchatz H', 'Puttini M', 'Cleris L', 'Pilotti S', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Formelli F']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, The National Cancer Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Benzamides', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Spleen/drug effects/pathology', 'Weight Loss']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402800 [doi]', '2402800 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):298-304. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402800.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,['Leukemia. 2004 Apr;18(4):886-7; author reply 887-8.

Allogeneic transplantation during BC or active leukemia is most often unsuccessful due to high-rates of both treatment-related complications and relapse. Long-term results are significantly better if a second chronic phase or remission can be achieved prior to transplantation. Similarly, DLI given for the treatment of post-transplant relapse is more successful when given during a second remission. In this study we report our results with a previously unreported approach consisting of short-term treatment with imatinib mesylate (formerly, STI571) to induce or maintain remission, followed by allogeneic transplantation or DLI and the impact on transplantation/DLI outcome. Sixteen patients were treated either in preparation for transplantation (n = 12), for DLI (n = 1), or for both (n = 3). Ten had CML in BC; seven myeloid and three lymphoid BC. Six patients had Ph(+) ALL. The donors were matched unrelated (n = 9), matched siblings (n = 5) or haplo-identical (n = 2). Eleven of 15 patients given imatinib pre-transplant were transplanted in complete hematologic response. Engraftment and GVHD rates were not different from expected. Seven patients had grade II-III hepatic toxicity after transplantation. After a median follow-up of 10 months (range, 3-16 months) six remain alive, two after further therapy. The 1-year survival rate was 25%. Four patients were given imatinib prior to DLI, all had complete response. Two remain in remission >6 months from relapse. In conclusion, treatment with imatinib allows transplantation in a more favorable status or maintaining remission with low toxicity until transplantation is feasible. Pre-transplant imatinib seems safe and not associated with excess post-transplant complications. Imatinib may have substantial activity in combination with DLI. Further study of a larger group of patients is required to assess the impact on long-term outcome and the role of post-transplant imatinib in controlling residual disease.","['Shimoni, A', 'Kroger, N', 'Zander, A R', 'Rowe, J M', 'Hardan, I', 'Avigdor, A', 'Yeshurun, M', 'Ben-Bassat, I', 'Nagler, A']","['Shimoni A', 'Kroger N', 'Zander AR', 'Rowe JM', 'Hardan I', 'Avigdor A', 'Yeshurun M', 'Ben-Bassat I', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Hematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402808 [doi]', '2402808 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):290-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402808.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of Bcr-Abl-induced transformation is not fully understood. Bcr-Abl is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase with transforming capacity for hematopoietic cells. We demonstrated recently that the Src kinase Hck interacts directly with Bcr-Abl by a kinase-independent mechanism. Moreover, the inhibition of the Hck kinase seems to block some of the transforming effects of Bcr-Abl. To identify the binding domains mediating this interaction of Hck with Bcr-Abl, we co-expressed different plasmid and baculovirus vectors containing mutants or single domains of Bcr-Abl and/or Hck in COS7 and Sf9 cells. At least four independent binding regions for Hck were identified in Bcr-Abl, one in Bcr, one in the region comprising the SH3 and SH2 domain of Abl, one in the SH1 domain of Abl, and one in the C-terminal domain of Abl. In the Hck kinase, deletion of the SH2 and/or the SH3 region abolished binding to Bcr-Abl. In contrast, deletion of the Hck SH1 domain enhanced binding of Hck to Abl and Bcr-Abl. In conclusion, the results indicate that the interaction of Bcr-Abl with Hck is mediated by a novel, complex mechanism that involves multiple domains of Bcr-Abl and the SH2 and SH3 domains of Hck.","['Stanglmaier, M', 'Warmuth, M', 'Kleinlein, I', 'Reis, S', 'Hallek, M']","['Stanglmaier M', 'Warmuth M', 'Kleinlein I', 'Reis S', 'Hallek M']","['GSF - National Institute of Health and Environment, Klinische Kooperationsgruppe fur Gentherapie, Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377 Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Spodoptera', 'Transfection']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2002/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402778 [doi]', '2402778 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Feb;17(2):283-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402778.,,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose minimal diagnostic criteria and a simple classification scheme which, while based on accepted morphological features and conforming with the recent suggestions of the WHO, allows for the special problems of myelodysplastic diseases in children. The classification recognizes three major diagnostic groups: (1) juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), previously named chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia (JCML); (2) myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome, a disease with distinct clinical and biological features, encompassing both MDS and AML occurring in Down syndrome; and (3) MDS occurring both de novo and as a complication of previous therapy or pre-existing bone marrow disorder (secondary MDS).

Immunohistochemical detection of the latter, therefore, is a useful marker for the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma. Nevertheless, interpretation of results is often hampered by the weak immunoreactivity obtained with routine detection techniques. This problem can be overcome by resorting to highly sensitive catalyzed signal amplification methods based on peroxidase-catalyzed deposition of a biotinylated phenolic compound. The present study compares the results obtained with catalyzed signal amplification, labeled streptavidin biotin, and dextran polymeric conjugate (EnVision+) techniques in cyclin D1 demonstration in mantle cell lymphoma. The study was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 20 mantle cell lymphoma cases. Ten cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma and 10 instances of follicular center cell lymphoma were used as controls. Antigen retrieval was done by autoclaving under controlled pressure (2 bar) and temperature (120 degrees C) conditions. The best results were obtained after 1 minute of exposure with catalyzed signal amplification and after 6 minutes with other detection systems. Regarding cyclin D1 expression in mantle cell lymphoma cases, 17 (85%) were weakly positive and 3 (15%), moderately positive with labeled streptavidin biotin, whereas 15 (75%) were weakly positive and 5 (25%) moderately positive with EnVision+. In contrast, all 20 mantle cell lymphoma cases were strongly cyclin D1 positive with catalyzed signal amplification. No evidence of cyclin D1 immunostaining was obtained in any of the small lymphocytic lymphoma and follicular center cell lymphoma instances with any of the three methods used. In conclusion, catalyzed signal amplification methods provide a very useful tool for cyclin D1 demonstration in cases in which other immunohistochemical techniques yield inconclusive results.","['Barranco, Carlos', 'Mate, Jose L', 'Ariza, Aurelio', 'Baro, Teresa', 'Diaz, Esther', 'Munne, Assumpta', 'Serrano, Sergi']","['Barranco C', 'Mate JL', 'Ariza A', 'Baro T', 'Diaz E', 'Munne A', 'Serrano S']","['Department of Pathology, Hospital del Mar, Autonomous University of Barcelona, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis', 'Catalysis', 'Cyclin D1/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', '*Immunoenzyme Techniques/methods', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Peroxidase']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/08/06 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.MP.0000051585.74803.09 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2003 Feb;16(2):161-5. doi: 10.1097/01.MP.0000051585.74803.09.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CAR was low in healthy adult myocardium, whereas strong CAR reexpression was observed in human dilated cardiomyopathy. The molecular mechanisms of CAR induction in cardiomyocytes are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report on CAR regulation during development, CAR induction after myocardial infarction, and cell-to-cell contact-dependent CAR regulation in the rat. The high CAR expression during development in various organs decreased up to 190-fold after birth. After infarction resulting in severe cardiac dysfunction (dP/dt(max), -53%; dP/dt(min), -58%; left ventricular pressure, -45%), CAR was induced locally in cardiomyocytes of the infarct zone, where it was also expressed by capillary-like CD31+ structures and CD18+ interstitial cells, whereas it remained confined to subendothelial layers of arterioles and venules. In cultured cardiomyocytes, endothelin-1, cardiotrophin-1, leukemia-inhibiting factor, and cyclic stretch had no effect on CAR, whereas at high versus low cell density, CAR was suppressed up to 10-fold (P=0.006). Conditioned media from low- or high-density cardiomyocytes or cardiofibroblasts had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: The locally confined CAR upregulation after infarction makes induction by various humoral factors unlikely, because cardiac dysfunction results in high activities of sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems and cytokines. The cell culture experiments identify a cell-to-cell contact-dependent mechanism of CAR regulation. Further characterization of the signals linking cell-to-cell interactions to CAR gene expression may provide insight into mechanisms and functional consequences of the generalized CAR induction in dilated cardiomyopathy, and of its local induction after myocardial infarction.","['Fechner, Henry', 'Noutsias, Michel', 'Tschoepe, Carsten', 'Hinze, Kerstin', 'Wang, Xiaomin', 'Escher, Felicitas', 'Pauschinger, Matthias', 'Dekkers, Dick', 'Vetter, Roland', 'Paul, Martin', 'Lamers, Jos', 'Schultheiss, Heinz-Peter', 'Poller, Wolfgang']","['Fechner H', 'Noutsias M', 'Tschoepe C', 'Hinze K', 'Wang X', 'Escher F', 'Pauschinger M', 'Dekkers D', 'Vetter R', 'Paul M', 'Lamers J', 'Schultheiss HP', 'Poller W']","['Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'CD18 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor-Like Membrane Protein', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Heart/*embryology/growth & development', 'Hemodynamics', 'Male', 'Myocardial Infarction/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myocardium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/03/01 04:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.cir.0000050150.27478.c5 [doi]'],ppublish,Circulation. 2003 Feb 18;107(6):876-82. doi: 10.1161/01.cir.0000050150.27478.c5.,,,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (CLMP protein, human)', '0 (Clmp protein, rat)', '0 (Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor-Like Membrane Protein)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the activation of this signaling pathway in the myocardia of patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a comprehensive expression and activation analysis of IL-6-related cytokines, receptors, signal transducers, and signal transduction inhibitors in left ventricular (LV) myocardia from patients with DCM (n=10) and non-failing (NF) donor hearts (n=5). Differential expression (DCM versus NF) was observed by immunoblotting at each level of the signaling cascade, including receptor ligands (IL-6: -59%, P<0.01; leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF]: +54%, P<0.05), receptor subunits (LIF receptor: -16%, P<0.05), signaling molecules (the Janus kinase TYK2: -48%, P<0.01; STAT3: -47%, P<0.01), and suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS1: +97%, P<0.05; SOCS3: -49%, P<0.01). Tyrosine-phosphorylation status of gp130 was increased (+60%, P<0.05), whereas tyrosine-phosphorylation status of JAK2 was reduced in DCM (-72%, P<0.01). Moreover, as shown by immunohistochemistry, the number of STAT3-positive cardiomyocytes was reduced in DCM (-42%, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Signaling via gp130 and JAK-STAT is profoundly altered in DCM. Importantly, tyrosine-phosphorylation of JAK2 is reduced in the face of increased gp130 phosphorylation, indicating impaired downstream activation of this critical pathway in DCM.","['Podewski, Edith K', 'Hilfiker-Kleiner, Denise', 'Hilfiker, Andres', 'Morawietz, Henning', 'Lichtenberg, Artur', 'Wollert, Kai C', 'Drexler, Helmut']","['Podewski EK', 'Hilfiker-Kleiner D', 'Hilfiker A', 'Morawietz H', 'Lichtenberg A', 'Wollert KC', 'Drexler H']","['Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Heart Ventricles/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Myocardium/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', '*Repressor Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'TYK2 Kinase', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/03/01 04:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.cir.0000057545.82749.ff [doi]'],ppublish,Circulation. 2003 Feb 18;107(6):798-802. doi: 10.1161/01.cir.0000057545.82749.ff.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 protein, human)']",,,['Circulation. 2003 Oct 28;108(17):e129-30; author reply e129-30.

We show that mice doubly deficient in LIF and IGF-I all died at birth of apparent respiratory failure. Growth retardation, muscle hypoplasia and delayed ossification in IGF-I-deficient E18.5 mice were exacerbated by the absence of LIF. The transcription factor Sp3 was decreased in the skeleton of the double null mice. Pronounced depletion of olfactory bulb neurons, in contrast, was only IGF-I-dependent. The lungs displayed reduced air space in the IGF-I-deficient embryos and neonates, phenotype exacerbated in the double nulls, which showed abnormal epithelial cells and decreased Sp3 expression. In addition, the transcription factor TTF-1 and the surfactant protein B were lower in the lung of the double null neonates than in all other genotypes.

We used a novel animal model for T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (TLL) to test the antitumor effect of TNP-470, a well-established angiogenesis inhibitor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells from spontaneously arisen TLL tumors were transferred to syngenic recipients. The mice were treated with TNP-470 (30 mg/kg) or vehicle every other day for 2 weeks. Mice were sacrificed on day 15 after transfer, and body and organ weights were measured. Cell cycle and morphologic analysis was performed on cells and/or sections from selected organs. The cytotoxic effect of TNP-470 was assayed in vitro using the TLL-M and HL-60 cell lines. RESULTS: TNP-470 treatment significantly reduced total tumor load and tumor mass in specific organs infiltrated with lymphoma/leukemia. This was associated with an increased apoptosis in these organs. We also observed side effects of TNP-470 not previously reported, such as diminished extramedullary erythropoiesis and disrupted liver morphology. In vitro TLL-M cells were resistant to cytotoxic effects of moderate doses of TNP-470. CONCLUSIONS: TNP-470 treatment has a beneficial effect on tumor load in the TLL transfer model, most likely caused by the antiangiogenic effect of TNP-470. This is supported by the observation of increased apoptosis in infiltrated organs. The TLL transfer model is well suited for further studies of combinations with TNP-470 or other angiogenesis inhibitors and cytotoxic drugs.","['Noren-Nystrom, Ulrika', 'Eriksson, Maria', 'Eriksson, Bjorn', 'Roos, Goran', 'Bergh, Anders', 'Holmberg, Dan']","['Noren-Nystrom U', 'Eriksson M', 'Eriksson B', 'Roos G', 'Bergh A', 'Holmberg D']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatrics, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclohexanes', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/drug therapy', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'O-(Chloroacetylcarbamoyl)fumagillol', 'Sesquiterpenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02010275 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01027-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Feb;31(2):143-9. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01027-5.,,,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclohexanes)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', 'X47GR46481 (O-(Chloroacetylcarbamoyl)fumagillol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Implications for lymphomagenesis.,131-42,"OBJECTIVE: SHP-1 protein tyrosine phosphatase has been implicated in suppressing B-lymphocyte and myeloid cell malignancies; however, there are little data on this role of SHP-1 in T-lymphocyte malignancies. We examined malignant human T cells to identify any abnormalities of SHP-1 that would support a role for this molecule in suppressing T lymphomagenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human T-lymphocyte cell lines and primary blood cells were used to examine the expression of SHP-1 mRNA and protein. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify particular portions of the SHP-1 mRNA for cloning and sequencing. Gene transfer was used to examine the effects of SHP-1 on cell growth and morphology. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were generated and used to determine SHP-1-associated proteins. RESULTS: Leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cell lines were identified that did not express SHP-1 protein. Examination of the mRNA from these and other T-cell lines, and from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), revealed three distinct transcripts by restriction enzymes, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and Southern blot analysis. In addition to the expected wild-type transcript, two novel transcripts were identified. One was a deletion transcript found only in Jurkat leukemia-derived cells, predicted to encode for a 7-kDa protein containing most of the amino-terminal SH2 domain. The second contained an 88-nucleotide insert that is the unspliced second intron resulting in a frame shift and the formation of a noncoding transcript. This mRNA was found in all cells examined but was the only transcript detected in the cell lines lacking SHP-1 protein. Expressing wild-type SHP-1 in these cell lines resulted in a change in the morphology of the cells with a concomitant decrease in their growth. GST fusion constructs showed the 7-kDa variant able to associate with an identical array of proteins as wild-type SHP-1, suggesting that it could compete with the wild-type SHP-1 for substrates. This protein was detectable in the cell line expressing its corresponding mRNA and was able to induce significant changes in cell morphology when transfected into a cell line expressing wild-type SHP-1; however, it did not induce any changes in cell growth. CONCLUSIONS: These data are the first to show the existence of multiple transcripts of SHP-1 in human transformed T lymphocytes and normal PBMCs and supports previous work showing that alternate forms of SHP-1 mRNA are a common finding in other cells. We also show the lack of splicing out of an intron as a novel mechanism of regulation of SHP-1 protein expression in both normal and transformed T cells. Moreover, we provide the first evidence showing a protein product detectable in cells that is translated from an alternatively spliced form of SHP-1 mRNA, a variant truncated SHP-1 protein having potential biologic relevance. This report provides evidence supporting the concept that SHP-1 can negatively regulate growth of malignant human T cells and that lack of SHP-1 protein or function may be associated with lymphomagenesis.","['Ma, Xue-Zhong', 'Jin, Tianru', 'Sakac, Darinka', 'Fahim, Soad', 'Zhang, Xin', 'Katsman, Yulia', 'Bali, Meenakshi', 'Branch, Donald R']","['Ma XZ', 'Jin T', 'Sakac D', 'Fahim S', 'Zhang X', 'Katsman Y', 'Bali M', 'Branch DR']","['Department of Medicine and Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, 67 College Street, Toronto M5G 2M1, Ontario, Canada']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Alternative Splicing/genetics/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/enzymology/etiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology/etiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics/pharmacology/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02010251 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01025-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Feb;31(2):131-42. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01025-1.,,,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to clarify the expression of LTC(4)S during normal and leukemic myelopoiesis and to investigate the correlation between abnormal LTC(4)S expression in CML myeloid cells and the activity of the disease-specific tyrosine kinase p210 BCR-ABL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immature and mature myeloid cell subpopulations were isolated with magnetic cell sorting from healthy volunteer bone marrow (n = 11) and CML patient peripheral blood (n = 8), respectively. The cells were subjected to analysis of LTC(4)S protein expression and activity. Expression of LTC(4)S was investigated in CD16(+) neutrophils from CML patients before and after 1 month of medication with imatinib mesylate (STI571), which is a specific inhibitor of p210 BCR-ABL. RESULTS: Among normal cells, the highest enzyme activity was observed in the most immature, CD34(+) progenitor cell-enriched and CD15(+) myelocyte-enriched fractions. Subsequently, LTC(4)S activity decreased with increasing maturity, with only negligible amounts of LTC(4) produced in CD16(+) neutrophils. LTC(4)S was expressed at the protein level in the immature myeloid cell fractions but not in CD16(+) cells. In CML cells, LTC(4)S activity and expression were consistently elevated. Thus, the CML CD34(+) and CD15(+) cell fractions, as well as the CD11b(+) myelocyte/metamyelocyte-enriched fractions, produced 6 to 10 times as much LTC(4) as the corresponding normal cells. Again, enzyme expression was highest in the most immature cells, although evident LTC(4)S expression and activity remained in CML CD16(+) neutrophils. Interestingly, treatment of five CML patients with imatinib mesylate down-regulated the abnormal neutrophil LTC(4)S expression and activity. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of LTC(4)S in immature myelopoid cells is in line with a role for this enzyme in myelopoiesis. In addition, consistent overexpression of LTC(4)S in CML and the correlation to p210 BCR-ABL activity suggests that LTC(4)S may be involved in leukemic pathogenesis.","['Tornhamre, Susanne', 'Stenke, Leif', 'Granzelius, Anna', 'Sjolinder, Mikael', 'Nasman-Glaser, Barbro', 'Roos, Cecilia', 'Widell, Susanne', 'Lindgren, Jan Ake']","['Tornhamre S', 'Stenke L', 'Granzelius A', 'Sjolinder M', 'Nasman-Glaser B', 'Roos C', 'Widell S', 'Lindgren JA']","['Division of Physiological Chemistry II, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Scheele Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, S-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.

Recombinant EBV was explored for transduction of primary human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: EBV vectors deleted for all oncogenic sequences and encoding terminal repeats (TR) essential for encapsidation, the lytic origin of replication (oriLyt) for DNA amplification, and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were packaged using an optimized, helper-virus-free method. Infectious EBV virions encoding EGFP (EBV/EGFP) with an infectious titer up to 2 x 10(6) per milliliter were generated. Primary leukemic cells from 14 patients with CLL were successfully transduced with EBV/EGFP at a very low multiplicity of infection (< 1). RESULTS: Transgene expression was detected in up to 85% of cells 48 hours after infection. Transduction was specifically mediated by EBV vectors because gene transfer was inhibited by an antibody (72A1) directed against the viral envelope glycoprotein gp350/220. Furthermore, transduction of CLL cells with packaged EBV vectors coding for EGFP but deleted for TR sequences (TR-) did not result in EGFP expression compared to TR+ vector constructs (p = 0.009).

Here we studied the expression of cytokines IL-6, LIF, IL-1beta and TNFalpha and cytokine receptors IL-6R, LIFR and Gp130 in the rat brain after kainic acid-induced status epilepticus using Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization histochemistry. After seizures, IL-6 mRNA was induced in the hippocampus, cortex, amygdala and meninges, and IL-6R was up-regulated in the hippocampus. LIF was up-regulated in the hippocampus, cortex and meninges after seizures, and LIFR mRNA was induced in the hippocampus and cortex. Gp130 was constitutively expressed in the brain. After seizures, Gp130 transcription was rapidly induced in the meninges. In thalamus, cortex, amygdala and hippocampus Gp130 mRNA was induced in a delayed fashion. IL-1beta transcription was induced in the temporal lobe cortex and thalamus, and TNFalpha in the hippocampus. In general, the cytokine and their receptor mRNA levels were low in intact rat brain, but were induced by seizures. Since IL-6 and LIF transcripts were induced in the meninges after seizures, the protein products of these transcripts may be more readily released in cerebrospinal fluid after seizures.

We used flow cytometry to study platelet-leukocyte conjugates and markers of platelet activation in patients with MPS. METHODS: Whole blood from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), chronic myelofibrosis (MF), and essential thrombocythemia (ET) and from healthy volunteers was prepared for flow cytometry. Platelet microparticles and platelet microaggregates were identified with anti-CD42b and forward scatter, activated platelets with anti-CD62p. Anti-CD42b, anti-CD14, and anti-CD45 were used to study platelet-leukocyte conjugates. RESULTS: The percentage of CD62p-positive platelets was elevated in all myeloproliferate syndrome subtypes. The median percentage of platelet microparticles was 5.2% in controls and significantly higher in PV (12.0%), MF (11.0%), and ET (11.0%, all p<0.05). There was an increased percentage of platelet-neutrophil conjugates in patients with PV (8.3%) and ET (10.4%) compared to normal controls (6.8%, all p<0.05). Platelet-monocyte conjugates were 8.0% in controls and elevated in PV (15.4%) and ET (15.0%, all p<0.05). Patients with a history of venous or arterial thrombotic events had slightly less platelet-leukocyte conjugates and slightly more microparticles than patients without thrombosis; however, this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that platelet-leukocyte conjugate formation occurs in myeloproliferative syndromes and indicates platelet activation. Also, platelet microparticles are elevated and might provide a catalytic surface for thrombin generation. This could explain the clinical observation that patients with myeloproliferative syndromes have an increased risk to experience arterial or venous thrombotic events.","['Villmow, Torben', 'Kemkes-Matthes, Bettina', 'Matzdorff, Axel C']","['Villmow T', 'Kemkes-Matthes B', 'Matzdorff AC']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Faculty of Internal Medicine, Justus-Liebig-University, Klinikstr. 36, 35385 Giessen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/blood', 'Leukocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood', 'P-Selectin/blood', '*Platelet Activation/immunology', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex/metabolism', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0049384802003547 [pii]', '10.1016/s0049-3848(02)00354-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2002 Nov 1;108(2-3):139-45. doi: 10.1016/s0049-3848(02)00354-7.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are three M3 morphologic variants: the typical hypergranular form and the microgranular and basophilic variants. Although most leukemic cells in M3 patients express t(15;17), other cytogenetic abnormalities have also been reported. Also, there are three molecular variants of the PML/RARalpha transcript (bcr1, bcr2, bcr3). Blasts had typical hypergranular appearance (13 patients) with a mature myeloid immunophenotype (HLA-DR(-),CD13(+), and/or CD33(+)) (10 patients) in the majority of patients with M3 followed in this study. The typical translocation [t(15;17)(q22;q11)] was detected by cytogenetic analysis in 5 M3 patients, but PML/RARalpha was positive in 13 out of 15 patients, as assessed by RT-PCR (8 patients with bcr1 and 5 with bcr3 subtype). Cytogenetic diversity was found in three patients (1 with t(17;17), 1 with +8, and 1 with add (7)(q22); -7; +8). According to many studies, leukemic cell heterogeneity in APL influences the clinical outcome of disease. The analysis of certain leukemic cell characteristics on the clinical outcome in our study revealed that patients with bcr3 had shorter medians of first remission and survival in comparison to patients with the bcr1 isoform of PML/RARalpha. Also, the clinical relapse of disease in 4 APL patients with reverted PML/RAR alpha positivity is consistent with the view that detection of PML/RARalpha by RT-RCR in patients in remission implies a poor prognosis. On the contrary, lack of detection of PML/RARalpha by RT-PCR at least three times is a sign of long remission and survival.","['Sucic, Mirna', 'Zadro, Renata', 'Burazer, Branka', 'Labar, Boris', 'Nemet, Damir', 'Mrsic, Mirando', 'Aurer, Igor', 'Mrsic, Sanja', 'Hitrec, Vlasta', 'Boban, Dubravka', 'Markovic-Glamocak, Mirjana', 'Batinic, Drago', 'Uzarevic, Branka', 'Stavljenic-Rukavina, Ana']","['Sucic M', 'Zadro R', 'Burazer B', 'Labar B', 'Nemet D', 'Mrsic M', 'Aurer I', 'Mrsic S', 'Hitrec V', 'Boban D', 'Markovic-Glamocak M', 'Batinic D', 'Uzarevic B', 'Stavljenic-Rukavina A']","['Division of Cytology of the Clinical Institute of Laboratory Diagnosis, Zagreb University Clinical Hospital Center and School of Medicine, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia. mirna.sucic@zg.tel.hr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Size', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/02/20 04:00,2003/11/07 05:00,['2003/02/20 04:00'],"['2003/02/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/152581602321080600 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2002 Dec;11(6):941-50. doi: 10.1089/152581602321080600.,,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional isotonic regression fits monotonically increasing step functions to data. In our approach we treat the number and location of the steps as random. For each step level we adopt the conjugate prior to the sampling distribution of the data as if the curve was unconstrained. We then propose to use Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to draw samples from the unconstrained model space and retain only those samples for which the monotonic constraint holds. The proportion of the samples collected for which the constraint holds can be used to provide a value for the weight of evidence in terms of Bayes factors for monotonicity given the data. Using the samples, probability statements can be made about other quantities of interest such as the number of change points in the data and posterior distributions on the location of the change points can be provided.

We have now fully characterized a new member of the Class II HDAC family, HDAC9. The enzyme contains a conserved deacetylase domain, represses reporter activity when recruited to a promoter, and utilizes histones H3 and H4 as substrates in vitro and in vivo. HDAC9 is expressed in a tissue-specific pattern that partially overlaps that of HDAC4. Within the human hematopoietic system, expression of HDAC9 is biased toward cells of monocytic and lymphoid lineages. The HDAC9 gene encodes multiple protein isoforms, some of which display distinct cellular localization patterns. For example, full-length HDAC9 is localized in the nucleus, but the isoform lacking the region encoded by exon 7 is in the cytoplasm. HDAC9 interacts and co-localizes in vivo with a number of transcriptional repressors and co-repressors, including TEL and N-CoR, whose functions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies. These results suggest that HDAC9 plays a role in hematopoiesis; its deregulated expression may be associated with some human cancers.","['Petrie, Kevin', 'Guidez, Fabien', 'Howell, Louise', 'Healy, Lyn', 'Waxman, Samuel', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Zelent, Arthur']","['Petrie K', 'Guidez F', 'Howell L', 'Healy L', 'Waxman S', 'Greaves M', 'Zelent A']","['Leukemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, 237 Fulham Road, London SW3 6JB, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Histone Deacetylases/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']",2003/02/19 04:00,2003/06/18 05:00,['2003/02/19 04:00'],"['2003/02/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M212935200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)58297-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 May 2;278(18):16059-72. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M212935200.

The presence of cathepsins B and H along with their potent inhibitor cystatin C in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was investigated in patients with leptomeningeal metastasis of cancer (LM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: CSF samples were obtained in 16 cases of LM (10 solid tumors and 6 leukemia or lymphoma) and compared with 11 cancer cases without involvement of the central nervous system, 12 multiple sclerosis cases and 34 healthy volunteers. The activity of the enzymes was measured, their molecular forms were analyzed by the Western blotting, and the concentration of cystatin C was measured by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry of the leptomeningeal tissues was also performed in six autopsy cases of LM. RESULTS: High activities of cathepsins B and H along with decreased cystatin C concentration were observed in CSF of LM as compared with three control groups. Western blot analysis revealed higher concentration of the enzyme protein as well as its active forms in samples with higher enzyme activity. Cells metastasizing leptomeningeal tissue were clearly positive in immunohistochemical staining of cathepsins, indicating active production by tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Production of cathepsins B and H by tumor cells and their high activity along with concomitant decrease of their potent inhibitor, cystatin C, in the CSF might contribute in the process of metastasis and spread of the cancer cells in the leptomeningeal tissues. A high enzyme activity/cystatin C concentration ratio in the CSF could be useful when diagnosing LM in combination with other parameters.","['Nagai, Atsushi', 'Terashima, Masaharu', 'Harada, Takayuki', 'Shimode, Koichi', 'Takeuchi, Hiromi', 'Murakawa, Yohko', 'Nagasaki, Makoto', 'Nakano, Akinobu', 'Kobayashi, Shotai']","['Nagai A', 'Terashima M', 'Harada T', 'Shimode K', 'Takeuchi H', 'Murakawa Y', 'Nagasaki M', 'Nakano A', 'Kobayashi S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Shimane Medical University, Izumo, Japan. anagai@shimane-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cathepsin B/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cathepsin H', 'Cathepsins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cell Count', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Cystatin C', 'Cystatins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology/*secondary', 'Neoplasm Metastasis']",2003/02/19 04:00,2003/12/18 05:00,['2003/02/19 04:00'],"['2003/02/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0009898103000238 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-8981(03)00023-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2003 Mar;329(1-2):53-60. doi: 10.1016/s0009-8981(03)00023-8.,,,"['0 (CST3 protein, human)', '0 (Cystatin C)', '0 (Cystatins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)', 'EC 3.4.22.16 (CTSH protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.16 (Cathepsin H)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using transthoracic echocardiography, anterior and posterior wall thickness, LV diameters and LV fractional shortening (FS) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline, and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats. Histology was performed in DOX-rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls. RESULTS: Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9-week period. End-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) LV diameters/BW significantly increased, whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the DOX group (p<0.001). These parameters remained unchanged in controls. Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. In 7 of the 18 rats, degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found. Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis. A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7.5 and 12 mg/kg in comparison with baseline (p<0.05). cTnT found in rats after 12 mg/kg were significantly greater than that found after 7.5 mg/kg DOX. Maximal cTnI (pg/ml) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls (p=0.006, 0.007). cTnI (ng/ml), CK-MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls. All markers remained stable in controls. Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters/BW (r=0.81 and 0.65; p<0.0001). A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes, and between LV diameters/BW and histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX, probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments.","['Bertinchant, J P', 'Polge, A', 'Juan, J M', 'Oliva-Lauraire, M C', 'Giuliani, I', 'Marty-Double, C', 'Burdy, J Y', 'Fabbro-Peray, P', 'Laprade, M', 'Bali, J P', 'Granier, C', 'de la Coussaye, J E', 'Dauzat, M']","['Bertinchant JP', 'Polge A', 'Juan JM', 'Oliva-Lauraire MC', 'Giuliani I', 'Marty-Double C', 'Burdy JY', 'Fabbro-Peray P', 'Laprade M', 'Bali JP', 'Granier C', 'de la Coussaye JE', 'Dauzat M']","['Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology, University of Montpellier-Nimes, France. jean.pierre.bertinchant@chu-nimes.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cathepsin B/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cathepsin H', 'Cathepsins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cell Count', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Cystatin C', 'Cystatins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology/*secondary', 'Neoplasm Metastasis']",2003/02/19 04:00,2003/12/18 05:00,['2003/02/19 04:00'],"['2003/02/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0009898103000135 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-8981(03)00013-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2003 Mar;329(1-2):39-51. doi: 10.1016/s0009-8981(03)00013-5.,,,"['0 (CST3 protein, human)', '0 (Cst3 protein, rat)', '0 (Cystatin C)', '0 (Cystatins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)', 'EC 3.4.22.16 (CTSH protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.16 (Cathepsin H)', 'EC 3.4.22.16 (Ctsh protein, rat)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A soluble form of the TfR (sTfR) has been identified in animal and human serum. Soluble TfR is a truncated monomer of tissue receptor, lacking its first 100 amino acids, which circulates in the form of a complex of transferrin and its receptor. The erythroblasts rather than reticulocytes are the main source of serum sTfR. Serum sTfR levels average 5.0+/-1.0 mg/l in normal subjects but the various commercial assays give disparate values because of the lack of an international standard. The most important determinant of sTfR levels appears to be marrow erythropoietic activity which can cause variations up to 8 times below and up to 20 times above average normal values. Soluble TfR levels are decreased in situations characterized by diminished erythropoietic activity, and are increased when erythropoiesis is stimulated by hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis. Measurements of sTfR are very helpful to investigate the pathophysiology of anemia, quantitatively evaluating the absolute rate of erythropoiesis and the adequacy of marrow proliferative capacity for any given degree of anemia, and to monitor the erythropoietic response to various forms of therapy, in particular allowing to predict response early when changes in hemoglobin are not yet apparent. Iron status also influences sTfR levels, which are considerably elevated in iron deficiency anemia but remain normal in the anemia of inflammation, and thus may be of considerable help in the differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia. This is particularly useful to identify concomitant iron deficiency in a patient with inflammation because ferritin values are then generally normal. Elevated sTfR levels are also the characteristic feature of functional iron deficiency, a situation defined by tissue iron deficiency despite adequate iron stores. The sTfR/ferritin ratio can thus describe iron availability over a wide range of iron stores. With the exception of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma, sTfR levels are not increased in patients with malignancies. We conclude that soluble TfR represents a valuable quantitative assay of marrow erythropoietic activity as well as a marker of tissue iron deficiency.","['Beguin, Yves']",['Beguin Y'],"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Liege, CHU Sart Tilman, 4000 Liege, Belgium. yves.beguin@chu.ulg.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,IM,"['Animals', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*blood', 'Nutritional Status', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism']",2003/02/19 04:00,2003/12/18 05:00,['2003/02/19 04:00'],"['2003/02/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0009898103000056 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-8981(03)00005-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2003 Mar;329(1-2):9-22. doi: 10.1016/s0009-8981(03)00005-6.,,135,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following a lesion to their axons in the PNS, motoneurons are able to regenerate. The regenerative capacity of these neurons is seen also after lesion in the ventral funiculus of the spinal cord, i.e. within the CNS compartment. Thus, after an axotomy within the ventral funiculus, motoneurons respond with a changing polarity towards production of axons, sometimes even from the dendritic tree. This capacity can be used in cases of ventral root avulsion (VRA) lesions, if a conduit for outgrowing axons is presented in the form of replanted ventral roots. In human cases, this procedure may accomplish return of function in denervated muscles. The strong regenerative capacity of motoneurons provides the basis for studies of the response in motoneurons with regard to their contents of substances related to survival and regeneration. Such studies have shown that, of the large number of receptors for neurotrophic substances and extracellular matrix molecules, mRNAs for receptors or receptor components for neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are strongly downregulated after VRA, while receptors for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and laminins are profoundly upregulated. These results should be considered in the design of combined pharmacological and surgical approaches to lesions of motor axons at or close to the CNS-PNS interface.","['Cullheim, S', 'Wallquist, W', 'Hammarberg, H', 'Linda, H', 'Piehl, F', 'Carlstedt, T', 'Risling, M']","['Cullheim S', 'Wallquist W', 'Hammarberg H', 'Linda H', 'Piehl F', 'Carlstedt T', 'Risling M']","['Department of Neuroscience, Retzius vag 8; B3:3, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77, Stockholm, Sweden. staffan.cullheim@neuro.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Brain Res Brain Res Rev,Brain research.

Intensive research has elucidated many signal transduction pathways activated by BCR/ABL. However, few studies addressed BCR/ABL-dependent alterations in gene expression that may contribute to the pathobiology of CML. To additionally define such downstream genes, we performed a subtractive hybridization between cord blood (CB) CD34(+) cells transduced with an MSCV-retrovirus vector containing either enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) alone or p210(BCR/ABL)-internal ribosome entry site-eGFP. Thirty-four subtracted clones expressed in p210-eGFP but not eGFP-transduced CD34(+) cells have been confirmed by Northern blot and sequenced. Fifty-nine percent represent novel proteins, and 41% are homologous to known genes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed that 14 of 14 genes tested were also overexpressed in additional populations of p210(BCR/ABL)-transduced CB CD34(+) cells, as well as in CD34(+) cells from primary newly diagnosed CML patients versus GFP-transduced CB or samples from normal donors. Western blot analysis showed that the known sequences were also overexpressed at the protein level. Treatment of BCR/ABL(+) cells with the Abl-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 decreased expression at the mRNA as well as protein level of some but not all of the gene products. This suggests that increased gene expression is in some cases tyrosine kinase-independent. Some of the overexpressed genes are implicated in cellular processes known to be disturbed in CML, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase or the ubiquitin pathway, whereas overexpression of other genes, including RAN and NUP98, may implicate new cellular pathways involved in CML. Additional characterization of downstream genes activated by BCR/ABL may lead to important new insights in the molecular mechanisms underlying CML and identify potentially novel therapeutic targets for CML.","['Salesse, Stephanie', 'Verfaillie, Catherine M']","['Salesse S', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Stem Cell Institute, Cancer Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2003/02/18 04:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/02/18 04:00'],"['2003/02/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/18 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2003 Feb;2(2):173-82.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,['R01 HL 49930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We show that the transforming efficiency of these mutants in primary lymphoid cells is correlated with their ability to mediate kappaB site-dependent transactivation and with specific changes in phosphorylation profiles. Interestingly, coexpression of the death antagonists Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 significantly increased their oncogenicity, whereas other NF-kappaB-regulated death inhibitors showed little or no effect. The fact that a subset of apoptosis inhibitors could rescue v-Rel transactivation mutants suggests that their reduced transcriptional activity may critically affect expression of defined death antagonists essential for oncogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed selection for high endogenous expression of Bcl-2-related death antagonists in cells transformed by weakly transforming v-Rel mutants. These results emphasize the need for Rel/NF-kappaB to efficiently activate expression of a subset of antiapoptotic genes from the Bcl-2 family to manifest its oncogenic phenotype.","['Rayet, Beatrice', 'Fan, Yongjun', 'Gelinas, Celine']","['Rayet B', 'Fan Y', 'Gelinas C']","['Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine.

Homozygous mutations in the l(3)mbt gene cause brain tumors in Drosophila, identifying l(3)mbt as a tumor suppressor gene. The h-l(3)mbt gene maps to chromosome 20q12, within a common deleted region associated with myeloid hematopoietic malignancies. H-L(3)MBT contains three repeats of 100 residues called MBT repeats, whose function is unknown, and a C-terminal alpha-helical structure, the SPM (SCM, PH, MBT domain, which is structurally similar to the SAM (sterile alpha motif) protein-protein interaction domain, found in several ETS transcription factors, including TEL (translocation Ets leukemia). We report that H-L(3)MBT is a transcriptional repressor and that its activity is largely dependent on the presence of a region containing the three MBT repeats. H-L(3)MBT acts as a histone deacetylase-independent transcriptional repressor, based on its lack of sensitivity to trichostatin A. We found that H-L(3)MBT binds in vivo to TEL, and we have mapped the region of interaction to their respective SPM/SAM domains. We show that the ability of TEL to repress TEL-responsive promoters is enhanced by the presence of H-L(3)MBT, an effect dependent on the H-L(3)MBT and the TEL interacting domains. These experiments suggest that histone deacetylase-independent transcriptional repression by TEL depends on the recruitment of PcG proteins. We speculate that the interaction of TEL with H-L(3)MBT can direct a PcG complex to genes repressed by TEL, stabilizing their repressed state.","['Boccuni, Piernicola', 'MacGrogan, Donal', 'Scandura, Joseph M', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Boccuni P', 'MacGrogan D', 'Scandura JM', 'Nimer SD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Aspects of Hematopoiesis, Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 3/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2003/02/18 04:00,2003/07/17 05:00,['2003/02/18 04:00'],"['2003/02/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M300592200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)30352-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Apr 25;278(17):15412-20. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M300592200.

We studied IDO expression by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in dendritic cells and by real-time RT-PCR in monocytes of patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation for leukaemia, who developed acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), and compared the IDO expression with that of pregnant women and healthy volunteers.

The IDO expression increased by in vitro IFN-gamma stimulation in pregnant women (median 116%), healthy volunteers (median 11.7%) and patients with a low-grade aGvHD (grades 0-II) 28 days after transplant (median 433%) but not in patients with a severe aGvHD (grades III-IV) (median 0%), which was highly significant (P < 0.01). IDO expression was also measured in dendritic cells by qualitative RT-PCR, where a spontaneous IDO expression was detected in 16 of 31 (52%) pregnant women versus none of 17 healthy volunteers and none of 62 studied patients after transplant.

During aging, modulation of hematopoiesis becomes disordered, impairing the ability of older people to respond appropriately to the physiological demand for blood cell replacement triggered by stimuli such as blood loss or cytoreductive chemotherapy. This may contribute to the increase in the prevalence of anemia that is observed during aging. In addition, various age-related events, such as genomic mutations secondary to oxidative stress and impaired regulation of cytokine production, may contribute to or cause the emergence of abnormal clones of hematopoietic cells. Therefore, normal hematopoiesis is disrupted, and the hematopoietic system is populated with cells that are quantitatively and functionally deficient and are also subject to leukemic transformation. These defects in the production and maturation of the various differentiated blood cells are referred to as myelodysplastic syndromes. These syndromes are so tightly associated with aging that they are considered to be geriatric disorders; they can lead to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia and to the development of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. Dysregulation of mechanisms controlling hematopoiesis is therefore an important characteristic of the hematopoietic system in the elderly, but the response of progenitor cells to humoral stimulators is preserved and accounts for the effectiveness of recombinant hematopoietic growth factors used as emerging treatment modalities for hematopoietic disorders in the elderly.","['Rothstein, Gerald']",['Rothstein G'],"['Division of Geriatrics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City 84132, USA. gerald.rothstein@hsc.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Am Geriatr Soc,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,7503062,IM,"['Aged', 'Aging/blood', 'Anemia/etiology', 'Hematologic Tests/methods', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic System/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/complications/diagnosis/therapy']",2003/02/18 04:00,2003/04/19 05:00,['2003/02/18 04:00'],"['2003/02/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['jgs5103 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1532-5415.51.3s.3.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Geriatr Soc. 2003 Mar;51(3 Suppl):S22-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1532-5415.51.3s.3.x.,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development of salvage therapy for post-transplant relapse could be expedited by understanding the post-transplant behaviour of microscopically undetectable leukaemia and the ability to predict impending relapse. We have used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction method (sensitivity of 5.0 x 10-6) to measure residual leukaemia before the conditioning regimen, and at five time-points after transplantation. In total, 18 patients with ALL transplanted in first or second remission were studied for 1 year: For the first year post BMT, 12 remained in remission, four had haematological relapses, one had a cutaneous relapse, and one died of severe graft-versus-host disease. The post-engraftment levels of the leukaemia-specific immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) chain gene rearrangement for patients with haematological relapses were significantly different from those who remained in remission. The levels for the patients who remained in remission decreased with time, although there were occasional increases consistent with the known standard deviation of the measurement assay. In contrast, all clinical relapses were preceded by a rapid increase in levels. Both the rate of this increase and its timing were variable. These results suggest that residual leukaemia measurements can be used to direct post-transplant interventions and measure their effects.","['Bunin, Nancy', 'Johnston, Dennis A', 'Roberts, W Mark', 'Ouspenskaia, Maia V', 'Papusha, Victor Z', 'Brandt, Mark A', 'Zipf, Theodore F']","['Bunin N', 'Johnston DA', 'Roberts WM', 'Ouspenskaia MV', 'Papusha VZ', 'Brandt MA', 'Zipf TF']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, PA 19104, USA. buninn@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence']",2003/02/18 04:00,2003/04/30 05:00,['2003/02/18 04:00'],"['2003/02/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['4135 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04135.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Feb;120(4):711-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04135.x.,,,,,,,['R21 CA68235/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical diagnoses and associated laboratory features were ascertained from a computerized laboratory database or from clinical notes. Over the period of study, serum or urine paraproteins were detected in 613 new patients. These consisted of 568 patients with serum paraproteins and 45 patients with urinary monoclonal free light chain (in the absence of a serum paraprotein). These paraproteins occurred more commonly in males and the frequency increased with age. Approximately 30% of the serum paraproteins and 60% of urinary monoclonal free light chain were associated with B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (multiple myeloma, plasmacytoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, etc) with the remainder being labeled as monoclonal gammopathies of uncertain significance (MGUS). At clinical presentation, patients with lymphoproliferative disorders tended to have higher levels of paraprotein, B2 microglobulin, the presence of free urinary light chain and demonstrated molecular size heterogeneity of the paraprotein but there was considerable overlap. A good correlation was noted between paraprotein concentration and viscosity in most patients. In conclusion paraproteins were most frequently encountered in the context of a gammopathy of uncertain significance. Features which suggested lymphoproliferative disorders included higher levels of serum paraprotein (> 15 g/l), elevated levels of B2-microglobulin and the presence of urinary free high chain. However, as much overlap was seen with patients with MGUS, regular monitoring of paraprotein level is considered mandatory in the management of these patients.","['Roberts-Thomson, Peter J', 'Nikoloutsopoulos, Tony', 'Smith, Anthony J']","['Roberts-Thomson PJ', 'Nikoloutsopoulos T', 'Smith AJ']","['Department of Immunology, Allergy & Arthritis, Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, Adelaide, South Australia 5042.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Thailand,Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol,Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology,8402034,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Blood Viscosity/physiology', 'Cryoglobulins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/immunology/urine', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/immunology/urine', 'Paraproteins/*immunology/*metabolism/urine', 'South Australia/epidemiology', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/blood/immunology/urine']",2003/02/18 04:00,2003/08/30 05:00,['2003/02/18 04:00'],"['2003/02/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/18 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol. 2002 Sep;20(3):187-95.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cryoglobulins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Paraproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increased warfarin dosage was required for a patient receiving 12-week cycles of mercaptopurine for acute promyelocytic leukemia. At the start of mercaptopurine therapy, an upward titration of 25% beyond the warfarin maintenance dosage was required to achieve a therapeutic international normalized ratio. When a cycle of mercaptopurine was completed, a sharp reduction in warfarin dosage was required. The mechanism behind this interaction is unclear. Mercaptopurine may inhibit gastrointestinal absorption of warfarin, or it may induce hepatic enzymes that metabolize the anticoagulant. With dramatic changes in warfarin or anticoagulant requirements, practitioners should be aware of potential thromboembolic sequelae or bleeding complications when these agents are prescribed concomitantly.

It can arise from any part of the body and is frequently associated with haematological diseases, commonly acute myeloid leukaemia. Rarely, it has been found in conjunction with myelodysplastic syndrome. We report a case of cutaneous granulocytic sarcoma in a 73-year-old lady. The patient presented with a two-month history of multiple skin nodules which were confirmed by skin biopsy to be granulocytic sarcoma. Bone marrow examination was consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome. Localised radiotherapy to the skin lesions were given. She died from septicaemia six months after presentation. The management of this condition presents a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for both the pathologist and physician. In cases which are poorly differentiated as in this case, histological diagnosis is particularly difficult. Its definitive diagnosis would then require the additional use of a broad panel of immunohistochemical and cytochemical stains.","['Cheah, K L', 'Lim, L C', 'Teong, H H', 'Chua, S H']","['Cheah KL', 'Lim LC', 'Teong HH', 'Chua SH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Outram Road, Singapore 169608. ckl@sgh.com.sg']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Singapore,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,IM,"['Aged', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/radiotherapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/radiotherapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/radiotherapy']",2003/02/18 04:00,2003/03/22 04:00,['2003/02/18 04:00'],"['2003/02/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/18 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Singapore Med J. 2002 Oct;43(10):527-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The general population in Canada is exposed to 1,3-butadiene primarily through ambient air. Inhaled 1,3-butadiene is carcinogenic in both mice and rats, inducing tumors at multiple sites at all concentrations tested in all identified studies. In addition, 1,3-butadiene is genotoxic in both somatic and germ cells of rodents. It also induces adverse effects in the reproductive organs of female mice at relatively low concentrations. The greater sensitivity in mice than in rats to induction of these effects by 1,3-butadiene is likely related to species differences in metabolism to active epoxide metabolites. Exposure to 1,3-butadiene in the occupational environment has been associated with the induction of leukemia; there is also some limited evidence that 1,3-butadiene is genotoxic in exposed workers. Therefore, in view of the weight of evidence of available epidemiological and toxicological data, 1,3-butadiene is considered highly likely to be carcinogenic, and likely to be genotoxic, in humans. Estimates of the potency of butadiene to induce cancer have been derived on the basis of both epidemiological investigation and bioassays in mice and rats. Potencies to induce ovarian effects have been estimated on the basis of studies in mice. Uncertainties have been delineated, and, while there are clear species differences in metabolism, estimates of potency to induce effects are considered justifiably conservative in view of the likely variability in metabolism across the population related to genetic polymorphism for enzymes for the critical metabolic pathway.","['Hughes, K', 'Meek, M E', 'Walker, M', 'Beauchamp, R']","['Hughes K', 'Meek ME', 'Walker M', 'Beauchamp R']","[""Existing Substances Division, Environmental Health Directorate, Health Canada, Environmental Health Centre, Tunney's Pasture PL0802B1, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1A 0L2.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev,"Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

A hierarchical Bayesian model is assumed for treatment effects within the subtypes. The hierarchical model, which is tailored to each particular application, allows treatment effects to differ across subtypes while assuming a priori that the effects are exchangeable and correlated. Two applications are described. The first is a trial of imatinib for sarcoma in which treatment activity is characterized by a binary indicator of tumour response. The second is a phase II trial of a new preparative regimen for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients with haematologic malignancies, with treatment effect characterized by the mean time from transplant to disease progression or death. The applications illustrate how the hierarchical Bayesian model borrows strength across subtypes.","['Thall, Peter F', 'Wathen, J Kyle', 'Bekele, B Nebiyou', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Baker, Laurence H', 'Benjamin, Robert S']","['Thall PF', 'Wathen JK', 'Bekele BN', 'Champlin RE', 'Baker LH', 'Benjamin RS']","['Department of Biostatistics, Box 447, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030-4095, USA. rex@manderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Bayes Theorem', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic/*methods', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', '*Research Design', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2003/02/15 04:00,2003/06/12 05:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.1399 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2003 Mar 15;22(5):763-80. doi: 10.1002/sim.1399.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,"['Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,['CA83932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

It has been beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and it has been used in veterinary medicine for the treatment of granulomatous colitis. Salicylazosulfapyridine was nominated for toxicity and carcinogenicity testing by the National Cancer Institute on the basis of its widespread use in humans and because it is a representative chemical from a class of aryl sulfonamides. Salicylazosulfapyridine is a suspect carcinogen because reductive cleavage of the azo linkage yields a p-amino aryl sulfonamide (sulfapyridine), and a related p-amino aryl sulfonamide (sulfamethoxazole) has been shown to produce thyroid neoplasms in rats. Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. Rats and mice were administered salicylazosulfapyridine (96% to 98% pure) in corn oil by gavage for 16 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. The gavage route of administration was selected for these studies because it approximates the typical route of human exposure to the chemical. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in vitro in Salmonella typhimurium and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and in vivo in rat and mouse bone marrow and mouse peripheral blood cells. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were administered 0, 675, 1,350, or 2,700 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for 16 days excluding weekends. All rats survived to the end of the study. With the exception of the 675 mg/kg male group, the final mean body weights of all dosed groups of males and females were significantly lower than those of controls. Mean body weight gains of all dosed groups were less than those of controls. Clinical findings included ruffled fur and distended abdomens in male and female rats receiving 2,700 mg/kg. Hypothyroidism, evidenced by decreased serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations and increased thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, occurred in 2,700 mg/kg male and female rats. The absolute and relative thymus weights of male rats receiving,350 or 2,700 mg/kg and female rats receiving 2,700 mg/kg were significantly lower than those of controls. At necropsy, all dosed rats had enlarged cecae/large intestines. Male rats receiving 1,350 mg/kg and male and female rats receiving 2,700 mg/kg had red, enlarged thyroid glands. Chemical-related microscopic lesions were present in the forestomach, thymus, thyroid gland, and pituitary gland. Minimal to mild hyperplasia of the forestomach mucosa was present in the 1,350 and 2,700 mg/kg male and female groups. Lymphoid depletion was observed in the thymus of three male and three female rats in the 2,700 mg/kg groups. Male and female rats receiving 1,350 and 2,700 mg/kg had thyroid gland follicular cell hyperplasia and an increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone producing cells in the pars distalis of the pituitary gland. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were administered 0, 675, 1,350, or 2,700 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for 16 days excluding weekends. There were no chemical-related deaths, and final mean body weights of dosed mice were similar to those of controls. No chemical-related clinical findings were noted for male or female mice. There were no differences in triiodothyronine, thyroxine, or thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations between dosed and control mice. There were no biologically significant differences in absolute or relative organ weights between dosed and control male and female mice. At necropsy, male mice receiving 2,700 mg/kg had enlarged cecae/large intestines. There were no biologically significant histopathologic lesions attributed to salicylazosulfapyridine administration. 13-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were administered 0, 84, 168.8, or 337.5 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for 13 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. The finaludy. The final mean body weights of dosed male rats were similar to those of controls; the final mean body weights and body weight gains of dosed females were significantly lower than those of controls. No chemical-related clinical findings were noted in dosed male or female rats during the 13-week study. No significant differences in hematology or urinalysis parameters between control and dosed rats were observed. The absolute and relative right kidney weights of 337.5 mg/kg females were significantly greater than those of controls. At necropsy, some 337.5 mg/kg male rats had red, enlarged thyroid glands. Histopathologic changes were noted primarily in the thyroid gland and pituitary gland of males and females in the 337.5 mg/kg groups. The thyroid gland lesions observed were similar to those present in the 16-day study. Nine male rats receiving 168.8 mg/kg and ten male and seven female rats receiving.5 mg/kg had minimal but consistent changes in thyroid gland follicular cells. In the pituitary gland of 337.5 mg/kg males and females, the thyroid-stimulating hormone producing cells were enlarged and contained pale-staining cytoplasm and prominent Golgi complexes. Decreased serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations and increased thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration, similar to differences observed in the 16-day study, occurred in 337.5 mg/kg male rats; thyroid hormone concentrations were not affected in female rats. Sperm motility of all dosed groups of males was significantly lower than that of controls. Vaginal cytology parameters of dosed groups of females were similar to those of controls. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were administered 0, 675, 1,350, or 2,700 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for 13 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. The final mean body weights of dosed male and female mice were similar to those of controls. The mean body weight gains of 1,350 and 2,700 mg/kg male mice were less than that of controls. No chemical-related clinical findings were noted in dosed male or female mice during the 13-week study. There was minimal evidence of a responsive anemia in mice in the 13-week study. The anemia was probably related to a methemoglobinemia. There were minimal decreases in thyroxine concentration in all dosed groups of male and female mice in the -week study. There were, however, no differences in triiodothyronine and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations between dosed and control animals. Absolute and relative liver weights of all groups of dosed male and female mice were significantly greater than those of controls. There were no chemical-related gross lesions. Microscopic evaluation of the liver revealed centrilobular hypertrophy in five 1,350 mg/kg and all 2,700 mg/kg male mice. The right cauda weight of the 1,350 mg/kg group and the right epididymis weights of all dose groups were significantly lower than those of controls. There was no evidence of chemical-related alteration in the vaginal cytology parameters of female mice. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 60 male and 60 female rats were administered 84, 168, or 337.5 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for up to 105 weeks. Groups of 70 male and 60 female rats were administered the corn oil vehicle by gavage for up to 105 weeks. A stop-exposure group of 70 male rats was administered 337.5 mg/kg salicylazosulfapyridine in corn oil by gavage for 6 months, after which animals received the corn oil vehicle by gavage for the remainder of the 2-year study. Ten animals from the vehicle control male group and 10 animals from the 337.5 mg/kg stop-exposure group were evaluated at 6 months; animals from each core-study group were evaluated at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Chemistry: Survival of 337.5 mg/kg male core-study rats was significantly lower than that of controls; survival of 84 and 168 mg/kg core-study males, all groups of dosed females, and the stop-exposure male group was similar to controls. Mean body weights of core-study males and stop-exposure males were similar to controls throughout the study. From week 45 to the end of the study, females in the 337.5 mg/kg group had mean body weights that were lower than those of controls. The serum thyroxine concentration in 337.5 mg/kg core-study males at study termination was minimally lower than that of controls; the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, and reverse triiodothyronine concentrations of dosed males and females were similar to those of controls. Pathology Findings: Administration of salicylazosulfapyridine for 2 years was associated with transitional epithelial papilloma in the urinary bladder of male rats and may have been associated with transitional epithelial papilloma of the kidney and of the urinary bladder of female rats. Nonneoplastic effects in the urinary bladder and kidney of male and female rats and in the spleen of male rats were also observed. Dosed male and female rats had increased incidences of grossly and microscopically observed urinary bladder concretions (diagnosed grossly as calculi at necropsy); male and female rats that developed transitional epithelial papillomas of the urinary bladder had grossly observed concretions (calculi) in the urinary bladder at necropsy. The microscopic neoplastic and nonneoplastic urinary bladder and kidney effects observed in dosed male rats during the 2-year continuous study did not occur in dosed rats during the 2-year stop-exposure study, nor were there gross observations of concretions (calculi) at necropsy. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats were decreased. The thyroid gland hyperplasia seen in the -week study was not observed in the 2-year study, and there was no evidence of chemical-related thyroid gland follicular cell adenomas or carcinomas. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male and 60 female mice were administered 0, 675, 1,350, or 2,700 mg salicylazosulfapyridine/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage for up to 104 weeks. Ten animals from each group were evaluated at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights,and Clinical Chemistry: Survival of all the dosed groups of male and female mice was similar to that of controls. Mean body weights of 675 and 1,350 mg/kg male and female mice were similar to controls throughout the study. From week 12 to the end of the study, 2,700 mg/kg male mice had mean body weights that were lower than those of controls. From week 14 to the end of the study, the 2,700 mg/kg female mice had mean body weights that were lower than those of controls. There were no chemical-related differences in triiodothyronine, reverse triiodothyronine, thyroxine, or thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations between dosed and control mice at the 15-month evaluation. Pathology Findings: Exposure of mice to salicylazosulfapyridine in corn oil by gavage for 2 years was associated with increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms in males and females. Nonneoplastic effects in the liver and spleen were also observed in male and female mice. The incidences of forestomach squamous cell papilloma in females and forestomach hyperplasia in males and females were decreased. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Salicylazosulfapyridine was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535, and it did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. These in vitro assays were performed with and without S9 metabolic activation enzymes. Results from in vivo mouse bone marrow chromo somal aberration tests were uniformly negative, while results of micronucleus assays performed on male or female mice exposed to salicylazosulfapyridine for periods ranging from 3 days to weeks were positive. Micronucleus tests in male mice for shorter exposure times (1 to 2 days) yielded negative or very weakly positive results. A three-treatment (72-hour exposure time) micronucleus test performed in male rats yielded equivocal results. Overall, results of these in vivo assays indicate that salicylazosulfa pyridine is capable of inducing chromosomal damage, possibly in the form of aneuploidy, in mouse bone marrow cells after multiple administrations. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of salicylazosulfapyridine in male and female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of neoplasms in the urinary tract. There was an increased incidence of transitional epithelial papilloma of the urinary bladder in males and a low incidence of rare transitional epithelial papillomas of the kidney and of the urinary bladder in females. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of salicylazosulfapyridine in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms. Increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the urinary bladder and kidney in male and female rats and of the spleen in male rats were observed. Increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the liver and spleen in male and female mice were observed. Decreased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats were related to salicylazosulfapyridine administration. Decreased incidences of forestomach squamous cell papilloma in female mice and forestomach hyperplasia in male and female mice were related to salicylazosulfapyridine administration.

It is used extensively in polyvinyl chloride and in cellulose plastics, polyvinyl acetate, polysulfides, and polyurethane. Butyl benzyl phthalate was nominated as part of a class study of phthalates. Previous studies of butyl benzyl phthalate by the NTP (1982a) resulted in chemical-related mortality in male rats beginning at about 14 weeks of exposure and, thus, were inadequate for evaluating carcinogenicity in male rats. The companion studies revealed a marginal increase in leukemia in female rats and no evidence of carcinogenicity in B6C3F1 mice. Consequently, the present evaluations were conducted only in F344/N rats. Male and female F344/N rats were given butyl benzyl phthalate (at least 97% pure) in feed for 10 weeks, 26 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, mouse bone marrow cells, and Drosophila melanogaster. 10-WEEK MODIFIED MATING STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 15 male F344/N rats were given 0, 300, 2,800, or 25,000 ppm butyl benzyl phthalate (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 20, 200, or 2,200 mg butyl benzyl phthalate/kg body weight) in feed for 10 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. The final mean body weight and body weight gain of the 25,000 ppm group were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by the 25,000 ppm group was less than that by the controls at the end of the study. A few minimal hematology changes occurred in the 25,000 ppm male rats. There was some evidence of a minimal anemia characterized by a decreased erythrocyte count and increases in mean cell hemoglobin and platelet count. The absolute and relative prostate gland weights of the 25,000 ppm males were significantly less than those of the controls. Degeneration of the seminiferous tubule germinal epithelium was observed in all males from the 25,000 ppm group. The absolute right cauda, right epididymis, and right testis weights of the 25,000 ppm males were significantly less than those of the controls. The epididymal spermatozoal concentrations in 2,800 and 25,000 ppm males were significantly less than that in the controls. Although 10 females mated to 25,000 ppm males were initially found to be sperm positive, none of these females were pregnant at necropsy. The fertility indices of males and females in the 25,000 ppm group were significantly lower than those of the controls. The maternal body weights of females mated to 300 and 2,800 ppm males were similar to those of females mated to control males. There were no significant differences in litter data between the controls and the 300 and 2,800 ppm groups. 26-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 15 male F344/N rats were given 0, 300, 900, 2,800, 8,300, or 25,000 ppm butyl benzyl phthalate in feed for 26 weeks. Dietary levels of 300, 900, 2,800, and 8,300 ppm delivered average daily doses of approximately 30, 60, 180, and 550 mg butyl benzyl phthalate/kg body weight. The final mean body weight and body weight gain of the 25,000 ppm males were significantly less than those of the controls. Except for the 25,000 ppm males, feed consumption by all exposed groups was similar to that by the controls. An exposure-related macrocytic responsive anemia was present in the 25,000 ppm group at all time points. Additionally, minimal erythrocyte count decreases occurred sporadically in the 2,800 and 8,300 ppm groups at various time points. Reticulocyte counts were increased on days 60 and 90. Increases in mean cell hemoglobin and mean cell hemoglobin concentrations occurred in the 8,300 and 25,000 ppm rats. The absolute right cauda, right epididymis, and right testis weights and the sperm concentration of 25,000 ppm males were significantly less than those of the controls. The incidences of hypospermia and of atrophy of the seminiferous tubule in the testis and of hypospermia in the epididymis in 25,000 ppm males were significantly greater than those in the in the controls. Degenerative changes of the testis and epididymis in the 25,000 ppm males were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed in males in the 10-week modified mating study. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 60 male F344/N rats were given 0, 3,000, 6,000, or 12,000 ppm butyl benzyl phthalate (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 120, 240, or 500 mg butyl benzyl phthalate/kg body weight), and groups of 60 female F344/N rats were given 0, 6,000, 12,000, or 24,000 ppm butyl benzyl phthalate (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 300, 600, or 1,200 mg/kg) in feed for 2 years. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption: Survival of all exposed groups of male and female rats was similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of the 12,000 ppm males and 24,000 ppm females were less than those of the controls throughout most of the study. Feed consumption by the females exposed to 24,000 ppm was less than that by the controls at the beginning of the study, but was similar to that by the controls by week 6. Hematology and Hormone Assays: In general, hematology changes were sporadic and minor. At 6 months, a minimal decrease in erythrocyte count and an increase in mean cell hemoglobin, similar to that which occurred in the 26-week study, occurred in male rats in the 12,000 ppm group. In female rats, a decreased hematocrit value occurred at 15 months in the 24,000 ppm group. There was also a mild decrease in triiodothyronine concentrations in the 24,000 ppm females at 6 and 15 months and at the end of the study. Pathology Findings: of pancreatic acinar cell adenoma and adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 12,000 ppm males were significantly greater than those in the controls. The incidences of adenoma and of adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 12,000 ppm males exceeded the ranges of historical controls from NTP 2-year feed studies. One carcinoma was observed in one 12,000 ppm male, and two adenomas were observed in 24,000 ppm females. At 2 years, the incidence of focal hyperplasia of the pancreatic acinar cell in 12,000 ppm males was significantly greater than that in the controls. At 2 years, transitional epithelial papillomas in the urinary bladder were observed in one control female and in two 24,000 ppm females. The incidence of this neoplasm exceeded the range of historical controls from NTP 2-year feed studies. The incidence of transitional epithelial hyperplasia in 24,000 ppm females was significantly greater than that in the controls. The absolute right kidney weight of 12,000 ppm females and the relative right kidney weights of all exposed groups of males and of 24,000 ppm females were significantly greater than those of the controls at the 15-month interim evaluation. The severities of renal tubule pigmentation in 12,000 ppm males and in 24,000 ppm females were greater than those in the controls at 15 months and 2 years. At 2 years, the incidences of kidney mineralization in 6,000 and 24,000 ppm females were significantly less than that in the controls, and the severity was decreased in exposed females. The incidence of preputial gland adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 12,000 ppm male rats was significantly less than in the controls, and the incidences occurred with a negative trend. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Results from in vitro mutagenicity tests with butyl benzyl phthalate were uniformly negative. No mutagenic response was obtained in any of several strains of Salmonella typhimurium treated with up to 11,550 mg/plate butyl benzyl phthalate, with or without S9 metabolic activation enzymes. Negative results were also obtained in in vitro studies of mammalian cell systems with and without S9. No induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells or sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells were observed. These assays also were conducted with and without S9. No significant increase in sex-linked recessive lethal mutations was observed in germ cells of male Drosophila melanogaster after administration of butyl benzyl phthalate either in feed or by injection. In contrast to the negative results obtained in vitro and in Drosophila, butyl benzyl phthalate gave positive responses in two in vivo studies with mice. Results of a mouse bone marrow sister chromatid exchange test were positive at sample times of 23 and 42 hours, but no confirmatory test was conducted. Chromosomal aberrations were induced in bone marrow cells of male mice sampled 17 hours after intraperitoneal injection of 5,000 mg/kg butyl benzyl phthalate. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this 2-year feed study, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of butyl benzyl phthalate in male F344/N rats based on the increased incidences of pancreatic acinar cell adenoma and of acinar cell adenoma or carcinoma (combined). There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of butyl benzyl phthalate in female 344/N rats based on the marginally increased incidences of pancreatic acinar cell adenoma and of transitional epithelial papilloma of the urinary bladder. Exposure of rats to butyl benzyl phthalate in feed for 2 years resulted in focal hyperplasia in the pancreas in male rats and in transitional epithelial hyperplasia in the urinary bladder of female rats.

Wide variations in the function of the P2X(7) receptor have been observed, in part because of a loss-of-function polymorphism that changes Glu-496 to Ala without affecting the surface expression of the receptor on lymphocytes. In this study a second polymorphism (Ile-568 to Asn) has been found in heterozygous dosage in three of 85 normal subjects and in three of 45 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. P2X(7) function was measured by ATP-induced fluxes of Rb(+), Ba(2+), and ethidium(+) into various lymphocyte subsets and was decreased to values of approximately 25% of normal. The expression of the P2X(7) receptor on lymphocytes was approximately half that of normal values as measured by the binding of fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody. Transfection experiments showed that P2X(7) carrying the Ile-568 to Asn mutation was non-functional because of the failure of cell surface expression. The differentiation of monocytes to macrophages with interferon-gamma up-regulated P2X(7) function in cells heterozygous for the Ile-568 to Asn mutation to a value around 50% of normal. These data identify a second loss-of-function polymorphism within the P2X(7) receptor and show that Ile-568 is critical to the trafficking domain, which we have shown to lie between residues 551 and 581.","['Wiley, James S', 'Dao-Ung, Lan-Phuong', 'Li, Changping', 'Shemon, Anne N', 'Gu, Ben J', 'Smart, Megan L', 'Fuller, Stephen J', 'Barden, Julian A', 'Petrou, Steven', 'Sluyter, Ronald']","['Wiley JS', 'Dao-Ung LP', 'Li C', 'Shemon AN', 'Gu BJ', 'Smart ML', 'Fuller SJ', 'Barden JA', 'Petrou S', 'Sluyter R']","['Department of Medicine, University of Sydney at Nepean Hospital, Penrith, New South Wales 2750, Australia. wileyj@medicine.usyd.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Asparagine', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Isoleucine', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/genetics/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2003/02/15 04:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M212759200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)58438-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 May 9;278(19):17108-13. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M212759200.

However, the significance of MRD in the second year of therapy is unclear. Moreover, it is unknown whether treatment intervention can alter outcome in patients with detectable MRD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the prognostic value of MRD testing in bone marrow samples from 85 children at 1, 12, and 24 months from diagnosis using clone-specific polymerase chain reaction primers designed to detect clonal antigen receptor gene rearrangements. These children were part of a multicenter, randomized clinical trial, which, in the second year of treatment, compared a 2-month reinduction-reintensification followed by maintenance chemotherapy with standard maintenance chemotherapy alone. RESULTS: MRD was detected in 69% of patients at 1 month, 25% at 12 months, and 28% at 24 months from diagnosis. By univariate analysis, high levels of MRD at 1 month, or the presence of any detectable MRD at 12 or 24 months from diagnosis, were highly predictive of relapse. Multivariate analysis showed that MRD testing at 1 and 24 months each had independent prognostic significance. Intensified therapy at 12 months from diagnosis did not improve prognosis in those patients who were MRD positive at 12 months from diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Clinical outcome in childhood ALL can be predicted with high accuracy by combining the results of MRD testing at 1 and 24 months from diagnosis.","['Marshall, Glenn M', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Kwan, Edward', 'Zhu, Ling', 'Ferrara, Daniella', 'Xue, Chengyuan', 'Brisco, Michael J', 'Sykes, Pamela J', 'Morley, Alexander', 'Webster, Boyd', 'Dalla Pozza, Luciano', 'Waters, Keith', 'Norris, Murray D']","['Marshall GM', 'Haber M', 'Kwan E', 'Zhu L', 'Ferrara D', 'Xue C', 'Brisco MJ', 'Sykes PJ', 'Morley A', 'Webster B', 'Dalla Pozza L', 'Waters K', 'Norris MD']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Sydney Children's Hospital Randwick, Randwick 2031, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2003/02/15 04:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.10.080 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Feb 15;21(4):704-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.10.080.,,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,['J Clin Oncol. 2003 Dec 1;21(23):4463-4; author reply 4464-5.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first remission received a single consolidation of high-dose cytarabine-idarubicin at a median of 1.1 month postremission with the intent to proceed to ASCT and IL-2 9 x 10(6) U/m(2)/24 h for 4 days, followed by 10 days of IL-2 1.6 x 10(6) U/m(2)/24 h on hematologic recovery. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of patients received the intended ASCT, and 68% of patients received IL-2 treatment. With a median follow-up of 39.4 months (range, 1.2 to 76.3 months), the 2-year cumulative probability of DFS for all 56 patients is 68% (95% confidence interval [CI], 55% to 80%) and 74% (95% CI, 57% to 85%) for the 39 patients undergoing IL-2 treatment after ASCT. The 2-year cumulative probability of DFS for favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable cytogenetics is 88% (95% CI, 59% to 97%), 48% (95% CI, 26% to 67%), and 70% (95% CI, 23% to 93%), respectively. Toxicities from IL-2 were mainly thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, fever, and fluid retention.

We compared these regimens as initial chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients (N = 856) with advanced Hodgkin's disease were randomly assigned to treatment with ABVD or MOPP/ABV. The major end points were failure-free and overall survival, life-threatening acute toxicities, and serious long-term toxicities, including cardiomyopathy, pulmonary toxicity, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and secondary malignancies. RESULTS: The rates of complete remission (76% v 80%, P =.16), failure-free survival at 5 years (63% v 66%, P =.42), and overall survival at 5 years (82% v 81%, P =.82) were similar for ABVD and MOPP/ABV, respectively. Clinically significant acute pulmonary and hematologic toxicity were more common with MOPP/ABV (P =.060 and.001, respectively). There was no difference in cardiac toxicity. There were 24 deaths attributed to initial treatment: nine with ABVD and 15 with MOPP/ABV (P =.057). There have been 18 second malignancies associated with ABVD and 28 associated with MOPP/ABV (P =.13). Thirteen patients have developed MDS or acute leukemia: 11 were initially treated with MOPP/ABV, and two were initially treated with ABVD but subsequently received MOPP-containing regimens and radiotherapy before developing leukemia (P =.011). CONCLUSION: ABVD and the MOPP/ABV hybrid are effective therapies for Hodgkin's disease. MOPP/ABV is associated with a greater incidence of acute toxicity, MDS, and leukemia. ABVD should be considered the standard regimen for treatment of advanced Hodgkin's disease.","['Duggan, David B', 'Petroni, Gina R', 'Johnson, Jeffrey L', 'Glick, John H', 'Fisher, Richard I', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Canellos, George P', 'Peterson, Bruce A']","['Duggan DB', 'Petroni GR', 'Johnson JL', 'Glick JH', 'Fisher RI', 'Connors JM', 'Canellos GP', 'Peterson BA']","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, 750 East Adams Street, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA. duggand@upstate.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Dacarbazine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Procarbazine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Vinblastine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2003/02/15 04:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.12.086 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Feb 15;21(4):607-14. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.12.086.,,,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP-ABV protocol']",,,['J Clin Oncol. 2003 Feb 15;21(4):583-5.

The present study investigated the central role of hCG in this process by using antisense receptor phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). Culturing cytotrophoblasts with the hCG/LH receptor antisense, but not sense, ODN resulted in a significant decrease in receptor protein levels and inhibited spontaneous as well as exogenous hCG induced increase in differentiation. The hCG/LH receptor antisense ODN also inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF), TGF-alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), but not 8-bromo-cAMP, induced increases in differentiation, suggesting that hCG is required for EGF, TGF-alpha and LIF, but not for the cAMP actions. Although antisense EGF receptor and LIF receptor ODNs inhibited EGF and LIF induced increase in differentiation, respectively, they were ineffective against hCG, suggesting that they use separate pathways, but they both converge on a common pathway requiring the hCG actions. Mechanism of action studies revealed that EGF treatment activates its receptors and MAPK, both of which are required for EGF to increase the differentiation, cAMP levels and activate protein kinase A. In summary, our results demonstrate that hCG is an autocrine and paracrine regulator that is required for EGF, TGF-alpha, and LIF, but not for cAMP to increase human placental syncytium formation. Direct activation of protein kinase A seems to bypass the hCG pathway, perhaps by targeting genes associated with the differentiation.","['Yang, M', 'Lei, Z M', 'Rao, Ch V']","['Yang M', 'Lei ZM', 'Rao ChV']","[""Division of Research, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Women's Health, University of Louisville Health Sciences Center, Louisville, Kentucky 40292, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, LH/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/pharmacology', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/*physiology']",2003/02/15 04:00,2003/03/29 05:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/en.2002-220922 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2003 Mar;144(3):1108-20. doi: 10.1210/en.2002-220922.,,,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, LH)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) transiently enhances p27(kip1) gene transcription in some cells, its effects on p27(KIP1) protein levels are generally more gradual and sustained. This suggests that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment may be stabilizing p27(KIP1) protein, which is sensitive to modification by the SCF(SKP2) protein ubiquitin ligase and proteosomal degradation. Here, we show that treatment of AT-84 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells with the 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) analog EB1089 increases p27(KIP1) protein levels without significantly affecting expression of its mRNA. EB1089 treatment repressed expression of mRNAs encoding the F-box protein p45(SKP2), a marker of poor head and neck cancer prognosis, and the cyclin kinase subunit CKS1, which is essential for targeting p45(SKP2) to p27(KIP1). This coincided with a reduction of total p45(SKP2) protein, and p45(SKP2) associated with p27(KIP1). Consistent with these findings, turnover of p27(KIP1) protein was strongly inhibited in the presence of EB1089. A similar reduction in p45(SKP2) expression and stabilization of p27(KIP1) protein was observed in 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-sensitive UF-1 promyelocytic leukemia cells, which also respond by transiently increasing p27(kip1) gene transcription. Our results reveal that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) analogs increase levels of p27(KIP1) in different cell types by inhibiting expression of SCF(SKP2) subunits and reducing turnover of p27(KIP1) protein.","['Lin, Roberto', 'Wang, Tian Tian', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr', 'White, John H']","['Lin R', 'Wang TT', 'Miller WH Jr', 'White JH']","['Department of Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1Y6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/analysis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Stability', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism']",2003/02/15 04:00,2003/03/29 05:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/en.2002-0026 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2003 Mar;144(3):749-53. doi: 10.1210/en.2002-0026.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'Q0OZ0D9223 (seocalcitol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most B-CLL cell samples undergo apoptotic death in response to DNA damage. However, a clinically distinct aggressive subset of B-CLL is completely resistant in vitro to irradiation-induced apoptosis. We therefore addressed 2 series of microarray analyses on 4 sensitive and 3 resistant B-CLL cell samples and compared their gene expression patterns before and after apoptotic stimuli. Data analysis pointed out 16 genes whose expression varied at least 2-fold specifically in resistant cells. We validated these selected genes by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 7 microarray samples and confirmed their altered expression level on 15 additional B-CLL cell samples not included in the microarray analysis. In this manner, in 11 sensitive and 11 resistant B-CLL cell samples tested, 13 genes were found to be specific for all resistant samples: nuclear orphan receptor TR3, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II glycoprotein HLA-DQA1, mtmr6, c-myc, c-rel, c-IAP1, mat2A, and fmod were up-regulated, whereas MIP1a/GOS19-1 homolog, stat1, blk, hsp27, and ech1 were down-regulated. In some cases, the expression profile may be dependent on the status of p53. Some of these genes encode general apoptotic factors but also exhibit lymphoid cell specificities that could potentially be linked to the development of lymphoid malignancies (MIP1alpha, blk, TR3, mtmr6).

However, downstream mediators of the effects of ATRA are not well understood. We used a cDNA microarray to search for ATRA-regulated genes in the APL cell line NB4 and found that ATRA regulated several members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway. Here we show that TNF can synergize with ATRA to induce differentiation, showing monocytic characteristics more typical of differentiation mediated by TNF than by ATRA. ATRA and TNF can also induce differentiation of the non-APL cell line U937. Underlying this response was an increase in TNF-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) DNA binding within 2 hours in the presence of ATRA and activation of NF-kappaB DNA binding and transcriptional activity in response to ATRA alone within 48 hours of ATRA treatment. Furthermore, we found a synergistic induction of the NF-kappaB target genes BCL-3, Dif-2, and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) in response to the combination of TNF and ATRA. These genes have been previously shown to play a role in TNF signaling, and amplification of such genes may represent a mechanism whereby TNF and ATRA can act synergistically. We propose that ATRA can prime cancer cells for differentiation triggered by TNF and suggest that targeting the TNF pathway in combination with ATRA may represent a novel route to treat leukemias.","['Witcher, Michael', 'Ross, Douglas T', 'Rousseau, Caroline', 'Deluca, Leslie', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Witcher M', 'Ross DT', 'Rousseau C', 'Deluca L', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research and SMBD Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal H3T1E2, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2003/02/15 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2725 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54000-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 1;102(1):237-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2725.

We previously reported that HOX11 immortalizes murine hematopoietic progenitors and induces pre-T-cell tumors in mice after long latency. It has been demonstrated in a number of studies that HOX11, similar to other homeodomain proteins, binds DNA and transactivates transcription. These findings suggest that translocation-activated HOX11 functions as an oncogenic transcription factor. Here we report that HOX11 represses transcription through both TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters. Interestingly, transcriptional repression by HOX11 is independent of its DNA binding capability. Moreover, a systematic mutational analysis indicated that repressor activity was separable from immortalizing function, which requires certain residues within the HOX11 homeodomain that make base-specific or phosphate-backbone contacts with DNA. We further showed that the pathologic action of HOX11 involves DNA binding-dependent transcriptional pathways that are distinct from those controlling expression of a chromosomal target gene (Aldh-1). We conclude that dysregulated expression of a particular set of downstream target genes by DNA binding via the homeodomain is of central importance for leukemia initiation mediated by HOX11.","['Owens, Bronwyn M', 'Zhu, Yuan-Xiao', 'Suen, Ting-Chung', 'Wang, Pei-Xiang', 'Greenblatt, Jack F', 'Goss, Paul E', 'Hawley, Robert G']","['Owens BM', 'Zhu YX', 'Suen TC', 'Wang PX', 'Greenblatt JF', 'Goss PE', 'Hawley RG']","['Department of Hematopoiesis, Holland Laboratory, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD 20855, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2003/02/15 04:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2857 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50666-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 15;101(12):4966-74. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2857.

These findings suggest a model of malignant transformation in Down syndrome AMKL in which GATA1 mutations are an early event and AMKL arises from latent TL clones following initial apparent remission.","['Hitzler, Johann K', 'Cheung, Joseph', 'Li, Yue', 'Scherer, Stephen W', 'Zipursky, Alvin']","['Hitzler JK', 'Cheung J', 'Li Y', 'Scherer SW', 'Zipursky A']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, ON, Canada. johann.hitzler@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/etiology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2003/02/15 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-01-0013 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54052-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 1;101(11):4301-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0013.

DNA methylation of a region surrounding the transcription start site of p57KIP2 was found in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)-derived cell lines. Methylation of this region correlated with gene silencing, and treatment of methylated/silenced cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in gene re-expression. P57KIP2 was methylated in 31 (50%) of 63 patients with newly diagnosed ALL, and in 11 (52%) of 21 patients with relapsed ALL. In 5 of them (25%), methylation was acquired at relapse. No association was observed between methylation of p57KIP2 alone and clinical-biologic characteristics studied, including overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival. Methylation of multiple genes in a cell-cycle regulatory pathway composed of p73, p15, and p57KIP2 occurred in 22% of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative patients. Ph-negative patients with methylation of 2 or 3 genes of this pathway had a significantly worse median OS compared with those with methylation of 0 or 1 gene (50 vs 467 weeks, respectively; P =.02). Our results indicate that p57KIP2 is frequently methylated in adult patients with ALL, and that inactivation of a pathway composed of p73, p15, and p57KIP2 predicts for poor prognosis in Ph-negative patients.","['Shen, LanLan', 'Toyota, Minoru', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Obata, Toshiro', 'Daniel, Sophia', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Imai, Kohzoh', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Shen L', 'Toyota M', 'Kondo Y', 'Obata T', 'Daniel S', 'Pierce S', 'Imai K', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Issa JP', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*DNA Methylation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/15 04:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2466 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44467-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 15;101(10):4131-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2466.

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), most MRD studies have focused on children, whereas in contrast, information on the value of MRD on adult ALL is scanty, and almost exclusively restricted to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies. Early response to therapy is one of the most important prognostic factors in acute leukemia, which prompted us to investigate whether or not early immunophenotypic assessment of MRD could also be a valuable tool for predicting relapse in adult patients with ALL. For that purpose we have analyzed the level of MRD during the initial phase of treatment (induction phase) by multiparameter flow cytometry in a series of 102 adolescent (older than 14 years) and adult patients with ALL. Immunophenotypic evaluation of the bone marrow (BM) at day +35 showed that patients with low MRD levels (< 0.05% leukemia-associated phenotype [LAP+] cells) had a significantly longer relapse-free survival (RFS) than patients with high MRD levels, and this prognostic influence was retained when only those patients in morphologic complete remission (mCR) at day +35 were considered (median RFS: 42 months vs 16 months; P =.001). Moreover, immunophenotyping helped to identify a small subset of patients (n = 12) with negative or low MRD levels (< 0.03% LAP+ cells) by day +14, with an excellent prognosis (projected RFS of 90% at 5 years). The contrary is true of patients who achieved late mCR (after day +35), since immunophenotypic investigation of MRD showed that, in spite of the mCR, none of the cases with more than 0.1% LAP+ cells would be relapse-free after 2 years. Multivariate analysis showed that the immunologic evaluation of MRD at day +35 was the most relevant independent prognostic parameter for adult patients with ALL, and together with age, white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis, and presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, represented the most informative combination of variables for predicting relapse-free survival.","['Vidriales, Maria-Belen', 'Perez, Jose J', 'Lopez-Berges, Maria Consuelo', 'Gutierrez, Norma', 'Ciudad, Juana', 'Lucio, Paulo', 'Vazquez, Lourdes', 'Garcia-Sanz, Ramon', 'del Canizo, Maria Consuelo', 'Fernandez-Calvo, Javier', 'Ramos, Fernando', 'Rodriguez, M Jesus', 'Calmuntia, M Jose', 'Porwith, Ana', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'San-Miguel, Jesus F']","['Vidriales MB', 'Perez JJ', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'Gutierrez N', 'Ciudad J', 'Lucio P', 'Vazquez L', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'del Canizo MC', 'Fernandez-Calvo J', 'Ramos F', 'Rodriguez MJ', 'Calmuntia MJ', 'Porwith A', 'Orfao A', 'San-Miguel JF']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Salamanca, Spain. mvidrialesv@aehh.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",2003/02/15 04:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2613 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50626-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 15;101(12):4695-700. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2613.

Investigators have postulated that unmutated and mutated CLL arises from malignant transformation of pre- and post-germinal center (GC) B cells, respectively. Alternatively, unmutated cases may arise from B cells stimulated by T-cell-independent antigens or from GC B cells with inactive somatic hypermutation. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a protein essential for somatic hypermutation, is expressed by GC B cells in which this process occurs. We investigated AID mRNA expression in 20 CLL cases. In 8 cases we detected high expression of wild-type AID mRNA and 2 splice variants; in 12 cases and 5 normal peripheral blood B-cell samples we detected no expression using standard conditions. Of 8 CLL cases that highly expressed AID, 7 were unmutated, suggesting that this subset may arise from GC-experienced B cells with inactive somatic hypermutation, and may predict prognosis.","['McCarthy, Helen', 'Wierda, William G', 'Barron, Lynn L', 'Cromwell, Candy C', 'Wang, Jing', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'Rangel, Roberto', 'Elenitoba-Johnson, Kojo S J', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V']","['McCarthy H', 'Wierda WG', 'Barron LL', 'Cromwell CC', 'Wang J', 'Coombes KR', 'Rangel R', 'Elenitoba-Johnson KS', 'Keating MJ', 'Abruzzo LV']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytidine Deaminase/chemistry/*genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2003/02/15 04:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2906 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50657-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 15;101(12):4903-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2906.

Recently, we reported a preferential use of the VH3-21 gene in mutated CLL and showed that mutated VH3-21 cases had an inferior overall survival compared with other mutated CLL. In order to further characterize this subset, we performed VH gene analysis in 265 CLL cases and identified 31 VH3-21 cases (11.7%); 21 cases had mutated and 10 cases unmutated VH genes. Regardless of VH gene mutation status, a poor overall survival was found in the VH3-21 cases with a median survival of 83 months. These survival data confirm that VH3-21 cases do not fit into the general prognostic grouping of mutated and unmutated CLL. A large fraction of VH3-21 cases also demonstrated unique features with shorter lengths of the third complementarity determining region (CDR3) and CDR3s with highly homologous amino acid sequences. Furthermore, the VH3-21 cases showed a striking dominance of lambda light chain expression, and analysis of the Iglambda gene rearrangements revealed highly restricted use of the Vlambda2-14/Jlambda3 genes in the majority of cases. Taken together, our new findings strengthen the suggestion that VH3-21-using cases comprise a new CLL entity, irrespective of VH gene mutation status, and implicate that a common antigen epitope, perhaps of pathogenic significance, is recognized by the highly homologous VH3-21/Vlambda2-14 Ig molecules expressed in individual tumors.","['Tobin, Gerard', 'Thunberg, Ulf', 'Johnson, Anna', 'Eriksson, Inger', 'Soderberg, Ola', 'Karlsson, Karin', 'Merup, Mats', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Vilpo, Juhani', 'Enblad, Gunilla', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Roos, Goran', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Tobin G', 'Thunberg U', 'Johnson A', 'Eriksson I', 'Soderberg O', 'Karlsson K', 'Merup M', 'Juliusson G', 'Vilpo J', 'Enblad G', 'Sundstrom C', 'Roos G', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/*chemistry/genetics', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/chemistry/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/chemistry/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology', 'Survival Rate']",2003/02/15 04:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2003/02/15 04:00'],"['2003/02/15 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/15 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-11-3485 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50664-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 15;101(12):4952-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3485.

Novel retinoids are searched for, to improve potency and lower toxicity. We investigated the effect of the synthetic retinoid Ro 13-6307 on neuroblastoma growth in vitro on SK-N-BE(2) and SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, effects on tumour growth and the toxicity profile were investigated in a rat xenograft model. Effects of Ro 13-6307 were compared to 13-cis RA (retinoic acid) in vitro and in vivo. Neuroblastoma cells treated with 1 microM Ro 13-6307 exhibited neuronal differentiation, decreased proliferation and accumulation of cells in G1 phase in at least the same magnitude as 5 microM 13-cis RA. No apoptosis was detected in vitro. Treatment of nude rats with neuroblastoma using Ro 13-6307, 0.12 mg p.o. daily, decreased neuroblastoma growth in vivo, in terms of tumour volume during treatment and tumour weight at sacrifice (p < 0.05). In contrast, Ro 13-6307, 0.08 mg p.o. daily, resulted in no significant reduction in tumour growth. All rats treated with Ro 13-6307 gained less weight than control rats, but they exhibited no other signs of toxicity. The toxicity profile of Ro 13-6307 was similar to what we found with 13-cis RA.

The aim of this prospective, phase II study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of low dose combination induction treatment consisted of cytarabine at a dose of 10 mg/m2 every 12 h s.c. for 7 days, VP-16 at a dose of 100 mg/day p.o. for 7 days and mitoxantrone at a dose of 6 mg/m2 i.v daily on days 1-3. Two induction courses were planned. In the group of 44 patients 12 (27%) achieved CR, 4 (9%) patients were in PR and there were 9 (20%) early deaths (ED). Age, performance status, preceding myelodysplastic syndrome, karyotype, WBC and % of blasts in bone marrow were not significant prognostic factors for CR probability. The following initial factors appeared to be related to a shorter duration of survival time from the start of treatment: age >70 (p<0.03), poor performance status (p<0.03), and % of BM blasts 50 (p<0.05).

It may be important to predict the possible risk of disease progression in individual patients. We have investigated by immunocytochemistry the bcl-2 and p53 protein expression in 53 B-CLL patients at the time of initial diagnosis. All B-CLL cases were bcl-2 protein positive. The relatively high frequency of p53 protein immunoreactivity was observed (17 of 53 cases; 32%). The percentage of bcl-2 and p53 protein positive cells remarkably varied in individual patients. The heterogeneity in the percentage of bcl-2 as well as p53 positive cells showed to be important in the analysis of mutual relation of these proteins. Noteworthy results were obtained when the group of p53 positive B-CLL patients was analyzed according to the percentage of p53 positive cells (less than 20% and more than 20%, respectively). An inverse relationship between a higher accumulation of p53 and repressed bcl-2 expression and vice versa was observed. The male patients (female patients were not assessed because of the limited number of p53 positive cases) with less than 20% p53 immunoreactive cells revealed a high percentage of bcl-2 protein (p=0.0008). The higher incidence (over 20%) p53 positive cells correlated with lowered percentage of bcl-2 positive cells (p=0.0368). When the patients were subdivided according to p53 positivity and negativity, the majority of p53 positive cases were males (82%), with significantly higher WBC count (p=0.0362). No significant effect of higher or lower WBC counts on bcl-2 and p53 expression was observed. However, the expression of bcl-2 protein was significantly higher in female patients under 50 years (p=0.0012). Regarding the patients of age <or=50 and >50, a significant difference in WBC count was shown in males (p=0.0590). The peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from healthy subjects used as controls, exhibited undetectable, to low proportion of bcl-2 and p53 positive cells. Comparing the percentage of bcl-2 as well as p53 positive cells in controls and those of B-CLL patients, the significant difference for both proteins was observed (p=0.0009 and p=0.0001, respectively). The results of this study indicate that the overexpression of p53 protein may contribute to the downregulation of bcl-2 in a subgroup of our B-CLL patients. Considering the small numbers of tested p53 positive cases, it would be necessary to confirm our findings in a larger cohort of patients with longer follow up. Thus it would be possible to confirm our expectation of a possible value of the simultaneous aberrant expression of bcl-2 and p53 as useful predictors of future aggressive behavior of B-CLL.","['Klobusicka, M', 'Kusenda, J', 'Babusikova, O']","['Klobusicka M', 'Kusenda J', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. exonklo@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/immunology/*metabolism', 'Sex Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/immunology/*metabolism']",2003/02/14 04:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2003/02/14 04:00'],"['2003/02/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2002;49(6):387-93.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular basis for its oncogenic activity has not been delineated. In gel-shift assays, NuMA-RARalpha bound to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) both as a homodimer and as a heterodimer with RXRalpha. The binding profile of NuMA-RARalpha to a panel of RAREs was very similar to PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha. In transient transfection assays using HepG2 cells, NuMA-RARalpha inhibited wild-type RARalpha transcriptional activity, while it augmented STAT3 transcriptional activity. In GST-pull down experiments, NuMA-RARalpha formed a complex with the corepressor SMRT, was released from the NuMA-RARalpha/SMRT complexes by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) at 10(-7)-10(-6) M and became associated with the coactivator TRAM-1 at 10(-8) M ATRA. Studies comparing NuMA-RARalpha with NuMA-RARalpha(deltaCC) demonstrated that the dimerization or alpha-helical coiled-coil domain of NuMA was required for homodimer formation, transcriptional repression of wild-type RARalpha, transcriptional activation of STAT3, and stability of the NuMA-RARalpha/SMRT complex. Confocal fluorescent microscopy of HeLa cells was performed following transient expression of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged proteins and incubation of cells with or without ATRA. Within the nucleus, CFP-NuMA-RARalpha exhibited a speckled pattern identical to that observed in cells transfected with CFP-NuMA. Furthermore, CFP-NuMA-RARalpha colocalized with yellow fluorescent protein-tagged (YFP)-NuMA.

In human immunodeficiency virus, ribosomes translating full-length viral RNA can shift back by 1 nucleotide at a specific site defined by the presence of both a slippery sequence and a downstream stimulatory element made of an extensive secondary structure. This so-called frameshift mechanism could become a target for the development of novel antiviral strategies. A different recoding strategy is used by other retroviruses, such as murine leukemia viruses, to synthesize the Gag-Pol precursor; in this case, a stop codon is suppressed in a readthrough process, again due to the presence of a specific structure adopted by the mRNA. Development of antiframeshift agents will greatly benefit from the availability of a simple animal and virus model. For this purpose, the murine leukemia virus readthrough region was rendered inactive by mutagenesis and the frameshift region of human immunodeficiency virus was inserted to generate a chimeric provirus. This substitution of readthrough by frameshift allows the synthesis of viral proteins, and the chimeric provirus sequence was found to generate infectious viruses. This system could be a most interesting alternative to study ribosomal frameshift in the context of a virus amenable to the use of a simple animal model.","['Brunelle, Marie-Noelle', 'Brakier-Gingras, Lea', 'Lemay, Guy']","['Brunelle MN', 'Brakier-Gingras L', 'Lemay G']","['Departement de Biochimie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3C 3J7.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Frameshifting, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, gag/genetics', 'Genes, pol/genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', '*Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",2003/02/14 04:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2003/02/14 04:00'],"['2003/02/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.5.3345-3350.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Mar;77(5):3345-50. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.5.3345-3350.2003.,,,"['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,,,,,,PMC149774,,,,,,,,

To elucidate sequence motifs important for enhancer function in vivo, we injected newborn mice with MCF 1dr (supF), a weakly pathogenic, molecularly tagged (supF) MCF virus containing only one copy of a sequence that is present as two copies (known as the directly repeated [DR] sequence) in the U3 region of MCF 247 and analyzed LTRs from supF-tagged proviruses in two resulting thymomas. Tagged proviruses integrated upstream and in the reverse transcriptional orientation relative to c-myc provided the focus of our studies. These proviruses are thought to contribute to thymoma induction by enhancer-mediated deregulation of c-myc expression. The U3 region in a tagged LTR in one thymoma was cloned and sequenced. Relative to MCF 1dr (supF), the cloned U3 region contained an insertion of 140 bp derived predominantly from the DR sequence of the injected virus. The inserted sequence contains predicted binding sites for transcription factors known to regulate the U3 regions of various murine leukemia viruses. Similar constellations of binding sites were duplicated in two proviral LTRs integrated upstream from c-myc in a second thymoma. We replaced the U3 sequences in an infectious molecular clone of MCF 247 with the cloned proviral U3 sequences from the first thymoma and generated an infectious chimeric virus, MCF ProEn. When injected into neonatal AKR mice, MCF ProEn was more pathogenic than the parental virus, MCF 1dr (supF), as evidenced by the more rapid onset and higher incidence of thymomas. Molecular analyses of the resultant thymomas indicated that the U3 region of MCF ProEn was genetically stable. These data suggest that the arrangement and/or redundancy of transcription factor binding sites generated by specific U3 sequence duplications are important to the biological events mediated by MCF proviruses integrated near c-myc that contribute to transformation.","['DiFronzo, Nancy L', 'Frieder, Marisa', 'Loiler, Scott A', 'Pham, Quynh N', 'Holland, Christie A']","['DiFronzo NL', 'Frieder M', 'Loiler SA', 'Pham QN', 'Holland CA']","[""Center for Virology and Immunology Research, Children's Research Institute, George Washington University School of Medical and Health Sciences, Washington, DC 20010, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Binding Sites', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Thymoma/*virology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*virology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology']",2003/02/14 04:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2003/02/14 04:00'],"['2003/02/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.5.3326-3333.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Mar;77(5):3326-33. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.5.3326-3333.2003.,,,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],,,,['CA-41510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC149780,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that this class of inhibitor targets a fusion-active structure of HTLV-1 envelope. In particular, the peptides bind specifically to a core coiled-coil domain of envelope, and peptide variants that fail to bind the coiled-coil lack inhibitory activity. Our data indicate that the inhibitory peptides likely function by disrupting the formation of a trimer-of-hairpins structure that is required for membrane fusion. Importantly, we also show that peptides exhibiting dramatically increased potency can be readily obtained.

Recently, it was reported that As(2)O(3), a drug used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (PML), stimulates HIV-1 replication. We found that As(2)O(3) accelerates the kinetics of a spreading HIV-1 infection in human T cells and increases the number of cells bearing HIV-1 provirus after a single round of infection. The stimulatory effect occurred after membrane fusion and resulted in increased steady-state levels of newly synthesized viral cDNA. Stimulation was independent of HIV-1 env and most viral accessory genes, and As(2)O(3) had no detectable effects on viral expression postintegration or virion assembly. Murine leukemia virus (MLV) transduction was enhanced by As(2)O(3) to the same extent as HIV-1 transduction, but As(2)O(3) had no additional effect on Fv1 restriction. In contrast, As(2)O(3) largely overcame the specific block to N-tropic MLV reverse transcription posed by human Ref1. As(2)O(3) disrupts PML bodies, nuclear structures named for a major component, the PML protein. We observed no changes in PML bodies in response to HIV-1 infection. Experiments with PML-null target cells indicated that PML has no effect on HIV-1 infectivity and is dispensable for the stimulatory effect of As(2)O(3). As(2)O(3) caused cell death in uninfected cells at the same concentrations which stimulate HIV-1 replication. Among four additional apoptosis-inducing agents, a boost in HIV-1 infectivity was observed only with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, a compound which, like As(2)O(3), disrupts the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In summary, As(2)O(3) stimulates retroviral reverse transcription, perhaps via effects on mitochondria, and provides a useful tool for characterizing Ref1.","['Berthoux, Lionel', 'Towers, Greg J', 'Gurer, Cagan', 'Salomoni, Paolo', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Luban, Jeremy']","['Berthoux L', 'Towers GJ', 'Gurer C', 'Salomoni P', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Luban J']","['Department of Microbiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Carbon-Oxygen Lyases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis', '*DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",2003/02/14 04:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2003/02/14 04:00'],"['2003/02/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.5.3167-3180.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Mar;77(5):3167-80. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.5.3167-3180.2003.,,,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 4.2.- (Carbon-Oxygen Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (APEX1 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (Apex1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,"['P30 AI042848/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI42848/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC149754,,,,,,,,

Both contain a nuclear export signal (NES) in their C-terminal domain and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in their N-terminal domain. The NES and NLS are necessary for shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm and are therefore indispensable for the transport of unspliced and singly spliced viral transcripts. HIV-1 Rev function is restricted in A9 cells, a murine fibroblast cell line, whereas HTLV-1 Rex is functional in these cells. Immunofluorescence studies with RevGFP fusion protein demonstrate normal import and export of Rev in A9 cells. To ascertain which domains of Rev are necessary for the restriction of Rev function in A9 cells, we studied a chimeric construct in which the NES domain of Rev was exchanged with Rex C-terminal amino acids 79 to 95, the Rev1-79/Rex79-95 chimera, which restored Rev function in A9 cells. In addition, overexpression of a truncated Rev containing the Rev C-terminal domain in the presence of wild-type Rev, led to restoration of Rev function in A9 cells. These results suggest that the C-terminal domain of HIV-1 Rev plays an important role in restricting Rev function in murine cells.","['Marques, Sandra M P', 'Veyrune, Jean-Luc', 'Shukla, Ram R', 'Kumar, Ajit']","['Marques SM', 'Veyrune JL', 'Shukla RR', 'Kumar A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The George Washington University, Washington, DC 20037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/*virology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, rev/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, rex/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV-1/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",2003/02/14 04:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2003/02/14 04:00'],"['2003/02/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.5.3084-3090.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Mar;77(5):3084-90. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.5.3084-3090.2003.,,,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,"['AI42491/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72147/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC149738,,,,,,,,

Via either transfection or infection, human cell lines transduced with the LA vector produced a lentiviral vector in a doxycycline-dependent manner at titers up to 10(5) to 10(6) green fluorescent protein transducing units per ml, which are comparable to the titers obtained by conventional multiple plasmid transfection methods. Efficient spread and persistent expression of the transgene were observed in cells maintained in long-term culture that had been infected with the LA vector. Furthermore, when cocultured with adherent cells infected with the LA vector, the human T-cell leukemia cell line was successfully transduced with a marker gene.

Although the critical risk factor for ATL development is not clear, it has been noted that ATL is incidentally associated with mother-to-child infection, elevated proviral loads, and weakness in HTLV-1-specific T-cell immune responses. In the present study, using a rat system, we investigated the relationships among the following conditions: primary HTLV-1 infection, a persistent HTLV-1 load, and host HTLV-1-specific immunity. We found that the persistent HTLV-1 load in orally infected rats was significantly greater than that in intraperitoneally infected rats. Even after inoculation with only 50 infected cells, a persistent viral load built up to considerable levels in some orally infected rats but not in intraperitoneally infected rats. In contrast, HTLV-1-specific cellular immune responses were markedly impaired in orally infected rats. As a result, a persistent viral load was inversely correlated with levels of virus-specific T-cell responses in these rats. Otherwise very weak HTLV-1-specific cellular immune responses in orally infected rats were markedly augmented after subcutaneous reimmunization with infected syngeneic rat cells. These findings suggest that HTLV-1-specific immune unresponsiveness associated with oral HTLV-1 infection may be a potential risk factor for development of ATL, allowing expansion of the infected cell reservoir in vivo, but could be overcome with immunological strategies.","['Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Ohashi, Takashi', 'Hanabuchi, Shino', 'Kato, Hirotomo', 'Takemura, Fumiyo', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Hasegawa A', 'Ohashi T', 'Hanabuchi S', 'Kato H', 'Takemura F', 'Masuda T', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'HTLV-I Antigens/administration & dosage/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Proviruses', 'Rats', 'Spleen/cytology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Viral Load']",2003/02/14 04:00,2003/03/21 04:00,['2003/02/14 04:00'],"['2003/02/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.5.2956-2963.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Mar;77(5):2956-63. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.5.2956-2963.2003.,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)']",,,,,,,PMC149753,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to explore the relationship between inflammatory leukocyte activation and mutagenesis using co-culture systems. We investigated the mutagenic potentials of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-stimulated differentiated HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia cells), and RAW 264.7 cells (murine macrophages) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon (IFN)-gamma by co-culturing each cell line with AS52 cells, a transgenic Chinese hamster ovary cell line. HL-60 cells rapidly generated superoxide (O(2)(-)) 15 min to 1 h (peak at 30 min) following TPA stimulation. RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS and IFN-gamma produced O(2)(-), nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) continuously for 5-25 h. There was a 2.0-fold increase in the mutation frequency of the gpt gene in AS52 cells co-cultured with TPA stimulated HL-60 cells, when compared with non-treated cells. Importantly, this increase in mutation frequency was significantly suppressed by antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor (inhibition rates: IRs = 18.2 and 35.1%, respectively). Similarly, co-culture of AS52 cells with LPS/IFN-gamma-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells also increased the mutation frequency of the gpt gene by 2.6-fold, and this increase in mutation frequency was suppressed by SOD, DPI and N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-L-ornithine dihydrochloride (L-NIO), an specific iNOS inhibitor (IRs = 58.3, 70.8 and 70.8%, respectively). In co-culture experiments, activated HL-60 and RAW 264.7 cells increased 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in AS52 cells when compared with non-treated controls (1.7- and 1.6-fold, respectively). Treatment of AS52 cells with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2), 100 micro M), ONOO(-) (100 micro M) and SIN-1 (100 micro M), a ONOO(-) generator, also increased the mutation frequency of the gpt gene (4.6-, 5.4- and 2.8-fold, respectively). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that RONS, derived from activated inflammatory leukocytes, are mutagenic in the biological systems, and that RONS generation inhibitors are potentially anti-mutagenic, and thus may be useful in cancer preventive strategies.","['Kim, Ha Won', 'Murakami, Akira', 'Williams, Marshall V', 'Ohigashi, Hajime']","['Kim HW', 'Murakami A', 'Williams MV', 'Ohigashi H']","['Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/*metabolism', 'Nitrogen/*metabolism', 'Pentosyltransferases/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2003/02/14 04:00,2003/04/01 05:00,['2003/02/14 04:00'],"['2003/02/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/24.2.235 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2003 Feb;24(2):235-41. doi: 10.1093/carcin/24.2.235.,,,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.22 (xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'N762921K75 (Nitrogen)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty-four patients, 27 with chronic granulocytic leukemia and seven with myelodysplastic syndrome, were studied in order to identify disease-specific aberrations, trisomy 8 and monosomy 7 using both traditional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization on interphase bone marrow cells. Using alphoid-satellite centromeric specific probes, trisomy 8 indicating the progression of the disease and poor prognosis in chronic granulocytic leukemia as well as monosomy 7 in myelodysplastic syndrome were identified. RESULTS: In 21 of 34 cases both methods led to the same results. In 13 patients fluorescence in situ hybridization making possible to examine a great number of cells, provided more information about the gain and loss of chromosomes above and clarified uncertain cytogenetic results. CONCLUSIONS: In both hematological malignancies, studied by the authors, fluorescence in situ hybridization proved a useful and sensitive method to determine chromosomes unrecognized or not accurately identified by the traditional cytogenetic analysis and to define the ratio of pathological cells. At the same time the results confirm that conventional cytogenetic analysis is still essential in diagnosing the genetic alterations of malignant cells and point at the chromosomes that are worth further studying by other methods.","['Szabo Gabriella, P', 'Balogh, Erzsebet', 'Jakab, Zsuzsanna', 'German, Peter', 'Bodnar, Ferencne', 'Kiss, Attila', 'Telek, Bela', 'Olah, Eva']","['Szabo Gabriella P', 'Balogh E', 'Jakab Z', 'German P', 'Bodnar F', 'Kiss A', 'Telek B', 'Olah E']","['Debreceni Egyetem, Orvos-es Egeszsegtudomanyi Centrum, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar, Gyermekklinika.']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Trisomy/*diagnosis/genetics']",2003/02/14 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2003/02/14 04:00'],"['2003/02/14 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2002 Dec 15;143(50):2775-9.,,,,,,,,,,,A citogenetikai vizsgalat es fluoreszcencia in situ hibridizacio parhuzamos alkalmazasanak jelentosege kronikus granulocytas leukaemiaban es myelodysplasias szindromaban a 8-as triszomia es a 7-es monoszomia kimutatasara.,,,,,,,

Phase II clinical trials have shown marked therapeutic activity of imatinib in all evolutive phases of CML, but notably in the chronic phase, where it induces complete hematological responses in almost 100% of patients resistant or intolerant to interferon, with a major cytogenetic response rate of 60%, including 41% complete cytogenetic responses. The preliminary results of an ongoing phase III multicenter randomized study comparing imatinib with interferon plus cytarabine as first-line treatment for CML favor imatinib in terms of efficacy and safety. If confirmed with longer follow-up,these results would establish imatinib as the choice therapy for the majority of CML patients, with allogeneic transplantation being restricted as initial therapy only to younger patients with a family donor. Longer follow-up will answer some questions, such as those on long-term safety, durability of the responses, whether these will translate into a survival prolongation and the possibility of molecular responses. In addition, further information on the mechanisms involved in the primary and acquired resistance to imatinib is needed. Besides the Bcr-Abl protein, the drug is also active against other tyrosine kinases, such as Abl, the stem-cell factor receptor (c-kit) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, whose inhibition might have potential implications for the treatment of several malignancies. In this sense, it must be pointed out that imatinib has shown a remarkable activity in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","['Hernandez-Boluda, Juan Carlos', 'Cervantes, Francisco']","['Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Cervantes F']","['Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Drugs Today (Barc),"Drugs of today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998)",101160518,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biological Availability', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/03/05 04:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['696536 [pii]', '10.1358/dot.2002.38.9.696536 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs Today (Barc). 2002 Sep;38(9):601-13. doi: 10.1358/dot.2002.38.9.696536.,,62,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,['Copyright 2002 Prous Science'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were included, 48 of whom experienced at least 1 cutaneous reaction. These reactions consisted of 36 rashes, 35 edemas, and 22 pruritus. The rash was severe in 5 patients, resulting in temporary interruption of treatment in 3. Highly significant relationships were observed between the daily dose of imatinib and both rashes and edema. In a multivariate analysis, female sex and the daily dose of imatinib were independent risk factors for the development of rashes.

STUDY DESIGN: All cases that had a diagnosis of invasive oral cancer (ICD-9 sites 140-146) during the study period were retrieved from the records of the Nova Scotia Cancer Registry, which theoretically includes all cancer cases in the province. Cases of in situ carcinoma, lymphoma, and leukemia were not included. All cases during the study period were categorized by tumor site and the age and sex of the patient. Tumors at ICD-9 sites 141 and 143-146 were analyzed separately as intraoral cancer. Trends were studied by grouping cases into three 5-year periods: period 1 (1983-1987), period 2 (1988-1992), and period 3 (1993-1997). Age-standardized incidence rates were calculated to the 1991 Canadian standard population. RESULTS: A total of 1,155 cases of oral cancer were registered in Nova Scotia for this 15-year study period, accounting for 2.0% of all cancer cases. There was an average of 57 cases in men and 20 cases in women per year. Overall, the most common site was the lip (26% of cases), followed by the tongue (20%), other mouth (16%), tonsil/oropharynx (12%), salivary gland (12%), floor of mouth (10%), and gum (4%). About 5% of cases occurred in patients 40 years and younger, and 53% occurred in patients 65 years and older. Lip cancer in men decreased by 38%, and the age-standardized incidence rate fell from 5.6 to 3.0 per 100,000 from period 1 to period 3. Intraoral cancers in men increased by 23% and the age-standardized incidence rate increased by 10% from period 1 to period 3. Both measures peaked in period 2. Intraoral cancer in women increased steadily by 84%, and the age-standardized incidence rate increased by 48% from period 1 to 3. The male-to-female ratio for intraoral cancer cases decreased from 2.9 to 2.5 to 1.9 over the 3 periods. CONCLUSION: Although there was a decreasing trend for lip cancer, the number of cases and the age-standardized incidence rate for intraoral cancer increased over the 15-year study period. Intraoral cancer increases in females were dramatic. Trends in the number of cases reflected changing risk and a growing, aging population. More oral cancers occurred each year than cancers of the uterine cervix, suggesting the need for more resource allocation in the areas of research, prevention, and early detection of oral cancer.","['Howell, Robin E', 'Wright, Bruce A', 'Dewar, Ron']","['Howell RE', 'Wright BA', 'Dewar R']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Sciences, Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Salhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

Many aspects of the cellular response to anthracyclines remain debated. The status of the main regulator of iron homeostasis, namely the RNA-binding activity of iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), has been assessed herein for two types of human tumor cells and their derived doxorubicin-resistant sublines. IRPs were always fully activated in the latter, whereas only partial activation occurred in the former. Doxorubicin exposure reversibly inactivated IRP1 in small cell lung carcinoma (GLC(4)) and myelogenous leukemia (K562) cell lines, but was without effect in their derived doxorubicin-resistant sublines. In contrast, adding doxorubicin to cytosolic fractions of untreated cells or to purified IRPs led to the irreversible alteration of the RNA-binding activity of IRP1. In these different conditions, interaction between doxorubicin and the iron regulatory system disturbs iron metabolism, and cells having developed a resistance mechanism are tuned to maximize the iron supply. The results reported herein may lead the path toward a better therapeutic management of cancer patients receiving doxorubicin by discriminating between the antiproliferative and cardiotoxic properties of this anthracycline.","['Brazzolotto, Xavier', 'Andriollo, Maud', 'Guiraud, Pascale', 'Favier, Alain', 'Moulis, Jean-Marc']","['Brazzolotto X', 'Andriollo M', 'Guiraud P', 'Favier A', 'Moulis JM']","['CEA/Grenoble, DRDC/BECP, 17 rue des Martyrs, 38054 Cedex 9, Grenoble, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Iron/analysis/metabolism', 'Iron Regulatory Protein 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0167488902003919 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4889(02)00391-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2003 Feb 17;1593(2-3):209-18. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4889(02)00391-9.,,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 4.2.1.3 (Iron Regulatory Protein 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When present, it is generally progressive, resulting in the patient being cured of cancer only to die of respiratory failure. Lung transplantation is believed by some to be of overly high risk in this population because of the pre-existing malignancy as well as the presumed compromised immune status. METHODS: Six children (Group 1), aged 5 to 17 years (mean 12.4 years), underwent lung transplantation at our institution because of either pulmonary fibrosis or bronchiolitis obliterans following treatment for acute leukemia (n = 5) or medulloblastoma (n = 1). All patients received chemotherapy, radiation and bone marrow transplantation in the course of treatment for their malignancies. The average forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) was 16% of the predicted value and forced vital capacity (FVC) was 28% of predicted. These results were compared with a similar group of 13 patients undergoing lung transplantation at our institution during the same time interval (Group 2). RESULTS: There were 2 deaths in Group 1, 1 early and 1 late, for an overall survival of 67% at a mean follow-up of 4.02 years. There were no early and 7 late deaths in Group 2 for an overall survival of 46% at a mean follow-up of 4.8 years. The acute rejection rate in the first post-transplant year was 0.2 episode/patient in Group 1 and 1.8 episode/patient in Group 2 (p <0.01). No patient in Group 1 has developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease or a relapse of their primary malignancy. Two patients in Group 1 developed unusual infections-Aspergillus and Mycobacterium chelonae. No such infections occurred in Group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Although this represents a small series, we believe that patients with respiratory failure following treatment of a prior malignancy are suitable candidates for lung transplantation. Although they may have some relative protection from acute rejection episodes by virtue of an already compromised immunologic status while receiving standard immunosuppression, an increased propensity for opportunistic infection may exist.","['Pechet, Taine V', 'de le Morena, Maite', 'Mendeloff, Eric N', 'Sweet, Stuart C', 'Shapiro, Steven D', 'Huddleston, Charles B']","['Pechet TV', 'de le Morena M', 'Mendeloff EN', 'Sweet SC', 'Shapiro SD', 'Huddleston CB']","[""Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis Children's Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Heart Lung Transplant,The Journal of heart and lung transplantation : the official publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation,9102703,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Bronchiolitis Obliterans/*etiology/*surgery', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', '*Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/therapy', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/*etiology/*surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/08/30 05:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['S105324980200671X [pii]', '10.1016/s1053-2498(02)00671-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Heart Lung Transplant. 2003 Feb;22(2):154-60. doi: 10.1016/s1053-2498(02)00671-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigations were undertaken to determine whether this variation reflected actual intercell differences in adduct levels. Melphalan-treated CCRF-CEM leukaemia cells were analysed by the trapped-in-agarose DNA immunostaining (TARDIS) method using fluorescein immunofluorescence and Hoechst dye-DNA fluorescence. Increasing the time of DNA denaturation in alkali affected the staining intensity, in agreement with known adduct properties, but failed to reduce intercell heterogeneity. To test the hypothesis that heterogeneity resulted from variation in levels of DNA strand breaks, drug-treated cells were exposed to ionising radiation. An increase in level and reduction in heterogeneity of immunofluorescence were observed, optimal at 10 Gy. When samples were irradiated after lysis, 1 Gy was optimal. At the optimal doses, irradiation before or after lysis resulted in similar levels of DNA strand breaks. Our conclusions are as follows: (a) There was no major intercell variation in the number of adducts other than from variation in DNA content. (b) Detection of melphalan, and possibly other adducts, by immunofluorescence can be markedly influenced by the level of strand breaks present in the DNA. (c) Samples analysed for melphalan adducts by immunofluorescence should be irradiated to minimise errors due to this factor.","['Frank, Adrian J', 'Tilby, Michael J']","['Frank AJ', 'Tilby MJ']","['Department of Haematology, Medical School, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, England.

He had manifested with lumbago, high-grade fever, and confusion. Physical examination on admission showed disorientation and severe back pain. There were neither lymphadenopathy nor hepatosplenomegaly. Routine laboratory tests showed moderate pancytopenia, hypercalcemia (serum calcium, 15.9 mg/dL), IgM lambda-type monoclonal gammopathy (IgG, 405 mg/dL; IgA, 42 mg/dL; and IgM, 2023 mg/dL), and lambda-type Bence-Jones protein in the urine (0.8 g/d). Bone marrow biopsy showed the clusters of surface lambda-positive small-sized mature-appearing lymphoplasmacytoid cells. Bone survey and computed tomographic scan showed multiple osteolytic lesions and a tumor involving the third lumbar spine (L3). An open biopsy of the L3 tumor showed diffuse proliferation of CD20- and lambda-positive large cells. We thus diagnosed the patient as simultaneously having LPL and DLBCL. Although the combination chemotherapy was at least partially effective, he died of bacteremia and organ failure after three courses of chemotherapy. To clarify the clonal relatedness between LPL and DLBCL, we analyzed the sequences of the complementarity-determining region 3 in immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 80 consecutive, newly diagnosed, and unselected AML patients (age 18-77 yr) undergoing remission induction chemotherapy. The patients were examined for 28 d. MAIN FINDINGS: Low levels of serum MBL (<1,000 microg/L) were found in 16/80 patients at diagnosis. This frequency is similar to what is found in the general population. In the remaining 64 patients, MBL concentrations were significantly higher than in controls and showed only a slight rise during the period of antineoplastic chemotherapy with its associated infectious complications. Low levels of MBL did not affect overall survival or morbidity in terms of incidence or duration of fever, or occurrence of septicaemia or pneumonia. Long-term survival was likewise independent of MBL concentration. CONCLUSION: MBL levels have no discernible influence on the occurrence or course of infections in AML patients during the initial hospitalisation. The predominant immunodeficiency during this phase is the profound granulocytopenia, which also compromises important effector functions of MBL. The finding in most AML patients of elevated MBL concentrations on admission is most likely because of the role of MBL as an acute phase reactant.","['Bergmann, Olav J', 'Christiansen, Michael', 'Laursen, Inga', 'Bang, Peter', 'Hansen, Niels Ebbe', 'Ellegaard, Jorgen', 'Koch, Claus', 'Andersen, Vagn']","['Bergmann OJ', 'Christiansen M', 'Laursen I', 'Bang P', 'Hansen NE', 'Ellegaard J', 'Koch C', 'Andersen V']","['Department of Haematology, Copenhagen University Hospital/Herlev Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. olbe@herlevhosp.kbhamt.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Fever/blood/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infections/blood/*etiology/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*complications/mortality', 'Male', 'Mannose-Binding Lectin/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Morbidity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Rate']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/05/08 05:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['012 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00012.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2003 Feb;70(2):91-7. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00012.x.,,,['0 (Mannose-Binding Lectin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ex vivo culture with exogenous IL-8 enhances IL-8 expression and prolongs leukaemia cell survival, partly through increased bcl-2 expression. IL-8 may function as an autocrine growth and apoptosis resistance factor in CLL. Therefore, we evaluated the prognostic relevance of plasma IL-8 levels in 151 CLL patients [median age 61 years (range, 32-84 years), median plasma IL-8 level 18.9 pg/ml (9.1-89.1 pg/ml)]. All Rai stages were represented; advanced stage was associated with significantly higher plasma IL-8 levels (P < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis). Also, plasma IL-8 level was correlated with serum beta2-microglobulin (beta2-M) (R = 0.24, P = 0.0081), haemoglobin (R = -0.39, P < 0.0001) and platelet count (R = -0.23, P = 0.0049) by Spearman's rank correlation. Univariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards models identified elevated IL-8 and beta2-M as significant prognostic factors with relative risks of 7.43 (P = 9.1 x 10(-9)) and 16.40 (P = 5.9 x 10(-10)) respectively. High levels of IL-8 were associated with shorter survival independent of beta2-M level.

We have examined the surface expression of CD80, CD86, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II, CD11a, CD54, and CD58 on the blast cells from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) at presentation. CD80 was only rarely expressed on AML blasts and, in those leukaemic cells expressing CD80, the level of expression was low. In contrast, expression of CD86 was detected on the AML blasts in more than half of the samples tested and, in some cases, the level of expression was equivalent to that of mature monocytes and activated B lymphocytes. The percentage of leukaemic blasts expressing CD86 was higher in the M4 and M5 French-American-British (FAB) types, and expression of CD11a and HLA class II was higher in the M4 FAB type. There was no difference in expression of CD80, CD54, CD58, or HLA Class I between different FAB subgroups. There was no significant difference in duration of first remission with expression of CD80, CD86, CD11a, CD54 or HLA class II. However, when expression of CD80 and CD86 were considered together, a significantly longer duration of remission was found.

However, molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of ICAM-1 in eosinophils are still being elucidated. We investigated the effect of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on ICAM-1 expression of eosinophils. METHODS: The surface expression of ICAM-1 on a human eosinophilic leukaemic cell line, EoL-1, was assessed by immunocytochemical staining. The phosphorylation of inhibitor kappa B-alpha (IkappaB-alpha) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was detected by Western blot. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) pathway-related genes were evaluated by the cDNA expression array system, whereas the activity of NF-kappaB was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). RESULTS: TNF-alpha was found to induce the cell surface expression of ICAM-1. A specific proteasome inhibitor N-cbz-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG-132), but not a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580), was found to suppress the TNF-alpha-induced expression of ICAM-1 on EoL-1 cells. The gene expressions of ICAM-1, NF-kappaB and IkappaBalpha were up-regulated after the stimulation with TNF-alpha. Further, TNF-alpha was shown to induce IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation and degradation, thereby indicating the activation of NF-kappaB. In EMSA, there was a shifted NF-kappaB band on TNF-alpha-treated cells with or without SB 203580, but no shifted band was observed on MG-132-treated cells. CONCLUSION: In vitro studies of EoL-1 cells, an eosinophilic leukaemic cell line, confirmed that NF-kappaB plays an important role in the expression of ICAM-1 and recruitment of eosinophils in allergic inflammation.","['Ip, W K', 'Wong, C K', 'Lam, C W K']","['Ip WK', 'Wong CK', 'Lam CW']","['Department of Chemical Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,IM,"['Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/metabolism', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/04/15 05:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['1585 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2222.2003.01585.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2003 Feb;33(2):241-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2222.2003.01585.x.,,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These range from the benign inability to concentrate urine that is seen in sickle cell disease to renal infarction that results from nephrotic syndrome. Our ability to treat and prevent these complications will improve as our understanding of these disease processes and their pathophysiology grows. Additionally, it is important for urologists to understand the underlying pathophysiology of hematologic disease to best serve the patients. For example, it may be the urologist who makes the diagnosis of ovarian vein thrombosis in a pregnant woman with right lower quadrant pain and fever. This diagnosis, with the proper treatment of antibiotics and anticoagulation, could prevent the potential development of septic thrombophlebitis.

For other diseases, however, the role of HCT in treatment remains a subject of further research. The availability of HCT was significantly expanded by developing alternative graft sources that currently include BM, peripheral blood, and UCB from autologous and allogeneic related or unrelated donors. Progress in autologous HCT has been achieved by the identification of more effective and less toxic preparative regimens and by ex vivo purging of stem cell products. In allogeneic HCT, graft-versus-leukemia or graft-versus-tumor effects are being exploited increasingly to lower relapse rates. In addition, immunomodulation to promote tolerance, as well as allogeneic antitumor reactions have been achieved by antibody therapy, cytokine therapy, or cell-based immunotherapy. Future improvements are likely, as evidenced by promising preliminary results in the development of stem cell collection techniques, in vitro stem cell expansion, and purging techniques of stem cell grafts. The development of less intensive or nonmyeloablative preparative regimens may further reduce regimen-related morbidity and mortality Specific immunotherapy may facilitate tolerance induction in mismatched allogeneic HCT and support allogeneic HCT in the setting of donor-host HLA disparity.

FC and cpPCR were both more sensitive than morphologic examination. A positive cpPCR result is associated with higher tumor cell numbers than a negative cpPCR result, as determined by FC (P = .0017). We determined cutoff values for number of tumor cells at which cpPCR is consistently positive. At 6.8 tumor cells per microliter, cpPCR would be expected to be positive in at least 90% of the samples. FC was adequate in 86 cases (100%), while cpPCR was adequate in 74 cases (86%). FC is superior to cpPCR for detecting minimal residual HCL.

Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), and segmented poly(ether urethane) (Tecoflex 60) were used as reference biomedical polymers. The protein adsorption onto the polymer surfaces from a cell culture medium was determined. The amount of the total protein adsorbed onto the PMBs was lower than that adsorbed onto the reference polymers, and the amount of adsorbed protein decreased with an increase in the MPC units in the PMBs. Human premyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) was used, and the expression of IL-1beta mRNA was investigated with the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. When HL-60 cells were cultured on PMBs, the expression of IL-1beta mRNA in the cells was much less than that on the reference polymers. In particular, the expression of IL-1beta mRNA in HL-60 cells cultured on the PMBs containing more than 10 mol % MPC units was not detected. This corresponded to the reduced amount of adsorbed proteins on the PMB surfaces. These results suggest that the PMBs effectively suppressed the activation and inflammatory response of adherent macrophagelike cells.","['Sawada, Shin-ichi', 'Sakaki, Shujiro', 'Iwasaki, Yasuhiko', 'Nakabayashi, Nobuo', 'Ishihara, Kazuhiko']","['Sawada S', 'Sakaki S', 'Iwasaki Y', 'Nakabayashi N', 'Ishihara K']","['Division of Organic Materials, Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 2-3-10 Kanda-surugadai, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 101-0062, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biomed Mater Res A,Journal of biomedical materials research.

RESULTS: The positive percentage of hTERTmRNA expression was 73.81% for the primary treatment cases, and 19.05% for the complete remission cases. All of the recurrent cases gave positive results. One of the normal controls presented low level of hTERTmRNA expression.

Here, we have identified human SNAIL3 (SNAI3) gene using bioinformatics. Human SNAI3 gene, consisting of at least three exons, spans around the nucleotide position 320214-328221 of human reference genomic contig NT_010404.8 in the reverse orientation.

Human SNAI3 gene was found to encode 292-amino-acid polypeptide with the N-terminal SNAG domain and five zinc finger domains. N-terminal SNAG domain was identified in zinc finger proteins SNAI1, SNAI2, SNAI3, SCRATCH (SCRT1), GFI1, and GFI1B. ATP/GTP binding site was identified in SCRT1, GFI1 and GFI1B, but not in SNAI1, SNAI2 and SNAI3. Phylogenetic analysis of human zinc finger proteins with SNAG domain revealed that SNAI1, SNAI2 and SNAI3 were more closely related. These results clearly indicate that SNAI1, SNAI2 and SNAI3 constitute a subfamily among SNAG zinc-finger proteins. Human SNAI3 mRNA was expressed in skin melanotic melanoma, lung epidermoid carcinoma, and germ cell tumor. Because SNAG zinc-finger proteins are transcriptional repressors implicated in carcinogenesis and embryogenesis, SNAI3 gene might be a potent target of pharmacogenomics in the field of oncology and regenerative medicine.","['Katoh, Masuko', 'Katoh, Masaru']","['Katoh M', 'Katoh M']","['M & M Medical BioInformatics, Narashino 275-0022, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Contig Mapping', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",2003/02/13 04:00,2004/01/14 05:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2003 Mar;11(3):383-8.,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SNAI3 protein, human)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mononuclear cells, recovered from fresh CB units by density-gradient centrifugation, were partly frozen and then thawed and partly immediately utilized for clonogenic tests. The cells were cultured in H4330 (C group) or H4434 (H4330 added with SC clonogenic growth factors) (C+ group) semisolid media added or not with serum-free Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM/sf). Cells seeded on H4330 were exposed to the conditioned supernatants from two human-embryo liver cell lines, which have been previously found to stimulate clonal growth of fresh CB hematopoietic cells.

CFU number was higher in cryopreserved than fresh cells in both C and C+ culture groups. Conditioned supernatants from both cell lines stimulated clonal growth in both fresh and cryopreserved cell cultures.

We found no effects of LIF on cell viability and prolactin secretion of unstimulated endometrial stromal cells.

Further, the extracellular matrix did not affect these stimulatory effects of LIF on cell viability of 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated endometrial stromal cells. These results indicate that LIF enhances the cell viability of PRL-non-secreting 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated stromal cells, and that the cell survival signals generated by LIF are independent of those generated by the extracellular matrix.

Our result might suggest that process of hnRNP B1 expression in ATLL differs from those in other lymphoid neoplasms and carcinoma.","['Tani, Hiroki', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Haraoka, Seiji', 'Hamasaki, Makoto', 'Kamma, Hiroshi', 'Ikeda, Seiyo', 'Kikuchi, Masahiro']","['Tani H', 'Ohshima K', 'Haraoka S', 'Hamasaki M', 'Kamma H', 'Ikeda S', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Carcinoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology/secondary', 'Cell Line, Tumor/chemistry', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B/*deficiency/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/immunology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2003 Mar;22(3):529-34.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (hnRNP A2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While investigating the apoptotic pathway induced by 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) in the human T-lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM (CEM) cells, we could easily retrieve high molecular weight (HMW) DNA fragments with a predominant size of 50 kb. However, under the same circumstances, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis was undetectable despite estimated heightened caspase-3 activity. Paradoxically, generation of low molecular weight DNA fragments was readily demonstrable by flow cytometric and immunohistochemical evidence in the absence of any detectable DNA ladder formation. These findings present a proof that, within certain contexts, small-sized DNA fragmentation occurring in apoptosis may not necessarily be of the ladder yielding internucleosomal integer multiples' pattern. Our data also add to the evidence that the machinery underlying HMW DNA fragmentation is distinct from that responsible for the internucleosomal one.","['Badran, Adel', 'Iwasaki, Hiromichi', 'Inoue, Hitoshi', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Badran A', 'Iwasaki H', 'Inoue H', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Matsuoka, Fukui 910-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/*pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleosomes/chemistry']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2003 Mar;22(3):517-22.,,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Review).,481-97,"CD26 is a surface glycoprotein with intrinsic dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) enzyme activity with multiple biological roles, including being intricately involved in immunoregulation as a T-cell activation molecule and as a regulator of chemokine function. T-cell lymphoid malignancies represent a heterogeneous group of diseases that are generally aggressive and are for the most part resistant to current treatment modalities. Previous studies showed that CD26 is expressed on selected T-cell neoplasms, suggesting a potential role for CD26 in tumor development. We review herein recent classification schemes for T-cell lymphoid malignancies that take into account various facets of their clinical presentation. In addition, we discuss findings supporting the conclusion that CD26 has an essential role in human T-cell activation, as well as its ability to regulate the biological effects of selected chemokines through its DPPIV activity. Finally, we will present recent work from our laboratory that indicates a potential role for CD26 as a molecular target for novel treatment modalities for T-cell lymphoid malignancies.","['Sato, Kazuya', 'Dang, Nam H']","['Sato K', 'Dang NH']","['Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, UT M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/drug effects/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/drug effects/*physiology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/enzymology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/classification/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation/*physiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/classification/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pentostatin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Transfection', 'World Health Organization']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2003 Mar;22(3):481-97.,,123,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Morphological changes showing apoptotic bodies were observed in the Molt 4B cells treated with these anthocyanins. The fragmentations by these anthocyanins of DNA to oligonucleosomal-sized fragments, that is a characteristic of apoptosis, were observed to be concentration-dependent. N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an antioxidant, suppressed the fragmentation of DNA by these anthocyanins.

Somatic mutations of the p53 gene are frequently detected in human cancers. Several methods can be used for identification of p53 mutations, including FASAY - functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast. FASAY distinguishes yeast colonies expressing functional p53 protein from colonies producing a dysfunctional p53 protein simply on the basis of color. The validity of the method depends on a low background level. There are several sources of background as PCR-induced point mutations, low quality of RNA and alternative splicing of intron 9 affecting the p53 carboxy-terminus. In the present work we show that FASAY can be successfully used for analysis of mRNA isolated from blood samples that were collected and stored for 24 hours at 0 degrees C without undesired increase of background. We also measured fidelity of several commonly used DNA polymerases and determined the most suitable kinds of Pfu DNA polymerases for FASAY.

It is used in the production of piperidine, an intermediate in the manufacture of rubber and mepiquat chloride, and as an intermediate and solvent in the preparation of vitamins and drugs, dyes, textile water repellants, and flavoring agents in food. Pyridine was nominated for study because of its large production volume and its use in a variety of food, medical, and industrial products. Male and female F344/N rats, male Wistar rats, and male and female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to pyridine (approximately 99% pure) in drinking water for 13 weeks or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and mouse bone marrow cells. 13-WEEK STUDY IN F344/N RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats were exposed to pyridine in drinking water at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 250, 500, or 1,000 ppm (equivalent to average daily doses of 5, 10, 25, 55, or 90 mg pyridine/kg body weight). Two females exposed to 1,000 ppm died during week 1. Final mean body weights of 1,000 ppm males and females and 500 ppm females were significantly less than controls. Water consumption by female rats exposed to 1,000 ppm was less than that by controls. At study termination, evidence of anemia persisted in the 500 and 1,000 ppm males and all exposed groups of females. There was evidence of hepatocellular injury and/or altered hepatic function demonstrated by increased serum alanine aminotransferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities and bile acid concentrations in 500 and 1,000 ppm rats. The estrous cycle length of 1,000 ppm females was significantly longer than that of the controls. Liver weights of males and females exposed to 250 ppm or greater were significantly greater than controls. In the liver, the incidences of centrilobular degeneration, hypertrophy, chronic inflammation, and pigmentation were generally increased in 500 and 1,000 ppm males and females relative to controls. In the kidney, the incidences of granular casts and hyaline degeneration (hyaline droplets) were significantly increased in 1,000 ppm males and slightly increased in 500 ppm males; these lesions are consistent with 2u-globulin nephropathy. Additionally, there were increased incidences and/or severities of protein casts, chronic inflammation, mineralization, and regeneration primarily in 500 and 1,000 ppm males. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MALE WISTAR RATS: Groups of 10 male Wistar rats were exposed to pyridine in drinking water at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 250, 500, or 1,000 ppm (equivalent to average daily doses of 5, 10, 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg). One male rat exposed to 500 ppm died during week 1. Final mean body weights of rats exposed to 250, 500, or 1,000 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls. Water consumption by rats exposed to 1,000 ppm was lower than that by controls. There was evidence of hepatocellular injury and/or altered hepatic function in the 500 and 1,000 ppm groups, similar to that observed in the 13-week study in F344/N rats. Incidences of centrilobular degeneration, hypertrophy, chronic inflammation, and pigmentation in the liver of rats exposed to 500 or 1,000 ppm were significantly increased relative to controls. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to pyridine in drinking water at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 250, 500, or 1,000 ppm (equivalent to average daily doses of 10, 20, 50, 85, or 160 mg/kg for males and 10, 20, 60, 100, or 190 mg/kg for females). One female mouse exposed to 250 ppm died during week 2. Final mean body weights of female mice exposed to 1,000 ppm were significantly less than those of controls. Water consumption by exposed female mice was lower than that by controls at week 1 but generally slightly higher than controls at week 13. Sperm motirm motility in exposed male mice was significantly decreased relative to controls. Liver weights were significantly increased relative to controls in males exposed to 100 ppm or greater and in 250 and 500 ppm females. No chemical-related lesions were observed in male or female mice. 2-YEAR STUDY IN F344/N RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats were exposed to pyridine in drinking water at concentrations of 0, 100, 200, or 400 ppm (equivalent to average daily doses of 7, 14, or 33 mg/kg) for 104 (males) or 105 (females) weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Water Consumption Survival of exposed males and females was similar to that of controls. Mean body weights of 400 ppm males and females were generally less than those of the controls throughout the study, and those of 200 ppm males and females were less during the second year of the study. Water consumption by males and females exposed to 200 or 400 ppm was generally greater than that by controls. Pathology Findings Incidences of renal tubule adenoma and renal tubule adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in male rats exposed to 400 ppm were significantly increased compared to controls and exceeded the historical control ranges. The findings from an extended evaluation (step section) of the kidneys did not reveal additional carcinomas, but additional adenomas were observed in each group of males. In the standard evaluation, an increased incidence of renal tubule hyperplasia was observed in 400 ppm males compared to controls. Incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in female rats were significantly increased in the 200 and 400 ppm groups, and the incidence in the 400 ppm group exceeded the historical control range. Exposure concentration-related nonneoplastic liver lesions were observed in males and females, and the incidences were generally increased in groups exposed to 400 ppm. These included centrilobular cytomegaly, cytoplasmic vacuolization, periportal fibrosis, fibrosis, centrilobular degeneration and necrosis, and pigmentation. Bile duct hyperplasia occurred more often in exposed females than in controls. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MALE WISTAR RATS: Groups of 50 male Wistar rats were exposed to pyridine in drinking water at concentrations of 0, 100, 200, or 400 ppm (equivalent to average daily doses of 8, 17, or 36 mg/kg) for 104 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Water Consumption Survival of rats exposed to 200 or 400 ppm was significantly less than that of the controls. Mean body weights of rats exposed to 100, 200, or 400 ppm were significantly less than controls. Water consumption was similar by control and exposed rats. Pathology Findings The incidence of testicular interstitial cell adenoma in rats exposed to 400 ppm was significantly increased compared to controls. Incidences of interstitial cell hyperplasia were observed in control and exposed groups and were slightly, but not significantly, increased in rats exposed to 200 or 400 ppm. Severity of nephropathy was marked in all groups, and additional evidence of kidney disease, including mineralization in the glandular stomach, parathyroid gland hyperplasia, and fibrous osteodystrophy, was observed in 100 and 200 ppm rats. The incidences of hepatic centrilobular degeneration and necrosis, fibrosis, periportal fibrosis, and/or pigmentation were increased in one or more exposed groups. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male B6C3F1 mice were exposed to pyridine in drinking water at concentrations of 0, 250, 500, or 1,000 ppm (equivalent to average daily doses of 35, 65, or 110 mg/kg) for 104 weeks, and groups of 50 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to pyridine in drinking water at concentrations of 0, 125, 250, or 500 ppm (equivalent to average daily doses of 15, 35, or 70 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Survival, Body Weights, and Water Consumption Survival of exposed males and females was similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of 250 and 500 ppm females were less than controls. Water consumption by males exposed to 250 or 500 ppm was generally greater than that by controls during the last year of the study; male mice exposed to 1,000 ppm consumed less water than controls throughout the study. Water consumption by exposed females was generally lower than that by controls during the first year of the study, but greater than controls during the second year. Pathology Findings Hepatocellular neoplasms, including hepatoblastomas, in exposed male and female mice were clearly related to pyridine exposure. Additionally, many mice had multiple hepatocellular neoplasms. The incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms in exposed males and females generally exceeded the historical control ranges for drinking water studies. Neoplasms from control mice, 1,000 ppm males, and 500 ppm females were negative when stained for p53 protein. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Pyridine was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 or in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, with or without S9 metabolic activation, and it did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9. Pyridine was tested for induction of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in adult male Drosophila melanogaster, and mixed results were obtained. In one experiment, administration by injection gave negative results, but feeding produced an equivocal response. A second experiment generated negative results by injection and feeding. A third experiment showed significant increases in sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in flies treated with pyridine by injection but not by feeding. Overall, results of the sex-linked recessive lethal mutations test in Drosophila melanogaster were considered negative by feeding and equivocal by injection. Results of a single reciprocal translocation test in male Drosophila melanogaster were negative. No induction of chromosomal aberrations or micronuclei was noted in bone marrow cells of male mice administered pyridine via intraperitoneal injection. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year drinking water studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of pyridine in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule neoplasms. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of pyridine in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in male Wistar rats based on an increased incidence of interstitial cell adenoma of the testis. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of pyridine in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of malignant hepatocellular neoplasms. In F344/N rats, exposure to pyridine resulted in increased incidences of centrilobular cytomegaly and degeneration, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and pigmentation in the liver of males and females; periportal fibrosis, fibrosis, and centrilobular necrosis in the liver of males; and bile duct hyperplasia in females. In male Wistar rats, pyridine exposure resulted in increased incidences of centrilobular degeneration and necrosis, fibrosis, periportal fibrosis, and pigmentation in the liver, and, secondary to kidney disease, mineralization in the glandular stomach and parathyroid gland hyperplasia.

However, recognition of tumor antigens by cytotoxic T cells is only one step towards effective cancer immunotherapy. Other crucial biological prerequisites must be fulfilled to expand tumor-reactive T cells that retain a functional phenotype, including in vivo cytolytic activity and the ability to travel to tumor sites without prematurely succumbing to apoptosis. We show that these requirements are met by expanding peripheral blood T cells genetically targeted to the CD19 antigen in the presence of CD80 and interleukin-15 (IL-15). T cells expanded in the presence of IL-15 uniquely persist in tumor-bearing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-Beige mice and eradicate disseminated intramedullary tumors.

Depending on the type of leukaemia and the study design, the prevalence of ocular disease in leukaemia varies from 30 to 90%. Although chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia in Western countries, the prevalence of ocular disease in CLL is not known. The aim of this prospective study was to estimate the prevalence of ocular disease in CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All CLL patients attending either a teaching or district general hospital haematology clinic were invited to undergo a full eye examination. The clinical stage of the CLL (Binet) at the time of the eye examination and the most recent full blood count (FBC) indices were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: Over 6 months, 25 patients with an average age of 65 were recruited. A total of 18 patients had Binet stage A disease, three had stage B, and four stage C. The mean FBC indices at the time of examination were haemoglobin 13.5 g/dl, white cell count 37.4 x 10(9)/l, and platelets 172 x 10(9)/l. Only three patients (12%) had ocular disease that was likely to be a secondary complication of CLL. These secondary complications included bilateral posterior subcapsular cataract following radiotherapy, unilateral acute retinal necrosis, and unilateral conjunctival vascular anomalies. The presence of ocular complications was not related to the CLL stage or to the current FBC parameters. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that ocular involvement in CLL is uncommon, a reflection of the indolent course of CLL as compared to other leukaemias. Although sight-threatening ocular complications have been documented in this and other studies, the low prevalence of complications and the lack of association with disease parameters make it impossible to identify a 'high-risk' group. Routine screening of CLL patients for ocular complications is not justified.","['Buchan, J', 'McKibbin, M', 'Burton, T']","['Buchan J', 'McKibbin M', 'Burton T']","['Department of Ophthamology, St James University Hospital, Leeds, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Eye (Lond),"Eye (London, England)",8703986,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Eye/pathology', 'Eye Diseases/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/03/06 04:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.eye.6700277 [doi]', '6700277 [pii]']",ppublish,Eye (Lond). 2003 Jan;17(1):27-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.eye.6700277.,,,,,,['Eye (Lond). 2003 Jan;17(1):3-4.

Human leukemic mast cells (HMC-1) have been used to study mast cell mediator and their role in inflammatory mechanisms. HMC-1 contain and release several inflammatory mediators, of which the proteolytic enzyme tryptase is most characteristic. Retinoids, including retinoic acid, are naturally occurring and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A. All-trans-retinoic (ATRA) acid had been previously reported to inhibit cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ATRA on the proliferation and secretion of tryptase in HMC-1. HMC-1 were treated with ATRA at 10(-4M), 10(-5M) or 10(-6M) for 3, 4 or 5 days in culture. Control HMC-1 were treated with equal amount of culture medium only. ATRA decreased the number of HMC-1 as compared to the control group. The same treatment for 3, 4 or 5 days also decreased intracellular tryptase levels. These results indicate that ATRA significantly inhibits both proliferation and growth as shown by the decreased intracellular tryptase levels in HMC-1.

GATA-2 gene disruption makes reduction in all hematopoietic precursors, whereas enforced expression of GATA-2 blocks normal hematopoiesis. GATA-2 exerts regulation in early embryo and cooperates with other GATA transcription factors in proliferation and differentiation of myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocytic and mast cell lineages. GATA-2 mRNA and protein could be detected in human myelogenous leukemia cell lines and in most patients with primary leukemias. Some data revealed that GATA-2 could transactivate the Cas-Br-E and graffi retroviruses, which can induce myelogenous leukemia in mice.

As compared to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts, AML blasts, except those of acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M(5)), form fewer amounts of long chain polyglutamate of MTX (MTXPG), when incubated with MTX, thus providing an explanation for their lack of responsiveness to MTX. To explore the novel approach of treatment in patients with AML-M(5), the U937 cell line, which has the monocytic characters, was used. Cell growth inhibition was mearsured by XTT assay after 24 and 48 hours in the continuous presence of various concentrations of MTX ranging from 1 nmol/L to 100 micro mol/L. After 24 hours MTX treatment, the IC(50) value for U937 cells was 0.04 micro mol/L. After 48 hours treatment, the IC(50) was 0.037 micro mol/L and IC(90) was 0.39 micro mol/L. To understand the mechanism of MTX cytotoxicity, the process of cell death was analyzed. A variety of assays, including trypan blue exclusion, flow cytometry, light microscopy (Wright's staining) and DNA fragment electrophoresis, were performed. There were no significant apoptotie changes after shorter exposure of MTX (4 and 6 hours). After 8 hours at various concentrations of MTX treatment ranging from 5 nmol/L to 10 micro mol/L, the percentage of the cells in the pre-G(1) (apoptotic) was 3.2% at 0.1 micro mol/L and it reached a peak of 18.2% at 5.0 micro mol/L. The DNA synthesis in S-phase was inhibited from 41.2% (0.01 micro mol/L) to 19.1% (10 micro mol/L). DNA ladder band, a feature of apoptosis, was observed.

Anyhow, the CD34(+) enriched populations have already been proved to show long-term reconstitution of hematopoiesis in animals and patients worldwidely. It still remains uncertain whether cells lack of CD34 and Lineage markers are the very best stem cells or maybe the residual embryonic stem cells keeping quiescent in the adult tissues are capable of transfer into hematopoietic stem cells when activated. Since just a negative selection technique is used to collect the CD34(-) cells everywhere for the time being, no final conclusion is convincing about the characterization of CD34(-) cells till a highly purified cell population of CD34(-)/Lin(-) is available. Clinical analysis shows that the most critical factor predicting the stem cell engraftment is the number of the cells infused. The number of nucleated cells in umbilical cord blood to be infused and required to obtain a successful engraftment is superior to 3.7 x 10(7)/kg. However, large dose of T-cell-depleted and purified CD34(+) cells as more than 5 x 10(6)/kg or even a 'megadose' of CD34(+) cells of 10(7)/kg is recommended for allotransplant of mobilized peripheral blood to achieve a high rate of successful engraftment. The delayed engraftment and the relapse of malignancy after cord blood transplantation are major problems. However, CBT is still the best choice of stem cell transplant for the baby patients with non-malignancies. At present, the HLA typing for class I antigens is still achieved with serology in most laboratories. As HLA typing is increasingly defined to higher degree of resolution by DNA probes, it is recommended to check with genotyping when there is a 'match' by the serological phenotyping especially for the unrelated donor/recipient couples. Improvements in DNA-based methods for the detection of numerous HLA alleles have provided the opportunity to investigate the relationship between HLA disparity and transplant complications. About 80% (or even more) of patients in China who might benefit from stem cell transplantation still fail to find suitable donors. It is worthy to adopt the unrelated donors matched or mismatched for those high-risk acute leukemia patients who do not have related matched donors but urgently need transplant. The advanced experience of unrelated mismatched transplant will no doubt be certain to carry weight and be disseminated in China. A great leap forward of the clinical practice and biological study on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells is expected in the new century to accept the challenge from the world outside China.","['Tang, Pei-Hsien']",['Tang PH'],,['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,2003/02/13 04:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2000 Mar;8(1):1-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore whether the WT1 may be used as a marker for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia, we examined the sensitivity of the nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by using WT1 gene primers in comparison with tumor-specific marker genes, such as PML/RARalpha gene in NB4 cells or bcr-abl gene in K562 cells. In all samples, the integrity of RNA was confirmed by amplification of the c-abl gene as an internal control.

In M-07e cells, the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSF R) is composed of two subunits: a low affinity alpha subunit and a phosphorylated beta subunit, which is constitutively linked to lyn(53/56) protein tyrosine kinase. In this study, The role of lyn kinase in regulating TGF-beta 1-induced apoptosis in M-07e cells was examined. The removal of rhGM-CSF from the culture medium resulted in down-regulation of lyn kinase activity, followed by growth inhibition and programmed cell death. Apoptosis of M-07e cells was accompanied with a massive cleavage of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins into shortened fragments with molecular mass of 22 kD and 18 kD, respectively. Using specific inhibitors, the cleavage of Bcl-2, but not Bax, was found to be processed through activated caspase-3 (CPP32), which is abundantly expressed in M-07e cells. TGF-beta 1 inhibited rhGM-CSF-stimulated cell growth and promoted apoptosis in M-07e cells with a pattern identical to that induced by rhGM-CSF depletion, which included massive cleavage of both Bcl-2 and Bax proteins and inactivation of lyn kinase activity. TGF-beta 1 did not affect the levels of lyn protein or the beta-subunit, neither did it block the interaction between these two components. Also, TGF-beta 1 treatment did not diminish the expression of the alpha subunit in M-07e cells. Our results showed that TGF-beta 1 inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in M-07e cells by inactivating the GM-CSF R-associated lyn kinase activity. Further, This study showed that Bcl-2 cleavage by activated CPP32 is a naturally occurring event associated with apoptosis, which is under the regulation of lyn kinase activation.","['Zhang, Xuemin', 'Hu, Meiru', 'Lan, Yu', 'Yu, Ming', 'Chen, Ben D-M']","['Zhang X', 'Hu M', 'Lan Y', 'Yu M', 'Chen BD']","['National Center of Biomedical Analysis, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing 100850, China; Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, and Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institutes, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201 USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,2003/02/13 04:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2000 Sep;8(3):166-175.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firstly, an optimal scheme of low dose total body irradiation combined with Ara-C was established in L615 leukemia (T lymphocytic leukemia) mouse model. The machanism of the enhancing effect was explored by patho-morphological observation, examination of residual leukemia cells, the expression of GM-CSF on the surface of marrow stromal cells and in the bone marrow cultural supernatants.

A specific fluorescent-labeled probe, binded with DNA/cDNA target, is supplemented into the reaction system of PCR. During the extension phase of PCR amplification, the specific fluorescent-labeled probe is cleaved by the 5'-->3' exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase, producing a fluorescent signal that can be detected. The amount of fluorescence released in the reaction is proportional to the target sequence number. Thus, an exactly and absolutely quantitative assessment of initial target DNA/cDNA copy number can be made in a closed tube assay system. This technique eliminates the need for post-PCR sample processing which is necessary in conventional PCR and decreases the probability of contamination which is inevitable in conventional PCR. Moreover, it reduces the potiental for false positive or negative results by utilizing the hybridization of a probe to sequences internal to amplification primers. RQ-PCR is proved to be a sensitive, specific, reliable and convenient tool for the quantification of minimal residual diseases (MRD) of hematological malignancies by recent studies. This article reviews the principle of RQ-PCR and its application in quantitative detection of MRD of hematological malignancies such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and malignant lymphoma.","['Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Laboratory of Internal Medicine, The First People's Hospital of Zhenjiang, Zhenjiang, 212007, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,2003/02/13 04:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2001 Sep;9(3):277-281.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 32 acute leukemia patients, the mean level of telomerase activity was (0.42 +/- 0.26) U (ranged 0 - 0.96 U) with a positive rate of 78.1%, showing a significantly higher activity in acute leukemia (P < 0.01). Moderate telomerase activity was detected in 21 cases of MDS, with a mean level of (0.27 +/- 0.19) U (0 - 0.97 U) from which the positive rate was 66.7%. This value was significantly higher than that in the normal BM (P < 0.05). Moreover, a significantly higher telomerase activity was shown in the high-risk group of MDS (P < 0.05). Based on the international scoring system evaluating the prognosis of MDS (IPPS), telomerase activity in HIGH subgroup was significantly higher than that in INT-1 and INT-2 subgroup (P < 0.05). The level of telomerase activity was not correlated to the chromosome aberrations. These results show that a borderline telomerase activity could be found in normal bone marrow cells. Telomerase activity was markedly higher in acute leukemia. BM of MDS patients demonstrated a moderate telomerase activity. Higher telomerase activity could be found in high-risk group and correlated with poor prognosis.","['Fu, Cheng-Cheng', 'Chen, Zi-Xing']","['Fu CC', 'Chen ZX']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,,2003/02/13 04:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2001 Dec;9(4):303-306.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of expression of bcl-2 and bax gene in predicting the prognosis of acute leukemia patients, and to explore the relationship between bcl-2 and bax expression and drug resistance. Seventy patients with acute leukemia entered this study. Expressions of bcl-2, bax and mdr-1 gene were measured by RT-PCR method and FCM. The result showed that: bcl-2 had been widely detected in specimens of blood or bone marrow from acute leukemia patients, the expression levels were much higher than those in normal control (1.46 vs 0.71, P < 0.05), bax expression levels and bax/bcl-2 ratio in patients had no significant difference with the control. No relationships were found between the expression levels of bcl-2 and bax and AL patients' age, sex, platelet counts, hemoglobin levels, percentage of marrow blasts, FAB classification, and S + G(2)M%. Both Bcl-2 protein expression (34.6% vs 69.2%, P < 0.03) and bax/bcl-2 mRNA ratio (37.1% vs 82.9%, P < 0.01) were associated with response to therapy and CR rate, bax/bcl-2 ratio also influences the overall survival time.

Morever, indirect immuno-fluorescence and FCM were used to demonstrate the location of NF-kappaB-RelA in HL-60/E6 cells and the efficiency of liposome-mediated ODN transfection. The results showed that RelA kept active and located at the nuclei of HL-60/E6 cells, and the efficiency of liposome-mediated ODN transfection was significantly higher than that of null ODN (P < 0.01 in 4, 6 and 12 h). Exposure of HL-60/E6 cells to 5 micro mol/L AS-PS-ODN-RelA led to a maximal 40% decline of bcl-x(L) mRNA levels. No significant change of bcl-x(L) mRNA level occurred in control group.

DESIGN: A retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of IFS reached with CT and confirmed by histopathologic evaluation. SETTING: An academic tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three immunocompromised patients with confirmed IFS and preoperative CT imaging. Controls were 10 patients with acute myelocytic leukemia and CT evidence of sinusitis but no history of IFS. OUTCOME MEASURES: The CT scans were reviewed to identify factors predictive of invasive fungal disease. Parameters evaluated were nasal cavity and sinus soft tissue thickening, the presence of air-fluid levels, bone erosion, extrasinus extension, and unilateral or bilateral nasal cavity and sinus involvement. RESULTS: The CT findings included severe soft tissue edema of the nasal cavity mucosa (turbinates, lateral nasal wall and floor, and septum) in 21 of the 23 patients, sinus mucoperiosteal thickening in 21, bone erosion in 8, orbital invasion in 6, facial soft tissue swelling in 5, and retroantral fat pad thickening in 2. Two patients had air-fluid levels. No patients had intracranial involvement. Unilateral involvement was found in 21 patients, and bilateral involvement in 2. Review of the control group revealed only mild soft tissue edema of the nasal cavity in 2 (P<.001), unilateral involvement in 2 (P<.001), and evidence of bone erosion or extrasinus soft tissue involvement in none. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients do not have classic CT findings of bone erosion or extrasinus extension in the early course of IFS. We found that severe unilateral thickening of the nasal cavity mucosa was the most consistent finding on CT suggestive of underlying IFS, occurring much more frequently in immunocompromised patients with IFS than without IFS. Even though severe nasal cavity soft tissue thickening is much more common in IFS, this is a nonspecific finding that can be seen, to a lesser degree, in all forms of rhinosinusitis. Therefore, the clinician cannot rely solely on CT imaging and must maintain a high index of suspicion when evaluating immunocompromised patients to establish a prompt diagnosis. Early nasal endoscopy with biopsy and initiation of appropriate therapy are necessary to improve prognosis.","['DelGaudio, John M', 'Swain, Ron E Jr', 'Kingdom, Todd T', 'Muller, Susan', 'Hudgins, Patricia A']","['DelGaudio JM', 'Swain RE Jr', 'Kingdom TT', 'Muller S', 'Hudgins PA']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,8603209,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*complications/*diagnostic imaging/immunology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sinusitis/*diagnostic imaging/*etiology/immunology', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/03/06 04:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']","['ooa20018 [pii]', '10.1001/archotol.129.2.236 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2003 Feb;129(2):236-40. doi: 10.1001/archotol.129.2.236.,,,,,,['Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2003 Dec;129(12):1355-6.

Based on the findings from a previous study a population-based case-control study was performed to investigate the association between childhood leukaemia and exposure to supplementary oxygen and other birth-related factors. METHODS: Children born in Sweden and diagnosed with lymphatic leukaemia between 1973 and 1989 (578 cases) were individually matched by gender and date of birth to a randomly selected control. Children with Down's syndrome were excluded. Exposure data were blindly gathered from antenatal, obstetric and other standardized medical records. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Resuscitation with 100% oxygen with a facemask and bag immediately postpartum was significantly associated with an increased risk of childhood lymphatic leukaemia (OR = 2.57, 95% Cl 1.21-6.82). The oxygen-related risk further increased if the manual ventilation lasted for 3 min or more (OR = 3.54, 95% CI 1.16-10.80). Low Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min were associated with a non-significantly increased risk of lymphatic leukaemia. There were no associations between lymphatic leukaemia and supplementary oxygen later in the neonatal period or other birth-related factors. CONCLUSION: Resuscitation with 100% oxygen immediately postpartum is associated with childhood lymphatic leukaemia, but further studies are warranted to confirm the findings.","['Naumburg, E', 'Bellocco, R', 'Cnattingius, S', 'Jonzon, A', 'Ekbom, A']","['Naumburg E', 'Bellocco R', 'Cnattingius S', 'Jonzon A', 'Ekbom A']","[""Department of Women 's and Children's Health, Section for Pediatrics, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. estelle.naumburg@kbh.uu.se""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apgar Score', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oxygen Inhalation Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Resuscitation/adverse effects', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/05/07 05:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08035250216105 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2002;91(12):1328-33. doi: 10.1080/08035250216105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was recently discovered that there are in fact 2 subtypes of CLL: a pre-germinal centre type. Characterised by unmutated genes which code for the variable parts of immunoglobulin chains (IgV), and a post-germinal centre variant, characterised by IgV somatic mutations. This IgV-gene mutational status as well as surface expression of CD38 and characteristic cytogenic abnormalities has recently been shown to be powerful prognostic factors. Furthermore, over the past few years new treatment modalities have been developed including purine analogues, immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies and stem cell transplantation. Therefore it is time to substitute the present policy used for the vast majority of patients (i.e. an expectant approach, if needs be followed by initial treatment with chlorambucil) with an approach based on the patient's individual risk profile.

CONCLUSION: Auto-BMT or auto-PBSCT in CR1 stage of acute leukemia could reduce the relapse rate, when there was no matched bone marrow donor; allo-BMT or allo-PBSCT in chronic stage could result in long-term disease-free survival of patients; Chinese herbal medicine administration in patients of malignant hematopathy might reduce the complications and plays certain role in promoting recovery of hematopoietic function.","['Yu, R X', 'Zhou, Y H', 'Zhu, N X']","['Yu RX', 'Zhou YH', 'Zhu NX']","['Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of TCM, Hangzhou 310006.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Phytotherapy']",2003/02/13 04:00,2003/06/25 05:00,['2003/02/13 04:00'],"['2003/02/13 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2001 Feb;21(2):90-3.,,,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a recent study in patients with solid tumors receiving a high-dose regimen of etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin plus autologous stem cell transplantation, amifostine pretreatment was associated with significant reductions in time to neutrophil and thrombocyte engraftment, fewer days of neutropenic fever, less need for salvage antibiotic therapy. Also, there were significant reductions in grade 3 or 4 stomatitis/diarrhea, and delayed nausea/vomiting. A phase I/II study in patients with refractory/high-risk malignancies indicated that a 140% increase of high-dose melphalan (up to 280 mg/m2) can be safely used with amifostine and autologous stem cell transplantation with manageable mucosal toxicity and a reduced incidence of regimen-related toxicity. Preliminary findings in another phase II study indicate that melphalan 280 mg/m2 can also be safely used with amifostine/stem cell transplantation in the treatment of patients with myeloma.

A cloned cell line RBL-hEIa-2B12 was the strongest responder among the transfected cell clones. The concentrations of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in the human IgE-sensitized cells increased after stimulation with anti-human IgE antibody. Thus, it is suggested that the alpha-chain of human FcepsilonRI is associated with the beta-chain and/or gamma-chain of rat FcepsilonRI, and that they form functional high affinity IgE receptor complexes. The total IgE concentrations of the sera from allergic patients were determined by using the beta-hexosaminidase release assay, where the transfected cells were sensitized with diluted and heat-inactivated (at 56 degrees C for 30 min) serum and stimulated with anti-human IgE antibody. The IgE concentration obtained correlated with those measured by an enzyme immunoassay method. beta-Hexosaminidase release induced by stimulation with 5 times diluted serum was sometimes less than the release induced by the same serum; diluted 25 times or 125 times, suggesting that these serum contained factors that blocked IgE binding to FcepsilonRI or cross-linking by anti-human IgE antibody.

Granule exocytosis-dependent target cell killing is a complex process, involving initial T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent signalling that includes Ca2+ influx and activation of protein kinase C, shape changes that serve to bind the CTL to the target and, finally, exocytosis of lytic granules at the site of contact with the target cell. Although there is reason to propose that multiple steps in the lytic process could involve the actin cytoskeleton of CTLs, few studies have examined this issue, and those that have do not allow the specific step(s) involved to be determined. We have used the potent membrane-permeant actin cytoskeleton-modifying drugs jasplakinolide and latrunculin A to investigate the actin dependence of defined processes that are expected to be important for granule exocytosis-dependent killing. Our results, obtained using TALL-104 human leukaemic CTLs as a model system, are consistent with the idea that a functional actin cytoskeleton is required for TCR/CD3-dependent signalling, for activation of store-dependent Ca2+ influx and for CTL shape changes. When cells were stimulated with solid-phase anti-CD3 antibodies, treatment with either jasplakinolide or latrunculin A abolished granule exocytosis. However, when cells were stimulated in a manner that bypasses TCR/CD3-dependent signalling, granule exocytosis was not significantly altered, suggesting that the actin cytoskeleton does not function as a barrier to exocytosis.","['Lyubchenko, Taras A', 'Wurth, Georjeana A', 'Zweifach, Adam']","['Lyubchenko TA', 'Wurth GA', 'Zweifach A']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, 4200 E. 9th Avenue, Denver, CO 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/drug effects/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/immunology', '*Depsipeptides', 'Exocytosis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*cytology/*immunology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Thiazolidines', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/11 04:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/02/11 04:00'],"['2003/02/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1113/jphysiol.2002.033522 [doi]', '2002.033522 [pii]']",ppublish,J Physiol. 2003 Mar 15;547(Pt 3):835-47. doi: 10.1113/jphysiol.2002.033522.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: U937 cells treated with DT(388)-GMCSF underwent apoptosis as shown by chromatin degradation and cellular and nuclear fragmentation. This apoptosis was prevented by a general caspase inhibitor. DT(388)-GMCSF treatment resulted in activation of the initiator caspases 8 and 9 and effector caspases. A selective caspase 8 inhibitor prevented activation of caspase 9, whereas a selective caspase 9 inhibitor did not prevent activation of caspase 8, indicating that caspase 8 activation is the proximal event in DT(388)-GMCSF-induced apoptosis. Caspase 8 was activated through a Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)-dependent mechanism as demonstrated by inhibition of DT(388)-GMCSF-induced apoptosis on expression of a dominant negative FADD molecule. However, unlike most FADD-dependent apoptosis, this pathway may not involve death receptors, including Fas, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors, because inhibitors of the receptors did not prevent DT(388)-GMCSF-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that targeted toxins induce apoptosis by activating components of the death receptor pathway in a receptor-independent manner.","['Thorburn, Jacqueline', 'Frankel, Arthur E', 'Thorburn, Andrew']","['Thorburn J', 'Frankel AE', 'Thorburn A']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*toxicity', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/toxicity', 'U937 Cells']",2003/02/11 04:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/02/11 04:00'],"['2003/02/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/11 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Feb;9(2):861-5.,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,"['CA09550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90263/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Analysis was performed on a molecular level by reverse transcription-PCR using a new, real-time detection method. We measured two genes simultaneously, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as the target gene and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a reference gene, in blood and bone marrow samples at diagnosis and after follow-up from six patients with neuroblastoma, one patient with ganglioneuroma, and one patient with ganglioneuroblastoma. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the assay was 1:10(6) peripheral WBCs. Four patients with stage IV neuroblastoma and one patient with stage III neuroblastoma were scored positive. The other stage III patient and the other two patients with ganglioneuroma and ganglioneuroblastoma followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively, were scored negative. Control bone marrow aspirates were also negative. The TH assay is more sensitive than immunohistochemical detection, and the results of the TH assay corresponded with the results of MYCN amplification. CONCLUSIONS: The described TH assay is specific, sensitive, and semiquantitative and can be used for the detection of neuroblastoma cell involvement in bone marrow and blood at diagnosis and during therapy.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eighteen patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia were enrolled. The median age was 54.5 years (range, 21-80 years). Patients received a 30-min infusion of fludarabine at 25 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days. i.v. gemcitabine was given as a single infusion at 10 mg/m(2)/min with the duration adjusted following a modified continuous reassessment method.

A pharmacokinetics analysis of imatinib was undertaken in CML patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imatinib plasma concentrations were measured in 19 CML patients treated with imatinib (400 or 600 mg/day). Five patients received a concomitant short-term course of clindamycin (CLI). RESULTS: A positive correlation between AGP and imatinib plasma levels was observed. CLI administration decreased imatinib plasma concentrations, evaluated as area under the curve (AUC) and peak concentrations (C(max)). The effects of a bolus of CLI was studied in three patients on imatinib 23 h after the last imatinib dose. Within 5-10 min in three of three cases, CLI caused a decrease in imatinib plasma concentrations of 2.6-, 2.7-, and 4.7-fold, respectively. In vitro experiments using fresh blasts from CML patients showed that AGP, at concentrations observed in the patients, decreased imatinib intracellular concentrations up to 10 times and blocked imatinib activity. The incubation with CLI restored imatinib intracellular concentrations and biological activity. CONCLUSION: AGP exerts significant effects of the pharmacokinetics, plasma concentrations, and intracellular distribution of imatinib in CML patients; these data indicate that plasma imatinib levels represent unreliable indicators of the cellular concentrations of this molecule.","['Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Zucchetti, Massimo', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Frapolli, Roberta', 'Verga, Magda', 'Bungaro, Silvia', 'Tornaghi, Lucia', 'Rossi, Fabio', 'Pioltelli, Pietro', 'Pogliani, Enrico', 'Alberti, Daniele', 'Corneo, Gianmarco', ""D'Incalci, Maurizio""]","['Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Zucchetti M', 'Russo D', 'Frapolli R', 'Verga M', 'Bungaro S', 'Tornaghi L', 'Rossi F', 'Pioltelli P', 'Pogliani E', 'Alberti D', 'Corneo G', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milano, Italy. carlo.gambacorti@istitutotumori@mi.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Orosomucoid/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding', 'Pyrimidines/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/11 04:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/02/11 04:00'],"['2003/02/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/11 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Feb;9(2):625-32.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that the expression of the p210 BCR-ABL fusion protein leads to a down-regulation of BRCA1 protein, a gene product involved in the maintenance of genome integrity. BRCA1 protein is nearly undetectable in leukemia cells from patients with CML, both during the chronic phase and in blast crisis. Similarly, stable transfection-enforced expression of p210 protein in established hematopoietic cell lines leads to severe BRCA1 depletion. The lack of significant change in BRCA1 mRNA level in cells expressing p210 supports the hypothesis that the regulation of BRCA1 protein level occurs after transcription. It is abolished on exposure of the cells to STI571 and by mutation in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pocket of p210 and thus seems to require the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL. Cell lines expressing high levels of BCR-ABL display an increased rate of sister chromatid exchange and chromosome aberrations after ionizing radiation.

However, it is not clear whether remissions will be durable and whether imatinib mesylate can eliminate the malignant primitive progenitors in which the disease arises. We investigated whether residual BCR/ABL+ hematopoietic progenitors were present in patients who achieved CCRs with imatinib mesylate treatment. CD34+ progenitor cells were selected from bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) and analyzed for the presence of the BCR/ABL fusion gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). CD34+ cells were also plated in committed progenitor (colony-forming cell, or CFC) and primitive progenitor (long-term bone marrow culture-initiating cell, or LTCIC) cultures and resulting colonies analyzed for the presence of BCR/ABL+ cells by FISH. Using these assays, residual BCR/ABL+ progenitors were detected in all patients studied. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated increased levels of BCR/ABL mRNA in CD34+ cells compared with total MNCs. Evaluation of samples collected at different time points demonstrated persistence of BCR/ABL+ progenitors despite continued treatment with imatinib mesylate. Our results indicate that inhibition of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase activity by imatinib mesylate does not eliminate malignant primitive progenitors in CML patients.

Little is known about transcription factors unique to the megakaryocytic lineage that might program divergence from the erythroid pathway. To identify such factors, we used the K562 system in which megakaryocyte lineage commitment is dependent on sustained extracellular regulatory kinase (ERK) activation and is inhibited by stromal cell contact. During megakaryocytic induction in this system, the myeloid transcription factor RUNX1 underwent up-regulation, dependent on ERK signaling and inhibitable by stromal cell contact. Immunostaining of healthy human bone marrow confirmed a strong expression of RUNX1 and its cofactor, core-binding factor beta (CBFbeta), in megakaryocytes and a minimal expression in erythroblasts. In primary human hematopoietic progenitor cultures, RUNX1 and CBFbeta up-regulation preceded megakaryocytic differentiation, and down-regulation of these factors preceded erythroid differentiation. Functional studies showed cooperation among RUNX1, CBFbeta, and GATA-1 in the activation of a megakaryocytic promoter. By contrast, the RUNX1-ETO leukemic fusion protein potently repressed GATA-1-mediated transactivation. These functional interactions correlated with physical interactions observed between GATA-1 and RUNX1 factors. Enforced RUNX1 expression in K562 cells enhanced the induction of the megakaryocytic integrin proteins alphaIIb and alpha2. These results suggest that RUNX1 may participate in the programming of megakaryocytic lineage commitment through functional and physical interactions with GATA transcription factors. By contrast, RUNX1-ETO inhibition of GATA function may constitute a potential mechanism for the blockade of erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation seen in leukemias with t(8;21).","['Elagib, Kamaleldin E', 'Racke, Frederick K', 'Mogass, Michael', 'Khetawat, Rina', 'Delehanty, Lorrie L', 'Goldfarb, Adam N']","['Elagib KE', 'Racke FK', 'Mogass M', 'Khetawat R', 'Delehanty LL', 'Goldfarb AN']","['Department of Pathology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0904, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha2/analysis', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry/*cytology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/physiology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb/analysis', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*physiology']",2003/02/11 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/02/11 04:00'],"['2003/02/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2708 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54056-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 1;101(11):4333-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2708.

We used a recently identified HLA-A2 binding peptide and dendritic cells (DCs) from healthy donors to induce survivin-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vitro. These T cells efficiently lysed target cells pulsed with the cognate peptide. Furthermore, survivin-specific CTLs recognized HLA-A2-matched tumor cell lines and primary malignant cells from patients with leukemia in an antigen-specific and HLA-restricted manner as demonstrated with the use of cold target inhibition assays and blocking antibodies. To validate the immunogenicity of survivin we performed the experiments in an autologous setting and used monocyte-derived DCs as targets. Interestingly, we found that DCs up-regulate survivin expression on stimulation with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). However, these mature DCs were not recognized by survivin-specific CTLs, whereas they lysed autologous mature DCs pulsed with the antigenic peptide or transfected with whole tumor RNA purified from a survivin-expressing cell line. To further analyze the possible use of survivin-specific CTLs in cancer therapies, we induced survivin-specific CTLs using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) and DCs from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The in vitro-generated T cells efficiently recognized autologous malignant CLL cells, whereas they spared autologous-purified nonmalignant B cells or DCs.

We have investigated the effects of GO on 4 human myeloid leukemia lines of different French-American-British (FAB) types (KG-1, THP-1, HL-60, and NB-4), observing 3 different types of response. Exposure to GO (10-1000 ng/mL) induced G2 arrest (up to 80% of the cells) followed by apoptosis (45% of the cells) in HL-60 and NB-4 cells. By contrast, in THP-1 cells we observed a strong G2 arrest (up to 75% of the cells) with little apoptosis. Finally, the KG-1 line was completely resistant to the same concentrations of GO. These different responses did not correlate with the levels of expression of either CD33 or multiple-drug resistance proteins, although the higher cyclosporin A (CsA)-inhibitable efflux activity of KG-1 cells may play a role in the resistance of this line to the drug. We could show that Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation, but not p53 or p21 expression, correlated with G2 arrest, implicating the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated/ataxia-telangiectasia related (ATM/ATR)-Chk1/Chk2 pathway in the cell cycle response to GO. However, apoptosis was associated with caspase 3 activation. Freshly isolated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells showed patterns of response to GO in vitro similar to those observed with the cell lines, including phosphorylation of Chk2 and caspase 3 activation.

Diagnostic of HCL is abnormal expression of the gene that encodes the beta2 integrin CD11c. In order to determine the cause of CD11c gene expression in HCL the CD11c gene promoter was characterized. Transfection of the CD11c promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene indicated that it is sufficient to direct expression in hairy cells. Mutation analysis demonstrated that of predominant importance to the activity of the CD11c promoter is its interaction with the activator protein-1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors. Comparison of nuclear extracts prepared from hairy cells with those prepared from other cell types indicated that hairy cells exhibit abnormal constitutive expression of an AP-1 complex containing JunD. Functional inhibition of AP-1 expressed by hairy cells reduced CD11c promoter activity by 80%. Inhibition of Ras, which represents an upstream activator of AP-1, also significantly inhibited the CD11c promoter.

In this study we show that loss of Jak1 does not affect in vitro transformation by v-abl as defined by the ability to induce cytokine-independent B-cell colony formation or establishment of B-cell lines. However, Jak1-deficient, v-abl-transformed cell lines were more tumorgenic than wild-type cells when transplanted subcutaneously into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice or injected intravenously into nude mice. Jak1 deficiency was associated with a loss in the ability of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)to induce growth arrest and/or apoptosis of v-abl-transformed pre-B cells or tumor growth in SCID mice. Moreover, IFN-gamma mRNA could be detected in growing tumors, and tumor cells explanted from SCID mice had lost the ability to respond to IFN-gamma in 9 of 20 cases, whereas the response to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) remained intact. Importantly, a similar increase in tumorgenicity was observed when IFN-gamma-deficient cells were injected into SCID mice, identifying the tumor cell itself as the main source of IFN-gamma. These findings demonstrate that Jak1, rather than promoting tumorgenesis as previously proposed, is critical in mediating an intrinsic IFN-gamma-dependent tumor surveillance.","['Sexl, Veronika', 'Kovacic, Boris', 'Piekorz, Roland', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Stoiber, Dagmar', 'Hoffmeyer, Angelika', 'Liebminger, Rita', 'Kudlacek, Oliver', 'Weisz, Eva', 'Rothammer, Kristen', 'Ihle, James N']","['Sexl V', 'Kovacic B', 'Piekorz R', 'Moriggl R', 'Stoiber D', 'Hoffmeyer A', 'Liebminger R', 'Kudlacek O', 'Weisz E', 'Rothammer K', 'Ihle JN']","['Department of Pharmacology, Vienna University, Austria. veronika.sexl@univie.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', '*B-Lymphocytes', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Culture Techniques', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Liver/embryology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2003/02/11 04:00,2004/02/05 05:00,['2003/02/11 04:00'],"['2003/02/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2001-11-0142 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50662-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 15;101(12):4937-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2001-11-0142.

Most patients in chronic phase maintain durable responses; however, many in blast crisis fail to respond, or relapse quickly.

Many of these mutations decrease the sensitivity of the Abl kinase to imatinib, thus accounting for resistance to imatinib. The role of other mutations in the emergence of resistance has not been established. Using biochemical and cellular assays, we analyzed the sensitivity of several mutants (Met244Val, Phe311Leu, Phe317Leu, Glu355Gly, Phe359Val, Val379Ile, Leu387Met, and His396Pro/Arg) to imatinib mesylate to better understand their role in mediating resistance.

To better understand the underlying mechanisms as well as to improve on the immunizing efficacy of tumor-derived chaperone complexes, in the present study we examined the effects of CRCL-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) against 12B1, an aggressive bcr-abl+ murine leukemia tumor. We found that DCs incubated with 12B1-derived CRCL had higher expression of CD40 and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) on their cell surface, produced more interleukin-12 (IL-12), and had superior immunostimulatory capacity in a mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) when compared with DCs exposed to unfractionated tumor lysate or purified heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70). Vaccination of mice with 12B1 CRCL-pulsed DCs significantly prolonged their survival, with more than 80% of mice rejecting their tumors following a lethal challenge with live 12B1 compared with those immunized with tumor lysate or HSP70-loaded DCs. The protective immunity generated was tumor specific, long lasting, and both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell dependent. Moreover, immunization with CRCL-loaded DCs resulted in a 75% cure rate in mice with pre-existing 12B1 tumors. Our findings indicate that CRCL has prominent adjuvant effects and is a very effective source of tumor antigen for pulsing DCs. FS-IEF-derived CRCL-pulsed DCs are a promising anticancer vaccine that warrants clinical research and development.","['Zeng, Yi', 'Feng, Hanping', 'Graner, Michael W', 'Katsanis, Emmanuel']","['Zeng Y', 'Feng H', 'Graner MW', 'Katsanis E']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724-5073, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell-Free System/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/transplantation', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/11 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/02/11 04:00'],"['2003/02/11 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/11 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-10-3108 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54078-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 1;101(11):4485-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-10-3108.

Biopsy revealed an immature lymphoid neoplasia with blastic tumor cell morphology and immunoreactivity for CD34, CD79a, CD43, and CD30 as well as slight positivity for TdT and CD20. Bcr-Abl rearrangement was found in interphase tumor cell nuclei by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Furthermore, a translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bone marrow (BM) examination showed regular hematopoiesis including a negative FISH analysis for Bcr-Abl and complete donor chimerism. Nested PCR from peripheral blood (PB), but not conventional PCR, was positive for the b3a2 Bcr-Abl transcript. Neither radiation nor intensive chemotherapy was capable of achieving a tumor remission, and the patient died from progressive disease 6 months later. Postmortem examinations showed a shift of immunophenotype with appearance of myeloperoxidase-positive tumor cells and loss of lymphoid antigens. In addition, there were characteristic cytogenetic findings of multiple Ph chromosomes and a clonal loss of P53 tumor suppressor gene. The latter was already deleted before HSCT.

We describe here a patient who developed ADEM after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). A 48-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia (M2) underwent allogeneic BMT from her HLA-identical sister. Cyclosporin for prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was discontinued from day 15 because of its toxicity. She was relatively well after the resolution of cytomegalovirus reactivation and chronic GVHD. Nine months after BMT, she suddenly developed diplopia, dysarthria, and gait disturbance. Computed tomography of the brain at that time revealed no abnormal findings. Leukemia recurrence was not revealed. The neurological symptoms were very mild without further deterioration. Her clinical course was carefully watched without therapy. Two weeks after onset, fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multifocal abnormal high-signal intensity mainly in the white matter of the cerebrum as well as in the cerebellum and brainstem. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed no abnormal findings. No laboratory findings suggested the presence of infectious agents. The typical MRI findings and an acute monophasic clinical course of this patient led to a diagnosis of ADEM. Twelve weeks after onset, the symptoms had almost resolved. Follow-up MRI showed a substantial improvement of the previous lesions without any new lesions. The symptoms had completely resolved 5 months after onset.

Cytokine research is expected to provide the key to pharmacological manipulation of the immune response and commands the attention of a massive and highly focused biotechnology industry. Based upon the hypothetical secondary and tertiary structures, a superfamily of growth hormone (GH)-like cytokine was identified previously. Here, we report the phylogeny of this superfamily based upon 3D structural data from the Protein Data Bank. First, a retrieving program is designed to abstract their secondary structures and associated atomic coordinates. Helices, digitized as vectors in the Cartesian coordinate system, are collected from the retrieved atomic coordinates at the alpha carbons of the protein backbone. Then the scalar value and vector angle against the reference vector, usually the first vector, are calculated. Furthermore, cluster analysis among various cytokines is performed on their helical scales and helical angles. As a result, GH is close to the cluster formed by ciliary neurotrophic factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF); leptin and erythropoietin are in descending order close to the cluster formed by interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10; the former seven members in the two subgroups above join together and form one group with leukemia inhibitory factor; granulocyte-macrophage CSF, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 are in descending order close to the cluster formed by IL-3 and macrophage CSF; and the latter six members form another group. Finally, it is demonstrated that the phylogeny of GH-like cytokines above is consistent with the evolutionary relationship of their gene organization, gene localization, receptor module composition, and receptor module compatibility.","['Ouyang, Shuguang', 'He, Fuchu']","['Ouyang S', 'He F']","['Department of Genomics and Proteomics, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, 27 Taiping Road, 100850, Beijing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Mol Evol,Journal of molecular evolution,0360051,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cytokines/*chemistry/classification/*genetics', 'Databases, Protein', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Growth Hormone/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Multigene Family', '*Phylogeny', 'Protein Conformation']",2003/02/08 04:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/02/08 04:00'],"['2000/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2002/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00239-002-2385-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Evol. 2003 Feb;56(2):131-6. doi: 10.1007/s00239-002-2385-2.,,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A similar human CD23 construct was also shown to inhibit binding of human IgE to human FcepsilonRI. In both systems, the inhibition was found to be temperature dependent; a 10-fold molar excess of lz-CD23 gave 90-98% inhibition at 4 degrees C, dropping to 20-30% inhibition at 37 degrees C. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of lz-CD23 binding to an IgE-coated sensor chip suggested that the effective concentration of lz-CD23 was lower at the higher temperatures. Analysis of (125)I-IgE binding to CD23(+)-Chinese hamster ovary cells also indicated that increased temperature resulted in a lower percentage of IgE capable of interacting with CD23. In contrast, IgE interacts more effectively with FcepsilonRI(+)-rat basophilic leukemia cells at 37 degrees C compared with 4 degrees C. The results support the concept that the open and closed IgE structures found by crystallography interact differently with the two IgE receptors and suggest that temperature influences the relative percentage of IgE in the respective structural forms. Changes in CD23 oligomerization also plays a role in the decreased binding seen at physiological temperatures.","['Chen, Bing-Hung', 'Kilmon, Michelle A', 'Ma, Check', 'Caven, Timothy H', 'Chan-Li, Yee', 'Shelburne, Anne E', 'Tombes, Robert M', 'Roush, Eric', 'Conrad, Daniel H']","['Chen BH', 'Kilmon MA', 'Ma C', 'Caven TH', 'Chan-Li Y', 'Shelburne AE', 'Tombes RM', 'Roush E', 'Conrad DH']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', '*Binding Sites, Antibody/genetics', 'Binding, Competitive/genetics/immunology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cold Temperature', 'Cricetinae', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Leucine Zippers/genetics/immunology', 'Mast Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', '*Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2003/02/08 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2003/02/08 04:00'],"['2003/02/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.170.4.1839 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Feb 15;170(4):1839-45. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.170.4.1839.,,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",,,,"['AI 07407/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 18697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 44163/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Effects of LIF were, therefore, tested on PRL expression in human prolactinomas and normal and tumorous rat lactotrophs. Normal human pituitary tissue expressed LIF, as well as the LIF receptor (LIFR) signaling subunits, gp130 and LIFR. Although all of 19 prolactinomas tested expressed gp130 and LIFR subunit mRNA and immunoreactive protein, only 3 of 19 prolactinomas expressed LIF mRNA. All of four prolactinomas had no detectable LIF immunoreactivity, in contrast to all other pituitary tumor types that expressed LIF. LIF (5 nM) treatment reduced PRL secretion in primary human prolactinoma cultures by up to 42% (P < 0.0005), an effect that was surprisingly blocked by sulpiride, a D2-like dopamine receptor antagonist. LIF (5 nM) also suppressed PRL levels in primary rat pituitary cultures by 70% (P < 0.005), and in rat MMQ pituitary tumor cells, and this effect was also reversed by sulpiride (200 micro M). D2R agonist suppression of PRL was not additive with LIF. GH levels in these cells were unchanged by LIF, consistent with a selective effect on PRL. Transfection of human long-form D2R into an LIF-resistant MMQ cell clone restored LIF responsiveness. These results show that even though human prolactinomas express gp130 and LIFR, and respond to exogenous LIF, albeit less than normal lactotrophs, they are largely devoid of LIF. These observations indicate a role for LIF in loss of autocrine PRL suppression contributing to unrestrained prolactinomas PRL secretion. Moreover, PRL suppression by LIF may be mediated by gp130 and D2R interaction.","['Ben-Shlomo, Anat', 'Miklovsky, Irina', 'Ren, Song-Guang', 'Yong, William H', 'Heaney, Anthony P', 'Culler, Michael D', 'Melmed, Shlomo']","['Ben-Shlomo A', 'Miklovsky I', 'Ren SG', 'Yong WH', 'Heaney AP', 'Culler MD', 'Melmed S']","['Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, University of California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,IM,"['Adenoma', 'Animals', 'Dopamine Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/*cytology/metabolism', '*Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Prolactin/*metabolism', '*Prolactinoma', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Dopamine D2/genetics', 'Sulpiride/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/08 04:00,2003/03/01 04:00,['2003/02/08 04:00'],"['2003/02/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jc.2002-021281 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2003 Feb;88(2):858-63. doi: 10.1210/jc.2002-021281.,,,"['0 (Dopamine Antagonists)', '0 (Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Dopamine D2)', '7MNE9M8287 (Sulpiride)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)']",,,,['DK 501238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

PAPK shares homology with members of the Ste20/germinal center kinase family of protein kinases and is ubiquitously expressed as two spliced forms, PAPK-A and PAPK-B, that encode for proteins of 418 and 189 amino acids, respectively. The expression of endogenous PAPK-A protein increased after growth factor withdrawal in murine hematopoietic and fibroblast cells. When tested in an in vitro kinase assay, PAPK-A was activated in response to the stress-inducing agent hydrogen peroxide and slightly by fetal calf serum. Biochemical characterization of the PAPK-A-initiated pathway revealed that this novel kinase does not affect MAP kinase activity but can stimulate both c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and ERK6/p38 gamma. The kinase activity of PAPK appears to be required for the activation of ERK6/p38 gamma but not JNK1. When an inducible construct of PAPK-A was expressed in stably transfected NIH3T3 cells, the cells exhibited distinct cytoskeletal changes and became resistant to apoptotic cell death induced by serum withdrawal, effects of PAPK that require its kinase activity. These data suggest that PAPK is a new member of the Ste20/germinal center kinase family that modulates cytoskeletal organization and cell survival.","['Nishigaki, Kazuo', 'Thompson, Delores', 'Yugawa, Takashi', 'Rulli, Karen', 'Hanson, Charlotte', 'Cmarik, Joan', 'Gutkind, J Silvio', 'Teramoto, Hidemi', 'Ruscetti, Sandra']","['Nishigaki K', 'Thompson D', 'Yugawa T', 'Rulli K', 'Hanson C', 'Cmarik J', 'Gutkind JS', 'Teramoto H', 'Ruscetti S']","['Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA. nishigakik@mail.ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polyploidy', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/08 04:00,2003/07/04 05:00,['2003/02/08 04:00'],"['2003/02/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M208601200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)64737-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Apr 11;278(15):13520-30. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M208601200.

The median leukocyte count was 98,250/mm3 (800-529,000), with circulating monocytic cells in all of the patients but one. Bone marrow examination was diagnostic of monocytic leukemia in all patients. At presentation, respiratory rate was 33 (18-50) per minute, and PaO2 on room air was 44.5 mm Hg (30-60). Chest radiographs revealed unilateral alveolar infiltrates (n = 1), bilateral alveolar infiltrates with (n = 3) or without (n = 11) pleural effusion, or diffuse interstitial infiltrates (n = 5). Alveolar hemorrhage was the main bronchoalveolar lavage finding, with monocytic cells retrieved from four patients. Respiratory function deteriorated after cancer chemotherapy initiation in all patients. Of the 15 patients who required mechanical ventilation, 10 died.

A prevailing hypothesis for HTLV-1-mediated cellular transformation is that expression of the viral transactivator, Tax, induces genomic instability. Tax-mediated failure in the cellular repair response is one possible mechanism for loss in genomic integrity. Here we have examined the in vivo repair response of Tax-expressing cells to determine the underlying defects that contribute to loss of genomic integrity. In these studies we examined the effects of de novo Tax-expression in naive ""pre-neoplastic"" REF52 cells. DNA-damage-induced p53 stabilization and concomitant transient stabilization of p21 were clearly evident in Tax-expressing cells. Likewise, the damage-induced apoptotic response of Tax-expressing cells was normal. However, the damage-induced G1 checkpoint was abrogated in either p53+ or p53- cellular backgrounds. Although nucleotide excision repair (NER) of asynchronous Tax-expressing cells was impaired, cell-cycle-independent assessment of NER in the global excision repair assay demonstrated comparable NER activity in Tax-expressing cells, suggesting that the failure of G1 checkpoint contributes to NER deficiency. Interestingly, we observed a dramatic increase in apoptosis and UV sensitivity of Tax-expressing p53-/- cells when compared to Tax-expressing p53+/+ cells. These data demonstrate that Tax-mediated cellular genomic instability arises from attenuation of cell-cycle checkpoint and imply a clonal dependence on p53 status separate from genomic integrity.","['Haoudi, Abdelali', 'Semmes, O John']","['Haoudi A', 'Semmes OJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virginia 23507, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'G1 Phase/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2003/02/08 04:00,2003/02/21 04:00,['2003/02/08 04:00'],"['2003/02/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/21 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202916429 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.2002.1642 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 Jan 20;305(2):229-39. doi: 10.1006/viro.2002.1642.,,,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,"['R01 CA076595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

During the past 20 years, remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of HCL. Since the introduction of interferon-alpha, splenectomy, which was formerly the standard therapy, has been rarely used. With the purine analogues cladribine and pentostatin, response rates are even better than with interferon-alpha and long-lasting remissions can be achieved in most patients. Therefore, these agents are now considered the treatment of choice. Recently, immunotherapeutic approaches which use monoclonal antibodies have increased the number of therapeutic options for HCL and offer promising salvage strategies for patients who relapse or who are refractory to treatment with purine analogues.

Such tumours include Philadelphia-chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) leukaemias, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, and PDGFR-positive leukaemias. Diseases such as primary hypereosinophilia and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans also seem to respond to imatinib. Clinical trials assessing the therapeutic effects of imatinib have shown that the drug is highly effective with few associated side-effects, achieving durable cytogenetic responses in many patients with chronic-phase BCR-ABL-positive leukaemias. However, the emergence of resistance, particularly in patients with acute leukaemias, has prompted intense research, and many are concerned about the future prospects for imatinib. The resistance has been found in patients with acute-phase disease, but may also occur in patients with chronic-phase disease. Two cellular mechanisms for resistance to imatinib have been identified: amplification of BCR-ABL gene and mutations in the catalytic domain of the protein. In addition, suboptimum inhibition of BCR-ABL in vivo could contribute to the selection of resistant cells. We have summarised all currently available data on resistance to imatinib, both published and unpublished, including the mechanisms of resistance identified so far, and their clinical relevance to the different forms of Ph-positive leukaemias is discussed. Furthermore, we discuss strategies to overcome or prevent the development of resistance.","['Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo B', 'Gunby, Rosalind H', 'Piazza, Rocco', 'Galietta, Annamaria', 'Rostagno, Roberta', 'Scapozza, Leonardo']","['Gambacorti-Passerini CB', 'Gunby RH', 'Piazza R', 'Galietta A', 'Rostagno R', 'Scapozza L']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, National Tumour Institute, Milan, Italy. carlo.gambacorti@istitutotumori.mi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Lancet Oncol,The Lancet.

However, how mitochondria accomplish this modulation is not completely understood. Using the human myelogenous leukemia cells ML-1a, respiration-deficient clone 19 derived from ML-1a, and reconstituted clones, we demonstrated the role of respiratory function in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Constitutive activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 was observed in clone 19, but not in ML-1a, and the constitutive activation observed in clone 19 was completely inhibited in reconstituted clones that have functional mitochondria. Additionally, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 observed in ML-1a was greatly reduced in clone 19. These results indicate that mitochondrial respiratory function regulates TNF-induced and constitutive activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1. We investigated the roles of reactive oxygen species in NF-kappaB activation. Generation of superoxide detected by hydroethidine, but not hydrogen peroxide detected by dehydrorhodamine 123, was transiently increased by TNF in both of the cells. The antioxidant, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, reduced TNF-induced, but not the constitutive, NF-kappaB activation. These results indicate that the increase in superoxide generation might be involved in TNF-induced, but not in constitutive, NF-kappaB activation. Our results thus demonstrate the involvement of mitochondrial respiratory function in the activation of reactive oxygen species-dependent and -independent pathways for NF-kappaB activation.","['Higuchi, Masahiro', 'Manna, Sunil K', 'Sasaki, Ryouhei', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Higuchi M', 'Manna SK', 'Sasaki R', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA. mhiguchi@bcm.tmc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,IM,"['2-Methoxyestradiol', 'Cell Respiration/*physiology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Estradiol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Ethidium/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/analysis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/analysis', 'Thiocarbamates/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/08 04:00,2003/07/26 05:00,['2003/02/08 04:00'],"['2003/02/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/152308602762197489 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2002 Dec;4(6):945-55. doi: 10.1089/152308602762197489.,,,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '6I2QW73SR5 (2-Methoxyestradiol)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increase in Pb-aided transduction efficiency at pH 7.7, relative to the value at pH 7.33, ranged from 13% to 49% for three serum lots. For a constant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) vector dilution at pH 7.33, three different serum lots resulted in absolute transduction efficiencies ranging from 29% to 53% using Pb. At the same vector dilution, PS-aided transduction was less effective on an absolute basis than Pb-aided transduction, but the benefit of elevated pH was more pronounced with PS. There was a similar enhancement with PS at elevated pH for a murine stem cell virus (MSCV) vector as for the MMLV vector. The benefit at pH 7.7 for PS-aided transduction was partially due to greater PS stability at elevated pH. Heat inactivating the serum supplement or adding protease inhibitors helped to stabilize PS. This increased the absolute transduction efficiency but decreased the relative benefit of elevated pH to a level similar to that for Pb-aided transduction. Incubating Pb with the vector at pH 7.1 for 10 min, prior to readjusting to pH 7.7 and transducing the cells, was sufficient to abrogate the beneficial effects of transduction at pH 7.7. In contrast, prior exposure of PS with vector at pH 7.1 did not affect subsequent transduction at pH 7.7. These results indicate that pH is an important variable in retroviral transduction and that the relative benefits of Pb or PS on retroviral vector transduction will vary with the pH, polymer addition method, and serum lot.","['Jensen, Tor W', 'Chen, Yong', 'Miller, William M']","['Jensen TW', 'Chen Y', 'Miller WM']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208-3120, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,IM,"['3T3 Cells/chemistry/drug effects/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hexadimethrine Bromide/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Mice', 'Protamines/pharmacology', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",2003/02/08 04:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/02/08 04:00'],"['2003/02/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bp025604g [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2003 Jan-Feb;19(1):216-23. doi: 10.1021/bp025604g.,,,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Protamines)', '4C905MSK4W (Hexadimethrine Bromide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This accumulation is considered to result from the prolonged survival of B-CLL cells arrested in the G0 stage of the cell cycle. However, when cultured in vitro, B-CLL cells die rapidly by apoptosis. It is now clear that a number of factors can delay or postpone the onset of apoptosis, including a number of cytokines and direct contact with different cell types. Although many drugs are now known to cause clinical improvement in B-CLL by causing apoptosis of B-CLL cells, in only a few cases have biological mechanisms been reported to have similar effects. It is now important to understand the role of these mechanisms in the pathogenesis and progression of B-CLL, and to devise strategies to exploit them for therapeutic use.","['Jewell, Andrew P']",['Jewell AP'],"['School of Life Science, Kingston University, Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey KT1 2EE, UK. a.jewell@kingston.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Biomed Sci,British journal of biomedical science,9309208,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology']",2003/02/08 04:00,2003/04/30 05:00,['2003/02/08 04:00'],"['2003/02/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09674845.2002.11783667 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Biomed Sci. 2002;59(4):235-8. doi: 10.1080/09674845.2002.11783667.,,22,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific reference was given to responses of the blood forming system. Results suggest that the daily dose rate of 7.5 cGy d-1 represents a threshold below which the hematopoietic system can retain either partial or full trilineal cell-producing capacity (erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis, and megakaryopoiesis) for extended periods of exposure (>1 yr). Trilineal capacity was fully retained for several years of exposure at the lowest dose-rate tested (0.3 cGy d-1) but was completely lost within several hundred days at the highest dose-rate (26.3 cGy d-1). Retention of hematopoietic capacity under chronic exposure has been demonstrated to be mediated by hematopoietic progenitors with acquired radioresistance and repair functions, altered cytogenetics, and cell-cycle characteristics. Radiological, biological, and temporal parameters responsible for these vital acquisitions by hematopoietic progenitors have been partially characterized. These parameters, along with threshold responses, are described and discussed in relation to potential health risks of the space traveler under chronic stress of low-dose irradiation.","['Seed, T M', 'Fritz, T E', 'Tolle, D V', 'Jackson, W E 3rd']","['Seed TM', 'Fritz TE', 'Tolle DV', 'Jackson WE 3rd']","['Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, Bethesda, MD 20889-5603, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Space Res,Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR),9878935,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', '*Gamma Rays', 'Hematopoiesis/*radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic System/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Leukocytes/radiation effects', 'Longevity/radiation effects', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Radiation Injuries, Experimental/mortality', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Risk Assessment', 'Space Flight', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2003/02/08 04:00,2003/05/07 05:00,['2003/02/08 04:00'],"['2003/02/08 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/08 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0273-1177(02)00159-x [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Space Res. 2002;30(4):945-55. doi: 10.1016/s0273-1177(02)00159-x.,,,,,['Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.'],,,,,,,['NASA: 00028750'],,,,,,

It is also used to correct hereditary angioneurotic edema, manage carcinoma of the breast, promote a positive nitrogen balance following injury or surgery, and stimulate erythropoiesis. Considerable amounts of androgens are consumed by athletes in attempts to improve athletic performance. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Cancer Institute nominated oxymetholone for study based on its extensive illicit pharmaceutical use and the limited evidence that it is a potential human carcinogen. Male and female F344/N rats received oxymetholone (greater than 99% pure) in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage for 16 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years, and male and female B6C3F1 mice received oxymetholone in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage for 16 days or 14 weeks. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female F344/N rats were administered 0, 160, 315, 625, 1,250, or 2,500 mg oxymetholone/kg body weight in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage for 16 days. All male rats survived to the end of the study; one 2,500 mg/kg female died on day 14. The mean body weights of all dosed groups of males were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls, while those of 160 and 315 mg/kg females were significantly greater. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female B6C3F1 mice were administered 0, 320, 630, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 mg/kg in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage for 16 days. All mice survived to the end of the study. The final mean body weights of all dosed groups of females were greater than those of the vehicle controls. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats were administered 0, 80, 160, 315, 625, or 1,250 mg/kg in 0.5% methylcellulose by gavage for 14 weeks. One male rat each in the 625 and 1,250 mg/kg groups died before the end of the study. The mean body weights of males administered 160 mg/kg or greater were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls; in contrast, the mean body weights of all dosed groups of females were significantly greater. A dose-related erythrocytosis, evidenced by increases in erythrocyte counts, total hemoglobin concentrations, and hematocrit values, occurred in dosed groups of rats at week 14. A dose-related hypocholesterolemia occurred at all time points in all dosed groups of rats. Dose- and time-related decreases in 5 -nucleotidase activity occurred in treated rats. There was a transient, treatment-related increase in the activity of alanine aminotransferase in males and females. For male rats administered oxymetholone, cauda epididymis, epididymis, and testis weights and spermatid counts and total spermatid heads per testis were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls, and total spermatid heads per gram testis were significantly greater. Female rats in the 80 mg/kg group spent more time in diestrus and less time in estrus than did the vehicle controls. Kidney weights of males and females and liver and uterus weights of females were increased compared to vehicle controls in rats that received 315 mg/kg or greater; thymus weights of males and females and sartorius muscle and testis weights of males were less. Compared to the vehicle controls, rats that received 160 mg/kg or greater had increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the kidney and mammary gland, and the incidences of hydrometra of the uterus and dysgenesis of the ovary were increased in dosed groups of females. Female rats administered 315 mg/kg or greater had increased incidences of cytoplasmic vacuolization of the adrenal gland and myocardial degeneration of the heart. The severities of these lesions generally increased with increasing dose. 14-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice were administered 0, 160, 320, 630, 1,250, or 2,500 mg/kged 0, 160, 320, 630, 1,250, or 2,500 mg/kg in 0.5&percnt; methylcellulose by gavage for 14 weeks. All mice administered oxymetholone survived until the end of the study. The mean body weights of all dosed groups were similar to those of the vehicle controls. The percentages of motile sperm in 1,250 and 2,500 mg/kg males were significantly less than those of the vehicle controls. The estrous cycle lengths of 630, 1,250, and 2,500 mg/kg females were significantly longer, and females in the 1,250 and 2,500 mg/kg groups spent more time in diestrus and less time in estrus. Kidney and liver weights of males and females were greater and thymus weights of females were less than those of the vehicle controls. All dosed females had hyperplasia of the clitoral gland, metaplasia of the parietal layer epithelium of the Bowman's capsule in the kidney, and cytoplasmic alteration of the submandibular gland; these lesions were not observed in the vehicle control group. The incidences of hypoplasia of the ovary in 320 mg/kg or greater females and of parotid gland atrophy in 1,250 and 2,500 mg/kg females were increased. The results of the 14-week oral gavage studies were generally similar in rats and mice, but rats were much more sensitive to oxymetholone. Because it was not likely that a long-term mouse study would provide significant additional toxicity information, the NTP decided to conduct a 2-year study in rats only. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 90 male F344/N rats were administered 0, 3, 30, or 150 mg/kg in 0.5&percnt; methylcellulose by gavage, and 90 female F344/N rats were administered 0, 3, 30, or 100 mg/kg in 0.5&percnt; methylcellulose by gavage for up to 104 weeks, with 9 or 10 rats per group evaluated at 3, 6, 12, or 18 months. Survival and Body Weights: Survival of all dosed groups was similar to that of the vehicle controls. The mean body weights of the 30 mg/kg male group were generally within 10&percnt; of those of the vehicle controls, but those of the 150 mg/kg group were markedly decreased. Mean body weights of 3 and 30 mg/kg females were generally greater than those of the vehicle controls throughout the study. Determinations of Oxymetholone in Plasma: The concentrations of oxymetholone in plasma of male and female rats receiving 3 mg/kg for 6, 12, or 18 months were generally below the limits of quantification; therefore, all plasma concentrations in the 3 mg/kg group are considered to be estimates (Table 8). The plasma concentrations at 30 mg/kg were approximately one order of magnitude greater than those of the estimates for males and females receiving 3 mg/kg. There were no dose-related differences in plasma concentrations in female rats receiving 30 or 100 mg/kg, but plasma concentrations in males were significantly elevated in the 150 mg/kg group. It was concluded that oxymetholone kinetics was saturated at 30 mg/kg in female but not male rats. Pathology Findings: A wide spectrum of neoplasms and nonneoplastic lesions was seen in rats administered oxymetholone for 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly increased in 100 mg/kg females as were the incidences of basophilic and clear cell foci in 150 mg/kg males and 100 mg/kg females compared to vehicle controls. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly increased in 30 mg/kg females. The incidences of mineralization in the lung of 150 mg/kg males and 30 and 100 mg/kg females were significantly increased. The incidence of keratoacanthoma was increased in 30 mg/kg females, and the combined incidence of squamous cell papilloma, keratoacanthoma, basal cell adenoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or carcinoma of the sweat gland was significantly increased in 100 mg/kg females. The incidences of subcutaneous tissue fibroma and fibroma or fibrosarcoma (combined) were significantly increased in 3 mg/kg males. At 2 years, the incidences of benign pheochromocytoma and benign or malignant pheochromocytoma (combined) of the adrenal gland in 150 mg/kg males and medullary hyperplasia in 100 mg/kg females were significantly increased. The incidences of cytoplasmic vacuolization of adrenal cortical cells were significantly increased in 30 and 150 mg/kg males at 18 months and 2 years and in 100 mg/kg females beginning at 12 months and in 30 mg/kg females at 2 years. The incidences of renal tubule adenoma in 3 and 150 mg/kg males were slightly increased. An extended evaluation of the kidney was conducted, and additional incidences of renal tubule adenoma were observed in step sections in vehicle control and dosed male rats. The combined single- and step-section incidence of renal tubule adenoma was significantly increased in 3 mg/kg males. The incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in 30 and 150 mg/kg males at 2 years and in 100 mg/kg females beginning at 3 months. The severities of nephropathy were significantly increased in dosed groups of males at 2 years and in 100 mg/kg females at 18 months and 2 years. The incidences of mineralization of the kidney were significantly increased in 150 mg/kg males at all time points. The incidences of ovarian dysgenesis were significantly increased in 100 mg/kg females beginning at 3 months and in 30 mg/kg females beginning at 6 months, and severities increased with increasing dose. The incidences of chronic myocardial degeneration (cardiomyopathy) were significantly increased in 100 mg/kg females at 6 months and 2 years and the severity was increased at 2 years. The incidences of lobular hyperplasia were increased in 150 mg/kg males at 18 months and 2 years and in 30 and 100 mg/kg females at all time points. The incidences of seminiferous tubule degeneration were significantly increased in 30 and 150 mg/kg males at 2 years, and the incidences of mineralization of the testis were increased in 150 mg/kg males at 12 months and in 30 mg/kg males at 18 months and at 2 years. Decreased incidences of neoplasms occurred in male and female rats. The incidence of uterine stromal polyp or stromal sarcoma (combined) was significantly decreased in 100 mg/kg females at 2 years. The incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma and fibroadenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly decreased in all dosed groups of females. The incidences of pituitary gland pars distalis adenoma were significantly decreased in 30 and 100 mg/kg females at 2 years. The incidences of testicular interstitial cell adenoma were significantly decreased in 30 and 150 mg/kg males at 18 months and in all dosed groups at 12 months and 2 years. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were significantly decreased in 30 and 150 mg/kg males and 100 mg/kg females at 2 years. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Oxymetholone was not mutagenic in S. typhimurium strain TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535, with or without S9 metabolic activation. It did not induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without S9, and no increase in the frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes was noted in peripheral blood samples from male or female mice treated for 14 weeks with oxymetholone. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this 2-year gavage study, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of oxymetholone in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of subcutaneous tissue fibromas and fibromas or fibrosarcomas (combined) of the skin, variably increased incidences of benign and benign or malignant pheochromocytomas (combined) of the adrenal gland, and increased incidences of renal tubule adenomas. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of oxymetholone in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms. Increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms and skin neoplasms in female rats were also related to oxymetholone administration. Decreased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms and testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males; uterine stromal polyps or stromal sarcomas (combined), mammary gland neoplasms, and pituitary gland pars distalis adenomas in females; and mononuclear cell leukemia in males and females were related to oxymetholone administration. In addition, gavage administration of oxymetholone to male and female F344/N rats resulted in a spectrum of nonneoplastic effects frequently reported with administration of synthetic anabolic androgens.

Several approaches of adenovirus-mediated gene expression have been used to transfect cell lines that are derived from lymphoid tumors and would have otherwise been refractory to other transfection methods. The identification of high-affinity receptor for human adenoviruses serotype 2 and 5, the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR), has raised the question about its relevance for the efficacy of recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene therapy. We review published studies that have analyzed the use of recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing cytotoxic genes for gene therapy in lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. For simplicity, we group all these diseases under the term lymphoproliferative disorders. We analyze the use of recombinant adenovirus-mediated cytotoxicity by assessing the importance of the biochemical and intrinsic signaling pathways interacting with the products of the exogenous viral-mediated expression. Ultimately, we discuss studies that have been finalized to by-pass the limitations of the biodistribution of CAR by modifying or targeting adenovirus to other membrane proteins in cells derived from lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Turturro, F']",['Turturro F'],"['Department of Medicine, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, 1501 Kings Highway, Shreveport, LA 71130-3932, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Adenoviruses, Human/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Enterovirus', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, p53', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*therapy', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",2003/02/07 04:00,2003/03/07 04:00,['2003/02/07 04:00'],"['2003/02/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/07 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.gt.3301842 [doi]', '3301842 [pii]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2003 Jan;10(2):100-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301842.,,49,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To prevent further in vivo growth, modified cells must be irradiated before reinjection into patients. The present study examines the effects of gamma-irradiation on transgene expression in transduced leukemic cells. Human and murine leukemic cells were transfected with retroviral vectors or plasmids carrying beta-galactosidase, GM-CSF or CD80 genes. Fresh leukemic cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were transfected with AdZ.F(pK7) adenoviral vector. gamma-irradiation at various lethal doses enhanced transgene expression in leukemic cell lines and fresh AML cells when the gene of interest was under CMV promoter but not when SV40 promoter was used. Oxidative stress also enhanced transgene expression and both irradiation and oxidative stress effects were inhibited by addition of N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a thiol anti-oxidant, indicating the involvement of reactive oxygen species. Transgene expression was also enhanced in vivo 48 and 120 h after subcutaneous injection of irradiated leukemic cells in syngeneic mice. These results show that a cell vaccine protocol using ex vivo gene transfer of transduced cells might be feasible in acute leukemia even if leukemic cells must be irradiated at lethal doses prior to reinjection to patients.","['Vereecque, R', 'Saudemont, A', 'Wickham, T J', 'Gonzalez, R', 'Hetuin, D', 'Fenaux, P', 'Quesnel, B']","['Vereecque R', 'Saudemont A', 'Wickham TJ', 'Gonzalez R', 'Hetuin D', 'Fenaux P', 'Quesnel B']","['Unite INSERM 524, IRCL, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Adoptive Transfer/*methods', 'Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics', 'Electroporation', 'Gamma Rays/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*radiation effects', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",2003/02/07 04:00,2003/04/09 05:00,['2003/02/07 04:00'],"['2003/02/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/07 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.gt.3301870 [doi]', '3301870 [pii]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2003 Feb;10(3):227-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301870.,,,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a series of 24 follow-up bone marrow (BM) samples in 11 patients (14 clonal markers), we performed real-time PCR assays using one consensus and one clone-specific primer for each marker. The markers analyzed included immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH), T-cell receptor (TCR) and TEL-AML1 rearrangements. RESULTS: We achieved a detection limit of 3.3 x 10(-5) +/- 1.2 x 10(-5) and an accurate quantitation (r = -0.99) limit of 2.0 x 10(-4) +/- 8.8 x 10(-5) blasts. Both inter- and intra-assay reproducibility were exceptional. Additionally, we found comparable results to those of a ""gold standard"" limiting-dilution PCR assay (r = 0.62). CONCLUSIONS: The IgH, TCR and TEL-AML1 markers can be used as targets by real-time PCR under the same cycling profile, allowing quantitation of MRD in more 95% of patients with pre-B ALL.

While sterilization methods sufficient to inactivate the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been shown to markedly alter osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties of bone allografts, the ability of a process for creating demineralized bone matrix to abrogate transmission of a retrovirus has not been investigated, to our knowledge. We hypothesized that a clinically accepted demineralization procedure would alter the nucleic acids of the feline leukemia virus (FeLV, a retrovirus with a structure and replication cycle similar to those of HIV), inactivating the virus in infected bone and rendering it noninfectious. METHODS: Bone infected with FeLV was demineralized with a method employed for creating demineralized bone matrix powder. The effects of demineralization on cellular and (pro)viral nucleic acids were examined with use of gel electrophoresis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. To compare the infectivity of the demineralized bone matrix with that of mineralized bone particles in cell cultures and in animals in which they had been implanted, we measured FeLV p27 antigen and (pro)viral nucleic acids as well as antiviral antibodies. RESULTS: Demineralization of FeLV-infected bone appeared to inactivate the virus by degradation and fragmentation of the DNA, rendering it noninfectious in both in vitro and in vivo test systems. In contrast, untreated mineralized FeLV-infected bone contained intact nucleic acids and readily transmitted the virus in both test systems. CONCLUSIONS: The demineralization process inactivated infectious retrovirus in infected cortical bone, thereby preventing disease transmission.","['Swenson, Cheryl L', 'Arnoczky, Steven P']","['Swenson CL', 'Arnoczky SP']","['Department of Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824, USA. swenson@cvm.msu.edu']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Bone Joint Surg Am,The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

These compounds are also involved in chemoprevention and differentiation therapy of some cancers, with particularly impressive results in the management of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Although highly effective in APL therapy, resistance to retinoic acid (RA) develops rapidly. The causes of this resistance are not completely understood and the following factors have been involved: increased metabolism, increased expression of RA binding proteins, P-glycoprotein expression, and mutations in the ligand binding domain of RARalpha. RA exerts its molecular actions mainly through RAR and RXR nuclear receptors. In addition to the nuclear receptor based mechanism of RA action, covalent binding of RA to cell macromolecules has been reported. RA derives from retinol by oxidation through retinol and retinal dehydrogenases, and several cytochrome p450s (CYPs). RA is thereafter oxidized to several metabolites by a panel of CYPs that differs for the different RA isomers. Phase II metabolism, mainly glucuronidation, is also observed. The role RA metabolism plays in the expression of its biological actions is not completely understood: in several systems, metabolism decreases RA activity, whereas in other systems metabolism appears involved in its action. In addition, several RA metabolites have shown activity and cannot be classified as only catabolites. Therapy of cancer with retinoids is still in its infancy, but the use of new analogues with improved pharmacological properties, along with combination with other drugs, could undoubtedly improve the management of several cancers in the future.","['Marill, Julie', 'Idres, Nadia', 'Capron, Claude C', 'Nguyen, Eric', 'Chabot, Guy G']","['Marill J', 'Idres N', 'Capron CC', 'Nguyen E', 'Chabot GG']","[""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM UMR-496), Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris 10, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Drug Metab,Current drug metabolism,100960533,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/chemistry/*metabolism/*physiology/therapeutic use']",2003/02/07 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2003/02/07 04:00'],"['2003/02/07 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/07 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1389200033336900 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Drug Metab. 2003 Feb;4(1):1-10. doi: 10.2174/1389200033336900.,,97,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The use of SE services was reported in 23% of survivors and 8% of siblings, with the greatest differences observed among survivors who were diagnosed before age 6 years, most notably survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (odds ratio [OR], 18.8; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 15.01-23.49), leukemia (OR, 4.4; 95%CI, 3.75-5.16), and Hodgkin disease (OR, 4.4; 95%CI, 2.64-7.24). It was found that intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) and cranial radiation (CRT), administered alone or in combination, significantly increased the likelihood that a survivor would use SE (IT MTX only: OR, 1.3; 95%CI, 1.09-1.78; CRT only: OR, 7.2; 95%CI, 6.14-8.39; IT MTX and CRT combined: OR, 2.6; 95%CI, 2.30-2.95). A positive dose response was identified between higher doses of CRT and use of SE. It was determined that survivors of leukemia (OR, 1.6; 95%CI, 1.23-2.16), CNS tumors (OR, 2.7; 95%CI, 1.92-3.81), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 1.8; 95%CI, 1.15-2.78), and neuroblastoma (OR, 1.7; 95%CI, 1.14-2.61) were significantly less likely to finish high school compared with siblings; however, when survivors received SE services, risk estimates approximated those of the sibling SE population. CONCLUSIONS: Children who are diagnosed with cancer should be followed closely during and after treatment to identify early signs of learning disabilities and to maximize intervention strategies for the successful completion of scholastic goals.","['Mitby, Pauline A', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Whitton, John A', 'Zevon, Michael A', 'Gibbs, Iris C', 'Tersak, Jean M', 'Meadows, Anna T', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Zeltzer, Lonnie K', 'Mertens, Ann C']","['Mitby PA', 'Robison LL', 'Whitton JA', 'Zevon MA', 'Gibbs IC', 'Tersak JM', 'Meadows AT', 'Stovall M', 'Zeltzer LK', 'Mertens AC']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical School and Cancer Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', '*Education, Special', '*Educational Status', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survivors']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/03/26 05:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11117 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Feb 15;97(4):1115-26. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11117.,['Childhood Cancer Survivor Study Steering Committee'],,,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society'],,['CA 55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors analyzed 512 patients with Ph-positive, early chronic-phase CML who were treated with interferon-based therapies between 1981-1995 for the incidence and durability of complete cytogenetic response, and in relation to long-term prognosis. RESULTS: One hundred forty patients (27%) achieved a complete cytogenetic response. Their 10-year survival rate was 78%. At the time of last follow-up, 44 patients (31%, 9% of the total) were alive, 21 in first and 23 in second durable complete cytogenetic response (median, 127 months; range, 88-191 months); 39 patients had not received any therapy for a median of 50 months (range, 11-139 months). Analysis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 78 patients during complete cytogenetic response showed 46 who had achieved at least 1 complete molecular response. Five of these 78 patients had died by the time of last follow-up, but only 2 had died of disease-specific causes. Recurrence rates were significantly lower and cytogenetic response durations were significantly longer among patients who achieved at least one complete molecular response. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving a complete cytogenetic or molecular response after therapy with interferon-alpha appears to be associated with excellent long-term prognosis. Approximately 10% of patients reportedly can achieve durable complete cytogenetic response, with or without continuation of interferon. This finding emphasizes the potential of long-term event-free survival in CML patients outside the context of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which may be improved with new therapies such as imatinib mesylate.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Faderl, Stefan H', 'Wierda, William G', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes JE', 'Shan J', 'Giles FJ', 'Rios MB', 'Faderl SH', 'Wierda WG', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Verstovsek S', 'Keating MJ', 'Freireich EJ', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/03/26 05:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11223 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Feb 15;97(4):1033-41. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11223.,,,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard amphotericin-based therapies may be ineffective for many patients and the available salvage agents (itraconazole and caspofungin) are reported to possess only moderate activity against resistant infections. Laboratory evidence suggests a synergistic interaction between amphotericin and caspofungin. The authors treated a group of patients with amphotericin-refractory IFIs with the combination of caspofungin and amphotericin (or liposomal amphotericin). METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of patients with amphotericin-resistant IFIs was conducted. Diagnosis was based on clinical, radiographic, and when available, microbiologic data. Response to combination antifungal therapy was graded as either favorable or unfavorable. Favorable responses included improvement of both clinical and radiographic signs of fungal pneumonia. All other responses were graded as unfavorable. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included in this analysis. Twenty-six patients had acute leukemia. Based on recently published criteria, the IFIs were classified as proven in 6 patients, probable in 4 patients, and possible in 20 patients. The median duration and dose of amphotericin monotherapy were 12 days (range, 4-65 days) and 7.8 mg/kg (range, 4.2-66.1 mg/kg), respectively. The median duration of combination therapy was 24 days (range, 3-74 days). Eighteen patients (60%) experienced a favorable antifungal response. Twenty patients with acute leukemia received combination therapy for fungal pneumonias arising during intensive chemotherapy treatments. Favorable responses were observed in 15 of these patients (75%), and antifungal response did not depend on the response of the underlying leukemia. Survival to hospital discharge was significantly better (P < 0.001) in patients having a favorable response. Mild to moderate nephrotoxicity was noted in 50% of patients, necessitating the substitution of liposomal amphotericin. Mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels occurred in 30% of patients. Caspofungin was temporarily withheld from one patient who developed moderate but reversible biochemical hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The antifungal combination of caspofungin and amphotericin can be administered safely to high-risk patients with hematologic malignancies. Although an absolute assessment of efficacy is limited by the design of this study, encouraging outcomes were noted for many patients. The authors plan to evaluate this regimen further in a randomized clinical trial.","['Aliff, Timothy B', 'Maslak, Peter G', 'Jurcic, Joseph G', 'Heaney, Mark L', 'Cathcart, Kathleen N', 'Sepkowitz, Kent A', 'Weiss, Mark A']","['Aliff TB', 'Maslak PG', 'Jurcic JG', 'Heaney ML', 'Cathcart KN', 'Sepkowitz KA', 'Weiss MA']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/*complications/drug therapy', 'Caspofungin', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Echinocandins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lipopeptides', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peptides', '*Peptides, Cyclic', 'Pneumonia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/03/26 05:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11115 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Feb 15;97(4):1025-32. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11115.,,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society'],,['5-T32-CA-09207-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this further, self-reported smoking habits in parents of 3838 children with cancer and 7629 control children included in the United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study (UKCCS) were analysed. Separate analyses were performed for four major groups (leukaemia, lymphoma, central nervous system tumours and other solid tumours) and more detailed diagnostic subgroups by logistic regression. In the four major groups, after adjustment for parental age and deprivation there were nonsignificant trends of increasing risk with number of cigarettes smoked for paternal preconception smoking and nonsignificant trends of decreasing risk for maternal preconception smoking (all P-values for trend >0.05). Among the diagnostic subgroups, a statistically significant increased risk of developing hepatoblastoma was found in children whose mothers smoked preconceptionally (OR=2.68, P=0.02) and strongest (relative to neither parent smoking) for both parents smoking (OR=4.74, P=0.003). This could be a chance result arising from multiple subgroup analysis. Statistically significant negative trends were found for maternal smoking during pregnancy for all diagnoses together (P<0.001) and for most individual groups, but there was evidence of under-reporting of smoking by case mothers. In conclusion, the UKCCS does not provide significant evidence that parental smoking is a risk factor for any of the major groups of childhood cancers.","['Pang, D', 'McNally, R', 'Birch, J M']","['Pang D', 'McNally R', 'Birch JM']","[""Cancer Research UK, Paediatric and Familial Cancer Research Group, Royal Marsden Children's Hospital, Stancliffe, Manchester, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hepatoblastoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Paternal Exposure', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'United Kingdom']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/03/19 04:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600774 [doi]', '6600774 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2003 Feb 10;88(3):373-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600774.,,,,,,['Br J Cancer. 2003 Aug 4;89(3):602; author reply 603.

Here we report that, at the plasma membrane of cells, the adenovirus E4-ORF1 oncoprotein selectively and potently stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), triggering a downstream cascade of events that includes activation of both protein kinase B and p70S6-kinase. This activity of E4-ORF1 could be abrogated by overexpression of its PDZ-protein targets or by disruption of its PDZ domain-binding motif, which was shown to mediate complex formation between E4-ORF1 and PDZ proteins at the plasma membrane of cells. Furthermore, E4-ORF1 mutants unable to activate the PI3K pathway failed to transform cells in culture or to promote tumors in animals, and drugs that block either PI3K or p70S6-kinase inhibited E4-ORF1-induced transformation of cells. From these results, we propose that the transforming and tumorigenic potentials of the adenovirus E4-ORF1 oncoprotein depend on its capacity to activate PI3K through a novel PDZ protein-dependent mechanism of action.","['Frese, Kristopher K', 'Lee, Siu Sylvia', 'Thomas, Darby L', 'Latorre, Isabel J', 'Weiss, Robert S', 'Glaunsinger, Britt A', 'Javier, Ronald T']","['Frese KK', 'Lee SS', 'Thomas DL', 'Latorre IJ', 'Weiss RS', 'Glaunsinger BA', 'Javier RT']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adenovirus E4 Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/etiology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred WF', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/03/01 04:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206151 [doi]', '1206151 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Feb 6;22(5):710-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206151.,,,"['0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, rat)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-79-3 (Foxo1 protein, rat)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,"['T32 CA009197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA58541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI07471/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007471/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA058541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC3501958,,,,,,,['NIHMS411910'],

The fusion partner TEL (ETV6) is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. The nature of the other fusion partner, MN1, has not been investigated in detail until now. We recently described that MN1 activates the transcription activity of the moloney sarcoma virus long terminal repeat, indicating that this protein itself may act as a transcription factor. We show here that MN1 comprises multiple transcription activating domains. A search for a bound DNA sequence revealed that MN1 has affinity for retinoic acid responsive elements. A DR5 retinoic acid responsive element was observed in the LTR. The combination of MN1 and ligand-activated retinoic acid receptor leads to a synergistic induction of expression directed by the LTR. Cotransfection of MN1 with RAC3 or p300, known coactivators of retinoic acid receptors, leads to a further synergistic induction of transcription. In addition, the effect of MN1 can be inhibited by the wild-type adenovirus ElA protein that inhibits p300 function, but not by an E1A mutant lacking the p300-binding site. GAL4-MN1-mediated transcription can be enhanced directly by RAC3 and p300. Taken together, our results indicate that MN1 is a transcription coactivator rather than a sequence-specific transcription factor, and that it may stimulate RAR/RXR-mediated transcription through interaction with p160 and p300.","['van Wely, Karel H M', 'Molijn, Anco C', 'Buijs, Arjan', 'Meester-Smoor, Magda A', 'Aarnoudse, Albert Jan', 'Hellemons, Anita', 'den Besten, Pim', 'Grosveld, Gerard C', 'Zwarthoff, Ellen C']","['van Wely KH', 'Molijn AC', 'Buijs A', 'Meester-Smoor MA', 'Aarnoudse AJ', 'Hellemons A', 'den Besten P', 'Grosveld GC', 'Zwarthoff EC']","['Department of Pathology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/03/01 04:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206124 [doi]', '1206124 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Feb 6;22(5):699-709. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206124.,,,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MN1-TEL fusion protein, human)', '0 (MYBBP1A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RAC3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,['CA72996-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

FL5.12 cells are interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependent for growth, proliferation, and survival. Relative resistance to cell death following IL-3 withdrawal can be conferred by either overexpression of the Bcl-x(L) apoptotic inhibitor, or constitutive activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt. The ability of Bcl-x(L) or a constitutively active myristylated Akt to promote leukemic transformation of FL5.12 cells was compared in athymic nu(+)/nu(+) mice. Bcl-x(L) alone could not promote leukemic transformation, but mice injected with FL5.12 cells overexpressing Bcl-x(L) and a dominant-negative p53 construct developed leukocytosis and blastic infiltration of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver with features of a high-grade lymphoid malignancy. In contrast to the cells injected into these animals, cell lines derived from the mice were able to proliferate in the absence of IL-3, and were found to have constitutively activated Akt. This constitutive activation was associated with a variety of alterations of the signaling pathway regulating Akt activity, including alterations of PTEN mRNA and protein expression. In addition, some of these leukemic clones demonstrated concurrent constitutive upregulation of ERK activity. A constitutively active Akt construct introduced into FL5.12 cells promoted similar clonal expansion in vivo, with emergence of clonal IL-3-independent proliferation. Bcl-x(L) and Akt appeared to function cooperatively in this model, enhancing rapid clonal outgrowth in vivo relative to Akt alone. These results implicate activated Akt and growth-factor independence in leukemogenic transformation, and demonstrate the potential for in vivo analysis of genetic determinants of leukemogenesis.","['Karnauskas, Robyn', 'Niu, Qun', 'Talapatra, Sunit', 'Plas, David R', 'Greene, Marianne E', 'Crispino, John D', 'Rudin, Charles M']","['Karnauskas R', 'Niu Q', 'Talapatra S', 'Plas DR', 'Greene ME', 'Crispino JD', 'Rudin CM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cells/cytology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'Spleen/physiopathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'bcl-X Protein']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/03/01 04:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206159 [doi]', '1206159 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Feb 6;22(5):688-98. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206159.,,,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,['CA81138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The transcription factor Tal1 (Scl), is not expressed in Flk1(-/-) embryos, consistent with a downstream role in the Flk1 pathway. We tested whether expression of Tal1 under the Flk1 promoter was sufficient to rescue the loss of endothelial and hematopoietic cells in Flk1 mutants. Only partial rescue of hematopoiesis and endothelial development was observed in vivo. However, Flk1(-/Tal1) embryonic stem (ES) cells were capable of blast colony formation in vitro at levels equivalent to Flk1(+/-) heterozygotes. Ectopic expression of Tal1 under the Flk1 promoter in Flk1(+/-) mouse embryos or ES cells caused no obvious pathology but increased the number of blast colony forming cells (BL-CFCs) and enhanced their hematopoietic potential. These single-cell-derived BL-CFCs also produced smooth muscle cells in vitro. Increased Tal1 expression inhibited smooth muscle differentiation in this assay, whereas loss of Tal1 promoted smooth muscle formation. We propose a model in which the combinatorial effects of Flk1 and Tal1 act to regulate cell fate choice in early development into hematopoietic, endothelial, and smooth muscle lineages.","['Ema, Masatsugu', 'Faloon, Patrick', 'Zhang, Wen Jie', 'Hirashima, Masanori', 'Reid, Tammy', 'Stanford, William L', 'Orkin, Stuart', 'Choi, Kyunghee', 'Rossant, Janet']","['Ema M', 'Faloon P', 'Zhang WJ', 'Hirashima M', 'Reid T', 'Stanford WL', 'Orkin S', 'Choi K', 'Rossant J']","['Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada M5G 1X5.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cardiovascular System/*embryology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Endothelium/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*metabolism']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/03/01 04:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/01 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.1049803 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 2003 Feb 1;17(3):380-93. doi: 10.1101/gad.1049803.,,,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",,,,,,,PMC195986,,,,,,,,

Topoisomerases I and II are also targets for widely used antitumor agents. We demonstrated previously that in the human leukemia cell line, HL-60, resistance to topoisomerase (topo) II-targeting drugs such as etoposide is associated with site-specific hypophosphorylation of topo II alpha. This effect can be mimicked in sensitive cells treated with the intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM). Here we identify Ser-1106 as a major phosphorylation site in the catalytic domain of topo II alpha. This site lies within the consensus sequence for the acidotrophic kinases, casein kinase I and casein kinase II. Mutation of serine 1106 to alanine (S1106A) abrogates phosphorylation of phosphopeptides that were found to be hypophosphorylated in resistant HL-60 cells or sensitive cells treated with BAPTA-AM. Purified topo II alpha containing a S1106A substitution is 4-fold less active than wild type topo II alpha in decatenating kinetoplast DNA and also exhibits a 2-4-fold decrease in the level of etoposide-stabilized DNA cleavable complex formation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (JN394t2-4) cells expressing S1106A mutant topo II alpha protein are more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of etoposide or amsacrine. These results demonstrate that Ca(2+)-regulated phosphorylation of Ser-1106 in the catalytic domain of topo II alpha modulates the enzymatic activity of this protein and sensitivity to topo II-targeting drugs.","['Chikamori, Kenichi', 'Grabowski, Dale R', 'Kinter, Michael', 'Willard, Belinda B', 'Yadav, Satya', 'Aebersold, Ruedi H', 'Bukowski, Ronald M', 'Hickson, Ian D', 'Andersen, Anni H', 'Ganapathi, Ram', 'Ganapathi, Mahrukh K']","['Chikamori K', 'Grabowski DR', 'Kinter M', 'Willard BB', 'Yadav S', 'Aebersold RH', 'Bukowski RM', 'Hickson ID', 'Andersen AH', 'Ganapathi R', 'Ganapathi MK']","['Experimental Therapeutics Program, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Alanine', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Casein Kinase II', 'Casein Kinases', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Egtazic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/chemistry', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/enzymology', '*Serine', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/07/04 05:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M300837200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)64636-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Apr 11;278(15):12696-702. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M300837200.

We investigated the serum concentrations of sTNF-RII in previously untreated patients with AML at the onset of cytoreductive therapy and in non-febrile chemotherapy-associated neutropenia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 54 eligible patients with AML, serum concentrations of sTNF-RII could be evaluated in 25 non-neutropenic, non-febrile and in 11 neutropenic, non-febrile patients. RESULTS: At baseline, non-neutropenic, non-febrile AML patients showed high median serum sTNF-RII concentrations of 3,804 pg/mL. In neutropenia, there was a non-significant trend (p = 0.18) to lower median sTNF-RII levels of 3,246 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Serum sTNF-RII concentrations in non-febrile AML patients before chemotherapy are in the range of levels reached in uncomplicated febrile episodes in otherwise healthy individuals. This must be taken into account when evaluating the cytokine profile for sepsis in patients with therapy-associated neutropenia. Concentrations are still elevated in neutropenia, suggesting that a normal number of leukocytes is not necessarily required for the activation of the TNF ligand/TNF receptor system in AML.","['Goetz, M', 'Schiel, X', 'Heussel, H', 'Steinmetz, T', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Weiss, M']","['Goetz M', 'Schiel X', 'Heussel H', 'Steinmetz T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Weiss M']","['Medizinische Klinik, Universitat Mainz, Munchen, Germany. mgoetz@mail.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglutethimide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Danazol/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etanercept', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/blood/chemically induced', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*blood', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II', 'Tamoxifen/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Med Res. 2002 Nov 25;7(11):487-90.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '0O54ZQ14I9 (Aminoglutethimide)', 'N29QWW3BUO (Danazol)', 'OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)', 'TAD protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe here the genomic structure of the human NAK gene and analysis of the promoter. The gene spanned 40.5 kb and contained 21 exons with lengths ranging from 39 to 196 bp. Comparison of the phase and position of intron insertions within the human NAK gene with those within IKKalpha, IKKbeta and IKK epsilon indicated that the exon/intron organization of IKK epsilon is more highly conserved than that of IKKalpha or IKKbeta. The transcriptional start site was mapped at a position about 98 bp upstream from the translation start site by means of both an RNase protection assay and a primer extension method. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using full-length human NAK cDNA as a probe showed that the human NAK gene is localized to human chromosome 13q14.2-3, a region in which the loss of heterozygosity is associated with squamous cell carcinoma and leukemia. By using a series of deletion constructs in performing a reporter assay, a minimal 77 bp upstream of the transcriptional initiation site was shown to contribute to the major promoter activity.","['Li, Sheng Fan', 'Fujita, Fumitaka', 'Hirai, Momoki', 'Lu, Rui', 'Niida, Hiroyuki', 'Nakanishi, Makoto']","['Li SF', 'Fujita F', 'Hirai M', 'Lu R', 'Niida H', 'Nakanishi M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, 1 Kawasumi, Mizuho-cho, Mizuho-ku, 467-8601, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"[""5' Flanking Region/genetics"", 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Exons', 'Genes/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Introns', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transfection']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/04/10 05:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111902011794 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(02)01179-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2003 Jan 30;304:57-64. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(02)01179-4.,,,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TBK1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although not all data obtained from murine or other animal models can be extrapolated to the clinic, there are leads that deserve to be pursued. The skin, intestinal tract, and liver are the 3 major target organs of GVHD and share the feature of presenting a barrier to the ""environment"" of the host. There is evidence that the damage inflicted to these organs, the epithelial and endothelial cells in particular, by the conditioning regimen causes a release of various cytokines and a penetration of endotoxin into the systemic circulation. According to these observations, the nonimmunologic aspects of GVHD have been likened to an inflammatory process. If this characterization is valid, blocking these nonspecific inflammatory changes would ameliorate GVHD without interfering with the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reaction. In fact, one study has shown a substantial amelioration of GVHD with a molecule that directly blocks endotoxin. Clinical data also suggest that patients with organ dysfunction early after transplantation that is presumed to be treatment related may benefit from preemptive interventions aimed at controlling GVHD. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that the mechanisms involved in GVHD may differ from organ to organ (for example, Fas/Fas-ligand interactions in the liver versus tumor necrosis factor alpha/receptor interactions in the intestinal tract), and from a therapeutic point of view, the time of onset of clinical GVHD may be important in choosing the appropriate therapy. Thus, combinations of interventions chosen and timed appropriately may be more effective in preventing and managing GVHD than are the standard across-the-board approaches that have been used so far. Such a strategy may also be successful in maintaining a GVL effect and possibly in incorporating direct antileukemic therapy, such as the use of cytotoxic T-cells directed at minor histocompatibility antigens, without increasing the risk of GVHD. The development of nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens and the observations on GVHD kinetics and the progression or eradication of leukemia with that strategy are likely to add new insights into how one can optimally combine various modalities to achieve engraftment, prevent GVHD, and at the same time maintain a GVL effect.","['Deeg, H Joachim']",['Deeg HJ'],"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA. jdeeg@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",2003/02/06 04:00,2003/06/06 05:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982598 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2003 Jan;77(1):15-21. doi: 10.1007/BF02982598.,,75,,,,,"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The levels of Bcl-2 family proteins were detected by Western blotting. Caspase-3 activity was determined by ApoAlert CPP32 colorimetric assay kit. RESULTS: DADAG exhibited potent antiproliferative activity and induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. After treatment with DADAG 8 micrograms.mL-1 for various times, the Bcl-XL protein level decreased in a time-dependent manner, while the Bad protein level was upregulated. The caspase-3 activity increased markedly after treatment with DADAG for 24 h. The apoptotic signals were suppressed by z-VAD.fmk (a general inhibitor of caspases), whereas z-DEVD.fmk, a selective inhibitor of caspase-3, only induced partial reversion of the apoptotic effects.

METHODS: The growth inhibition of NB4 cells was measured by MTT test. Apoptosis was determined morphologically by Giemsa stain and by DNA ladder formation in electrophoresis. Quantitation of apoptosis was determined by percentage of PI stained cells containing subdiploid amount of DNA measured by flow cytometry. Generation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) in NB4 cells was determined by lucigenin dependent chemoluminescent (CL) test. Spectrophotometer was used to measure the level of reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase in the cell. RESULTS: Sodium selenite was shown to inhibit the growth of NB4 cells. Sodium selenite induced apoptosis with dose and time dependency: the ratio of subdiploid cells in control group was 1.3% +/- 0.7%. The 5 mumol.L-1 group was 10.4% +/- 1.4%, 10 mumol.L-1 group was 16% +/- 1%, and the 20 mumol.L-1 group was 27.3% +/- 0.8%. Sodium selenite (> or = 5 mumol.L-1) enhanced the ROS level markedly in NB4 cells (in 20 mumol.L-1 group ROS level was increased by 17 times, compared with control group), accompanied with decrease of reduced intracellular glutathione. These effects were time and dose dependent. N-acytlcysteine as an antioxidant was found to inhibit sodium selenite-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in NB4 cells. CONCLUSION: Sodium selenite can induce apoptosis of NB4 cells and would possibly be used as an agent for the treatment of malignancy. The main mechanism of action might be related to oxidative stress induced by sodium selenite, thereby, leading to apoptosis as shown in NB4 cells.","['Li, Jian', 'Zuo, Lu', 'Shen, Ti', 'Zhang, Zhi-nan']","['Li J', 'Zuo L', 'Shen T', 'Zhang ZN']","['Hematology Department, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Yao Xue Xue Bao,Yao xue xue bao = Acta pharmaceutica Sinica,21710340R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sodium Selenite/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/06 04:00,2004/05/28 05:00,['2003/02/06 04:00'],"['2003/02/06 04:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/06 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Yao Xue Xue Bao. 2002 Sep;37(9):677-81.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old man with lymphoblastic lymphoma received treatment with daunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. He developed postural headache and severe nausea and vomiting after a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed superior sagittal sinus (SSS) thrombosis and meningeal enhancement. An epidural blood patch was performed and enoxaparin was prescribed for 6 months. He has remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PDPH have classic postural headache. The occurrence of additional signs and symptoms should alert the clinician to the presence of intracranial pathology.

Depending on the diagnosis, the location of the neoplasm and the age of the patient, these treatment modalities may be given alone or in combination. All forms of cancer therapy can affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The long-term consequences for reproductive function depend on several aspects. The sex of the patient is important, since ovarian and testicular function differ significantly. Sex hormone production in the female is dependent on the presence of germ cells, whereas this is not the case in the male. The sensitivity of germ cells to cancer therapy also differs between the sexes. Moreover, the sensitivity of both the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and the gonads is highly age dependent. With regard to chemotherapy, the possible damage to the gonads is dependent on the total dose and type of agent given. According to current knowledge, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is not affected by conventional doses of chemotherapy. Radiotherapy has by far the most damaging effect on the reproductive axis, having serious adverse effects on both the hypothalamic-pituitary area as well as on the gonads themselves. The harmful effect of irradiation depends on the total dose of irradiation, the radiation field, as well as the number and size of fractions given. The long-term consequences of recently introduced radiotherapeutic methods such as stereotactic irradiation are not yet known. The present review will focus on the late effects of cancer therapy in children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, brain tumour, Hodgkin's lymphoma or Wilms' tumour, including the adverse effects of bone marrow transplantation.","['Muller, Jorn']",['Muller J'],"['Paediatric Clinics I and II, and Department of Growth and Reproduction, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. jmuller@rh.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Horm Res,Hormone research,0366126,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones/blood', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/blood/*complications/surgery/*therapy', 'Ovary/*drug effects/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Sex Factors', 'Testis/*drug effects/physiology/*radiation effects']",2003/02/05 04:00,2003/11/06 05:00,['2003/02/05 04:00'],"['2003/02/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000067835 [doi]', '67835 [pii]']",ppublish,Horm Res. 2003;59 Suppl 1:12-20. doi: 10.1159/000067835.,,70,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)']",,"['Copyright 2003 S.

Hypopituitarism occurs in patients who receive radiation therapy for pituitary tumours, nasopharyngeal cancer and primary brain tumours, as well as in children who undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, or total body irradiation for a variety of tumours and other diseases. The degree of pituitary hormonal deficit is related to the radiation dose received by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Thus, after lower radiation doses isolated growth hormone deficiency ensues, whilst higher doses may produce hypopituitarism. The timing of onset of the radiation-induced pituitary hormone deficit is also dose-dependent. The main site of radiation damage is the hypothalamus rather than the pituitary, although the latter may be affected directly.","['Darzy, K H', 'Shalet, S M']","['Darzy KH', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Horm Res,Hormone research,0366126,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Height/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Growth Disorders/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Human Growth Hormone/*deficiency/*radiation effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypopituitarism/diagnosis/etiology', 'Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Puberty/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Radiation Injuries/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects/classification']",2003/02/05 04:00,2003/11/06 05:00,['2003/02/05 04:00'],"['2003/02/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000067834 [doi]', '67834 [pii]']",ppublish,Horm Res. 2003;59 Suppl 1:1-11. doi: 10.1159/000067834.,,91,"['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",,"['Copyright 2003 S.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB may be involved in the growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of the carotenoid. To test this hypothesis, human leukemic cells (HL-60) and colon adenocarcinoma cells (LS-174 and WiDr) were treated with beta-carotene, alone or in combination with alpha-tocopherol or N-acetylcysteine, and changes in 1) cell oxidative status, 2) cell growth and apoptosis, 3) DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB and 4) expression of c-myc, a NF-kappaB target gene involved in apoptosis, were evaluated. In HL-60 cells, beta-carotene induced a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (P < 0.001) and in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) content (P < 0.005) at concentrations >/=10 micro mol/L. These effects were always accompanied by a sustained elevation of NF-kappaB and by a significant inhibition (P < 0.002) of cell growth. NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity increased at 3 h and persisted for at least 48 h. Colon adenocarcinoma cells displayed substantial differences in their sensitivity to beta-carotene, exhibiting increased ROS levels and activation of NF-kappaB at concentrations much lower in LS-174 cells (2.5-5.0 micro mol/L) than in WiDr cells (50-100 micro mol/L). In all cell lines studied, alpha-tocopherol and N-acetylcysteine inhibited the effects of beta-carotene on NF-kappaB, cell growth and apoptosis, and normalized the increased expression of c-myc induced by the carotenoid. These data suggest that the redox regulation of NF-kappaB induced by beta-carotene is involved in the growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of the carotenoid in tumor cells.","['Palozza, Paola', 'Serini, Simona', 'Torsello, Angela', 'Di Nicuolo, Fiorella', 'Piccioni, Elisabetta', 'Ubaldi, Vanessa', 'Pioli, Claudio', 'Wolf, Federica I', 'Calviello, Gabriella']","['Palozza P', 'Serini S', 'Torsello A', 'Di Nicuolo F', 'Piccioni E', 'Ubaldi V', 'Pioli C', 'Wolf FI', 'Calviello G']","['Institute of General Pathology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. p.palozza@rm.inicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology', 'Adenocarcinoma/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, myc/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'beta Carotene/metabolism/*physiology']",2003/02/05 04:00,2003/02/26 04:00,['2003/02/05 04:00'],"['2003/02/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jn/133.2.381 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr. 2003 Feb;133(2):381-8. doi: 10.1093/jn/133.2.381.,,,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '01YAE03M7J (beta Carotene)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that the transcription factors E2A and HEB associate with high affinity to these E-boxes. Moreover, we have identified pT alpha as a direct target of E2A-HEB heterodimers in immature thymocytes because they specifically occupy the enhancer in vivo. In these cells, pT alpha mRNA levels are determined by the presence of one or two functional E2A or HEB alleles. Furthermore, E2A/HEB transcriptional activity is repressed by heterodimerization with SCL, a transcription factor that is turned off in differentiating thymocytes exactly at a stage when pT alpha is up-regulated. Taken together, our observations suggest that the dosage of E2A, HEB, and SCL determines pT alpha gene expression in immature T cells.","['Tremblay, Mathieu', 'Herblot, Sabine', 'Lecuyer, Eric', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Tremblay M', 'Herblot S', 'Lecuyer E', 'Hoang T']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H2W 1R7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2003/02/05 04:00,2003/07/04 05:00,['2003/02/05 04:00'],"['2003/02/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M209870200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)64634-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Apr 11;278(15):12680-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M209870200.

However, LIF significantly reduced development to the blastocyst stage when added for culture of 4-cell stage embryos (P<0.05). In contrast, a positive effect was found for progression of blastocyst development. In vitro blastocyst hatching rates were significantly improved in the presence of LIF (P<0.02). Number of total cells and of inner cell mass (ICM) cells were increased in LIF-treated blastocysts. In vitro survival of frozen-thawed blastocysts was not improved by adding LIF to morula stage embryos before cryopreservation.

In these cells, two important enzymes in deoxynucleoside triphosphate production, ribonucleotide reductase and thymidine kinase (TK), both cell-cycle regulated, are indeed very weakly expressed. This study investigated the regulation of dCK activity in response to UV-C light, a condition which causes DNA lesions and DNA repair synthesis. We observed that activity of dCK in B-CLL cells was upregulated up to 3-fold, 30 min after irradiation with 30 J/m(2) UV-C, whereas TK activity was unchanged. Activation of dCK by UV-C light was caused neither by a change in concentration of a low molecular weight metabolite nor by an increase in the amount of dCK protein. Activation of dCK by UV-C was mimicked by H(2)O(2), markedly counteracted by N-acetylcysteine, a general antioxidant, and completely abolished by the growth factor receptor inhibitor suramin. Taken together, these results indicate that dCK activity is upregulated by UV-C light through a postranslational modification that may be initiated at the cell surface through oxidative mechanisms. Suramin also suppressed the increase in DNA repair synthesis elicited by UV-C irradiation, suggesting that upregulation of dCK activity could contribute to the normal completion of DNA repair synthesis elicited by UV light.","['Van Den Neste, Eric', 'Smal, Caroline', 'Cardoen, Sabine', 'Delacauw, Anne', 'Frankard, Joelle', 'Ferrant, Augustin', 'Van den Berghe, Georges', 'Bontemps, Francoise']","['Van Den Neste E', 'Smal C', 'Cardoen S', 'Delacauw A', 'Frankard J', 'Ferrant A', 'Van den Berghe G', 'Bontemps F']","['Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Christian de Duve Institute of Cellular Pathology, Avenue Hippocrate 75, UCL-ICP 7539, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium. vandenneste@sang.ucl.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/*radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Suramin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",2003/02/05 04:00,2003/03/11 04:00,['2003/02/05 04:00'],"['2003/02/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/11 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295202015599 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01559-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Feb 15;65(4):573-80. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01559-9.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effects of sodium salicylate (NaSal) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the association of these effects with apoptotic tumor cell death. We demonstrate that NaSal mediates ROS production followed by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi(m)), release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. However, expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) prevents ROS production and subsequent loss of deltapsi(m), thereby inhibiting apoptotic cell death. The presence of ROS scavengers and an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase or expression of a dominant negative form of Rac1 blocks ROS production, deltapsi(m) collapse, and the subsequent activation of caspases. These observations indicate that NaSal mediates ROS production critical in the triggering of apoptotic tumor cell death through a Rac1-NADPH oxidase-dependent pathway. Our data collectively imply that NaSal-induced ROS are key mediators of deltapsi(m) collapse, which leads to the release of cytochrome c followed by caspase activation, culminating in tumor apoptosis.","['Chung, Young Mee', 'Bae, Yun Soo', 'Lee, Soo Young']","['Chung YM', 'Bae YS', 'Lee SY']","['Division of Molecular Life Sciences and Center for Cell Signaling Research, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*ultrastructure', 'NADPH Oxidases/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sodium Salicylate/*pharmacology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/pharmacology']",2003/02/05 04:00,2003/08/26 05:00,['2003/02/05 04:00'],"['2003/02/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0891584902013011 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(02)01301-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2003 Feb 15;34(4):434-42. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(02)01301-1.,,,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'WIQ1H85SYP (Sodium Salicylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intraperitoneal administration of ghrelin twice a day (6 nmol/mice/day) for 6 days suppressed weight loss in SEKI-inoculated mice and increased the rate of weight gain in vehicle-treated nude mice. Ghrelin administration also increased food intake in both SEKI- and vehicle-treated mice. Both the weight of white adipose tissue and the plasma leptin concentration were reduced in tumor-inoculated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice; these factors increased following ghrelin administration. The levels of both ghrelin peptide and mRNA in the stomach were upregulated in tumor-inoculated mice. The anabolic effect of ghrelin efficiently reverses the cachexia in mice bearing SEKI human melanoma. Ghrelin therefore may have a therapeutic ability to ameliorate cancer cachexia.","['Hanada, Takeshi', 'Toshinai, Koji', 'Kajimura, Naoko', 'Nara-Ashizawa, Noriko', 'Tsukada, Toshihiko', 'Hayashi, Yujiro', 'Osuye, Kazuhiro', 'Kangawa, Kenji', 'Matsukura, Shigeru', 'Nakazato, Masamitsu']","['Hanada T', 'Toshinai K', 'Kajimura N', 'Nara-Ashizawa N', 'Tsukada T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Osuye K', 'Kangawa K', 'Matsukura S', 'Nakazato M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Medical College, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', '*Cachexia', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Gastric Mucosa/metabolism', 'Ghrelin', 'Growth Inhibitors/blood', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leptin/blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/blood', 'Melanoma/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms/physiopathology', 'Peptide Hormones/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/05 04:00,2003/04/16 05:00,['2003/02/05 04:00'],"['2003/02/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X02030280 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)03028-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Feb 7;301(2):275-9. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(02)03028-0.,,,"['0 (Ghrelin)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Peptide Hormones)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HIPK-2 has been found to interact with the SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and can be covalently modified by SUMO-1. It has also been shown to interact with and phosphorylate p53 and to form punctate speckles in the nucleus of which a proportion colocalize with PML nuclear bodies (ND10). We have previously shown that the hamster equivalent of HIPK-2 (named PKM) interacts with the interferon-induced antiviral GTPase Mx1 and associates with ND10 in interferon-treated cells. Given the connections between the interferon response pathway, constituents of ND10, and SUMO-1-conjugated proteins, we have studied the effects of exogenously expressed PKM on endogenous ND10 proteins. We found that PKM induces structural changes in ND10 that can be attributed both to its kinase activity and to the presence of a functional SUMO-1 interaction motif in the C-terminal half of the protein. The changes in the localization of PML, Sp100, and hDaxx induced by exogenous PKM or fragments thereof correlate with changes in the posttranslationally modified species of PML. We propose that PKM is able to modify ND10 structure by inducing changes in the posttranslational modification of PML and by interacting with SUMO-1 modification pathways.","['Engelhardt, Othmar G', 'Boutell, Chris', 'Orr, Anne', 'Ullrich, Evelyn', 'Haller, Otto', 'Everett, Roger D']","['Engelhardt OG', 'Boutell C', 'Orr A', 'Ullrich E', 'Haller O', 'Everett RD']","['Abteilung Virologie, Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Universitat Freiburg, Hermann-Herder-Strasse 11, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*enzymology/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Eukaryotic Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2003/02/05 04:00,2003/03/13 04:00,['2003/02/05 04:00'],"['2003/02/05 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/05 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0014482702000253 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-4827(02)00025-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2003 Feb 1;283(1):36-50. doi: 10.1016/s0014-4827(02)00025-3.,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (HIPK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Science (USA)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays for RNA encoded by the BM5def and BM5eco components of LP-BM5. The assays were used to standardize better the input doses of LP-BM5 viruses across viral preparations and to quantify BM5def and BM5eco gag RNA levels in spleen and blood cells from MAIDS-susceptible and -insusceptible infected mice. Spleens of MAIDS-susceptible infected mice harbored approximately similar levels of BM5def gag RNA as infected spleens of mice that are insusceptible to MAIDS due to lack of CD40. In contrast, the same infected spleens of CD40-deficient mice contained substantially higher (up to 10-fold) levels of BM5eco gag RNA compared with susceptible controls. Similar to that seen in spleen, infected blood of CD40-deficient mice contained similar levels of BM5def gag as susceptible strains, but increased levels (up to threefold) of BM5eco gag RNA.

CML responds to immune-mediated therapies, including stem cell transplantation, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), and interferon alfa.

Recently, clinical observations supported by laboratory data have demonstrated the presence of CML-specific T cells in patients.

Without effective treatment, patients eventually progress to a blastic phase (BP), frequently through an intermediate or accelerated phase (AP). Because the definition of AP varies among studies, comparisons of outcome and prognosis are difficult. The management of patients in these advanced phases of the disease has been much less satisfactory than that of patients in CP. Treatment with interferon-alfa (IFNalpha)-based therapy is ineffective for most patients in AP and for all of those in BP. Imatinib mesylate has demonstrated significant activity AP and BP disease, although the results are inferior compared to treatment in CP. In AP, 82% of patients achieve a hematologic response, with 24% achieving a major cytogenetic remission (MCR). Early MCR (within 3 months of diagnosis) provides a survival advantage over patients who do not achieve this response or achieve it later. In BP, 21% of previously treated patients and 36% of previously untreated patients have responded to imatinib, and up to 17% of patients may achieve a major cytogenetic response. However, responses are frequently short-lived. Several agents are being investigated for treatment of advanced-phase CML, including decitabine (DAC), homoharringtonine (HHT), troxacitabine, clofarabine, farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitors (FTI), and others. Many have also proven to be synergistic with imatinib in vitro and combination studies are ongoing.

Currently, the only unequivocally curative treatment for CML is allogeneic stem cell transplant. Unfortunately, a large proportion of CML patients are ineligible for such treatment and alternative forms of therapy must be employed. Conventional chemotherapy makes use of compounds, such as hydroxyurea, that are cytotoxic for actively dividing cells. Although effective, these agents are not selective for the leukemic clone and this is the cause of undesirable side effects. Moreover, as the disease progresses patients frequently become refractory to chemotherapy. In recent years, knowledge of the molecular pathology of CML has allowed the development of drugs that selectively target the malignant cells: imatinib mesylate is the most prominent example. These agents are selective because they target molecular determinants that are exclusively deregulated in the leukemic cells. In this review we consider some of the novel developments in this field. Particular emphasis is given to chemical agents that target the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. The latter affords an excellent opportunity for therapy since CML, in contrast to many other human malignancies, is likely caused by the activity of a single oncoprotein. Furthermore, it is believed that Bcr-Abl continues to play a central role throughout the course of the disease.","['Barnes, David J', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Barnes DJ', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Catalytic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2003/02/04 04:00,2003/10/09 05:00,['2003/02/04 04:00'],"['2003/02/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/shem.2003.50002 [doi]', 'S0037196302000045 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Jan;40(1):34-49. doi: 10.1053/shem.2003.50002.,,91,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,"['Copyright 2003, Elsevier Science (USA).

Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to gallium arsenide particles (greater than 98% pure; mass median aerodynamic diameter = 0.8 to 1.0 &mgr;m) by inhalation for 16 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, and the frequency of micronuclei was determined in the peripheral blood of mice exposed to gallium arsenide for 14 weeks. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were exposed to particulate aerosols of gallium arsenide with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of approximately 1 &mgr;m at concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 37, 75, or 150 mg/m(3) by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 16 days. All rats survived to the end of the study. The final mean body weights of all exposed groups of males and females were similar to those of the chamber controls. Compared to chamber controls, the liver and lung weights of males exposed to 1 mg/m(3) or greater and females exposed to 10 mg/m(3) or greater were increased; the thymus weights of all exposed groups of males were decreased. Gallium arsenide particles were visible in the alveolar spaces and, to a lesser extent, within alveolar macrophages of exposed rats. Moderate proteinosis (surfactant mixed with small amounts of fibrin) and minimal histiocytic cellular infiltrate were observed in the alveoli of exposed males and females. Epithelial hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of the larynx were observed primarily in males exposed to 150 mg/m(3). 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and four or five female mice were exposed to particulate aerosols of gallium arsenide with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of approximately 1 &mgr;m at concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 37, 75, or 150 mg/m(3) by inhalation, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 16 days. The final mean body weights were similar among exposed and chamber control groups. Compared to chamber controls, the lung weights of males and females exposed to 10 mg/m(3) or greater were increased. Gallium ar senide particles were visible in alveolar spaces and macrophages in some mice exposed to 150 mg/m(3). Moderate proteinosis, mild epithelial hyperplasia, and histiocytic infiltration of the lung were observed in males and females exposed to 10 mg/m(3) or greater. In the larynx, mild squamous metaplasia was seen in mice exposed to 10 mg/m(3) or greater, and mild chronic inflammation occurred in mice exposed to 75 or 150 mg/m(3). 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed by inhalation to gallium arsenide particulate at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 37, or 75 mg/m(3), 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 14 weeks. All rats survived until the end of the study. The final mean body weight and body weight gain of males exposed to 75 mg/m(3) were significantly less than those of the chamber controls. Hematology and clinical chemistry results indicated that exposure to gallium arsenide induced a microcytic responsive anemia with an erythrocytosis and increased zinc protoporphyrin/heme ratios in exposed groups of rats. There were also increases in platelet and neutrophil counts, a transient decrease in leukocyte counts, and increases in the serum activities of alanine aminotransferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase. These changes were of greater magnitude in male rats. The lung weights of all exposed groups of rats were increased, while testis, cauda epididymis, and epididymis weights of males exposed to 37 or 75 mg/m(3) were generally less than those of chamber controls. Total spermatid heads and spermatid counts were significantly decreased in males exposed to 75 mg/m(3), while epididymal spermatozoa motility was significantly reduced in males ees exposed to 10 mg/m(3) or greater. Gallium arsenide particles were visible in alveolar spaces and macrophages in the lungs of exposed rats. Minimal to marked proteinosis and minimal histiocytic cellular infiltration of the alveoli were observed in all exposed groups; minimal squamous metaplasia in the larynx and lymphoid cell hyperplasia of the mediastinal lymph node were observed in some males and females exposed to 37 or 75 mg/m(3). Exposure-related increases in the incidences of plasma cell hyperplasia of the mandibular lymph node, testicular atrophy, epididymal hypospermia, bone marrow hyperplasia (males), and hemosiderosis in the liver were observed in the 37 and 75 mg/m(3) groups. 14-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed by inhalation to gallium arsenide particulate at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 37, or 75 mg/m(3), 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 14 weeks. One female mouse exposed to 75 mg/m(3) died before the end of the study. Final mean body weights and body weight gains of males in the 75 mg/m(3) group were signifi cantly less than the chamber controls. Hematology and clinical chemistry results indicated that exposure to gallium arsenide affected the circulating erythroid mass and induced a microcytic responsive anemia with an erythrocytosis and increased zinc protoporphyrin/heme ratios in male and female mice. There were also increases in platelet and neutrophil counts. Compared to the chamber controls, the lung weights of males exposed to 1 mg/m(3) or greater and females exposed to 10 mg/m(3) or greater were increased. Testis, cauda epididymis, and epididymis weights, total spermatid heads, spermatid counts, and concentration and motility of epididymal spermatozoa were generally decreased. Gallium arsenide particles were visible in alveolar spaces and macrophages in the lungs of mice exposed to 1 mg/m(3) or greater. Mild to marked proteinosis, histiocytic infiltration, and epithelial hyperplasia were observed in the alveoli of males and females exposed to 1 mg/m(3) or greater. Minimal to mild suppurative inflammation and granuloma in the lung and squamous metaplasia in the larynx were present in males and females exposed to 10 mg/m(3) or greater. Min imal hyperplasia was observed in the tracheobronchial lymph node of males exposed to 10 mg/m(3) or greater and females exposed to 37 or 75 mg/m(3). Exposure- related increases in the incidences of testicular atrophy, epididymal hypospermia, hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen, and hemosiderosis of the liver and spleen were observed in groups of male and female mice exposed to 10 mg/m(3) or greater. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed by inhalation to gallium arsenide particulate at concentrations of 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/m(3), 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 105 weeks. Survival and Body Weights: Survival of exposed male and female rats was similar to the chamber controls. Mean body weights of males exposed to 1.0 mg/m(3) were generally less than those of the chamber controls throughout the study; females exposed to 1.0 mg/m(3) had slightly lower mean body weights during the second year. Pathology Findings: Compared to the chamber controls, the incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms were significantly increased in females exposed to 1.0 mg/m(3) and exceeded the historical control ranges. Exposure-related nonneoplastic lesions in the lungs of male and female rats included atypical hyperplasia, alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, chronic active inflammation, proteinosis, and alveolar epithelial metaplasia. In the larynx of males exposed to 1.0 mg/m(3), the incidences of hyperplasia, chronic active inflammation, squamous metaplasia, and hyperplasia of the epiglottis were significantly increased. The incidences of benign pheochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla occurred with a positive trend in female rats, and the incidence was significantly increased in the 1.0 mg/m(3) group and exceeded the historical control range. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was significantly increased in females exposed to 1.0 mg/m(3) and exceeded the historical control range. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed by inhalation to gallium arsenide particulate at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/m(3), 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 105 (males) or 106 (females) weeks. Survival and Body Weights: Survival of male and female mice was similar to the chamber controls. Mean body weights of exposed groups of males were similar to those of the chamber controls throughout the study; mean body weights of exposed groups of females were greater than those of the chamber controls from week 13 until the end of the study. Pathology Findings: Exposure-related nonneoplastic lesions in the lung of all groups of exposed mice included suppurative focal inflammation, chronic focal inflammation, histiocyte cellular infiltration, alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, and proteinosis. Increased incidences of minimal lymphoid hyperplasia of the tracheobronchial lymph node occurred in mice exposed to 1.0 mg/m(3) and in 0.5 mg/m(3)mg/m(3) males. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Gallium arsenide was not mutagenic in several strains of Salmonella typhimurium, with or without S9 metabolic activation enzymes, and no increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was observed in peripheral blood of male or female mice exposed to gallium arsenide by inhalation for 14 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of gallium arsenide in male F344/N rats exposed to 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/m(3). There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms in the lung. Increased incidences of benign neoplasms of the adrenal medulla and increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were also considered to be exposure related. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in male or female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/m(3). Exposure to gallium arsenide caused a spectrum of nonneoplastic lesions in the lung of rats and mice, the larynx of male rats and hyperplasia of the tracheobronchial lymph node in mice.

Extracts from the roots, bark, and/or dried leaves of buckthorn, senna, cascara, aloe, frangula, and rhubarb have been used as laxatives since ancient times and currently are widely used in the preparation of herbal laxative preparations. Anthraquinone glycosides are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but are cleaved by gut bacteria to produce aglycones (such as emodin) that are more readily absorbed and are responsible for the purgative properties of these preparations. There is extensive exposure to emodin and other anthraquinones resulting from the use of herb-based stimulant laxatives. Reports that 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, a commonly used laxative ingredient, caused tumors in the gastrointestinal tract of rats raised the possibility of an association between colorectal cancer and the use of laxatives containing anthraquinones. Because emodin is a hydroxyanthraquinone structurally similar to 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, is present in herbal laxatives, and was reported to be mutagenic in bacteria, it was considered a potential carcinogen and was selected for in-depth evaluation. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to emodin (at least 94% pure) in feed for 16 days, 14 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, rat and mouse bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of five male and five female rats were fed diets containing 0, 600, 2,000, 5,500, 17,000, or 50,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 50, 170, 480, 1,400, or 3,700 mg emodin/kg body weight to males and 50, 160, 460, 1,250, or 2,000 mg/kg to females) for 15 (males) or 16 (females) days. Three female rats died before the end of the study. Mean body weights of males and females exposed to 5,500 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by males and females receiving 17,000 or 50,000 ppm was decreased throughout the study. Macroscopic lesions were present in the kidney of rats exposed to 17,000 or 50,000 ppm. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were fed diets containing 0, 600, 2,000, 5,500, 17,000, or 50,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 120, 400, 1,200, or 3,800 mg/kg to males and 140, 530, 1,600, or 5,000 mg/kg to females; 50,000 ppm equivalents were not calculated due to high mortality) for 15 (males) or 16 (females) days. All mice exposed to 50,000 ppm died before the end of the study. Mice in the 17,000 ppm groups lost weight during the study. Feed consumption by 5,500 ppm females was greater than that by the controls throughout the study. Macroscopic lesions were present in the gallbladder and kidney of mice exposed to 17,000 ppm. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 312.5, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 20, 40, 80, 170, or 300 mg/kg to males and females) for 14 weeks. Mean body weights of males exposed to 2,500 ppm or greater and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. During the first week of the study, feed consumption by males exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm and females exposed to 5,000 ppm was less than that by the controls. Feed consumption by these groups was similar to that by the controls for the remainder of the study. In rats exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm, there were increases in platelet counts in males and females and segmented neutrophil counts in females. Total serum protein and albumin concentrations were decreased in females exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm. Relative kidney weights of rats exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and relative lung weights of rats exposed to 625 ppm or greater were significantly increased compared to the control groups. Relative liver weights were incree increased in females exposed to 625 ppm or greater. The estrous cycle length wassignificantly increased in females exposed to 1,250 or 5,000 ppm. All male rats exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater and all exposed female rats had pigment in the renal tubules; and the severity of pigmentation generally increased with increasing exposure concentration. The incidences of hyaline droplets in the cortical epithelial cytoplasm were increased in all groups of exposed males and in females exposed to 312.5, 625, or 1,250 ppm. 14-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312.5, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approxi mately 50, 100, 190, 400, or 800 mg/kg to males and 60, 130, 240, 500, or 1,100 mg/kg to females) for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of males exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed groups was generally similar to that by the controls. Relative kidney weights of male mice exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater, relative lung weights of males exposed to 625 ppm or greater, and relative liver weights of female mice exposed to 625 ppm or greater were increased. The incidences and severities of nephropathy were increased in males and females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater. The incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm or greater and in females exposed to 1,250 ppm or greater. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 65 male and 65 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 280, 830, or 2,500 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 110, 320, or 1,000 mg/kg to males and 120, 370, or 1,100 mg/kg to females) for 105 weeks. Ten male and ten female rats from each group were necropsied at 6 months. Blood samples from five male and five female rats in each group were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months for plasma emodin concentrations; these rats were necropsied at 12 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption: Survival of exposed males and females was similar to that of the controls. The mean body weights of rats in the 2,500 ppm groups were less than those of the controls beginning at week 2 of the study. Feed consumption by exposed groups was similar to that by the controls throughout the study. Pathology Findings: Three Zymbal's gland carcinomas were observed in female rats exposed to 2,500 ppm. This incidence exceeded the range observed for current historical controls and was considered an equivocal finding. At the 6- and 12-month interim evaluations and at 2 years, emodin-related increases in the incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets occurred in all exposed groups. The incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males at 2 years. There were negative trends in the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats, and the incidences in the 2,500 ppm groups were significantly decreased. In females exposed to 2,500 ppm, the incidence was below the historical control range; the incidence in males exposed to 2,500 ppm was at the lower end of the historical control range. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male mice were fed diets containing 0, 160, 312, or 625 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 15, 35, or 70 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Groups of 60 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 30, 60, or 120 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Ten male and ten female mice from each group were necropsied at 12 months. Survival, Body Weights, and Feed Consumption Survival and mean body weights of exposed males and females were similar to those of the controls. No differences in feed consumption were noted between exposed and control groups. Pathology Findings: Low incidences of renal tubule adenoma and carcinoma occurred in exposed male mice; these incidences included one carcinoma each in the 312 and 625 ppm groups. Renal tubule neoplasms are rare in male mice, and their presence in these groups suggested a possible association with emodin exposure. At the 12-month interim evaluation, the severity of nephropathy was slightly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm. Also at 12 months, the severity of nephropathy increased from minimal in the lower exposure groups to mild in females exposed to 1,250 ppm; the incidence in this group was significantly increased compared to the control group. At 2 years, the severities of nephropathy were slightly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm and females exposed to 1,250 ppm. The incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in all exposed groups of females. At the 12-month interim evaluation, the incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and in females exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm. The severities increased with increasing exposure concentration. At 2 years, the incidences of renal tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups; severities increased with increasing exposure concentration. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Emodin was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the presence of S9 activation; no mutagenicity was detected in strain TA98, with or without S9. Chromosomal aberrations were induced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with emodin, with and without S9. Three separate in vivo micronucleus tests were performed with emodin. A male rat bone marrow micronucleus test, with emodin administered by three intraperitoneal injections, gave negative results. Results of acute-exposure (intraperitoneal injection) micronucleus tests in bone marrow and peripheral blood erythrocytes of male and female mice were negative. In a peripheral blood micronucleus test on mice from the 14-week study, negative results were seen in male mice, but a weakly positive response was observed in similarly exposed females. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in male F344/N rats exposed to 280, 830, or 2,500 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in female F344/N rats based on a marginal increase in the incidence of Zymbal's gland carcinoma. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in male B6C3F1 mice based on a low incidence of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm. Exposure of rats to emodin resulted in increased incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets and pigmentation in males, increased incidences of renal tubule hyaline droplets in females, and increased severities of renal tubule pigmentation in males and females. Emodin exposure resulted in increased incidences of renal tubule pigmentation in male and female mice and increased incidences of nephropathy in female mice. Incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia decreased in male and female rats exposed to 2,500 ppm. Synonyms: Archin; C.I. 75440; C.I. Natural Green 2; C.I.

It is also used in manufacturing diazo dyes, nitroso compounds, and other organic compounds; in dyeing and printing textile fabrics and bleaching fibers; in photography; as a laboratory reagent and a corrosion inhibitor; in metal coatings for phosphatizing and detinning; and in the manufacture of rubber chemicals. Sodium nitrite also has been used in human and veterinary medicine as a vasodilator, a bronchial dilator, an intestinal relaxant, and an antidote for cyanide poisoning. Sodium nitrite was nominated by the FDA for toxicity and carcinogenesis studies based on its widespread use in foods. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to sodium nitrite (99% pure) in drinking water for 14 weeks or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, rat and mouse bone marrow, and mouse peripheral blood. 14-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to 0, 375, 750, 1500, 3,000, or 5000 ppm sodium nitrite (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 30, 55, 115, 200, or 310 mg sodium nitrite/kg body weight to males and 40, 80, 130, 225, or 345 mg/kg to females) in drinking water for 14 weeks. Clinical pathology study groups of 15 male and 15 female rats were exposed to the same concentrations for 70 or 71 days. One female exposed to 3000 ppm died before the end of the study. Body weights of males exposed to 3000 or 5000 ppm and females exposed to 5000 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls. Water consumption by 5000 ppm males and 3000 and 5000 ppm females was less than that by the controls at weeks 2 and 14. Clinical findings related to sodium nitrite exposure included brown discoloration in the eyes and cyanosis of the mouth, tongue, ears, and feet of males exposed to 3000 or 5000 ppm and of females exposed to 1500 ppm or greater. Reticulocyte counts were increased in males and females exposed to 3000 or 5000 ppm. The erythron was decreased on day 19 but increased by week 14 in males and females exposed to 5000 ppm. Methemoglobin concentrations were elevated in almost all exposed groups throughout the 14 week study; a no-observed-adverse-effect level was not achieved. The relative kidney and spleen weights of males and females exposed to 3000 or 5000 ppm were significantly greater than those of the controls. Sperm motility in 1500 and 5000 ppm males was significantly decreased. Increased erythropoietic activity in the bone marrow of exposed males and females was observed. The incidences of squamous cell hyperplasia of the forestomach in 5000 ppm males and females were significantly increased. 14-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 375, 750, 1500, 3000, or 5000 ppm sodium nitrite (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 90, 190, 345, 750, or 990 mg/kg to males and 120, 240, 445, 840, or 1230 mg/kg to females) in drinking water for 14 weeks. Body weights of males exposed to 5000 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls. Water consumption by males exposed to 1500 ppm or greater was slightly less than that by the controls at week 13. Relative spleen weights of 3000 and 5000 ppm males and absolute and relative heart, kidney, liver, and spleen weights of females exposed to 3000 or 5000 ppm were greater than those of the control groups. Sperm motility was decreased in 5000 ppm males, and the estrous cycles of 1500 and 5000 ppm females were significantly longer than in the controls. There were increased incidences of squamous cell hyperplasia of the forestomach in 5000 ppm males and females, extramedullary hematopoiesis of the spleen in 3000 and 5000 ppm males and 1500 ppm or greater females, and degeneration of the testis in 3000 and 5000 ppm males. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed to 0, 750, 1500, or 3000 ppm sodium nitrite (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 35, 70, or 130 mg/kg to males and 40, 8d 40, 80, or 150 mg/kg to females) in drinking water for 2 years. For toxicokinetic studies of plasma nitrite and blood methemoglobin, 10 male and 10 female special study rats were exposed to the same concentrations for 12 months. Survival of exposed groups was similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of males and females exposed to 3000 ppm were less than those of the controls throughout the study. Water consumption by males and females exposed to 3000 ppm was less than that by the controls throughout the study, and that by the other exposed groups was generally less after week 14. The incidences of hyperplasia of the forestomach epithelium in males and females exposed to 3000 ppm were significantly greater than those in the control groups. The incidence of fibroadenoma of the mam mary gland was significantly increased in females exposed to 1500 ppm, and the incidences of multiple fibroadenoma were increased in 750 ppm and 1500 ppm females; however, these neoplasms occur with a high background incidence, and no increase was seen in the 3000 ppm group. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were significantly decreased in males and females exposed to 1500 or 3000 ppm. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 750, 1500, or 3000 ppm sodium nitrite (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 60, 120, or 220 mg/kg to males and 45, 90, or 165 mg/kg to females) in drinking water for 2 years. Survival of exposed groups was similar to that of the controls; mean body weights of 3000 ppm females were less than those of the controls throughout the study. Exposed groups generally consumed less water than the control groups. The incidences of squamous cell papilloma or carcinoma (combined) in the forestomach of female mice occurred with a positive trend. The incidence of hyperplasia of the glandular stomach epithelium was significantly greater in 3000 ppm males than in the controls. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Sodium nitrite was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100, with and without Aroclor 1254-induced hamster and rat liver S9 enzymes; no mutagenicity was observed in strain TA98. Results of acute bone marrow micronucleus tests with sodium nitrite in male rats and mice by intraperitoneal injection were negative. In addition, a peripheral blood micronucleus assay conducted with mice from the 14-week study gave negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this 2-year drinking water study, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of sodium nitrite in male or female F344/N rats exposed to 750, 1500, or 3000 ppm. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of sodium nitrite in male B6C3F1 mice exposed to 750, 1500, or 3000 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of sodium nitrite in female B6C3F1 mice based on the positive trend in the incidences of squamous cell papilloma or carcinoma (combined) of the forestomach. Exposure to sodium nitrite in drinking water resulted in increased incidences of epithelial hyperplasia in the forestomach of male and female rats and in the glandular stomach of male mice.

These electric and magnetic fields are predominantly of low frequency (60 Hz in the United States and 50 Hz in Europe) and generally of low intensity. Epidemiology studies have suggested a potential for increased breast cancer, brain cancer, and leukemia rates with increasing magnetic field exposure. Therefore, given the widespread exposure to low-intensity, 60-Hz magnetic fields in industrialized societies, standard toxicology studies and long-term carcinogenesis studies were conducted using traditional rodent models. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1mice were exposed to 60-Hz magnetic fields by whole-body exposure for 2 years. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 100 male and 100 female rats were exposed to 60-Hz magnetic fields at intensities of 0.02, 2, or 10 G for 18.5 hours per day, 7 days per week, for 106 weeks. Groups of 100 male and 100 female control rats were housed in the same exposure chambers without applied magnetic fields. Additional groups of 100 male and 100 female rats were intermittently exposed (1 hour on and 1 hour off) to a 10 G 60-Hz field 18.5 hours per day, 7 days per week, for 106 weeks. The highest field intensity (10 G) is approximately 5,000-fold greater than what was considered high intensity for homes in epidemiology studies in humans. Survival and Body Weights: Survival and mean body weights of exposed groups of male and female rats was similar to those of the control groups. Pathology Findings: The incidences of thyroid gland C-cell adenoma and carcinoma in 0.02 G male rats, adenoma in 2 G males, and adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 0.02 and 2 G males were significantly greater than in the control group. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in males in the 10 G intermittent group was significantly less than in the control group. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 100 male and 100 female mice were exposed to 60-Hz magnetic fields at intensities of 0.02, 2, or 10 G for 18.5 hours per day, 7 days per week, for 106 weeks. Groups of 100 male and 100 female control mice were housed in the same exposure chambers without applied magnetic fields. Additional groups of 100 male and 100 female mice were intermittently exposed (1 hour on and 1 hour off) to a 10 G 60-Hz field 18.5 hours per day, 7 days per week, for 106 weeks. Survival and Body Weights: Survival of male mice exposed to 10 G was significantly less than that of control mice after 2 years; survival of all other exposed groups of mice was similar to that of control mice. Mean body weights of exposed groups of male and female mice were similar to those of the control groups throughout the study. Pathology Findings: The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma were significantly decreased in 0.02 and 2 G male mice and 2 G female mice relative to the control groups; the incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) were significantly less in males and females exposed to 2 G than in the control groups. In female mice, the incidence of malignant lymphoma in the 10 G intermittent group was significantly less than in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year whole-body exposure studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of 60-Hz magnetic fields in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of thyroid gland C-cell neoplasms in the 0.02 and 2G groups. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N rats or male or female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 0.02, 2, or 10 G, or 10 G intermittent 60-Hz magnetic fields. In exposed rats and mice there were no increased incidences of neoplasms at sites for which epidemiology studies have suggested an association with magnetic fields (brain, mammary gland, leukemia).",,,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser,National Toxicology Program technical report series,8500747,,,2003/02/04 04:00,2003/02/04 04:00,['2003/02/04 04:00'],"['2003/02/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/04 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/04 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser. 1999 Apr;488:1-168.,['National Toxicology Program'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), however, have indicated how disruption of transcription-factor function can disrupt normal cellular differentiation and lead to cancer. This model involves lineage-specific transcription factors, which are involved in normal haematopoietic differentiation. These factors are often targeted in AML--either by direct mutation or by interference from translocation proteins. Uncovering these underlying pathways will improve the diagnosis and treatment of AML, and provide a working model for other types of human cancer, including solid tumours.","['Tenen, Daniel G']",['Tenen DG'],"['Harvard Institutes of Medicine, 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. dtenen@caregroup.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

To reduce the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) caused by transplanted T cells, donors and recipients are HLA matched. For patients for whom a matched donor is not available, one option is transplantation from an HLA-mismatched relative who shares one HLA haplotype. This procedure is distinguished by the use of a stronger conditioning regimen for the patient and of a T-cell-depleted graft containing numerous stem cells. After transplantation, natural killer cells are prevalent, and they can include alloreactive cells that kill tumour cells and prevent GVHD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Austria, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland cover a population of 13 million inhabitants. Cancer registries in these countries supplied incidence and survival data for 465 000 cases of cancer. The prevalence of stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast, cervix uteri, corpus uteri and prostate cancer, as well as skin melanoma, Hodgkin's disease, leukaemia and all malignant neoplasms combined was estimated for the end of 1992. RESULTS: A large heterogeneity was observed within central European countries. For all cancers combined, estimates ranged from 730 per 100 000 in Poland (men) to 3350 per 100 000 in Germany (women). Overall cancer prevalence was the highest in Germany and Switzerland, and the lowest in Poland and Slovenia. In Slovakia, prevalence was higher than average for men and lower than average for women. This was observed for almost all ages. As shown by incidence data, breast cancer was the most frequent malignancy among women in all countries. Among men, prostate cancer was the leading malignancy in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and lung cancer was the major cancer in Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland. The Netherlands had a high prevalence of both prostate and lung cancer. Time-related magnitude of prevalence within each country and the variability of such proportions across the countries has been estimated and cancer prevalence is given by time since diagnosis (1 year, 1-5 years, 5-10 years, >10 years) for each site. The weight of 1-year prevalence (248 per 100 000 among men and 253 per 100 000 among women) was <15% of total prevalence. Prevalent cases between 1 and 5 years since diagnosis represented between 22% and 34% of the total prevalence. Prevalent cases diagnosed from 5 to 10 years before (335 per 100 000 for men and 505 per 100 000 for women) represented between 17% and 23% of prevalent cancers. Finally, long-term cancer prevalence (diagnosed >10 years before), reflecting long-term survival, and number of people considered as cured from cancer were 490 per 100 000 for men and 1028 per 100 000 for women, with a range between 26% (The Netherlands, men) and 50% (Slovakia, women). CONCLUSION: It is clear from observing countries in Central Europe, that high cancer prevalence is associated with well-developed economies. This burden of cancer could be interpreted as a paradoxical effect of better treatments and thereby survival. It could also be taken as a sign for not being satisfied with the advances in treating patients diagnosed with cancer, and for supporting more primary prevention.","['Lutz, J M', 'Francisci, S', 'Mugno, E', 'Usel, M', 'Pompe-Kirn, V', 'Coebergh, J-W', 'Bieslka-Lasota, M']","['Lutz JM', 'Francisci S', 'Mugno E', 'Usel M', 'Pompe-Kirn V', 'Coebergh JW', 'Bieslka-Lasota M']","['Institut de Medecine Sociale et Preventive, Universite de Geneve, Switzerland. jean-michel.lutz@imsp.unige.ch']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Economics', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Survival']",2003/02/04 04:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/02/04 04:00'],"['2003/02/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdg059 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)45335-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2003 Feb;14(2):313-22. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdg059.,['EUROPREVAL Working Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are few published data to support this recommendation, particularly the role of examining multiple levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow biopsies from 172 patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) entered in two consecutive trials of the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group were analysed. The original haematoxylin and eosin-stained trephine biopsy and two or more deeper sections cut at 0.1-0.2 mm intervals were assessed with respect to the morphology, extent and pattern of lymphomatous involvement. The rate of positive diagnosis was correlated with the length of the biopsy specimen and the number of sections examined. RESULTS: Forty-seven biopsies (27%) demonstrated marrow involvement on examination of a mean of four trephine biopsy sections. The rate of positivity increased with the examination of multiple levels and correlated with increasing trephine length but was not dependent on the number of sites sampled. Twenty per cent of biopsies <20 mm in length were positive for lymphoma; this increased to 35% for biopsies >/=20 mm (P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Morphological bone marrow involvement in DLCL is optimally demonstrated by a 20-mm long trephine biopsy from a single site which is examined at multiple levels (four or more). This obviates the need for bilateral sampling, thereby reducing patient morbidity from the procedure. This study provides evidence to support the National Cancer Institute recommendations regarding trephine biopsy in the staging of DLCL, providing multiple levels are examined.","['Campbell, J K', 'Matthews, J P', 'Seymour, J F', 'Wolf, M M', 'Juneja, S K']","['Campbell JK', 'Matthews JP', 'Seymour JF', 'Wolf MM', 'Juneja SK']","[""Division of Laboratory Services, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies']",2003/02/04 04:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/02/04 04:00'],"['2003/02/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdg055 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)45332-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2003 Feb;14(2):273-6. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdg055.,['Australasian Leukaemia Lymphoma Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a recent German case-control study, there was a twofold increase in the leukaemia risk for children whose mothers were aged < 20 years at the time of delivery. As the prevalence of younger mothers among control families was particularly low, data on maternal age distributions for the general population of Germany were obtained in order to examine the representativeness of the control sample. Despite the excellent sampling frame based on data from complete and up-to-date population registries and a satisfactory response rate among controls ( approximately 71%), there seemed to be a material deficit of young mothers in the control sample. The prevalence of young mothers in the control group was 1.4%[95% CI 0.8%, 2.0%] compared with 2.9% in the general population and 3.3%[1.8%, 4.8%] among leukaemia cases. The most likely cause of this deficit was non-participation. Non-participation bias is hard to identify if no information is available on non-responders and if it results from only small subgroups among the total control sample. Maternal age and childhood leukaemia are an example where differential non-participation creates a spurious moderate association for a relatively rare exposure situation. But nowadays, many epidemiological studies target the detection of small to moderate risk increases for rare exposures. Therefore, the choice of a representative control group as well as the achievement of an excellent response rate are of prime importance.","['Schuz, Joachim']",['Schuz J'],"['Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Mainz, Germany. schuez@imsd.unimainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,IM,"['Bias', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology', '*Maternal Age', 'Neuroblastoma/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Risk', 'Sample Size']",2003/02/04 04:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/02/04 04:00'],"['2003/02/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['460 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-3016.2003.00460.x [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2003 Jan;17(1):106-12. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3016.2003.00460.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the frequency of identifying dense inflammatory infiltrates in frozen histologic sections during Mohs operation for BCC or SCC in patients with CLL and organ-transplant recipients, to characterize the infiltrate (reactive versus leukemic) in CLL, and to estimate the subclinical tumor extension in patients with CLL, transplant recipients, and control subjects undergoing Mohs procedure. METHODS: Frozen sections of head and neck BCC and SCC obtained during Mohs procedures in patients with CLL, organ transplant recipients, and a control group were reviewed retrospectively. Biopsy specimens of CLL with dense infiltrates were assessed with immunohistochemical stains. Subclinical tumor extension (postoperative defect size minus preoperative tumor size) was evaluated in each group. RESULTS: Dense infiltrates were found in tumors of 20 of 55 patients with CLL (36%), 1 of 8 transplant recipients (13%), and 1 of 105 controls (1%). In patients with CLL, 75% of the dense infiltrates were B-cell leukemic. Compared with controls, the mean subclinical tumor extension was larger in patients with CLL (P=0.029) and in transplant recipients (P=0.55). CONCLUSION: Dense leukemic infiltrates associated with BCC or SCC in CLL may complicate pathologic interpretation of Mohs surgical histologic margins and may be associated with larger postoperative defects relative to preoperative clinical tumor appearance. In patients with CLL, as in transplant recipients, SCC seems more likely to develop than BCC.","['Mehrany, Khosrow', 'Byrd, David R', 'Roenigk, Randall K', 'Weenig, Roger H', 'Phillips, P Kim', 'Nguyen, Tri H', 'Otley, Clark C']","['Mehrany K', 'Byrd DR', 'Roenigk RK', 'Weenig RH', 'Phillips PK', 'Nguyen TH', 'Otley CC']","['Division of Dermatologic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Dermatol Surg,Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],9504371,IM,"['Carcinoma, Basal Cell/*pathology/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology/surgery', 'Female', 'Frozen Sections', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mohs Surgery', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology/surgery', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery']",2003/02/04 04:00,2003/03/08 04:00,['2003/02/04 04:00'],"['2003/02/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/08 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/04 04:00 [entrez]']","['29034 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1524-4725.2003.29034.x [doi]']",ppublish,Dermatol Surg. 2003 Feb;29(2):129-34. doi: 10.1046/j.1524-4725.2003.29034.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of glomerular pathologic findings attributable to hypercalcemia has been observed in only a few patients and therefore has been considered an unusual finding. In the current study, calcium deposition within glomeruli was investigated in 2 patients with extreme elevations in serum calcium levels and hypercalcemic nephropathy. The study material consisted of a renal biopsy specimen from a 31-year-old woman (patient 1) who had T-cell lymphoma/leukemia and a serum calcium level of 20.2 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L) and autopsy kidney specimens from a 19-year-old woman (patient 2) who was being evaluated for primary hyperparathyroidism and a calcium level of 18.4 mg/dL (4.6 mmol/L). The renal biopsy specimen for patient 1 exhibited calcium deposits present in the glomerular capillary basement membranes, where they were associated with segmental sclerosing lesions (21% of glomeruli). Nine percent of the cortical tubules contained calcifications. In patient 2, calcium was found in the mesangial areas in 95% of glomeruli, filling the Bowman space in 7% of glomeruli, or associated with capillary basement membranes and segmental sclerosing lesions (12% of glomeruli). Fifteen percent of cortical tubules, 4% of outer medullary tubules, and 40% of inner medullary tubules were calcified. In neither case was there immunofluorescence or electron microscopic evidence of primary glomerular disease. Thus, glomerular calcification may exceed that occurring in the cortical and outer medullary tubules and may play a significant role in the loss of renal function in hypercalcemic nephropathy. Glomerular calcinosis may also be recognized as an additional cause of segmental glomerulosclerosis and nephrotic range proteinuria in patients with extremely high levels of serum calcium.","['Henegar, Jeffrey R', 'Coleman, John P', 'Cespedes, Julio', 'Hughson, Michael D']","['Henegar JR', 'Coleman JP', 'Cespedes J', 'Hughson MD']","['Department of Pathology and Center for Excellence in Cardiovascular-Renal Research, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216-4505, USA. jhenegar@pathology.umsmed.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['Adult', 'Calcinosis/blood/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*diagnosis', 'Kidney Diseases/blood/*diagnosis', 'Kidney Glomerulus/*pathology', 'Kidney Tubules/pathology']",2003/02/04 04:00,2003/02/28 04:00,['2003/02/04 04:00'],"['2003/02/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/28 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/04 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/2003-127-e80-GCIH [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2003 Feb;127(2):E80-5. doi: 10.5858/2003-127-e80-GCIH.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This neoplasia commonly shows chromosomal rearrangements at 14q32.1 including translocations [t(14;14)(q11;q32), t(7;14)(q35;q32)], and inversions [inv(14)(q11;q32)]. The investigation of the locus in question at 14q32.1 resulted in the identification of two related genes named T cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (TCL1) and TCL1b. Both genes are activated in T-CLL/T-PLL by the chromosomal aberrations mentioned above. Mice from a transgenic mouse strain expressing the TCL1 gene under the thymocyte specific lck promoter developed a mature T cell leukemia late in life, thereby demonstrating that over-expression of TCL1 induces the neoplastic transformation of T cells. Biochemically, Tcl1 protein works as a co-factor of the Akt kinase, a key regulator of antiapoptotic and proliferative signals. Tcl1 interacts physically with Akt, increases its kinase activity and facilitates its transport to the nucleus. The pathogenesis of T-CLL/T-PLL may also involve Nur77, a T cell transcription factor required for T cell receptor-mediated apoptosis. Akt phosphorylates Nur77, thereby blocking its DNA-binding ability and rendering the transcription factor inactive. The recently emerged insights into the molecular mechanisms of T cell leukemogenesis will allow for the development of specific pharmacological tools for the treatment of these hematopoietic malignancies.","['Pekarsky, Yuri', 'Hallas, Cora', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Pekarsky Y', 'Hallas C', 'Croce CM']","['Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.

This has arbitrarily been defined here as exposures from 0 to 5 cGy. The health implications of exposures within this dose range are highly controversial since the effects are exclusively stochastic. As such, the effects can only be detected in large populations. The Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancers (OSCC) established leukaemia as a predominant effect. After the chernobyl nuclear disaster, studies in European countries have correlated perinatal mortality with radioactive contaminations which could only have raised the radiation burdens by levels which are currently regarded as negligible. The reported risk indices for childhood leukaemia arising from low level exposures are generally comparable to those ascertained for high exposures, thus posing an enigma to radiobiologists. This paper reviews the progress in various areas of radiobiological research and attempts to make a synthesis of the facts with the view to provide an explanation. The purpose is also to stimulate an understanding of multifactorial biological mechanisms. Environmental radiation exposures must be expected to be concomitant with other toxic agents which must be taken into account in risk assessment. The challenge in the future will be to realise this goal.","['Stevenson, Abraham F G']",['Stevenson AF'],"['Institute for Toxicology, Centre for Environmental Sciences, University of Kiel Brunswiker Str. 10, 24105 Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",India,Indian J Exp Biol,Indian journal of experimental biology,0233411,IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation Effects', 'Radiation Injuries/*etiology', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk Assessment']",2003/02/04 04:00,2003/03/11 04:00,['2003/02/04 04:00'],"['2003/02/04 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/11 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/04 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Exp Biol. 2002 Jan;40(1):12-24.,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate whether AS2O3 can induce cell differentiation and its association with growth inhibition in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma using BALB/C nude mice xenograft model. METHODS: Poorly differentiated human nasopharyngeal squamous carcinoma cells from CSNE-1 cell strain were transplanted subcutaneously to BALB/C nude mice to produce tumors. AS2O3 at a dose of 5 mg.(kg.d)-1 was given intraperitoneally for 10 consecutive days, and then 3 times a week for the following 3 weeks. The xenograft tumor growth in mice was observed after drug administration. The morphological changes of the tumors were examined under light and electron microscopy. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: AS2O3 at dose of 5 mg.(kg.d)-1 significantly inhibited the tumor growth in vivo, with a inhibitory rate of 75.4%. Remarkable cell differentiation induced by AS2O3 was observed under light microscope and transmission electron microscope, which was characterized by keratinization of tumor cells, decreased nuclear/cytoplasm ratio, increased cytoplasmic organelles and rich tonofibrils in cytoplasm. Desmosomes and micro-processes were much more frequently observed in tumors treated with AS2O3. Significantly decreased PCNA expression was observed in AS2O3-treated tumor cells. The PCNA-positive cell index (PI) was 53.6 +/- 7.0% in AS2O3-treated mice, and 95.2 +/- 5.0% in control, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The growth of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma xenograft in BALB/C nude mice can be significantly inhibited by AS2O3, which might be related to the cell differentiation induced by AS2O3.","['Du, Cai-Wen', 'Li, De-Rui', 'Lin, Ying-Cheng', 'Wu, Ming-Yao']","['Du CW', 'Li DR', 'Lin YC', 'Wu MY']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, Cancer Hospital, Shantou, Guangdong, 515031, P.

Leukapheresis was obtained from 15 related donors (father, 10; mother, 3; sister, 1; aunt, 1) after s.c. stimulation with G-CSF, 300 micro g daily, starting from day -3 (where day 0 was the day of the first granulocyte collection) and continuing throughout the period of GTX treatment. The donors' median white blood cell (WBC) count at leukapheresis was 31.6 x 10(9)/l (range 12-56), and the median yield was 31.39 x 10(9) WBC (range 2.96-64.73 x 10(9)), with a proportion of PMN of 90-95%. Overall, 70 GTX were administered, with a median of 4 GTX per episode of infection (range 2-11). The combination of GTX with antimicrobial therapy led to complete or partial recovery in 6 and in 3 of 15 episodes (60%), respectively. Priming of the donor with G-CSF was well tolerated, the most common side-effects being bone pain, malaise and paresthesia. All donors are alive and well after a median of 4.5 years (range 0.8-7.7) from donation. We conclude that GTX is potentially useful when the severity of the infection and the host's immunodeficiency make any other antimicrobial treatment ineffectual. Long-term safety data on the stimulation of donors with G-CSF have been reassuring to date. Further controlled studies are needed to assess the exact role of GTX in the outcome of neutropenic patients with severe infection and any criteria for patient selection and the timing of GTX administration.","['Cesaro, Simone', 'Chinello, Pierangelo', 'De Silvestro, Giustina', 'Marson, Piero', 'Picco, Giorgio', 'Varotto, Stefania', 'Pittalis, Silvia', 'Zanesco, Luigi']","['Cesaro S', 'Chinello P', 'De Silvestro G', 'Marson P', 'Picco G', 'Varotto S', 'Pittalis S', 'Zanesco L']","['Clinic of Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Via Giustiniani 3, 35128 Padova, Italy. simone.cesaro@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*complications', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', '*Blood Component Transfusion', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*transplantation', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infections/etiology/*therapy', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*complications/etiology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-002-0394-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2003 Feb;11(2):101-6. doi: 10.1007/s00520-002-0394-8.

Insertion of these sequences into the proline-rich region (PRR) of Env resulted in a chimeric GFP-Env protein that allowed retrovirus vector transduction of murine cells with titres similar to wild-type Env. However, N-terminal extension with GFP did not result in a functional Env protein. GFP sequences were then inserted into the Env PRR of E-MO virus, a MoMLV that carries epidermal growth factor sequences at the N terminus of its Env protein. The resulting virus, GFP-EMO1, replicates to the same titres as the parental virus. In a chronically infected cell culture, GFP-EMO1 was genetically stable. However, additional insertions of sequences that led to recombination or that may have been incompatible with virus replication were deleted and decreased virus titre. In summary, Env PRR can be used to tag individual virus particles with GFP, which leaves other regions available for modification in studies aimed at altering virus tropism.","['Erlwein, Otto', 'Buchholz, Christian J', 'Schnierle, Barbara S']","['Erlwein O', 'Buchholz CJ', 'Schnierle BS']","['Institute for Biomedical Research, Georg-Speyer Haus, Paul-Ehrlich-Str. 42-44, D-60596 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Paul Ehrlich Institute, Medical Biotechnology, Paul-Ehrlich-Str. 51-59, D-63225 Langen, Germany.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research, Georg-Speyer Haus, Paul-Ehrlich-Str. 42-44, D-60596 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Proline/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/03/05 04:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.18761-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2003 Feb;84(Pt 2):369-373. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.18761-0.,,,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.18761-0 [doi]

Previous studies have shown that, during wild-type infection, 55K associates initially with structures termed ND10, which are sites of localization of the promyelocytic leukaemia protein, and then moves, dependent upon its interaction with Orf6, to the establishing virus replication centres. Absence of either Orf3 or Orf6 affects the localization of 55K and so may affect its function. In this study, the influence of Orf3 and Orf6 expression on the association of 55K with the insoluble matrix fraction of the nucleus and with ND10 particularly was examined. Overexpression of Orf6 was sufficient to block the association of 55K with this fraction, irrespective of the presence of Orf3. This effect depended upon the two proteins being able to interact. However, the association of 55K with ND10, which persists throughout infection in the absence of Orf6, required Orf3 to be present, thus distinguishing two subsets of matrix-associated 55K. A modified form of 55K, formation of which was blocked by mutating the known site of SUMO-1 attachment, was more abundant in the absence of Orf6 but unaffected by the absence of Orf3. Thus, this modification is favoured when 55K remains associated with the matrix but does not correlate with its stable association with ND10, many components of which are modified by SUMO-1.","['Lethbridge, Katherine J', 'Scott, Gillian E', 'Leppard, Keith N']","['Lethbridge KJ', 'Scott GE', 'Leppard KN']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Adenovirus E1B Proteins/*metabolism', 'Adenovirus E4 Proteins/*metabolism', 'Adenoviruses, Human/*pathogenicity', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Matrix/*metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/03/05 04:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/05 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.18820-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2003 Feb;84(Pt 2):259-268. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.18820-0.,,,"['0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)']",,,,['C12930/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.18820-0 [doi]

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single centralized laboratory received and analyzed whole blood for RT-PCR for PSA for a subset of patients enrolled on two Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) randomized trials (CALGB 9583 and CALGB 9480). Using 9583, a prognostic model was developed and an independent data set (CALGB 9480) was used to validate the fitted model. RESULTS: Of 162 patients in 9583, 91 (56%) patients were negative for RT-PCR for PSA and 71 (44%) patients were positive. The median survival time was 21 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 18 to 27 months) for RT-PCR-negative patients compared with 11 months (95% CI, 8 to 15 months) for RT-PCR-positive patients (P < or =.001). In multivariable analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) for death was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.4; P =.006) for positive RT-PCR patients compared with negative RT-PCR patients. A fitted model that incorporated RT-PCR for PSA and other factors was used to classify patients from 9480 into one of two risk groups: low or high. We observed good agreement between the observed and predicted survival probabilities for the two risk groups. CONCLUSION: RT-PCR to detect PSA-positive circulating cells is confirmed to be a significant prognostic factor of survival in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. This model could be used to stratify patients in randomized phase III trials.","['Halabi, Susan', 'Small, Eric J', 'Hayes, Daniel F', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Kantoff, Philip W']","['Halabi S', 'Small EJ', 'Hayes DF', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Kantoff PW']","['Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics and CALGB Statistical Center, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA. susan.halabi@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/*analysis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/02/26 04:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/26 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.04.104 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Feb 1;21(3):490-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.04.104.,,,['EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)'],,,,"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Investigations were carried out in 110 diagnostic and follow up specimens from B cell disorders, namely: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL; 65), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; 39), and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL; 6). A selected panel of monoclonal antibodies was used both for FC and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In CLL there was agreement between the three investigations in 71% of samples and in 88% when only FC and BMB were compared. In nine of 65 samples, FC and BMB were positive, although the aspirate was reported as negative. Four BMB negative samples had minimal residual disease (MRD) detected by FC, whereas two samples were positive both on BMB and aspirate but showed no evidence of disease on FC. In NHL, there was agreement between the three investigations in 22 of 39 cases, and in 27 of 39 cases there was agreement between FC and BMB. In eight of 39 NHL cases, FC was negative but the BMB was either positive (five) or uncertain (three), whereas in three of 39, FC was positive but BMB was either negative (one) or uncertain (two). In three of five uncertain BMB, no clonal population was detected by the polymerase chain reaction, whereas in the remaining two cases the nodular aggregates disappeared on further sectioning. CONCLUSIONS: Both BMB and FC are better than bone marrow aspirates for the detection of infiltration in B cell disorders. FC might be slightly more sensitive than BMB to detect MRD in CLL, whereas BMB may be slightly better than FC in NHL.","['Sah, S P', 'Matutes, E', 'Wotherspoon, A C', 'Morilla, R', 'Catovsky, D']","['Sah SP', 'Matutes E', 'Wotherspoon AC', 'Morilla R', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden Hospital, 203 Fulham Road, London SW3 6JJ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/03/26 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.56.2.129 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2003 Feb;56(2):129-32. doi: 10.1136/jcp.56.2.129.,,,,,,,,,,PMC1769888,,,,,,,,

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is used to treat APL and is a potent morphogen that regulates HOX gene expression in embryogenesis and organogenesis. HOX genes are also involved in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Thirty-nine mammalian HOX genes have been identified and classified into 13 paralogous groups clustered on 4 chromosomes. They encode a complex network of transcription regulatory proteins whose precise targets remain poorly understood. The overall function of the network appears to be dictated by gene dosage. To investigate the mechanisms involved in HOX gene regulation in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis by precise measurement of individual HOX genes, a small-array real-time HOX (SMART-HOX) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform was designed and validated. Application of SMART-HOX to 16 APL bone marrow samples revealed a global down-regulation of 26 HOX genes compared with normal controls. HOX gene expression was also altered during differentiation induced by ATRA in the PML-RARalpha(+) NB4 cell line.

In this study, we analyzed the direct proapoptotic effect of TC-A in the B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) model. We focused on the signal cascade triggered by TC-A in B-CLL cells and identified activated mitochondrial as well as endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress signals. The expression levels of known effector molecules mediating mitochondrial signaling, such as Bax and Bid, and the antagonistic molecule Bcl-2 did not influence sensitivity of B-CLL cells to TC-A. Furthermore, the molecular chaperone and sensor of ER stress, HSP70, though significantly up-regulated in B-CLL cells undergoing TC-A-triggered apoptosis, was ineffective to exert its anti-apoptotic function described in multiple cell death pathways. Autologous T cells of B-CLL patients were significantly less sensitive to TC-A as were also T cells from healthy donors when compared with their normal B-cell fraction. Furthermore, sensitivity of B-CLL cells to TC-A treatment in vitro was dependent neither on the expression levels of CD38-a prognostic factor for survival of B-CLL patients as well as for their response to therapy-nor on the clinical stage or pretreatment status of patients. From our data showing that TC-A induced a cell death pathway via ER stress preferentially in B cells and that it acted independently of important markers of drug sensitivity and of clinical markers, we conclude that TC-A might represent an attractive candidate drug for further evaluation in preclinical trials.","['Anether, Gabriele', 'Tinhofer, Inge', 'Senfter, Monika', 'Greil, Richard']","['Anether G', 'Tinhofer I', 'Senfter M', 'Greil R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases', 'Female', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2501 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54088-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 1;101(11):4561-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2501.

Patients who have high levels of MIP-1alpha have a poor prognosis. Furthermore, blocking MIP-1alpha expression in an in vivo model of human MM profoundly decreases both tumor burden and bone destruction, suggesting that MIP-1alpha is an important mediator of MM bone disease. Therefore, to analyze the regulation of MIP-1alpha production in MM, we cloned the human MIP-1alpha promoter and characterized the transcription factor (TF) motifs that control MIP-1alpha expression in MM cells. The proximal region of MIP-1alpha promoter was composed of 2 sets of identical transcription regulatory regions consisting of GATA-2(+) AML-1(+) C/EBPalpha motifs. Since 2 alternatively spliced variants of the acute myeloid leukemia-1 (AML-1) class of TFs can bind the AML-1 region, AML-1A and AML-1B, the relationship between the expression levels of AML-1A or AML-1B in MM cells and their capacity to express MIP-1alpha was examined. AML-1A mRNA was relatively overexpressed compared with AML-1B in MM cell lines that produced high levels of MIP-1alpha (> 1 ng/mL per 10(6) cells per 72 hours), but AML-1A was not increased in MM cell lines that expressed less than 200 pg/mL MIP-1alpha. More importantly, the ratio of AML-1A to AML-1B mRNA levels was also increased in 3 of 3 highly purified myeloma cells from patients with MM who expressed increased amounts of MIP-1alpha. The ratio of AML-1A to AML-1B mRNA in patients with MM was 8-fold higher than in healthy controls. Transduction of AML-1B into the MM-derived MM.1S and ARH-77 cells totally blocked MIP-1alpha production, while AML-1A did not further increase the already high levels of MIP-1alpha produced by these cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that in patients with MM who produce increased concentrations of MIP-1alpha, the relative level of AML-1B is significantly decreased compared with healthy controls. The data suggest that strategies that enhance AML-1B expression or decrease AML-1A in MM cells may be beneficial therapeutically.","['Choi, Sun J', 'Oba, Tomoko', 'Callander, Natalie S', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Roodman, G David']","['Choi SJ', 'Oba T', 'Callander NS', 'Jelinek DF', 'Roodman GD']","['Department of Medicine Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-08-2641 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44418-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 May 15;101(10):3778-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-08-2641.

The study objective was to assess whether CVL location and insertion technique are associated with the incidence of VTE in children. We hypothesized that VTE would be more frequent with (1). CVL location on the left body side, (2). CVL location in the subclavian vein rather than the jugular vein, and (3). CVL insertion by percutaneous technique rather than venous cut-down. This was a prospective, multicenter cohort study in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had a CVL placed in the upper venous system during induction chemotherapy. Characteristics of CVL were documented prospectively. All children had outcome assessment for VTE by objective radiographic tests, including bilateral venography, ultrasound, echocardiography, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Among 85 children, 29 (34%) had VTE; 28 VTEs appeared in the upper venous system, and 1 was sinovenous thrombosis. Left-sided CVL (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-6.4; P =.048), subclavian CVL (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2-8.5; P =.025), and percutaneous CVL insertion (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.3-9.2; P =.011) were associated with an increased incidence of VTE. Interaction occurred between CVL vein location and insertion technique. Subclavian vein CVL inserted percutaneously had an increased incidence (54%) of VTE compared with any other combination (P =.07). For CVL in the upper venous system, CVL placement on the right side and in the jugular vein may reduce the risk for CVL-related VTE. If subclavian vein placement is necessary, CVL insertion by venous cut-down appears preferable over percutaneous insertion.","['Male, Christoph', 'Chait, Peter', 'Andrew, Maureen', 'Hanna, Kim', 'Julian, Jim', 'Mitchell, Lesley']","['Male C', 'Chait P', 'Andrew M', 'Hanna K', 'Julian J', 'Mitchell L']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antithrombin III/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Phlebography', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Venous Thrombosis/diagnosis/*etiology/prevention & control']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2731 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54047-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 1;101(11):4273-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2731.

However, its prognostic relevance in the era of imatinib therapy is unknown. We investigated the independent prognostic relevance of CE in 498 patients with Ph-positive CML treated with imatinib for chronic or accelerated phases. One hundred twenty-one patients had CE alone (n = 70) or with other accelerated phase criteria (n = 51). Patients were compared in 4 categories: chronic phase (n = 295), CE only (n = 70), accelerated phase without CE (n = 82), and accelerated phase with CE (n = 51). Statistical methods used established methodologies for univariate and multivariate analyses. In chronic and accelerated phases of CML, CE was not associated with significant differences in major or complete cytogenetic response rates, but it was an independent poor prognostic factor for survival by multivariate analyses in both chronic (P =.005) and accelerated phase (P =.03). Multivariate analyses conducted at the 3-month landmark (including the 3-month cytogenetic response) identified the lack of cytogenetic response at 3 months to be a stronger independent poor prognostic factor for survival than CE for both chronic (major cytogenetic response versus other) and accelerated phase (any cytogenetic response versus other). We conclude that cytogenetic CE is not an important factor for achieving major or complete cytogenetic response with imatinib mesylate therapy, but it is an independent poor prognostic factor for survival in both chronic and accelerated phases of CML. The 3-month cytogenetic response to imatinib mesylate refined the prognostic relevance of such studies in patients on imatinib mesylate therapy.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Giles, Francis', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Wierda, William', 'Ferrajoli, Allessandra', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Cortes JE', 'Talpaz M', 'Giles F', ""O'Brien S"", 'Rios MB', 'Shan J', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Faderl S', 'Thomas DA', 'Wierda W', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Jeha S', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Clinical investigators are poorly served by such conventional methodology. We contend that phase 2 trials are inherently comparative, with the results of the comparison determining whether to conduct a subsequent phase 3 trial. When different treatments are studied in separate single-arm trials, actual differences between response rates associated with the treatments, ""treatment effects,"" are confounded with differences between the trials, ""trial effects."" Thus, it is impossible to estimate either effect separately. Consequently, when the results of separate single-arm trials of different treatments are compared, an apparent treatment difference may be due to a trial effect. Conversely, the apparent absence of a treatment effect may be due to an actual treatment effect being cancelled out by a trial effect. Because selection involves comparison, single-arm phase 2 trials thus fail to provide a reliable means for selecting which therapies to investigate in phase 3. Moreover, reducing complex clinical phenomena, including both adverse and desirable events, to a single outcome wastes important information. Consequently, conventional phase 2 designs are inefficient and unreliable. Given the limited number of patients available for phase 2 trials and the increasing number of new therapies that must be evaluated, it is critically important to conduct these trials efficiently. These concerns motivated the development of a general paradigm for randomized selection trials evaluating several therapies based on multiple outcomes. Three illustrative applications of trials using this approach are presented.","['Estey, Elihu H', 'Thall, Peter F']","['Estey EH', 'Thall PF']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA. ehestey@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenine Nucleotides', 'Adult', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Bias', 'Biomarkers', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Clofarabine', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Carriers', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Selection', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Remission Induction', '*Research Design', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2937 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44357-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 15;102(2):442-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2937.

Although the Tax viral transactivator is clearly an oncogene, the role of its continuous expression in the maintenance of the transformed phenotype is controversial. Because arsenic trioxide (As) and interferon alpha (IFN) synergize to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of ATL cells both ex vivo and in vitro, we investigated the effects of As alone and As/IFN combination on gene networks in HTLV-1-infected leukemic cells. The As/IFN combination reduced Tax expression and, accordingly, reversed the Tax-induced constitutive nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Using DNA microarray analyses, we demonstrated that As rapidly and selectively blocks the transcription of NF-kappaB-dependent genes in HTLV-1-infected cells only. Reversal of NF-kappaB activation by As alone resulted from dramatic stabilization of IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-epsilon, independently of IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity modulation or Tax degradation. In contrast, only the As/IFN combination induced late and massive down-regulation of cell cycle-regulated genes, concomitantly with Tax degradation by the proteasome and cell death induction, indicating the importance of continuous Tax expression for ATL cell survival.

These results demonstrate that GATA1 is likely to play a critical role in the etiology of TMD, and mutagenesis of GATA1 represents a very early event in DS myeloid leukemogenesis.","['Mundschau, Gina', 'Gurbuxani, Sandeep', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Greene, Marianne E', 'Arceci, Robert J', 'Crispino, John D']","['Mundschau G', 'Gurbuxani S', 'Gamis AS', 'Greene ME', 'Arceci RJ', 'Crispino JD']","['Ben May Institute for Cancer Research, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutagenesis', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/etiology/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/07/12 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-12-3904 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54051-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jun 1;101(11):4298-300. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3904.

Recombinant human interleukin 11 (rhIL-11) prevents gastrointestinal epithelial disintegrity and has immunomodulatory actions. Our aim was to ascertain whether or not treatment with rhIL-11 can prevent gut-associated infections. METHODS: We did a double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial, to which we enrolled 40 patients with haematological malignant disease who were undergoing chemotherapy. Patients received either rhIL-11 50 microg/kg (n=20) or placebo (n=20) daily by subcutaneous injection from the day before the start of chemotherapy until resolution of neutropenia or for 21 days, whichever was longer. Our primary outcome measure was a reduction in bacteraemia. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Significantly fewer patients who received rhIL-11 rather than placebo developed bacteraemia, particularly of gastrointestinal origin: the proportion of patients with at least one positive blood culture was 0.65 and 0.25, respectively (p=0.02). The numbers of patients (placebo vs rhIL-11) for each number of distinct isolates were: no organism isolated seven versus 15, one organism nine versus four, two organisms two versus one, three organisms one versus none, and four organisms one versus none (p=0.01), suggesting a lower bacterial load in the rhIL-11 than in the placebo group. Time to first bacteraemic event was longer in patients who received rhIL-11 (p=0.03) than in those who received placebo. INTERPRETATION: rhIL-11 reduces the frequency and load of bacteraemia in patients with haematological malignant disease undergoing chemotherapy, possibly by gastrointestinal cytoprotective or immunological mechanisms [corrected].","['Ellis, Michael', 'Zwaan, Ferdinand', 'Hedstrom, Ulla', 'Poynton, Christopher', 'Kristensen, Jorgen', 'Jumaa, Pauline', 'Wassell, Julie', 'al-Ramadi, Basel']","['Ellis M', 'Zwaan F', 'Hedstrom U', 'Poynton C', 'Kristensen J', 'Jumaa P', 'Wassell J', 'al-Ramadi B']","['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates. michael.ellis@uaeu.ac.ae']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/*prevention & control', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/*therapeutic use']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0140673603123227 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(03)12322-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2003 Jan 25;361(9354):275-80. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(03)12322-7.,,,"['0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'HM5641GA6F (oprelvekin)']",,,,,,['Lancet. 2003 M ar 15;361(9361):972.'],,,,,,,,,

However, the data presented to the independent data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) at both its reviews in 1998 suggested large benefits for the additional course with hazard ratios of 0.47 and 0.55 (95% CIs 0.29-0.77 and 0.38-0.80, p=0.003 and p=0.002, respectively). Despite these highly significant findings, the DMEC did not recommend closure of the randomization, a decision vindicated by the subsequent reversion to a null result. The main reason for not closing the randomization was that the treatment effects observed in 1998 (53% and 45% reductions in the odds of death) were considered too large to be clinically plausible, despite the p-values associated with them. Investigations have not identified any clinical explanations, such as different types of patients in the early and later parts of the trial, to explain the loss of benefit as the trial progressed. Thus, the most likely current explanation for the large benefit observed early on is the play of chance. Lessons to be learned from this example are that: fixed stopping rules based on some predetermined p-value should not be used and the decision to close a randomization or not should take account of other factors such as the medical plausibility of the magnitude of the treatment effect; chance effects do occur and happen more frequently than many clinicians realize; it is important that DMEC members are experienced in the interpretation of clinical trial evidence and aware of the dangers of early stopping without wholly convincing evidence.","['Wheatley, Keith', 'Clayton, David']","['Wheatley K', 'Clayton D']","['Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham, Park Grange, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom. k.wheatley@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Control Clin Trials,Controlled clinical trials,8006242,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/04/30 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0197245602002738 [pii]', '10.1016/s0197-2456(02)00273-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Control Clin Trials. 2003 Feb;24(1):66-70. doi: 10.1016/s0197-2456(02)00273-8.,,,,,,"['Control Clin Trials. 2004 Feb;25(1):67-9; author reply 71-2.

Acid treatment thus allows detection of the cell surface class I antigens by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to HLA-free heavy chains. We found that acid treatment also enables detection of the cell surface non-classical HLA-G class I antigen with mAbs specific for HLA-G free heavy chains, including 4H84 mAb recognizing all isoforms. Furthermore, we found that 4H84 mAb, but not other mAbs specific to HLA-G free heavy chains, binds to the surface of 8 out of 16 acid-treated leukemia cell lines. Nevertheless, HLA-G antigen is not present in any of these leukemia cells. This was demonstrated by failure to detect any antigen with 4H84 mAb in immunoblotting as well as by inability to detect HLA-G mRNA by RT-PCR. The antigen recognized by 4H84 mAb in some acid treated leukemia cells was identified by immunoprecipitation as a 45 kDa protein. A number of observations indicate that 45 kDa proteins are none other than classical class I heavy chains. Acid treatment thus induces the ability of the 4H84 mAb to recognize some classical HLA class I molecules. Remarkably, 4H84 determinant on HLA-G is linear but corresponding determinant present on some partially folded classical HLA class I free heavy chains is conformational. In view of the unexpected cross-reactivity, detection of HLA-G with this mAb must be carefully evaluated to avoid false detection.","['Polakova, Katarina', 'Bennink, Jack R', 'Yewdell, Jonathan W', 'Bystricka, Magdalena', 'Bandzuchova, Elena', 'Russ, Gustav']","['Polakova K', 'Bennink JR', 'Yewdell JW', 'Bystricka M', 'Bandzuchova E', 'Russ G']","['Cancer Research Institute, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Choriocarcinoma/pathology', 'Citric Acid/*pharmacology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/drug effects/*immunology', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Isoforms/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology', 'Uterine Neoplasms/pathology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/immunology']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/09/27 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0198885902007772 [pii]', '10.1016/s0198-8859(02)00777-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 2003 Feb;64(2):256-64. doi: 10.1016/s0198-8859(02)00777-2.,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '2968PHW8QP (Citric Acid)', 'SE337SVY37 (sodium phosphate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, indications should be refined and mitoxantrone reserved as a rescue therapy to: (1) patients in the relapsing-remitting phase with frequent and disabling exacerbations likely leading to permanent severe disability and (2) to patients in the secondary progressive phase whose disability progression rate increases by one EDSS point or more per year and who do not respond to other current therapies. An induction phase with the monthly intravenous administration of 12 mg/m(2) followed by a maintenance phase with 12 mg/m(2) every 3 months for 2 years seems the most effective and safe treatment regimen, not exceeding the maximum cumulative dose of 140 mg/m(2). Given the potent myelosuppressive activity of mitoxantrone, dosage should be carefully adapted to the body surface and hematological changes. Long-term toxicities (amenorrhoea and therapy-related leukemia) seem acceptable but a valid evaluation will need a longer follow-up in more patients. Cardiotoxicity, the major long-term toxicity, is clearly dose-dependent and is a strict treatment duration limiting factor. To reduce the risk of cardiac events, the drug should be administered by slow infusion (over 30 min). Analogs of mitoxantrone with a much lower cardiotoxicity are currently investigated in animal experimental models.","['Gonsette, R E']",['Gonsette RE'],"['National Center for MS, Melsbroek B 1820, Belgium. r.gonsette@skynet.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Neurol Sci,Journal of the neurological sciences,0375403,IM,"['Disability Evaluation', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Humans', 'Mitoxantrone/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/*drug therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0022510X02003350 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-510x(02)00335-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurol Sci. 2003 Feb 15;206(2):203-8. doi: 10.1016/s0022-510x(02)00335-0.,,56,['BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The consequences of the reaction are directly related to the reactivity of the sugars involved, whether aldoses or ketoses, phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated. So far, most studies have been focused on glucose, while fructose, a faster glycating agent, attracted minor attention. We have recently demonstrated that under in vitro conditions fructose and its phosphate derivatives can modify plasmid DNA faster than glucose and its phosphate metabolites. In the present study we provide further evidences suggesting that fructose and its phosphate metabolites, at the tested conditions, are cytotoxic and inflict deleterious DNA modifications to L5178Y cells in culture. Damage was verified by viable cell counts, MTT assay, colony forming ability, induction of mutation in the thymidine kinase gene, internucleosomal DNA cleavage, and single strand breaks. The intensity of the tested sugars to impose damage increased significantly in the following order: sucrose = glucose 1-phosphate < glucose < glucose 6-phosphate < fructose 1-phosphate = fructose < fructose 6-phosphate. Aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of the glycation reaction, inhibited internucleosomal DNA cleavage. Taken together, these results suggest that fructose triggers deleterious modification in cultured cells through the glycation process, and thus should deserve more attention as an agent that may induce physiological complications.","['Levi, Boaz', 'Werman, Moshe J']","['Levi B', 'Werman MJ']","['Department of Food Engineering and Biotechnology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Nutr Biochem,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,9010081,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Damage/*physiology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Fructose/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0955286302002541 [pii]', '10.1016/s0955-2863(02)00254-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr Biochem. 2003 Jan;14(1):49-60. doi: 10.1016/s0955-2863(02)00254-1.,,,"['0 (Phosphates)', '30237-26-4 (Fructose)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strikingly, these translocations were complex, clonally heterogeneous and amplified. We observed reiterated IgH/c-Myc fusions on dicentric chromosomes, suggesting that amplification occurred by repeated cycles of bridge, breakage and fusion. Leukemogenesis was not mitigated in RAG-2/p53/Prkdc-deficient mice, but leukemic pro-B cells lacked IgH/c-Myc translocations. Thus, global genomic instability conferred by p53/Prkdc disruption efficiently transforms pro-B cells lacking RAG-1/2-induced DSB.

We report a case of oral Exophiala infection in a 39-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Clinical records of the patient were reviewed and the following additional information was collected: histological and microbiological evidence; identification of the causative organism; in vitro antifungal susceptibility. RESULTS: The patient developed a necrotic ulcer surrounded by a violaceous rim in the gingiva during neutropenia. Exophiala dermatitidis was identified as the causative organism by histopathological examination and culture, and finally confirmed by sequencing of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed space domain. In vitro, amphotericin B was found to show strong activity against the Exophiala isolate while itraconazole showed less activity. The patient was successfully treated with parenteral amphotericin B and oral itraconazole in combination with surgical removal of the fungi focus. CONCLUSION: Local excision with adequate antifungal agents can be used to treat immunocompromised patients with Exophiala stomatitis, based on early diagnosis.","['Myoken, Yoshinari', 'Sugata, Tatsumi', 'Fujita, Yoshinori', 'Kyo, Tai-ichi', 'Fujihara, Megumu', 'Katsu, Masakazu', 'Mikami, Yuzuru']","['Myoken Y', 'Sugata T', 'Fujita Y', 'Kyo T', 'Fujihara M', 'Katsu M', 'Mikami Y']","['Department of Oral Surgery, Hiroshima Red-Cross Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospital, 1-9-6 Senda-machi, Naka-ku, Hiroshima 730-0052, Japan. myoken@do5.enjoy.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,J Oral Pathol Med,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,8911934,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage', 'DNA, Fungal/analysis', '*Exophiala/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Itraconazole/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Mycoses/complications/drug therapy/*microbiology/surgery', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Stomatitis/complications/drug therapy/*microbiology/surgery']",2003/02/01 04:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/02/01 04:00'],"['2003/02/01 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/02/01 04:00 [entrez]']","['056 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0714.2003.00056.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Oral Pathol Med. 2003 Jan;32(1):51-4. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0714.2003.00056.x.,,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (DNA, Fungal)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the two genes involved in this translocation have been identified: the MEL1 gene at 1p36.3, and the RPN1 gene at 3q21. The breakpoint in RPN1 is centromeric to the breakpoint cluster region of the inv(3) abnormality. Because the MEL1 transcript is detected only in leukemic cells with t(1;3)(p36;q21), ectopic expression of MEL1 driven by RPN1 at 3q21 is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of t(1;3)(p36;q21) leukemia. However, the precise breakpoint in the patients has not yet been identified. With fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis by use of BAC/PAC probes, we identified the breakpoint at 1p36.3 in three MDS/AML patients with t(1;3)(p36;q21): within the first intron of the MEL1 gene (one patient) or within a 29-kb region located in the 5' region of MEL1 (two other patients). We detected several sizes of MEL1 transcript in two patients including the first patient, although we have not yet clarified whether MEL1 transcripts were different among the patients and whether a truncated MEL1 transcript was expressed in the first patient.

Because of the favorable prognosis, the evidence of the t(8;21) or the AML1/ETO fusion gene is mandatory in most of the therapy trials, allowing the stratification of the patients to the correct risk group in terms of treatment. Here we present six out of 59 children with AML who were positive for AML1/ETO by RT-PCR, but showed no evidence of the classical t(8;21)(q22;q22) by conventional cytogenetics. Because of the discrepancies between molecular and cytogenetic analyses, these six patients were further investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Small hidden interstitial insertions resulting in an AML1/ETO rearrangement were detected in five (8.5%) of the 59 patients, whereas the sixth patient showed a cryptic three-way translocation. The insertions could be characterized as ins(21;8) in three patients and ins(8;21) in the remaining two. Additionally, three of the patients showed secondary chromosome aberrations leading to a higher complexity of the karyotype.

Both direct DNA-PCR and reverse transcriptase-PCR were used to examine healthy individuals for lymphoma- and leukemia-associated CTs. Two oncogene-activating CTs [t(14;18)(q32;q21) and t(8;14)(q24;q32)] and one fusion-gene CT [t(2;5)(p23;q35)] from lymphomas and five fusion-gene CTs from leukemia [t(9;22)(q34;q11), t(4;11)(q21;q23), t(15;17)(q22;q11), t(12;21)(p13;q22), t(8;21)(q22;q22)] were detected in such studies. The biological implication is that CTs associated with malignant tumors may also be found in cells that are not neoplastic. CTs are characteristic attributes of neoplastic clones but are by themselves insufficient to cause malignant transformation. A better understanding of the special biology of non-neoplastic CT-bearing cells will provide insight into their putative role as tumor precursors.

The standardised incidence ratio (SIR) for each cancer was calculated and overall risk, risk in relation to gender and age at diagnosis of the index cancers and time from diagnosis of the index cancer to the diagnosis of the second malignancy were measured. There were 9385 CM patients, 4016 CLL patients and 13 857 NHL patients identified with an index cancer with 56 195, 14 450 and 44 999 person-years of follow-up, respectively. There was an increased risk of both CLL and NHL following a diagnosis of CM (SIR 2.3 and 1.5, respectively) and of CM following a diagnosis of CLL and NHL (SIR 2.3 and 2.1, respectively). The risk was statistically significantly increased for CLL developing in CM patients and for CM occurring in NHL survivors (P<0.05). This study supports an association between CM, CLL and NHL developing in the same patient.

To further evaluate this issue, we isolated a HL-60 cell clone highly resistant to several drugs inducing apoptosis and to the differentiating chemical all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). The resistant clone displayed an activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT1 pathway, with levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate higher than the parental cells and increased levels of both Thr 308 and Ser 473 phosphorylated AKT1. In vitro AKT1 activity was elevated in resistant cells, whereas treatment of the resistant cell clone with two inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin or Ly294002, strongly reduced phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate levels and AKT1 activity. The inhibitors reversed resistance to drugs. Resistant cells overexpressing either dominant negative PI3K or dominant negative AKT1 became sensitive to drugs and ATRA. Conversely, if parental HL-60 cells were forced to overexpress an activated AKT1, they became resistant to apoptotic inducers and ATRA. There was a tight relationship between the activation of the PI3K/AKT1 axis and the expression of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 proteins. Activation of the PI3K/AKT1 axis in resistant cells was dependent on enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, conceivably due to an autocrine insulin-like growth factor-I production. Our findings suggest that an up-regulation of the PI3K/AKT1 pathway might be one of the survival mechanisms responsible for the onset of resistance to chemotherapeutic and differentiating therapy in patients with acute leukemia.","['Neri, Luca M', 'Borgatti, Paola', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Bortul, Roberta', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Tabellini, Giovanna', 'Bellacosa, Alfonso', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Neri LM', 'Borgatti P', 'Tazzari PL', 'Bortul R', 'Cappellini A', 'Tabellini G', 'Bellacosa A', 'Capitani S', 'Martelli AM']","['Dipartimento di Morfologia ed Embriologia, Universita di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein']",2003/01/31 04:00,2003/07/30 05:00,['2003/01/31 04:00'],"['2003/01/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2003 Jan;1(3):234-46.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, others have demonstrated that unlike normal, CML CD34+ progenitors can proliferate in response to KL as a sole stimulus. To address these seemingly paradoxical findings, we examined the growth responses of CML CD34+ GM progenitors to various cytokines with and without a potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity, PD173955. The heightened growth responses of CML GM progenitors to KL alone and to G-CSF + GM-CSF were abrogated by 10 nM PD173955 while having no effect on normal GM progenitors. While normal GM progenitors exhibited the expected synergistic response when KL was added to G-CSF + GM-CSF, CML GM progenitors had a minimal response; however, some synergism was restored by 10 nM PD173955. Normal erythroid progenitors require the synergistic interaction between KL and a saturating amount of erythropoietin (EPO, 1 unit) for optimal growth. In contrast, CML erythroid progenitors had up to 50% of optimal growth in KL alone, and, only a subthreshold amount of EPO (0.1 unit) was needed with KL to achieve 85% of the optimal response; these heightened growth responses were largely abrogated by 10 nM PD173955. Thus, direct evidence is provided that constitutively activated Bcr-Abl kinase pathways in primitive CML progenitors cooperate with single growth factors producing a heightened growth response, and, in so doing, disrupt the normally required synergistic interactions between KL and other cytokines to achieve activation and optimal growth of primitive progenitors. Coupled with our previous findings that a larger than normal proportion of CML primitive progenitors are at a later stage of maturation, we propose that this disruption of normal synergistic responses leads to increased progenitor recruitment into a committed pool by a process of accelerated maturation.","['Strife, Annabel', 'Wisniewski, David', 'Liu, Chongyuan', 'Lambek, Caryl L', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew', 'Silver, Richard T', 'Clarkson, Bayard']","['Strife A', 'Wisniewski D', 'Liu C', 'Lambek CL', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Silver RT', 'Clarkson B']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'CD13 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD36 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyridones/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*metabolism']",2003/01/31 04:00,2003/07/30 05:00,['2003/01/31 04:00'],"['2003/01/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2003 Jan;1(3):176-85.,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (PD 173955)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",,,,"['R01 CA028704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA028704-26/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, PLD2 is fully active in the presence of this phospholipid, whereas PLD1 activation is dependent on additional factors such as ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF-1) and protein kinase Calpha. We find that mastoparan, an activator of G(i) and mast cells, stimulates an intrinsic PLD activity, most likely PLD2, in fractions enriched in plasma membranes from rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 mast cells. Overexpression of PLD2, but not of PLD1, results in a large increase in the mastoparan-inducible PLD activity in membrane fractions, particularly those enriched in plasma membranes. As in previous studies, expressed PLD2 is localized primarily in the plasma membrane and PLD1 in granule membranes. Studies with pertussis toxin and other agents indicate that mastoparan stimulates PLD2 independently of G(i), ARF-1, protein kinase C, and calcium. Kinetic studies indicate that mastoparan interacts synergistically with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and that oleate, itself a weak stimulant of PLD2 at low concentrations, is a competitive inhibitor of mastoparan stimulation of PLD2. Therefore, mastoparan may be useful for investigating the regulation of PLD2, particularly in view of the well studied molecular interactions of mastoparan with certain other strategic signaling proteins.","['Chahdi, Ahmed', 'Choi, Wahn Soo', 'Kim, Young Mi', 'Beaven, Michael A']","['Chahdi A', 'Choi WS', 'Kim YM', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1760, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Oleic Acid/pharmacology', 'Peptides', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wasp Venoms/*pharmacology']",2003/01/31 04:00,2003/05/20 05:00,['2003/01/31 04:00'],"['2003/01/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M212084200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)64791-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Apr 4;278(14):12039-45. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M212084200.

To address the mechanism by which this regulation occurs, we examined the chromatin structure of the histone H4/n (FO108, H4FN) gene locus. Micrococcal nuclease, DNase I, and restriction enzymes show similar cleavage sites and levels of sensitivity at the H4/n locus in both proliferating and differentiated HL-60 cells. In contrast, differentiation-related activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(cip1/WAF1) gene is accompanied by increased nuclease hypersensitivity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the H4/n gene reveal that acetylated histones H3 and H4 are maintained at the same levels in proliferating and postproliferative cells. Thus, the chromatin of the H4/n locus remains in an open state even after transcription ceases. Using ligation-mediated PCR to visualize genomic DNase I footprints at single-nucleotide resolution, we find that protein occupancy at the site II cell cycle element is selectively diminished in differentiated cells while the site I element remains occupied. Decreased occupancy of site II is reflected by loss of the site II binding protein HiNF-P. We conclude that H4 gene transcription during differentiation is downregulated by modulating protein interaction at the site II cell cycle element and that retention of an open chromatin conformation may be associated with site I occupancy.","['Hovhannisyan, Hayk', 'Cho, Brian', 'Mitra, Partha', 'Montecino, Martin', 'Stein, Gary S', 'Van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Stein, Janet L']","['Hovhannisyan H', 'Cho B', 'Mitra P', 'Montecino M', 'Stein GS', 'Van Wijnen AJ', 'Stein JL']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Micrococcal Nuclease/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Restriction Mapping/methods', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2003/01/31 04:00,2003/03/06 04:00,['2003/01/31 04:00'],"['2003/01/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.4.1460-1469.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Feb;23(4):1460-9. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.4.1460-1469.2003.,,,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (HINFP protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'EC 3.1.31.1 (Micrococcal Nuclease)']",,,,"['R01 GM032010/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM32010/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC141140,,,,,,,,

Triggering differentiation has been employed as a strategy to inhibit cell proliferation and accelerate apoptosis in malignant cells, in which the apoptotic threshold is often characteristically elevated. To better understand the mechanisms underlying differentiation-mediated regulation of apoptosis, we have studied death receptor responses during erythroid differentiation of K562 erythroleukemia cells, which normally are highly resistant to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-, FasL-, and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, upon hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation, K562 cells specifically lost their resistance to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which efficiently killed the differentiating cells independently of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling. Concomitantly with the increased sensitivity, the expression of both c-FLIP splicing variants, c-FLIP(L) and c-FLIP(S), was downregulated, resulting in an altered caspase 8 recruitment and cleavage in the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Stable overexpression of both c-FLIP(L) and c-FLIP(S) rescued the cells from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis with isoform-specific effects on DISC-recruited caspase 8. Our results show that c-FLIP(L) and c-FLIP(S) potently control TRAIL responses, both by distinct regulatory features, and further imply that the differentiation state of malignant cells determines their sensitivity to death receptor signals.","['Hietakangas, Ville', 'Poukkula, Minna', 'Heiskanen, Kaisa M', 'Karvinen, Jarkko T', 'Sistonen, Lea', 'Eriksson, John E']","['Hietakangas V', 'Poukkula M', 'Heiskanen KM', 'Karvinen JT', 'Sistonen L', 'Eriksson JE']","['Turku Centre for Biotechnology, University of Turku and Abo Akademi University, FIN-20521 Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'K562 Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein']",2003/01/31 04:00,2003/03/06 04:00,['2003/01/31 04:00'],"['2003/01/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/06 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.4.1278-1291.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Feb;23(4):1278-91. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.4.1278-1291.2003.,,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,PMC141136,,,,,,,,

We investigated how inhibition of glucose metabolism could affect death receptor-mediated apoptosis in human tumor cells of diverse origin. We show that both substitution of glucose for pyruvate and treatment with 2-deoxyglucose enhanced apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, CD95 agonistic antibody, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Inhibition of glucose metabolism enhanced killing of myeloid leukemia U937, cervical carcinoma HeLa, and breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells upon death receptor ligation. Caspase activation, mitochondrial depolarization, and cytochrome c release were increased under these conditions. Glucose deprivation-mediated sensitization to apoptosis was prevented in MCF-7 cells overexpressing BCL-2. Interestingly, the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4, a prototype for mitochondria-independent death receptor-induced apoptosis, was also sensitized to anti-CD95 and TRAIL-induced apoptosis under glucose-free conditions. Changes in c-FLIP(L) and cFLIPs levels were observed in some but not all the cell lines studied following glucose deprivation. Glucose deprivation enhanced death receptor-triggered formation of death-inducing signaling complex and early processing of procaspase-8. Altogether, these results suggest that the glycolytic pathway may be an important target for therapeutic intervention to sensitize tumor cells to selectively toxic soluble death ligands or death ligand-expressing cells of the immune system by facilitating the activation of initiator caspase-8.","['Munoz-Pinedo, Cristina', 'Ruiz-Ruiz, Carmen', 'Ruiz de Almodovar, Carmen', 'Palacios, Carmen', 'Lopez-Rivas, Abelardo']","['Munoz-Pinedo C', 'Ruiz-Ruiz C', 'Ruiz de Almodovar C', 'Palacios C', 'Lopez-Rivas A']","['Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Calle Ventanilla 11, 18001 Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Deoxyglucose/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Precursors/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Glucose/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Pyruvates/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology/*physiology', 'U937 Cells', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",2003/01/31 04:00,2003/07/04 05:00,['2003/01/31 04:00'],"['2003/01/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M212392200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)64645-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Apr 11;278(15):12759-68. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M212392200.

To assess the possibility that risks from radionuclide exposures may be underestimated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Risk estimates following internal exposures can be made for a small number of alpha-particle-emitting nuclides. (1) Lung cancer in underground miners exposed by inhalation to radon-222 gas and its short-lived progeny. Studies of residential (222)Rn exposure are generally consistent with predictions from the miner studies. (2) Liver cancer and leukaemia in patients given intravascular injections of Thorotrast, a thorium-232 oxide preparation that concentrates in liver, spleen and bone marrow. (3) Bone cancer in patients given injections of radium-224, and in workers exposed occupationally to (226)Ra and (228)Ra, mainly by ingestion. (4) Lung cancer in Mayak workers exposed to plutonium-239, mainly by inhalation. Liver and bone cancers were also seen, but the dosimetry is not yet sufficiently good enough to provide quantitative estimates of risks. Comparisons can be made between risk estimates for radiation-induced cancer derived for radionuclide exposure and those derived for the A-bomb survivors, exposed mainly to low-LET (linear energy transfer) external radiation. Data from animal studies, using dogs and rodents, allow comparisons of cancer induction by a range of alpha- and beta-/gamma-emitting radionuclides. They provide information on relative biological effectiveness (RBE), dose-response relationships, dose-rate effects and the location of target cells for different malignancies. RESULTS: For lung and liver cancer, the estimated values of risk per Sv for internal exposure, assuming an RBE for alpha-particles of 20, are reasonably consistent with estimates for external exposure to low-LET radiation. This also applies to bone cancer when risk is calculated on the basis of average bone dose, but consideration of dose to target cells on bone surfaces suggests a low RBE for alpha-particles. Similarly, for leukaemia, the comparison of risks from alpha-irradiation ((232)Th and progeny) and external radiation suggest a low alpha RBE; this conclusion is supported by animal data. Risk estimates for internal exposure are dependent on the assumptions made in calculating dose. Account is taken of the distribution of radionuclides within tissues and the distribution of target cells for cancer induction. For the lungs and liver, the available human and animal data provide support for current assumptions. However, for bone cancer and leukaemia, it may be that changes are required. Bone cancer risk may be best assessed by calculating dose to a 50 micro m layer of marrow adjacent to endosteal (inner) bone surfaces rather than to a single 10 micro m cell layer as currently assumed. Target cells for leukaemia may be concentrated towards the centre of marrow cavities so that the risk of leukaemia from bone-seeking radionuclides, particularly alpha emitters, may be overestimated by the current assumption of uniform distribution of target cells throughout red bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: The lifetime risk estimates considered here for exposure to internally deposited radionuclides and to external radiation are subject to uncertainties, arising from the dosimetric assumptions made, from the quality of cancer incidence and mortality data and from aspects of risk modelling; including variations in baseline rates between populations for some cancer types. Bearing in mind such uncertainties, comparisons of risk estimates for internal emitters and external radiation show good agreement for lung and liver cancers. For leukaemia, the available data suggest that the assumption of an alpha-particle RBE of 20 can result in overestimates of risk. For bone cancer, it also appears that current assumptions will overestimate risks from alpha-particle-emitting nuclides, particularly at low doses.","['Harrison, J D', 'Muirhead, C R']","['Harrison JD', 'Muirhead CR']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot OX11 0RQ, UK. john.harrison@nrpb.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Liver Neoplasms/etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Plutonium/adverse effects', 'Radium/adverse effects', 'Radon/adverse effects', 'Thorium Dioxide/adverse effects']",2003/01/31 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2003/01/31 04:00'],"['2003/01/31 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/31 04:00 [entrez]']",['EB92MKAX91BELLWK [pii]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2003 Jan;79(1):1-13.,,94,"['53023GN24M (Plutonium)', '9XA7X17UQC (Thorium Dioxide)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)', 'W90AYD6R3Q (Radium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The mean knee extension strength, ankle dorsiflexion strength, and TUG measures for children with ALL before DI were significantly less than the means for the controls. The mean dorsiflexion strength measures for the children with ALL after 4 weeks of DI therapy were significantly lower than at time zero. Correlation of -0.794 (P = 0.05) was found between knee extension strength and TUG score for children with ALL.

The human polyomavirus JC virus (JCV) has been discussed as a candidate virus, but its presence has not been demonstrated in leukemia cells from children with ALL. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate if prenatal human polyomavirus infection could still indirectly be correlated to the development of childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: Fifty-four Guthrie cards (stored, dried blood spots filter papers, routinely collected from newborns for different screening analyses), collected at 3-5 days of age, from Swedish children who subsequently developed ALL, as well as from 37 healthy controls, were investigated by nested PCR for the presence of human polyomaviruses JCV and BK virus (BKV). RESULTS: JCV and BKV DNA were not detected in any of the Guthrie cards from ALL patients or from healthy controls, although all tested samples had amplifiable DNA as confirmed by an HLA DQ PCR. CONCLUSIONS: JCV or BKV were not found in any of the dried blood spots of children who later developed ALL or in the healthy controls. These findings suggest that it is unlikely that childhood ALL is associated with an in utero infection with JCV or BKV, although it is not possible to exclude an association with an in utero infection that has become latent in the kidneys with very low levels of circulating virus at birth.","['Priftakis, Peter', 'Dalianis, Tina', 'Carstensen, John', 'Samuelsson, Ulf', 'Lewensohn-Fuchs, Ilona', 'Bogdanovic, Gordana', 'Winiarski, Jacek', 'Gustafsson, Britt']","['Priftakis P', 'Dalianis T', 'Carstensen J', 'Samuelsson U', 'Lewensohn-Fuchs I', 'Bogdanovic G', 'Winiarski J', 'Gustafsson B']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Viral/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'JC Virus/*genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polyomavirus Infections/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications']",2003/01/30 04:00,2003/03/12 04:00,['2003/01/30 04:00'],"['2003/01/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/12 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10246 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Apr;40(4):219-23. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10246.,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter breakpoint was the same as that identified in three monocytic cell lines carrying t(10;11).

The patient was treated with the protocol MAQ, which comprised mitoxantrone, aracytine, and quinine, as her blasts expressed the p-glycoprotein, but she failed to obtain remission. A second treatment with the same protocol resulted in only minimal response. The patient was treated again with high-dose Ara-C and idarubicine in an attempt to achieve a response before allogeneic unrelated transplantation, but she did not respond to the treatment and died shortly thereafter.

We assessed the role of ethnicity controlling for other known prognostic factors on treatment outcome and survival in this population. Older age, high leukocyte count at diagnosis, and high-risk chromosomal aberrations were significantly associated with overall survival in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis high leukocyte count and high-risk chromosomal aberrations exerted an independent negative effect on survival. European origin was associated with longer event-free survival in univariate analysis (P = 0.024) and longer overall (P < 0.01) and event-free (P < 0.01) survival but not with a higher remission rate in multivariate analysis.

Whether women have less access to stem cell transplantation (SCT) is not known. We evaluated allogeneic SCT data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) and compared them with disease incidence data from the Surveillance and Epidemiologic End Results (SEER) database. We estimated the ratio of males to females among transplanted patients with acute lymphoblastic (ALL), acute myelogenous (AML) and chronic myelogenous (CML) leukemia, diseases for which SCT is often done and compared them to male/female ratios of disease incidence. The association between gender and SCT was estimated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). There was no association between gender (male vs female) and the rates of SCT for individuals with AML (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.89-1.02), or CML (OR = 1.0; CI = 0.90-1.1). Among patients with newly diagnosed ALL, more males underwent SCT than females (OR = 1.30, CI = 1.18-1.44). Because children with newly diagnosed ALL usually have a favorable prognosis, SCT is not generally a frontline therapy. Therefore, when we compared SCT rates to a population of children with relapsed ALL, the gender differences disappeared (OR = 1.09, CI = 0.94-1.25). We conclude that for the diagnoses where SCT is commonly used, there is no significant bias towards use in males compared to females. While boys with ALL appear to receive SCT at a higher rate, this difference is likely attributable to biological rather than social reasons.","['Mehta, Paulette', 'Pollock, Brad H', 'Nugent, Melodee', 'Horowitz, Mary', 'Wingard, John R']","['Mehta P', 'Pollock BH', 'Nugent M', 'Horowitz M', 'Wingard JR']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA.

Congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia are principal categories of SCN. Since 1994, the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) has collected data to monitor the clinical course, treatments, and disease outcomes for SCN patients. This report summarizes data for 853 patients, almost all treated with daily or alternate-day recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF or Filgrastim). G-CSF treatment increased the ANC overall from 0.34 x 10(9)/L +/- 0.018 pre-treatment to 3.70 x 10(9)/L +/- 0.18 during the first year of treatment. For most patients, the responses were durable with patients remaining on the same dose of G-CSF for many years. Long-term hematological observations showed stable mean leukocyte and neutrophil counts and gradually increasing hemoglobin levels. Thrombocytopenia developed in 4% of patients. As of January 1, 2000, myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has occurred in 35 of 387 patients with congenital neutropenia with a cumulative risk of 13% after 8 years of G-CSF treatment. This event occurred without a predictable relationship to the duration or dose of G-CSF treatment. No patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia developed MDS or AML. Other important adverse events included hepatomegaly, osteoporosis, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and deaths in 4 of 14 cases requiring splenectomy. Growth and development and the outcome of pregnancy appeared to be unaffected by G-CSF treatment. These data indicate that congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia can be effectively treated with long-term G-CSF. The risk of leukemia, osteoporosis, other potentially adverse events, and pregnancy outcome need to be further evaluated with continuing long-term observations.","['Dale, David C', 'Cottle, Tammy E', 'Fier, Carol J', 'Bolyard, Audrey Anna', 'Bonilla, Mary Ann', 'Boxer, Laurence A', 'Cham, Bonnie', 'Freedman, Melvin H', 'Kannourakis, George', 'Kinsey, Sally E', 'Davis, Robert', 'Scarlata, Debra', 'Schwinzer, Beate', 'Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Welte, Karl']","['Dale DC', 'Cottle TE', 'Fier CJ', 'Bolyard AA', 'Bonilla MA', 'Boxer LA', 'Cham B', 'Freedman MH', 'Kannourakis G', 'Kinsey SE', 'Davis R', 'Scarlata D', 'Schwinzer B', 'Zeidler C', 'Welte K']","['Department of Medicine, Box 356422, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. dcdale@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Growth', 'Humans', 'Hypertrophy', 'Infant', 'Internationality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pregnancy', '*Registries', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/01/30 04:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/01/30 04:00'],"['2003/01/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10255 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2003 Feb;72(2):82-93. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10255.,,50,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

JNK activation occurred in HL-60/neo, HL-60/bcl-x(L), and in HL-60 cells pretreated with the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, indicating that JNK activation is not dependent on ajoene-induced mitochondria perturbation and subsequent caspase activation. Cells overexpressing a dominant-negative JNK showed no altered sensitivity towards ajoene suggesting that the activation of JNK is not necessary for ajoene-induced cell death. Inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB 203580 had no influence on ajoene-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of ERK1/2 vastly enhanced ajoene-induced cell death. The survival kinase Akt, in contrast, did not participate in ajoene-induced death signaling as shown by the use of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Thus in contrast to the previous findings regarding stress-induced cell death, ajoene-mediated activation of JNK and p38 has no impact on ajoene-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Blockade of ERK1/2 but not Akt pathways leads to sensitization of cells against ajoene-mediated apoptosis supporting the view that inhibition of ERK1/2 is a valuable strategy to increase the sensitivity of promyeloleukemic cells towards ajoene.","['Antlsperger, Dorothee S M', 'Dirsch, Verena M', 'Ferreira, Dulce', 'Su, Jen-Liang', 'Kuo, Ming-Liang', 'Vollmar, Angelika M']","['Antlsperger DS', 'Dirsch VM', 'Ferreira D', 'Su JL', 'Kuo ML', 'Vollmar AM']","['Department of Pharmacy, Center of Drug Research, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Sulfoxides']",2003/01/30 04:00,2003/02/14 04:00,['2003/01/30 04:00'],"['2003/01/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/14 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206161 [doi]', '1206161 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Jan 30;22(4):582-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206161.,,,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '99A0041VG8 (ajoene)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allelotyping at polymorphic loci was performed on purified material, allowing unequivocal detection of allelic loss and homozygous deletions. Six AML-M0 patients shared a common region of LOH harboring a single gene: RUNX1 (AML1), the most frequent site of translocations in acute leukemia and a well-known fusion oncogene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization allowed the identification of deletions with breakpoints within RUNX1 in two patients as the cause of LOH. In the four others the LOH pattern and the presence of two karyotypically normal chromosomes 21 were in line with mitotic recombination. Further molecular and cytogenetic analyses showed that this caused homozygosity of primary RUNX1 mutations: two point mutations, a partial deletion and, most significantly, a complete deletion of RUNX1. These findings identify RUNX1 as a classical TSG: both alleles are mutated or absent in cancer cells from four of the 17 AML-M0 patients examined. In contrast to AML-M0, the AML-M1 patient was trisomic for chromosome 21 and has two mutated and one normal RUNX1 allele, suggesting that the order of mutagenic events leading to leukemia may influence the predominant tumor type.","['Silva, Fernando P G', 'Morolli, Bruno', 'Storlazzi, Clelia T', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Wessels, Hans', 'Bezrookove, Vladimir', 'Kluin-Nelemans, Hanneke C', 'Giphart-Gassler, Micheline']","['Silva FP', 'Morolli B', 'Storlazzi CT', 'Anelli L', 'Wessels H', 'Bezrookove V', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'Giphart-Gassler M']","['Department of Radiation Genetics and Chemical Mutagenesis, Leiden University Medical Center, P.O.

These data suggest that restriction factors in human and non-human primate cells are able to recognize and block infection by multiple, widely divergent retroviruses and that the factors themselves may be related.","['Hatziioannou, Theodora', 'Cowan, Simone', 'Goff, Stephen P', 'Bieniasz, Paul D', 'Towers, Greg J']","['Hatziioannou T', 'Cowan S', 'Goff SP', 'Bieniasz PD', 'Towers GJ']","['Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and the Rockefeller University, 455 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Animals', 'Carbon-Oxygen Lyases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Viral', '*DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase', 'HIV-1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/metabolism']",2003/01/30 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2003/01/30 04:00'],"['2003/01/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/cdg042 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2003 Feb 3;22(3):385-94. doi: 10.1093/emboj/cdg042.,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 4.2.- (Carbon-Oxygen Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (APEX1 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (Apex1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)']",,,,"['R01 AI050111/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI50111/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC140727,,,,,,,,

Deletion of SOCS3 causes an embryonic lethality that is rescued by a tetraploid rescue approach, demonstrating an essential role in placental development and a non-essential role in embryo development. Rescued SOCS3-deficient mice show a perinatal lethality with cardiac hypertrophy. SOCS3-deficient placentas have reduced spongiotrophoblasts and increased trophoblast secondary giant cells. Enforced expression of SOCS3 in a trophoblast stem cell line (Rcho-1) suppresses giant cell differentiation. Conversely, SOCS3-deficient trophoblast stem cells differentiate more readily to giant cells in culture, demonstrating that SOCS3 negatively regulates trophoblast giant cell differentiation. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promotes giant cell differentiation in vitro, and LIF receptor (LIFR) deficiency results in loss of giant cell differentiation in vivo. Finally, LIFR deficiency rescues the SOCS3-deficient placental defect and embryonic lethality. The results establish SOCS3 as an essential regulator of LIFR signaling in trophoblast differentiation.","['Takahashi, Yutaka', 'Carpino, Nick', 'Cross, James C', 'Torres, Miguel', 'Parganas, Evan', 'Ihle, James N']","['Takahashi Y', 'Carpino N', 'Cross JC', 'Torres M', 'Parganas E', 'Ihle JN']","[""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biochemistry, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Embryo, Mammalian/physiology', 'Gestational Age', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocardium/pathology', 'Placenta/cytology/metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Distribution', '*Transcription Factors', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/*metabolism']",2003/01/30 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2003/01/30 04:00'],"['2003/01/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/cdg057 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2003 Feb 3;22(3):372-84. doi: 10.1093/emboj/cdg057.,,,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,PMC140741,,,,,,,,

Machine learning models, such as neural networks, have been applied to discover genes and expression patterns. This process is achieved by implementing training and test phases. In the training phase, a set of cases and their respective labels are used to build a classifier. During testing, the classifier is used to predict new cases. One approach to assessing its predictive quality is to estimate its accuracy during the test phase. Key limitations appear when dealing with small-data samples. This paper investigates the effect of data sampling techniques on the assessment of neural network classifiers. RESULTS: Three data sampling techniques were studied: Cross-validation, leave-one-out, and bootstrap. These methods are designed to reduce the bias and variance of small-sample estimations. Two prediction problems based on small-sample sets were considered: Classification of microarray data originating from a leukemia study and from small, round blue-cell tumours. A third problem, the prediction of splice-junctions, was analysed to perform comparisons. Different accuracy estimations were produced for each problem. The variations are accentuated in the small-data samples. The quality of the estimates depends on the number of train-test experiments and the amount of data used for training the networks. CONCLUSION: The predictive quality assessment of biomolecular data classifiers depends on the data size, sampling techniques and the number of train-test experiments. Conservative and optimistic accuracy estimations can be obtained by applying different methods. Guidelines are suggested to select a sampling technique according to the complexity of the prediction problem under consideration.","['Azuaje, Francisco']",['Azuaje F'],"['School of Computing and Mathematics, University of Ulster, Jordanstown, Nothern Ireland, UK. fj.azuaje@ulster.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,IM,"['Computational Biology/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Data Collection/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Entropy', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genomics/*methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*genetics', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA Splice Sites/genetics', '*Sampling Studies']",2003/01/30 04:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/01/30 04:00'],"['2002/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1471-2105-4-5 [doi]'],ppublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2003 Jan 28;4:5. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-4-5.

METHODS: Demographic information, response to therapy and survival of patients (>14 years of age) admitted between January 1988 to August 1996 with acute myeloid leukaemia was retrieved and analysed. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were admitted with a diagnosis of AML during the study period. There were 43 males and 31 females. Age ranged between 15 and 70 years with a mean age of 38 years. The most common presenting feature was fever (67.5%) and the morphological subtype according to French-American-British Group (FAB) criteria was M4. Fifty-five patients received treatment and were evaluable for response and outcomes. Thirty-six (65.4%) patients had complete remission. Sixteen (29.1%) died during the first 28 days after starting induction chemotherapy. The median survival was 11 months. Six (11%) patients (4 females, 2 males) are surviving beyond 4 years (long-term survivors). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the long-term outcomes of adults with AML are comparable to what has been reported in the literature for patients who do not receive bone marrow transplants.","['Kakepoto, G N', 'Burney, I A', 'Zaki, S', 'Adil, S N', 'Khurshid, M']","['Kakepoto GN', 'Burney IA', 'Zaki S', 'Adil SN', 'Khurshid M']","['Department of Pathology, The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Pak Med Assoc,JPMA.

Resources used included the medical literature as well as personal communications with radiology experts. Dose estimates for each procedure based on this database are reported. Methods and complications are contrasted with a past effort to estimate dose from dental radiography for a case-control study of parotid gland tumors. Among the more difficult aspects of medical radiography dose estimation are the wide variety of examinations performed, the continually-changing environment of diagnostic imaging, and the number of variables that contribute to the delivered dose to an individual from a specific imaging procedure.","['Preston-Martin, Susan', 'Pogoda, Janice M']","['Preston-Martin S', 'Pogoda JM']","['Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California (USC), Department of Preventive Medicine, USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1441 Eastlake Avenue, MS 44, P.O.

Thus, intensified chemotherapy strategies are required. The application of hyperthermia enhances the efficacy of certain antineoplastic drugs such as ifosfamide. In this study, the effects and molecular mechanisms of ifosfamide (4hydroperoxy-ifosfamide = 4OOH-IFA)- and/or hyperthermia-induced cell death are investigated in CEM cells. Hyperthermia enhanced the efficacy of 4OOH-IFA in a subaddictive manner. Analysis of caspase activation revealed an early hyperthermia-induced stimulation of caspase-3 and -6 directly after the heating pulse, while maximum activation following stimulation with 4OOH-IFA was obtained after 24 hours of culture. The combination of 4OOH-IFA and hyperthermia mediated an overaddictive caspase stimulation directly following the heating phase. At this time also an overaddictive cytotoxic effect was noticed, being mainly responsible for the enhancing effects of hyperthermia on 4OOH-IFA cytotoxicity. In conclusion, hyperthermia enhanced the cytotoxic effect of 4OOH-IFA on CEM cells by stimulation of an early 4OOH-IFA effect. Thus, thermochemotherapy might be considered as an intensifying treatment option in relapsed T cell leukemias.","['Mauz-Korholz, C', 'Dietzsch, S', 'Banning, U', 'Trobs, R B', 'Korholz, D']","['Mauz-Korholz C', 'Dietzsch S', 'Banning U', 'Trobs RB', 'Korholz D']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany. mauc@medizin.uni-leipzig.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 6', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hyperthermia, Induced/*methods', 'Ifosfamide/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*therapy']",2003/01/30 04:00,2003/03/08 04:00,['2003/01/30 04:00'],"['2003/01/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/08 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 Nov-Dec;22(6C):4243-7.,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '39800-28-7 (hydroperoxyisophosphamide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functionality of Notch signalling was tested using HES1 gene activation. SEL1 gene product has been postulated to be a negative regulator of Notch signalling. We investigated the relationship between Notch signalling and the expression of SEL1L gene in a number of leukaemia and lymphoma cells in culture. The cell lines could be separated into two groups. Group 1 contained lymphoma cell lines in which Notch signalling was intact; of these 4 cell lines were SEL1L+/HES1- and 3 SEL1L-/HES1-. Notch signalling was not subverted by EBNA2 expression in these lymphoma cells. In Group 2 cell lines Notch signalling was constitutively active but 6 out of 7 cell lines expressed SEL1L at high levels. In summary, a majority of cell lines of both groups express SEL1L and no inverse relationship is evident between SEL1L expression and the status of Notch signalling. The present investigation therefore suggests that SEL1L may not exert a negative regulatory influence on Notch signalling.

The Y8 cell line had been previously shown to have an increased apoptotic response to a variety of agents that included DNA damaging agents, kinase inhibitors and drugs directed at NFkappa B activation. In this study we show that lactacystin (LC, an inhibitor of proteasome activity) in combination with parthenolide (PA) caused a synergistic increase in the apoptotic fraction of the Y8 cells. LC (2.5 microM) alone and PA (5.0 microM) caused less than 20% of the Y8 cells to undergo apoptosis. However, the combination of LC (2.5 microM) plus PA (5.0 microM) caused 60% of the Y8 cells to undergo apoptosis. The combination of drugs had no effects on the parental wild-type L1210 cells. Pretreatment of the intact Y8 cells with the caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, resulted in a marked decrease in the apoptosis caused by the LC plus PA combination. Cell-free extracts prepared from the LC plus PA combination-treated cells had activated caspase activities in the caspase cascade: caspase-3 >> caspase-8 > caspase-6 and caspase-10. These results suggest that there are interacting pathways involving aspects of NFkappa B activation and proteasome activity that could be exploited in therapy directed at p53-deficient tumor cells that would lead to caspase-3 activation and apoptosis bypassing the p53-dependent chemotherapy insensitivity.","['Cory, Ann H', 'Cory, Joseph G']","['Cory AH', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis']",2003/01/30 04:00,2003/03/08 04:00,['2003/01/30 04:00'],"['2003/01/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/08 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 Nov-Dec;22(6C):3805-9.,,,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the true incidence of non-hepatocellular malignancies remains ill defined. We performed a retrospective cohort study to identify a possible association between hereditary hemochromatosis and the development of non-hepatocellular carcinomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After appropriate institutional review board approval, an extensive chart review was completed on all patients with hereditary hemochromatosis diagnosed between 1986 and 2001. The diagnosis was based on either a genetic study to identify the Cys282Tyr and the His63Asp mutations on the HLA-H gene and/or hepatic tissue diagnosis, in conjunction with a treatment history of therapeutic phlebotomy. Data collection also included documentation of associated malignancies, the presence of co-morbid medical illnesses, and risk factors for cancer. Our database was age-standardized to the United States population using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program data to obtain a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of non-hepatocellular malignancies in our study population. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (49 males, 10 females) with a mean age of 46 years (range: 10-68 years) met the criteria for the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. Of these, 13 patients (22%) had a biopsy-proven diagnosis of a primary non-hepatocellular malignancy giving an age-adjusted SIR of 1.40 (p < 0.04). Histologically, the types of malignancy included: 3 patients with colorectal cancer; 2 patients with gastric carcinoma, 3 patients with prostate cancer; 2 patients with breast cancer; 1 patient with acute myelogenous leukemia, one patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma and one patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSION: While an association between hemochromatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is well-described, there also appears to be a relationship between hemochromatosis and the development of non-hepatocellular malignancies. Since increased iron stores alone have not been proven to be premalignant in recent studies, interplay between genetic factors in hemochromatosis may play a role as a risk factor in the development of an associated malignancy. Larger cohorts of subjects with hereditary iron overload disorders are needed to confirm our findings. Furthermore, if a causal association between hemochromatosis and common carcinomas does indeed exist, such patients may be candidates for individualized, rigorous cancer screening programs.","['Geier, Debra', 'Hebert, Brian', 'Potti, Anil']","['Geier D', 'Hebert B', 'Potti A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of North Dakota School of Medicine, 1919, N Elm Street, Fargo, ND 58102, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hemochromatosis/*complications/epidemiology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2003/01/30 04:00,2003/02/25 04:00,['2003/01/30 04:00'],"['2003/01/30 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/30 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2002 Nov-Dec;22(6B):3797-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uptake and potential cytotoxic mechanisms.,3765-76,"Dimethylsilane tetramines are structural analogues of spermine with a (CH3)2 Si-group incorporated into the central carbon chain. They have potential as anticancer drugs. Their cytotoxic effect was considered to rely mainly on their polyamine antagonist property. In order to obtain new ideas about cellular mechanisms, which are potential targets of the dimethylsilane polyamines, the effects of these compounds on some basic cell functions, such as protein and DNA synthesis, and calmodulin antagonism were studied. In addition, their mode of accumulation in cells was investigated. It became evident that the intracellular accumulation of dimethylsilane polyamines is almost exclusively achieved via the polyamine transport system. However, the exchange of a part of the intracellular natural polyamines against dimethylsilane polyamines has only a small effect on polyamine uptake. Binding to the endoplasmic reticulum and inhibition of protein synthesis are presumably important for the cytotoxic action of bis(11-amino-4,8-diazaundecyl)dimethylsilane, a hexamine, but seem of no importance for the tetramines.

Besides the high risk of blood-borne infections associated with multiple transfusions, the increased susceptibility of these patients to infectious diseases has been attributed to a coexistent immune deficiency. Immune abnormalities have also been held responsible for the frequent occurrence of malignancies in beta-thalassemia, especially leukemia and lymphomas. Recent studies on immune competence in beta-thalassemia have revealed numerous quantitative and functional defects, involving T and B lymphocytes, immunoglobulin production, neutrophils and macrophages, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis, as well as the complement system. Regarding pathogenesis, iron overload, a primary complication of both thalassemia itself and transfusion therapy, is thought to be the main precipitating mechanism, due to the important immunoregulatory properties of iron and its binding proteins; iron excess may derange the immune balance in favor of the growth of infectious organisms. Other factors include multiple transfusions, associated with constant allo-antigenic stimulation, as well as with transmission of immunosuppressive viruses; splenectomy, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections by encapsulated bacteria and to immune system modifications; low levels of zinc, another immune regulator; iron chelation therapy, which predisposes to serious infections by yersinia species; and the circulation of abnormal native thalassemic erythrocytes, forming another permanent immune stimulus. Thus surveillance for infections in patients with beta-thalassemia is crucial, while further studies are warranted on immune function abnormalities and the implicated mechanisms.","['Farmakis, Dimitrios', 'Giakoumis, Anastasios', 'Polymeropoulos, Evaggelos', 'Aessopos, Athanasios']","['Farmakis D', 'Giakoumis A', 'Polymeropoulos E', 'Aessopos A']","['1st Department of Internal Medicine, Laiko General Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Athens, Athens, Greece. dfarm@panafonet.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/etiology', 'Iron/metabolism', 'beta-Thalassemia/complications/*immunology/*pathology']",2003/01/29 04:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/01/29 04:00'],"['2003/01/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [entrez]']",['2991 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2003 Jan;9(1):RA19-22.,,33,['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, after decades of debate many issues remain unsettled. The aim of our study was to estimate the distribution of tubulin in etoposide-induced HL-60 cells and address the question of whether the reorganization of tubulin may be involved in apoptosis. MATERIAL/METHODS: HL-60 cells were incubated with etoposide (0.02-200 mM/L) for 72 hours. Tubulin was estimated by the indirect immunofluorescence method. TRITC-labeled goat anti rabbit IgG was used to label tubulin. RESULTS: Significant changes occurred in cell morphology of and tubulin organization at 200 mM/L etoposide: large cells, brightly labeled for tubulin, in cytoplasm. At 200 uM/L etoposide, we also observed an increase in apoptotic cells with bright staining for tubulin at the site of apoptotic body formations. Cells with features of apoptosis were frequently seen also at 20 mM/L etoposide. The exposure of cells to 0.02, 0.2, or 2 mM/L etoposide did not result in any visible changes in morphology or tubulin organization. Cell size, the number of viable cells, and the percentage of apoptotic cells correlated significantly with the dose of etoposide (p<0.001).

We have now generated a conditional knockout of SCL by using CreLox technology and an IFN-inducible Cre transgenic mouse. Deletion of SCL in adult mice perturbed megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis with the loss of early progenitor cells in both lineages. This led to a blunted response to the hematopoietic stress induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, with a persistently low platelet count and hematocrit compared with controls. In contrast, progenitors of granulocyte and macrophage lineages were not affected, even in the setting of stress. Immature progenitor cells (day 12 colony-forming unit spleen) with multilineage capacity were still present in the SCL null bone marrow, but these progenitors had lost the capacity to generate erythroid and megakaryocyte cells, and colonies were composed of only myeloid cells. These results suggest that SCL is critical for megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis, but is dispensable for production of myeloid cells during adult hematopoiesis.","['Hall, Mark A', 'Curtis, David J', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Elefanty, Andrew G', 'Sourris, K', 'Robb, Lorraine', 'Gothert, Joachim R', 'Jane, Stephen M', 'Begley, C Glenn']","['Hall MA', 'Curtis DJ', 'Metcalf D', 'Elefanty AG', 'Sourris K', 'Robb L', 'Gothert JR', 'Jane SM', 'Begley CG']","['Rotary Bone Marrow Research Laboratory, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria 3050, Australia. hall@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Spleen/cytology/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism/*physiology']",2003/01/29 04:00,2003/03/19 04:00,['2003/01/29 04:00'],"['2003/01/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0237324100 [doi]', '0237324100 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Feb 4;100(3):992-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0237324100.

We determined the structure of FeLV-B RBD, which has FeLIX activity, to a 2.5-A resolution by X-ray crystallography. The structure of the receptor-specific subdomain of this glycoprotein differs dramatically from that of Friend murine leukemia virus (Fr-MLV), which binds a different cell surface receptor. Remarkably, we find that Fr-MLV RBD also activates FeLV-T infection of cells expressing the Fr-MLV receptor and that FeLV-B RBD is a competitive inhibitor of infection under these conditions. These studies suggest that FeLV-T infection relies on the following property of mammalian leukemia virus RBDs: the ability to couple interaction with one of a variety of receptors to the activation of a conserved membrane fusion mechanism. A comparison of the FeLV-B and Fr-MLV RBD structures illustrates how receptor-specific regions are linked to conserved elements critical for postbinding events in virus entry.","['Barnett, Anna L', 'Wensel, David L', 'Li, Weihua', 'Fass, Deborah', 'Cunningham, James M']","['Barnett AL', 'Wensel DL', 'Li W', 'Fass D', 'Cunningham JM']","[""Department of Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry']",2003/01/29 04:00,2003/03/15 04:00,['2003/01/29 04:00'],"['2003/01/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/15 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.4.2717-2729.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Feb;77(4):2717-29. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.4.2717-2729.2003.,,,"['0 (Fr-RBD protein, Friend murine leukemia virus)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (feline leukemia virus receptor)']",,,,,,,PMC141074,,,,,,['PDB/1LCS'],,

Notably, several characteristics of their particle replication strategies are more similar to those of hepatitis B virus (HBV) than those of typical retroviruses. Compared to conventional retroviruses, which require only Gag proteins for budding and release of virus-like particles (VLPs), both FV and HBV require Env proteins. In the case of HBV, Env (S protein) alone is sufficient to form subviral particles (SVPs). Because FVs also depend on Env for budding, we tested whether FV Env alone could produce SVPs. The Env proteins of FV and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) were both released into cell culture supernatants and migrated into isopycnic gradients; however, unlike MuLV Env, FV Env displayed characteristics of SVPs. FV Env particles were of greater density than those of MuLV (1.11 versus 1.07 g/ml, respectively), which strongly suggested that the released proteins of FV Env were particulate. When we examined FV SVPs by immunoelectron microscopy, we found particles that were consistent in morphology, size, and staining with gold beads, similar to FV VLPs and unlike the particle-like structures of MuLV Env, which were more consistent with vesicles produced from nonspecific membrane ""blebbing."" Taken together, our results demonstrated that FV Env alone is sufficient for particle budding.

To aid the diagnosis of such aberrations, and possibly disease monitoring, we established an interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for the affected breakpoint region. DESIGN AND METHODS: Several overlapping PAC (P1-derived artificial chromosome) clones centromeric to the EVI-1 gene were labeled with a red fluorescent dye, and PAC clones telomeric to EVI-1 with a green fluorochrome. This dual-color probe was hybridized to cytogenetic preparations of cell lines and patients' samples, which were also investigated for the presence of 3q26 rearrangements by chromosome banding analysis. RESULTS: In nuclei without 3q26 rearrangements, two pairs of co-localized red and green signals were observed, while separation of one red/green signal pair or splitting of one red or one green signal was found when 3q26 aberrations were present. The threshold value for true positivity, as determined on 20 samples from patients with myeloid malignancies without 3q26 rearrangements, was 10.2% for separation of one red/green signal pair, and 1% and 1.3% for splitting of one red or one green signal, respectively. In 17 samples from patients with a 3q26 aberration, the percentage of aberrant cells was significantly above these threshold levels.

However, a high proportion of patients show normal or intermediate-risk karyotypes. In these patients, other determinants could help to identify those with a higher risk of relapse. Recently, internal tandem duplications (ITD) and D835 mutations in FLT3 tyrosine kinase receptor have been shown to confer a bad prognosis in AML. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the incidence of these mutations in a total of 208 patients of different AML subsets and their prognostic relevance in non-promyelocytic de novo AML. RESULTS: FLT3 mutations were detected in 24% of de novo AML, 42% of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 17% of secondary AML. Four patients showed both ITD and D835 mutations. Ninety-four per cent of the patients with FLT3 alterations were classified into the intermediate-risk group. There was no association between the presence of FLT3 alterations and response to induction while the alterations were associated with a worse disease-free survival and event-free survival in both the overall and intermediate-risk patients.

The aim of this study was to define the long-term risk of thrombosis, acute leukemia (AL) and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) in young PV patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1975 to 2000, 70 PV patients aged less than 50 years were followed for a median time of 14 years (range 2-26). About three quarters were treated with pipobroman. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression were used for survival analysis. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated using Italian age/sex specific mortality rates. RESULTS: The risk of thrombosis increased during the observation period, reaching a plateau of 14% at 10 years and was markedly higher in individuals with a previous history of thrombosis (p=0.0023). No patient had progression into AL or MMM before the 9th year of follow-up. Subsequently, five patients (7%) developed AL and five (7%) MMM, with a 20-year cumulative risk of 15% and 10%, respectively. Overall survival at 20 years was 62%, with nine patients dying of progression into AL or MMM, four of vascular events, one of lung cancer, and four of non-PV-related causes. The SMR was 5.3, indicating a mortality significantly higher than that of the general population (p<0.000). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This long-term retrospective cohort study shows that although the median survival of young patients with PV exceeds 23 years, their life expectancy is markedly lower than that of the general population because of disease evolution into AL or MMM.","['Passamonti, Francesco', 'Malabarba, Lucia', 'Orlandi, Ester', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Canevari, Angelo', 'Brusamolino, Ercole', 'Bonfichi, Maurizio', 'Arcaini, Luca', 'Caberlon, Sabrina', 'Pascutto, Cristiana', 'Lazzarino, Mario']","['Passamonti F', 'Malabarba L', 'Orlandi E', 'Barate C', 'Canevari A', 'Brusamolino E', 'Bonfichi M', 'Arcaini L', 'Caberlon S', 'Pascutto C', 'Lazzarino M']","['Division of Hematology, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Italy f.passamonti@smatteo.pv.it']",['eng'],"['Comment', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Polycythemia Vera/*complications/mortality', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombosis/*etiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2003/01/29 04:00,2003/06/12 05:00,['2003/01/29 04:00'],"['2003/01/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Jan;88(1):13-8.,,,,['Haematologica. 2003 Jan;88(1):1-4.

However, the dose dependency of this observation has not been explored. Here, we used NaHCO(3) and HCl to produce a predictable concentration of CO(2) within the culture medium. Using 1 MHz continuous wave 4 W/cm(2) ultrasound, we sonicated U937 cells suspension for 1 min at 37 degrees C with CO(2) at different concentrations. At 2 mM, reduced cell killing was observed that further decreased with increasing CO(2) concentration until 100% protection was attained at 20 mM. Ultrasound-induced free-radical production was significantly decreased at 1 mM and became undetectable at 2 mM CO(2). This finding shows that CO(2)-mediated inhibition is concentration dependent and that the threshold for free-radical production is one order of magnitude higher than the threshold for cell killing induced by ultrasound. In addition, it also cautions researchers when adding acids and acid-based agents to a culture medium, which almost always contains NaHCO(3), in experiments related to the bioeffects of ultrasound.","['Feril, Loreto B Jr', 'Kondo, Takashi', 'Ogawa, Ryohei', 'Zhao, Qing-Li']","['Feril LB Jr', 'Kondo T', 'Ogawa R', 'Zhao QL']","['Department of Radiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Ultrason Sonochem,Ultrasonics sonochemistry,9433356,IM,"['Carbon Dioxide/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Free Radicals/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultrasonics']",2003/01/29 04:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2003/01/29 04:00'],"['2003/01/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1350-4177(02)00122-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s1350-4177(02)00122-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Ultrason Sonochem. 2003 Mar;10(2):81-4. doi: 10.1016/s1350-4177(02)00122-0.,,,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the discrimination of leukemic promyelocytes and regenerating promyelocytes by morphology is sometimes difficult. Although PML/RARA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can help, the major drawback of FISH is its high false positive rate, which reaches up to 5-10%. We used RARA FISH at the initial diagnosis (16 cases) and follow-up of APL patients (21 cases) with t(15;17), though RARA FISH was originally designed to detect translocations involving the RARA gene rather than t(15;17), and compared the results with those of PML/RARA FISH. A reference range for PML/RARA and RARA FISH was set using 50 normal control specimens. Using a RARA split probe, we were able to lower the reference range for RARA rearrangement down to 1.5%, which is significantly lower than that of PML/RARA (8%). Actually 74.2% (46/62 cases) of cases with positive signals of the PML/RARA rearrangement by the PML/RARA probe, showed absolutely negative results with the RARA split probe. By conducting RARA FISH, we were able to significantly resolve the difficulty in interpreting results around cut-off value in PML/RARA FISH. In conclusion, we believe that once the PML/RARA rearrangement is confirmed either by G-banding or FISH, RARA FISH is more effective than PML/RARA during the follow-up of APL after treatment.","['Lee, Dong Soon', 'Lee, Yun Song', 'Kim, Young Ree', 'Han, Kyu Sup', 'Park, Kyoung Un', 'She, Cha Ja', 'Kim, Eu Chong', 'Park, Sun Yang', 'Cho, Han Ik']","['Lee DS', 'Lee YS', 'Kim YR', 'Han KS', 'Park KU', 'She CJ', 'Kim EC', 'Park SY', 'Cho HI']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. soonlee@plaza.snu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Blood Cells/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow Cells/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Disease Progression', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2003/01/29 04:00,2003/02/25 04:00,['2003/01/29 04:00'],"['2003/01/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460802006192 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00619-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2002 Dec;139(2):104-8. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00619-2.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As coordination between two allelic counterparts is well exemplified by synchrony in replication timing, we examined, in blood cells of patients suffering from various hematologic malignancies, replication patterns of five loci. These loci were three cancer-implicated genes (TP53, AML1, and RB1) and two nontranscribed sequences engaged in chromosome segregation. All five loci normally display synchrony in allelic replication timing. In addition, in order to exemplify an asynchronous mode of allelic replication, we followed the replication of allelic counterparts of an imprinted gene (SNRPN), which is distinguished by its asynchronous mode of allelic replication (allele-specific replication). Allelic replication patterns were studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which has been shown to distinguish between nonreplicated and replicated regions of the genome in interphase cells, based on the structure of the specific hybridization signals that are being detected. Using the FISH replication assay we observed, for all loci which normally exhibit synchrony in allelic replication, loss of synchrony when present in blood cells of patients with hematologic malignancies. The loss of synchrony in allelic replication in patients' cells was accompanied by aneuploidy (chromosome losses and gains), the hallmark of cancer. We were able to reinstate the normal pattern of replication in the patients' cells by introducing an inhibitor of DNA methylation. It thus appears loss of allelic coordination is an epigenetic alteration characterizing cancer, which is easily identified by simple cytogenetic means and has a potential use in both cancer investigation and detection.","['Korenstein-Ilan, Avital', 'Amiel, Aliza', 'Lalezari, Shadan', 'Lishner, Michael', 'Avivi, Lydia']","['Korenstein-Ilan A', 'Amiel A', 'Lalezari S', 'Lishner M', 'Avivi L']","['Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Alleles', '*Aneuploidy', 'Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Segregation/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Genes, p53', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*blood/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2003/01/29 04:00,2003/02/25 04:00,['2003/01/29 04:00'],"['2003/01/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460802006106 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00610-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2002 Dec;139(2):97-103. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00610-6.,,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TP53 and 11q deletions were only present in a proportion of the clonal B-cells, which suggests that they are secondary events in B-CLL.","['Doneda, Luisa', 'Montillo, Marco', 'Intropido, Liliana', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Morra, Enrica', 'Larizza, Lidia']","['Doneda L', 'Montillo M', 'Intropido L', 'Tedeschi A', 'Morra E', 'Larizza L']","['Department of Biology and Genetics Medical Faculty, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. lidia.larrizza@unimi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/ultrastructure', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Interphase', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/ultrastructure', 'Prognosis']",2003/01/29 04:00,2003/03/04 04:00,['2003/01/29 04:00'],"['2003/01/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/04 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460802006404 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00640-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2003 Jan 1;140(1):31-6. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00640-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the gp130 cytokine family, is involved in osteoarticular tissue metabolism and might participate in osteogenesis. Immunohistochemical staining showed that LIF is expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes and vascular sprouts of cartilage and bone during rat and human osteogenesis. LIF is also present in osteoblasts but not in osteoclasts. Observations in a rat endochondral ossification model were confirmed by studies of human cartilage biopsies from foetuses with osteogenesis imperfecta.

Previous studies have suggested that these differences may be related to the histologic diagnosis, but this issue has not as yet been demonstrated. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients admitted with acute leukemia (AL) or lymphoma (ML) from 1988 to 1998. Incidence of bacteremia was calculated for the following subgroups: acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), AML following refractory anaemia with excess blasts (AML-RAEB), high-grade ML (HGML), intermediate-grade ML (IGML), low-grade ML (LGML) and indeterminate ML (IML). Kaplan-Meier curves of time to the first positive blood culture were constructed and compared by means of log-rank test. RESULTS: In the period covered there were 244 new diagnoses of AL or ML: 62 AML, 32 ALL, 20 AML-RAEB, 78 HGML, 7 IGML, 37 LGML and 6 IML. At the end of the study period, 44 patients were alive, 147 were known to have died at a certain date and 53 had been formally lost to follow-up (most of them, transferred for hospice care). Among 684 blood cultures, there were 51 contaminations and 155 significant isolates. Among the latter, gram-positive bacteria were isolated in 74 and gram-negative bacteria in 47; in 27 cases more than 1 bacterial species were recovered. Fungi were isolated in 7 cases. The incidence of bacteremia expressed as cases per 1000 patient-days was 5.80 for AML, 5.03 for AML-RAEB, 1.56 for ALL, 0.21 for HGML and 0.40 for the remaining ML. Time to the first positive blood culture was significantly shorter for AML than for any other group, and was shorted for ALL and AML-RAEB than for ML. CONCLUSION: Differences in the incidence of bacteremia were observed among histologically-defined groups of unselected patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Teira, Ramon', 'Lizarralde, Eva', 'Santamaria, Juan M', 'Zubero, Zurine', 'Munoz, Pepa', 'Baraiaetxaburu, Josu', 'Olabarria, Itziar', 'Ezpeleta, Carmen', 'Beltran de Heredia, Jose M', 'Cisterna, Ramon']","['Teira R', 'Lizarralde E', 'Santamaria JM', 'Zubero Z', 'Munoz P', 'Baraiaetxaburu J', 'Olabarria I', 'Ezpeleta C', 'Beltran de Heredia JM', 'Cisterna R']",['Servicios de Enfermedades Infecciosas.

The patterns of the karyotype alterations may provide insights into the genetic pathways of disease progression. RESULTS: We developed a simplified computer readable cytogenetic notation (SCCN) by which chromosome findings are normalised at a resolution of 400 bands. Lost or gained chromosomes or chromosome segments are specified in detail, and ranges of chromosome breakpoint assignments are recorded. Software modules were written to summarise the recorded chromosome changes with regard to the respective chromosome involvement. To assess the degree of karyotype alterations the ploidy levels and numbers of numerical and structural changes were recorded separately, and summarised in a complex karyotype aberration score (CKAS). The SCCN and CKAS were used to analyse the extend and the spectrum of additional chromosome aberrations in 94 patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph-positive) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and secondary chromosome anomalies. Dosage changes of chromosomal material represented 92.1% of all additional events. Recurring regions of chromosome losses were identified. Structural rearrangements affecting (peri)centromeric chromosome regions were recorded in 24.6% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: SCCN and CKAS provide unifying elements between karyotypes and computer processable data formats. They proved to be useful in the investigation of additional chromosome aberrations in Ph-positive ALL, and may represent a step towards full automation of the analysis of large and complex karyotype databases.","['Bradtke, Jutta', 'Balz, Harald', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Heinze, Barbara', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Mohr, Brigitte', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Rieder, Harald']","['Bradtke J', 'Balz H', 'Fonatsch C', 'Heinze B', 'Jauch A', 'Mohr B', 'Schoch C', 'Rieder H']","['Institute of Clinical Genetics, Philipps-University, Bahnhofstrabetae 7, Marburg, 35037, Germany. bradtke@mailer.uni-marburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations/statistics & numerical data', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Computer Graphics/statistics & numerical data', 'Cytogenetics/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Isochromosomes/genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2003/01/29 04:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/01/29 04:00'],"['2002/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1471-2105-4-4 [doi]'],ppublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2003 Jan 28;4:4. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-4-4.

Because attempts to develop a suitable mass spectrometry assay for TPA were unsuccessful (because of the lack of sufficient sensitivity), we developed a novel and highly sensitive blood level bioassay for TPA that measures ethyl acetate-extractable differentiating activity in blood. Differentiating activity in ethyl acetate extracts of blood was measured in HL-60 cells by measuring the formation of adherent cells. The sensitivity of the assay was approximately 0.1 ng TPA/ml blood. The assay for TPA has a high degree of specificity and does not measure deesterifed potential metabolites (phorbol, phorbol-13-acetate, or phorbol-12-myristate), and the presence of GM-CSF, G-CSF, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma does not interfere with the assay. Blood levels of TPA as measured by the bioassay immediately after an IV infusion of TPA (0.125 mg/m2; approximately 0.25 mg per patient) and 1 and 3 h later were 1.75 +/- 0.55, 0.93 +/- 0.54, and 0.69 +/- 0.42 ng/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD from eight infusions in five patients). Terminal half-lives were determined in a few patients where TPA blood levels were measured at multiple time intervals after the TPA infusion. In these patients, the terminal half-life was 11.1 +/- 3.9 h (from five infusions in four patients). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytical method for the measurement of TPA.","['Cui, Xiao Xing', 'Chang, Richard L', 'Zheng, Xi', 'Woodward, Donald', 'Strair, Roger', 'Conney, Allan H']","['Cui XX', 'Chang RL', 'Zheng X', 'Woodward D', 'Strair R', 'Conney AH']","['Susan Lehman Cullman Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Chemical Biology, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8020, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,IM,"['Biological Assay/*methods', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Drug Stability', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/administration & dosage/*blood/*pharmacokinetics']",2003/01/29 04:00,2003/08/26 05:00,['2003/01/29 04:00'],"['2003/01/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 2002;13(3):169-74.,,,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two tumors lacking receptors for progesterone and estrogen [methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma (MC-C) and spontaneous lymphoid leukemia (LB)] exhibited slow kinetics throughout the course of pregnancy, although inhibition was stronger beyond day 10. On the other hand, one of two tumors bearing receptors for progesterone and estrogen [medroxyprogesterone (MPA)-induced mammary adenocarcinoma (C7HI)] exhibited three phases: up to days 8-10 of gestation the tumor grew faster than in virgins, between days 8-10 and 15 it reached a plateau, and beyond day 15 a sharp reduction in tumor mass was observed. The other tumor [mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-induced mammary carcinoma(T2280)] behaved as a typical pregnancy-dependent tumor (i.e., it grew in pregnant but not in virgin mice, regressed soon after delivery, and reassumed its growth at the middle of a second round of pregnancy). Neither MPA nor estrogen affected MC-C and LB tumor growth. On the other hand, MPA-treated mice enhanced C7HI tumor and reciprocally C7HI tumor-bearing mice treated with estrogen strongly inhibited tumor growth. As for T2280, neither MPA nor estrogen alone could promote tumor growth and, in consequence, no tumor developed. However, when MPA plus estrogen was administered in a schedule simulating the successive appearance of these hormones in pregnancy, T2280 grew even faster than in pregnant mice. When the four tumors were implanted in mice bearing grafts of embryonal tissues (teratomas), all of them were inhibited. This antitumor effect was similar to that observed in pregnancy when tumors unresponsive to progesterone and estrogen were tested. On the other hand, with tumors bearing progesterone and estrogen receptors, differences in tumor growth were detected in pregnant and teratoma-bearing mice. This suggested the existence during pregnancy of two factors potentially acting on tumor growth. First, a progesterone and estrogen-mediated hormonal component, which would exert either inhibitory or stimulatory effects only evidenced with tumors bearing hormonal receptors. Secondly, an antitumor effect proportional to the growing embryonal mass, inhibiting all tumors independently of their origin or hormone responsiveness. This antitumor effect could be attributed to a beat-resistant serum factor (1,000-1,200 Da molecular weight) presumably associated with the pathway of the arachidonic acid metabolism. The interplay between the hormonal component and the serum factor associated with embryonal mass could account for some of the largely heterogeneous and otherwise unexplained effects of pregnancy on tumor growth reported in the literature and illustrated by the four tumors studied here.","['Bustuoabad, Oscar D', 'di Gianni, Pedro D', 'Franco, Marcela', 'Kordon, Edith C', 'Vanzulli, Silvia I', 'Meiss, Roberto P', 'Grion, Lorena C', 'Diaz, Graciela S', 'Nosetto, Sergio H', 'Hockl, Pablo', 'Lombardi, M Gabriela', 'Pasqualini, Christiane Dosne', 'Ruggiero, Raul A']","['Bustuoabad OD', 'di Gianni PD', 'Franco M', 'Kordon EC', 'Vanzulli SI', 'Meiss RP', 'Grion LC', 'Diaz GS', 'Nosetto SH', 'Hockl P', 'Lombardi MG', 'Pasqualini CD', 'Ruggiero RA']","['Division Medicina Experimental, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas y Centro de Estudios Oncologicos, Academia Nacional de Medicina.

However, the binding patterns between hydroxyurea-induced and uninduced HEL cells were different. Furthermore, by using Western-blot analysis, our data showed that the amount of GATA-2 was decreased in hydroxyurea-induced HEL cells. In contrast to GATA-2, the amount of GATA-1 was increased in hydroxyurea-induced HEL cells. These results showed that the different members of GATA family might play different roles during the differentiation of erythrocytes.

In addition, MCF-7 human breast cancer cell growth was also promoted by AFP and inhibited by anti-AFP antibody. Because AFP cell-surface receptors have been detected in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and AFP could also be produced and secreted by MCF-7 cells, the possibility may be considered: AFP may bind with its receptors on tumor cell membrane for the purposes of growth stimulation.","['Wang, X W', 'Xie, H']","['Wang XW', 'Xie H']","['Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao,Shi yan sheng wu xue bao,0413570,IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/immunology/*pharmacology']",2003/01/29 04:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/01/29 04:00'],"['2003/01/29 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/29 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao. 1999 Mar;32(1):15-22.,,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 51 children in the study were under 15 years and being treated for leukemia in hospitals affiliated with the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) where their parents were interviewed using a questionnaire to ascertain their emotional responses to the illness. The data are analyzed and reported in five domains: perceived illness; psychological impact; coping strategies; family relationships; socio-economic impact. A strengthening of family bonds was found the most common response (82.4%). The second most common responses were concern for the expenses incurred by the illness and the time dedicated to caring for the sick child (both 78.4%). It is especially important to assess families with meager social and financial resources as to their emotional responses to life-threatening illness because these limitations impose greater burdens and make coping more difficult.

This epigenetic modification has been associated with gene silencing, malignant transformation, and aging. It is not known whether there are epigenetic differences between pediatric patients and adult patients with ALL. METHODS: To investigate the methylation characteristics of pediatric patients with ALL and to determine whether DNA methylation can explain prognostic or biologic differences between pediatric and adult patients, the authors analyzed the methylation status of 7 promoter-associated CpG islands in 16 pediatric patients with ALL and compared them with the methylation characteristics of a cohort of adult patients with ALL. The genes analyzed included the estrogen receptor gene (ER), multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), p15, C-ABL, CD10, p16, and p73. RESULTS: The mean methylation densities of ER, MDR1, CD10, p15, and C-ABL were 25.4%, 16.4%, 5.23%, 4.24%, and 4%, respectively. P16 was methylated in 11.7% of patients, and p73 was methylated in 17.6% of patients. One patient (6.2%) had methylation of 0 genes, 15 patients (93.7%) had methylation of >/= 1 gene, and 4 patients (25%) had methylation of 3-4 genes. Methylation of all these genes was < 2% (or methylation specific polymerase chain reaction negative) in nonneoplastic tissues. A significant inverse correlation was observed between methylation of CD10 and CD10 expression. No differences were observed between the methylation characteristics of pediatric patients and adult patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that DNA methylation is common in pediatric patients with ALL and that methylation of the genes studied does not account for prognostic differences between pediatric patients and adult patients with ALL.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Daniel, Jerry', 'Williamson, Jason', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Garcia-Manero G', 'Jeha S', 'Daniel J', 'Williamson J', 'Albitar M', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

However, in approximately 25% of patients, the disorder has been found to evolve into a multiple myeloma (MM). The mechanism leading to the evolution of MGUS remains unknown. The aim of the current study was, first, to assess by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) the incidence of numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 6, 9, 13, and 17 in MGUS patients and to compare it with that found in MM and PC leukemia (PCL) patients and, second, to explore the potential heterogeneity of the pathologic PC in MGUS as a way to identify unique cytogenetic patterns different from those frequently observed in MM and PCL. METHODS: Numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 6, 9, 13, and 17 were investigated by dual- and triple-color FISH in bone marrow PC from 208 patients corresponding to MGUS (n = 30), MM (n = 158), and PCL (n = 20) cases. In MGUS and MM patients with < 10% PC, both normal and phenotypically aberrant PC were discriminated by multiparameter flow cytometry, the latter subset being specifically sorted for FISH analysis with a purity of 93% +/- 6%. RESULTS: Overall, 57% of the MGUS patients displayed abnormalities for at least 1 of the 4 chromosomes analyzed compared with 75% of both MM and PCL cases. The most common single chromosome abnormalities detected in MGUS were gains of chromosomes 9 (23%) and/or 6 (21%) and loss of chromosomes 13 (21%) and/or 17 (17%). Compared with MM patients, MGUS patients were found to have both a lower incidence of gains of chromosome 9 (23% vs. 54%, P = 0.002) and monosomy 13/13q(-) deletions (21% vs. 38%, P = 0.07); with respect to PCL cases, MGUS patients were found to have a lower incidence of monosomy 13/13q(-) deletions (21% vs. 75%, P < 0.001) together with a slightly higher frequency of gains of both chromosomes 6 (21% vs. 0%, P = 0.05) and 9 (23% vs. 7%, P = 0.1). The simultaneous use of two or three different chromosome probes showed that within the purified compartment of phenotypically aberrant PC from most MGUS patients (67%), more than 1 PC clone could be identified. In contrast, the incidence of 2 or more PC clones was much lower in MM (19%, P < 0.001) and PCL (15%, P = 0.003). Interestingly, although some FISH patterns were shared by both groups of diseases (i.e., monosomy 13/13q(-) deletions alone, gains of chromosome 9 alone or together with trisomy 6), others were found almost exclusively in either MGUS (i.e., a clone with monosomy 6 and/or 17 together with nuclei displaying a normal chromosome number) or in MM (i.e., monosomy 13/13q(-) deletions together with gains of chromosome 6 and/or 9). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the results of the current study showed that MGUS patients displayed a high incidence of numerical alterations, which are usually associated with the presence of more than one tumor cell clone. It is interesting to note that the cytogenetic patterns observed in the aneuploid PC clones from MGUS patients were frequently different from those observed in both MM and PCL.","['Rasillo, Ana', 'Tabernero, Maria Dolores', 'Sanchez, Maria Luz', 'Perez de Andres, Martin', 'Martin Ayuso, Marta', 'Hernandez, Jose', 'Moro, Maria Jesus', 'Fernandez-Calvo, Javier', 'Sayagues, Jose Maria', 'Bortoluci, Aglae', 'San Miguel, Jesus Fernando', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Rasillo A', 'Tabernero MD', 'Sanchez ML', 'Perez de Andres M', 'Martin Ayuso M', 'Hernandez J', 'Moro MJ', 'Fernandez-Calvo J', 'Sayagues JM', 'Bortoluci A', 'San Miguel JF', 'Orfao A']","['Servicio General de Citometria, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aneuploidy', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'Paraproteinemias/*genetics/pathology']",2003/01/28 04:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11100 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Feb 1;97(3):601-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11100.,,,,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11100'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although BMT is associated with increased event free survival compared with intensive chemotherapy (CT) consolidation, BMT also is associated with increased treatment-related mortality and likely decreased quality of life and life expectancy in patients who do not develop recurrent disease. METHODS: The authors used decision analysis to compare three strategies for maximizing quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in patients with AML in first remission with an MSD: BMT All, BMT None (consolidation CT only), or BMT in high-risk patients, as defined by baseline cytogenetic testing (Test strategy). A second decision-analysis tree was then constructed that compared BMT with CT specifically for patients with intermediate cytogenetics. RESULTS: Using expected QALYs as the outcome measure, the Test, BMT All, and BMT None strategies were associated with 20.10 QALYs, 19.63 QALYs, and 18.38 QALYs, respectively. Thus, the Test strategy, with CT for low-risk patients and BMT for intermediate risk and high-risk patients, was expected to be the optimal strategy. In the intermediate cytogenetic decision analysis, although the expected QALY for BMT recipients was higher compared with CT recipients (19.78 QALYs vs. 18.75 QALYs), because of uncertainty in variable estimates, the optimal choice was less clear. CONCLUSIONS: CT consolidation is a reasonable option for patients with AML who have favorable cytogenetics, even if an MSD is available. This model provides a framework from which patients with AML and their physicians can make decisions about consolidation therapy.","['Sung, Lillian', 'Buckstein, Rena', 'Doyle, John J', 'Crump, Michael', 'Detsky, Allan S']","['Sung L', 'Buckstein R', 'Doyle JJ', 'Crump M', 'Detsky AS']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. lillian.sung@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytogenetics', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*therapy', 'Probability', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2003/01/28 04:00,2003/02/13 04:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/13 04:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11098 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Feb 1;97(3):592-600. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11098.,,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11098'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Success may depend in part on a simple anti-xenoresponse. Using hCEA-transfected syngeneic tumor cells in hCEA-transgenic mice should bypass this problem and allow testing for new vaccination strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established a hCEA transgenic model of the haplotype H2(d), which may differ from other haplotypes in cytokine production and in effectiveness of antigen presentation, and tested two vaccination protocols in wild-type and transgenic mice. RESULTS: Syngeneic wild-type mice built up an immune response with high antibody titers; only 65% of animals developed solid tumors after tumor challenge. In contrast, hCEA-transgenic mice developed no antibody response and accepted the tumor in more than 90% of cases, thus demonstrating the role of human CEA as a foreign antigen. Accordingly, active immunization using tumor lysate or lymphocytes loaded with hCEA resulted in a CTL response and tumor-rejection in up to 80% of wild-type mice. hCEA-transgenic mice could be induced with both immunization protocols to build up a CTL response, although the number of CTL were much lower and the cytotoxic response weaker than in wild-type mice. In vivo hCEA-transgenic mice rejected hCEA-positive tumors only after immunization with the tumor lysate in about 60% whereas there was no rejection of tumors after immunization with the human hCEA-loaded autologous lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: The findings clearly show the importance of transgenic models when testing the effects of immunization towards human tumor associated antigens such as hCEA because results differ in wild-type and transgenic mice.","['Muders, M', 'Ghoreschi, K', 'Suckfuell, M', 'Zimmermann, W', 'Enders, G']","['Muders M', 'Ghoreschi K', 'Suckfuell M', 'Zimmermann W', 'Enders G']","['Institute for Surgical Research, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, Marchioninistrasse 27, 81366 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Int J Colorectal Dis,International journal of colorectal disease,8607899,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antibody Formation', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/*immunology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vaccination']",2003/01/28 04:00,2003/06/07 05:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2002/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00384-002-0421-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Colorectal Dis. 2003 Mar;18(2):153-9. doi: 10.1007/s00384-002-0421-8.

In the present study we compared the abilities of three such analogs, 24a, 24b-dihomo-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (PRI-1890), 24-ene-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(2) (PRI-1906) and (24R)-1,24-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (PRI-2191) to induce markers (CD14, CD11b and MSE) of differentiation, G(1) phase block, and associated molecular events in human promyeloblastic leukemia cells HL60. We found that the potencies of the analogs to induce differentiation paralleled their activation of Erk, JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and the anti-proliferative activity closely correlated with the extent of hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Interestingly, low concentrations of derivatives of vitamin D, which were insufficient to induce any detectable changes in the cell cycle traverse, markedly increased the levels of total pRb, which was highly phosphorylated. These results suggest that pRb may have an unsuspected role in monocytic differentiation, perhaps to increase the sensitivity of the G(1) checkpoint, by increasing the amount of substrate for cyclin-dependent kinases.","['Ji, Yan', 'Kutner, Andrzej', 'Verstuyf, Annemieke', 'Verlinden, Lieve', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Ji Y', 'Kutner A', 'Verstuyf A', 'Verlinden L', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ergocalciferols/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology']",2003/01/28 04:00,2003/08/14 05:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['09160265 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.1.6.269 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2002 Nov-Dec;1(6):410-5. doi: 10.4161/cc.1.6.269.,,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,['R01-CA44722-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Because the differentiation process requires cell cycle arrest (e.g., in G(1)), the possibility arises that CDK inhibitors might potentiate the maturation response of neoplastic cells to various differentiation-inducing agents. However, recent findings indicate that contrary to expectations, pharmacologic CDK inhibitors fail to promote differentiation, at least in human leukemia cells; instead, they antagonize the maturation process and induce dysregulation of various cell cycle and apoptotic regulatory proteins that culminate in mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. A brief summary of the events that might contribute to these phenomena in human leukemia cells follows below. A better understanding of interactions between putative differentiation-inducers and cell cycle inhibitors may provide the foundation for the future development of novel chemotherapeutic strategies in hematopoietic and possibly non-hematopoietic malignancies.","['Grant, Steven', 'Dent, Paul']","['Grant S', 'Dent P']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, USA. stgrant@hsc.vcu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology']",2003/01/28 04:00,2003/08/14 05:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10210275 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.1.6.260 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2002 Nov-Dec;1(6):383-8. doi: 10.4161/cc.1.6.260.,,92,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Specific localization of immune T cells to the antigen-positive tumor was detected over time, by sequential imaging of the same animals. Naive T cells did not localize to the tumor site, indicating that preimmunization was required. Autoradiography and immunohistochemistry analysis corroborated the microPET data.

Here, we present the first evidence that Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)) is a crucial molecular determinant in activation of SOC channels and store-operated Ca(2+) entry pathway. Using molecular, imaging, and electrophysiological techniques, we show that directed molecular or pharmacological impairment of the functional activity of iPLA(2) leads to irreversible inhibition of CCE mediated by nonselective SOC channels and by Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels. Transfection of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) with antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides for iPLA(2) impaired thapsigargin (TG)-induced activation of iPLA(2) and TG-induced Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) influx. Identical inhibition of TG-induced Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) influx (but not Ca(2+) release) was observed in SMC, human platelets, and Jurkat T-lymphocytes when functional activity of iPLA(2) was inhibited by its mechanism-based suicidal substrate, bromoenol lactone (BEL). Moreover, irreversible inhibition of iPLA(2) impaired TG-induced activation of single nonselective SOC channels in SMC and BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)-induced activation of whole-cell CRAC current in rat basophilic leukemia cells. Thus, functional iPLA(2) is required for activation of store-operated channels and capacitative Ca(2+) influx in wide variety of cell types.","['Smani, Tarik', 'Zakharov, Sergey I', 'Leno, Endri', 'Csutora, Peter', 'Trepakova, Elena S', 'Bolotina, Victoria M']","['Smani T', 'Zakharov SI', 'Leno E', 'Csutora P', 'Trepakova ES', 'Bolotina VM']","['Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/cytology', 'Blood Platelets/cytology/*enzymology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism', 'Group VI Phospholipases A2', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Manganese/pharmacokinetics', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/cytology/*enzymology', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Pyrones/pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats']",2003/01/28 04:00,2003/05/20 05:00,['2003/01/28 04:00'],"['2003/01/28 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M210878200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)64774-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Apr 4;278(14):11909-15. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M210878200.
