It has a unique clinical course, being preceded by a pre-leukaemic condition known as transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM), and provides an excellent model to study multistep leukaemogenesis. Both TAM and ML-DS blasts carry acquired N-terminal truncating mutations in the erythro-megakaryocytic transcription factor GATA1. These result in exclusive production of a shorter isoform (GATA1s). The majority of TAM cases resolve spontaneously without the need for treatment; however, around 10% acquire additional cooperating mutations and transform to leukaemia, with differentiation block and clinically significant cytopenias. Transformation is driven by the acquisition of additional mutation(s), which cooperate with GATA1s to perturb normal haematopoiesis.",['(c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.'],"['Garnett, Catherine', 'Cruz Hernandez, David', 'Vyas, Paresh']","['Garnett C', 'Cruz Hernandez D', 'Vyas P']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9386-0485'],"['MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.', 'MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.', 'MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.']",['eng'],"['MC_UU_00016/11/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/11/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '109187/Z/15/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/L008963/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1000729/94931/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U137961146/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1000729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191126,England,IUBMB Life,IUBMB life,100888706,['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Down Syndrome/genetics/*pathology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', '*Mutation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Gata1', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*cohesin', '*trisomy 21']",2019/11/27 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2019/11/27 06:00'],"['2019/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/iub.2197 [doi]'],ppublish,IUBMB Life. 2020 Jan;72(1):119-130. doi: 10.1002/iub.2197.

ATLL is a rare but extremely aggressive malignancy that can be challenging to diagnose. Very little data exist on the incidence patterns of ATLL in the United States. METHODS: ATLL cases reported to the National Program of Cancer Registries, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, and the New York State Cancer Registry were used for the study. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated by age, race/ethnicity, sex, and year of diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate was compared among race/ethnicity groups with the SEER data. RESULTS: During 2001-2015, 2148 ATLL cases were diagnosed in the United States, 18% of which were in New York State. New York State had the highest incidence rate for ATLL, with a rising trend especially among non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs), whereas the incidence was stable across the remainder of the United States. NHBs were diagnosed at a younger median age (54 years) and had a shorter overall survival (6 months). In New York City, only 22.6% of the ATLL cases diagnosed were born in North America. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest epidemiological study of ATLL in the United States and shows a rising incidence in New York City. NHBs have a younger age at presentation and poor overall survival. The rising incidence is largely due to NHBs originating from the Caribbean.",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],"['Shah, Urvi A', 'Shah, Nishi', 'Qiao, Baozhen', 'Acuna-Villaorduna, Ana', 'Pradhan, Kith', 'Adrianzen Herrera, Diego', 'Sica, R Alejandro', 'Shastri, Aditi', 'Mantzaris, Ioannis', 'Derman, Olga', 'Kornblum, Noah', 'Braunschweig, Ira', 'Ye, B Hilda', 'Verma, Amit', 'Janakiram, Murali']","['Shah UA', 'Shah N', 'Qiao B', 'Acuna-Villaorduna A', 'Pradhan K', 'Adrianzen Herrera D', 'Sica RA', 'Shastri A', 'Mantzaris I', 'Derman O', 'Kornblum N', 'Braunschweig I', 'Ye BH', 'Verma A', 'Janakiram M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8419-1091', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3650-0800']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'New York State Cancer Registry, New York State Department of Health, Albany, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Epidemiology & Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20191126,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'New York City/epidemiology', 'North America/epidemiology', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Epidemiology', '*National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR)', '*New York', '*New York State Cancer Registry (NYSCR)', '*Surveillance', '*United States', '*adult T cell', '*and End Results (SEER)', '*epidemiology', '*human T-cell leukemia virus', '*leukemia/lymphoma', '*non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*survival']",2019/11/27 06:00,2020/08/13 06:00,['2019/11/27 06:00'],"['2019/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32556 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Feb 1;126(3):567-574. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32556.

However, Ara-C suffers from high hydrophilicity, rapid plasma degradation and significant side effects. Thus, herein, to eliminate the limitations of Ara-C in the treatment of leukemia, Sgc8 aptamer targeting and glutathione (GSH)-responsive polymeric micelles (PCL-ss-Ara@Sgc8-BSA) were prepared. The prodrug was synthesized via covalent bond formation between acryloyl chloride-terminal PCL-ss-PCL and Ara-C, and surface decoration with Sgc8-bovine serum albumin (Sgc8-BSA). The obtained PCL-ss-Ara@Sgc8-BSA exhibited good GSH-responsive drug release behavior, obvious targetability and sufficient antitumor effect to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells (CCRF-CEM). A hemolysis test was further carried out to demonstrate that these polymeric micelles are safe to be administrated intravenously. Compared with free Ara-C, PCL-ss-Ara@Sgc8-BSA significantly enhanced tumor growth inhibition in mice bearing CCRF-CEM xenograft tumors, while causing little side effects, and improved the survival rate of CCRF-CEM tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Therefore, this new self-assembling small molecular prodrug equipped with Sgc8 targeting function is a potential treatment for the targeted therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",,"['Fang, Zhigang', 'Wang, Xiaozhen', 'Sun, Yanling', 'Fan, Ruifang', 'Liu, Zhong', 'Guo, Rui', 'Xie, Deming']","['Fang Z', 'Wang X', 'Sun Y', 'Fan R', 'Liu Z', 'Guo R', 'Xie D']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5132-7463', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7674-073X']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510010, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510010, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510010, China.', 'Department of Prevention & Healthcare, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510010, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Bioengineering Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China. tliuzh@jnu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Biomaterials of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technological Research Center for Drug Carrier Development, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China. bme2004@126.com guorui@jnu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Biomaterials of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Guangdong Provincial Engineering and Technological Research Center for Drug Carrier Development, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China. bme2004@126.com guorui@jnu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191126,England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biocompatible Materials)', '0 (Micelles)', '0 (Polyesters)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '24980-41-4 (polycaprolactone)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Glutathione/*chemistry', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Micelles', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Particle Size', 'Polyesters/chemistry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/chemistry']",,,2019/11/27 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2019/11/27 06:00'],"['2019/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c9nr07391d [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2019 Dec 21;11(47):23000-23012. doi: 10.1039/c9nr07391d.

The goal of this study was to further identify the efficacy of bortezomib-containing regimens for PCL in Chinese patients. Materials and Methods: In this study, 56 consecutive PCL patients [14 primary PCL (pPCL) and 42 secondary PCL (sPCL) cases] were retrospectively enrolled and 42/56 patients received bortezomib-based regimens (BBRs), including 10/14 pPCL and 32/42 sPCL patients. The patients' survival data, clinical information, and safety data were collected and analyzed. Results: In pPCL and sPCL patients, the overall response rate in the bortezomib group was 90.0% and 25.0%, respectively. The median progression-free survival from PCL diagnosis for pPCL and sPCL was 8.3 months vs. 2.9 months (p=0.043) and median overall survival (OS) from PCL diagnosis was 23.3 months vs. 4.0 months. The OS for patients receiving BBRs was significantly longer for both pPCL (8.3 vs. 1.2 months, p=0.002) and sPCL (4.3 vs. 1.1 months, p<0.001). In multivariate COX analysis, BBR treatment [p=0.008, hazard ratio (HR)=0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.19-0.77] and very good partial response or better (>/=VGPR) (p=0.035, HR=0.19, 95% CI=0.04-0.74) were independent predictors of OS for sPCL patients. For pPCL patients, BBR predicted OS (p=0.029, HR=0.056, 95% CI=0.004-0.745) instead of >/=VGPR (p=0.272, HR=3.365, 95% CI=0.38-29.303).

It regulates at the transcriptional level all aspects of erythroid maturation and function, as revealed by gene knockout studies in mice and by genome-wide occupancies in erythroid cells. The GATA1 protein contains two zinc finger domains and an N-terminal transactivation domain. GATA1 translation results in the production of the full-length protein and of a shorter variant (GATA1s) lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain, which is functionally deficient in supporting erythropoiesis. GATA1 protein abundance is highly regulated in erythroid cells at different levels, including transcription, mRNA translation, posttranslational modifications, and protein degradation, in a differentiation-stage-specific manner. Maintaining high GATA1 protein levels is essential in the early stages of erythroid maturation, whereas downregulating GATA1 protein levels is a necessary step in terminal erythroid differentiation. The importance of maintaining proper GATA1 protein homeostasis in erythropoiesis is demonstrated by the fact that both GATA1 loss and its overexpression result in lethal anemia. Importantly, alterations in any of those GATA1 regulatory checkpoints have been recognized as an important cause of hematological disorders such as dyserythropoiesis (with or without thrombocytopenia), beta-thalassemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, myelodysplasia, or leukemia.

The seminal discovery of oncogenic driver mutations in colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) in the majority of patients with CNL in 2013 anchored a new scientific framework, deepening our understanding of its molecular pathogenesis, providing a diagnostic biomarker, and rationalizing the use of pharmacological targeting. DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA: In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) included the presence of activating CSF3R mutations as a central diagnostic feature of CNL. Other criteria include leukocytosis of >/=25 x 10(9) /L comprising >80% neutrophils with <10% circulating precursors and rare blasts, and absence of dysplasia or monocytosis, while not fulfilling criteria for other MPN. DISEASE UPDATES: Increasingly comprehensive genetic profiling of CNL has disclosed a complex genomic landscape and additional prognostically relevant mutational combinations. Though prognostic determination and therapeutic decision-making remain challenging, emerging data on prognostic markers and the use of newer therapeutic agents, such as JAK inhibitors, are helping to define state-of-the-art management in CNL.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Szuber, Natasha', 'Elliott, Michelle', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Szuber N', 'Elliott M', 'Tefferi A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1499-6171', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7366-9886', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4605-3821']","['Department of Hematology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191230,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CSF3R protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', '*Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'World Health Organization']",,,2019/11/27 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/11/27 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25688 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Feb;95(2):212-224. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25688.

Mutant IDH reveals an altered enzymatic activity leading to the synthesis of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which has been implicated in epigenetic mechanisms of oncogenesis. Nevertheless, it is unclear exactly how IDH mutations drive glioma initiation and progression, and it is also not clear why tumors with this mutation generally have a better prognosis than IDH wild-type tumors. Recognition of the high frequency of IDH mutations in glioma [and also in other malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cholangiocarcinoma] have led to the development of a number of targeted agents that can inhibit these enzymes. Enasidenib and ivosidenib have both gained regulatory approval for IDH mutant AML. Both agents are still in early clinical phases for glioma therapy, as are a number of additional candidates (including AG-881, BAY1436032, and DS1001). A marked clinical problem in the development of these agents is overcoming the blood-brain barrier. An alternative approach to target the IDH1 mutation is by the induction of synthetic lethality with compounds that target poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), glutamine metabolism, and the Bcl-2 family of proteins. We conclude that within the last decade, several approaches have been devised to therapeutically target the IDH1 mutation, and that, potentially, both IDH1 inhibitors and synthetic lethal approaches might be relevant for future therapies.",,"['Karpel-Massler, Georg', 'Nguyen, Trang T T', 'Shang, Enyuan', 'Siegelin, Markus D']","['Karpel-Massler G', 'Nguyen TTT', 'Shang E', 'Siegelin MD']",,"['Department of Neurosurgery, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Rm. 15-415, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Bronx Community College, City University of New York, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, P&S Rm. 15-415, New York, NY, 10032, USA. ms4169@cumc.columbia.edu.']",['eng'],"['K08 NS083732/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS095848/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS102366/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,CNS Drugs,CNS drugs,9431220,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glutarates)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography was used to analyze the chemical composition of the extract. Antioxidant activity of GTP was assessed by O2(-), OH(), DPPH(), and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay in vitro. Sixty Kunming mice were divided into 6 groups including control, model, low-, medium-, and high-doses GTP (200, 400, 800 mg/kg) and vitamin E (250 mg/kg) groups, 10 in each group. GTP and vitamin E were administered at a level of abovementioned doses twice per day for 7 days prior to exposure to a single injection of CCl4. Hepatoprotective effects of GTP were evaluated in a CCl4-induced mouse model of acute liver injury, using commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits, histopathological observation, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTPNick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and Western blot. RESULTS: GTP contained 98.56 microg gallic acid equivalents per milligram extract total polyphenols, including epicatechingallate, epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin, and epigallocatechin. Compared with the model group, low-, medium-, or high doses GTP significantly decreased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase (P<0.01). Histopathological observation confirmed that pretreatment of GTP prevented swelling and necrosis in CCl4-exposed hepatocytes. Hepatoprotective effects of low-, medium-, and high-dose GTP were associated with eliminating free radicals and improving superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity in the liver. Additionally, low-, medium-, and high-dose GTP decreased cell apoptosis in the CCl4-exposed liver (P<0.01). Phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), p53, Bcl-2 associated x protein/B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene, cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase-3 levels were downregulated compared with the model group (P<0.01).

However, the results of the two methods are sometimes inconsistent. This study was designed to analyze how to address the discordant results of FCM and RQ-PCR in AML patients undergoing chemotherapy, especially when positive FCM (FCM+) and negative NPM1m (NPM1m-) results are detected in the same sample. Our study included 93 AML patients with NPM1m positive (NPM1m+) who received chemotherapy but did not undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We monitored NPM1m and leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) by RQ-PCR and FCM, respectively, to assess MRD after each chemotherapy course. After each course of chemotherapy, all patients were classified into four groups based on the results of FCM and RQ-PCR: both negative (group 1, FCM-NPM1m-), single positive (group 2, FCM-NPM1m+; group 3, FCM+NPM1m-), or both positive (group 4, FCM+NPM1m+). The results showed that there was not a significant difference in the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) after each course of chemotherapy between group 2 and group 3.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Therapy of haematologic malignancies do not provoke an overt damage of Sertoli and Leydig cell populations, as revealed by normal levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and testosterone, but a mild primary testicular dysfunction may be observed, compensated by moderate gonadotropin elevation, during pubertal development. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Evidence exists on the deleterious effect that chemotherapy and radiotherapy have on germ cells, and some attention has been given to the effects on Leydig and Sertoli cells of the adult gonads, but information is virtually non-existent on the effects of oncologic treatment on testicular somatic cell components during childhood and adolescence. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective, analytical, observational study included 97 boys with haematological malignancies followed at two tertiary paediatric public hospitals in Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 2002 and 2015. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Clinical records of males aged 1-18 years, referred with the diagnoses of ALL, AML or NHL for the assessment of gonadal function, were eligible. We assessed serum levels of AMH and FSH as biomarkers of Sertoli cell endocrine function and testosterone and LH as biomarkers of Leydig cell function. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: All hormone levels were normal in the large majority of patients until early pubertal development. From Tanner stage G3 onwards, while serum AMH and testosterone kept within the normal ranges, gonadotropins reached mildly to moderately elevated values in up to 35.9% of the cases, indicating a compensated Sertoli and/or Leydig cell dysfunction, which generally did not require hormone replacement therapy. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Serum inhibin B determination and semen analysis were not available for most patients; therefore, we could not conclude on potential fertility impairment or identify whether primary Sertoli cell dysfunction resulted in secondary depleted spermatogenesis or whether primary germ cell damage impacted Sertoli cell function. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The regimens used in the treatment of boys and adolescents with ALL, AML or NHL in the past two decades seem relatively safe for endocrine testicular function; nonetheless, a mild primary testicular endocrine dysfunction may be observed, usually compensated by slightly elevated gonadotropin secretion by the pituitary in adolescents, and not requiring hormone replacement therapy. No clinically relevant risk factor, such as severity of the disease or treatment protocol, could be identified in association with the compensated endocrine dysfunction.

Results and conclusion: In this study, a phenyl-thiazolyl-benzoic acid derivative (PTB) was identified as a potent agonist of RXRalpha and RARalpha. PTB was characterized in nuclear receptor binding, reporter gene, cell differentiation and cell growth assays. PTB bound directly to RXRalpha and RARalpha, but not to PPARalpha, delta(beta) or gamma. PTB fully activated reporter genes with enhancer elements for RXRalpha/RXRalpha, and partially activated reporter genes with enhancer elements for RARalpha/RXRalpha, PPARdelta(beta) and PPARgamma. Furthermore, PTB induced differentiation and inhibited the growth of human APL cells. Thus, PTB is a novel dual agonist of RXRalpha and RARalpha and works as both a differentiation inducer and a proliferation inhibitor to leukemic cells.",['(c) 2019 The Author(s).'],"['Koshiishi, Chie', 'Kanazawa, Takanori', 'Vangrevelinghe, Eric', 'Honda, Toshiyuki', 'Hatakeyama, Shinji']","['Koshiishi C', 'Kanazawa T', 'Vangrevelinghe E', 'Honda T', 'Hatakeyama S']",,"['Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Pharma K.K, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Pharma K.K, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191119,England,Heliyon,Heliyon,101672560,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Biochemistry', 'Cancer research', 'Dose-response relationship', 'Drug binding', 'Hematological system', 'Molecular biology', 'Oncology', 'Retinoic acid', 'Virtual screening']",2019/11/27 06:00,2019/11/27 06:01,['2019/11/27 06:00'],"['2019/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02849 [doi]', 'S2405-8440(19)36508-9 [pii]', 'e02849 [pii]']",epublish,Heliyon. 2019 Nov 19;5(11):e02849. doi: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02849. eCollection 2019 Nov.,PMC6872757,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of the MLL1 catalytic function is associated with mixed-lineage leukemia, and antagonism of the WDR5-MLL1 interaction by small molecules has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for MLL-rearranged cancers. Small molecule binders of the ""WIN"" site of WDR5 that cause displacement from chromatin have been additionally implicated to be of broader use in cancer treatment. In this study, a fragment screen with Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) was used to identify a highly ligand-efficient imidazole-containing compound that is bound in the WIN site. The subsequent medicinal chemistry campaign-guided by a suite of high-resolution cocrystal structures with WDR5-progressed the initial hit to a low micromolar binder. One outcome from this study is a moiety that substitutes well for the side chain of arginine; a tripeptide containing one such substitution was resolved in a high resolution structure (1.5 A) with a binding mode analogous to the native tripeptide. SPR furthermore indicates a similar residence time (k d = approximately 0.06 s(-1)) for these two analogs. This novel scaffold therefore represents a possible means to overcome the potential permeability issues of WDR5 ligands that possess highly basic groups like guanidine.

Homeobox (Hox) genes balance self-renewal, proliferation, cell death, and differentiation in many tissues and aberrant Hox gene expression can create a predisposition to leukemogenesis in hematopoietic cells. However, possible linkages between the regulatory pathways of Hox genes and miRNAs are not yet fully resolved. We identified miR-708 to be upregulated in Hoxa9/Meis1 AML inducing cell lines as well as in AML patients. We further showed Meis1 directly targeting miR-708 and modulating its expression through epigenetic transcriptional regulation. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout of miR-708 in Hoxa9/Meis1 cells delayed disease onset in vivo, demonstrating for the first time a pro-leukemic contribution of miR-708 in this context. Overexpression of miR-708 however strongly impeded Hoxa9 mediated transformation and homing capacity in vivo through modulation of adhesion factors and induction of myeloid differentiation. Taken together, we reveal miR-708, a putative tumor suppressor miRNA and direct target of Meis1, as a potent antagonist of the Hoxa9 phenotype but an effector of transformation in Hoxa9/Meis1. This unexpected finding highlights the yet unexplored role of miRNAs as indirect regulators of the Hox program during normal and aberrant hematopoiesis.",,"['Schneider, Edith', 'Pochert, Nicole',

In this study, we assessed the role of IGF2BP1 in orchestrating leukemia stem cell properties. Tumor-initiating potential, sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, and expression of cancer stem cell markers were assessed in a panel of myeloid, B-, and T-cell leukemia cell lines using gain- and loss-of-function systems, cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP), and photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) techniques. Here, we report that genetic or chemical inhibition of IGF2BP1 decreases leukemia cells' tumorigenicity, promotes myeloid differentiation, increases leukemia cell death, and sensitizes leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. IGF2BP1 affects proliferation and tumorigenic potential of leukemia cells through critical regulators of self-renewal HOXB4 and MYB and through regulation of expression of the aldehyde dehydrogenase, ALDH1A1.

Some of these patients have measurable residual disease (MRD) by BCR-ABL1 mRNA testing, and most have detectable BCR-ABL1 DNA by highly sensitive methods. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting and BCR-ABL1 DNA PCR to investigate the lineage of residual CML cells in TFR. Twenty patients in TFR for >1 year provided blood for sorting into granulocytes, monocytes, B cells, T cells, and NK cells. MRD was identified predominantly in the lymphoid compartment and never in granulocytes. B cells were more often BCR-ABL1 positive than T cells (18 vs 11/20 patients) and at higher levels (median 10(-4.9) vs 10(-5.7); P = 0.014). In 13 CML patients studied at diagnosis lymphocytes expressing BCR-ABL1 mRNA comprised a small proportion of total leukocytes. These data improve our understanding of TFR biology, since it is now clear that MRD in the blood of TFR patients need not imply the persistence of multipotent CML cells.

The objective of our study was to evaluate chimerism monitoring on the CD3-negative mononuclear cells by RQ-PCR to predict relapse of patients allografted for AML and to compare its performance with WT1 quantification. A cohort of 100 patients undergoing allogenic SCT for AML was retrospectively analyzed in a single institution. Patients without complete chimerism, defined as less than 0.01% of recipient's DNA in CD3-negative cells, had a significantly higher risk of relapse and a lower overall survival (p < 0.001). An increase in the percentage of recipient DNA in CD3-negative cells was associated with an increased risk of relapse (p < 0.001) but not with overall survival. Comparable performances between monitoring of CD3-negative cell chimerism and WT1 expression to predict relapse was observed up to more than 90 days before hematological relapse, with sensitivity of 82% and 78%, respectively, and specificity of 100% for both approaches. Quantitative specific chimerism of the CD3-negative mononuclear fraction, enriched in blastic cells, is a new and powerful tool for monitoring measurable residual disease and could be used for AML

In this work, we dissect the functional role of the HOXB-AS3 lncRNA in patients with NPM1-mutated (NPM1mut) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We show that HOXB-AS3 regulates the proliferative capacity of NPM1mut AML blasts in vitro and in vivo. HOXB-AS3 is shown to interact with the ErbB3-binding protein 1 (EBP1) and guide EBP1 to the ribosomal DNA locus. Via this mechanism, HOXB-AS3 regulates ribosomal RNA transcription and de novo protein synthesis. We propose that in the context of NPM1 mutations, HOXB-AS3 overexpression acts as a compensatory mechanism, which allows adequate protein production in leukemic blasts.",,"['Papaioannou, Dimitrios',

To identify new risk variants for B-cell ALL (B-ALL) we conducted a meta-analysis with four GWAS (genome-wide association studies), totalling 5321 cases and 16,666 controls of European descent. We herein describe novel risk loci for B-ALL at 9q21.31 (rs76925697, P = 2.11 x 10(-8)), for high-hyperdiploid ALL at 5q31.1 (rs886285, P = 1.56 x 10(-8)) and 6p21.31 (rs210143 in BAK1, P = 2.21 x 10(-8)), and ETV6-RUNX1 ALL at 17q21.32 (rs10853104 in IGF2BP1, P = 1.82 x 10(-8)). Particularly notable are the pleiotropic effects of the BAK1 variant on multiple haematological malignancies and specific effects of IGF2BP1 on ETV6-RUNX1 ALL evidenced by both germline and somatic genomic analyses. Integration of GWAS signals with transcriptomic/epigenomic profiling and 3D chromatin interaction data for these leukaemia risk loci suggests deregulation of B-cell development and the cell cycle as central mechanisms governing genetic susceptibility to ALL.",,"['Vijayakrishnan, Jayaram', 'Qian, Maoxiang', 'Studd, James B', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Kinnersley, Ben', 'Law, Philip J', 'Broderick, Peter',

Despite the clinical relevance of MRE colonization levels, we know little about how they vary in hospitalized patients and the clinical factors that determine those levels. Here, we conducted one of the largest studies of MRE fecal levels by tracking longitudinally 133 acute leukemia patients and monitoring their MRE levels over time through extensive culturing. MRE were defined as Enterobacteriaceae species that acquired nonsusceptibility to >/=1 agent in >/=3 antimicrobial categories. In addition, due to the selective media used, the MRE had to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. MRE were detected in 60% of the patients, but their fecal levels varied considerably among patients and within the same patient (>6 and 4 orders of magnitude, respectively). Multivariate analysis of clinical metadata revealed an impact of intravenous beta-lactams (i.e., meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam), which significantly diminished the fecal MRE levels in hospitalized patients. Consistent with a direct action of beta-lactams, we found an effect only when the patient was colonized with strains sensitive to the administered beta-lactam (P < 0.001) but not with nonsusceptible strains. We report previously unobserved inter- and intraindividual heterogeneity in MRE fecal levels, suggesting that quantitative surveillance is more informative than qualitative surveillance of hospitalized patients. In addition, our study highlights the relevance of incorporating antibiotic treatment and susceptibility data of gut-colonizing pathogens for future clinical studies and in clinical decision-making.",['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Djukovic, Ana', 'Gonzalez-Barbera, Eva M', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Artacho, Alejandro', 'Penaranda, Ivan', 'Herrera, Beatriz', 'Garzon, Maria Jose', 'Salavert, Miguel', 'Lopez-Hontangas, Jose Luis', 'Xavier, Karina B', 'Kuster, Bernhard', 'Debrauwer, Laurent', 'Rolain, Jean-Marc', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Xavier, Joao B', 'Ubeda, Carles']","['Djukovic A', 'Gonzalez-Barbera EM', 'Sanz J', 'Artacho A', 'Penaranda I', 'Herrera B', 'Garzon MJ', 'Salavert M', 'Lopez-Hontangas JL', 'Xavier KB', 'Kuster B', 'Debrauwer L', 'Rolain JM', 'Sanz MA', 'Xavier JB', 'Ubeda C']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5210-1434'],"['Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica-FISABIO, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica-FISABIO, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica-FISABIO, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica-FISABIO, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica-FISABIO, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics, Technical University of Munich, Freising, Germany.', 'Toxalim-Research Center in Food Toxicology, Toulouse University, INRA UMR 1331, ENVT, INP-Purpan, Paul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France.', 'Axiom Platform, UMR 1331 Toxalim, MetaToul-MetaboHUB, National Infrastructure of Metabolomics and Fluxomics, Toulouse, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, IHU-Mediterranee Infection, Marseille, France.', 'Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Lucille Castori Center for Microbes, Inflammation and Cancer, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Computational and Systems Biology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, New York, USA.', 'Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica-FISABIO, Valencia, Spain ubeda_carmor@gva.es.', 'Centers of Biomedical Research Network (CIBER) in Epidemiology and Public Health, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI137269/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI124275/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200127,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cephalosporins)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (beta-Lactams)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Cephalosporins/pharmacology', 'Culture Media', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Enterobacteriaceae/*drug effects', 'Feces/*microbiology', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'beta-Lactams/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Enterobacteriaceae', '*antibiotic resistance', '*beta-lactams', '*intestinal colonization']",2019/11/27 06:00,2020/11/26 06:00,['2019/11/27 06:00'],"['2019/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['AAC.01415-19 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.01415-19 [doi]']",epublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2020 Jan 27;64(2). pii: AAC.01415-19. doi: 10.1128/AAC.01415-19.

We previously reported that both human and murine-activated T cells are converted into stem cell memory-like T (iTSCM) cells by coculture with stromal OP9 cells expressing the NOTCH ligand. However, the mechanism of NOTCH-mediated iTSCM reprogramming remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that the NOTCH/OP9 system efficiently converted conventional human CAR-T cells into TSCM-like CAR-T, ""CAR-iTSCM"" cells, and that mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming played a key role in this conversion. NOTCH signaling promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid synthesis during iTSCM formation, which are essential for the properties of iTSCM cells. Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) was identified as a downstream target of NOTCH, which was responsible for these metabolic changes and the subsequent iTSCM differentiation. Like NOTCH-induced CAR-iTSCM cells, FOXM1-induced CAR-iTSCM cells possessed superior antitumor potential compared with conventional CAR-T cells. We propose that NOTCH- or FOXM1-driven CAR-iTSCM formation is an effective strategy for improving cancer immunotherapy.

CONCLUSION: Patients with acute leukemias have substantial palliative care needs that often go unmet with standard oncology care. Evidence shows that the early integration of specialist palliative care into standard oncology care improves patient-centered outcomes among those with advanced solid tumors. Emerging evidence supports similar benefits among hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing stem cell transplantation, and additional trials are underway to further test palliative care interventions in patients with AML.

However, TKIs cannot eliminate quiescent leukemia stem cells (LSCs) which persist in all patients on long-term therapy and provides a reservoir for disease progression and recurrence. Many researches have confirmed that TKI-resistant LSCs compartment can be captured within CD26 (+) fraction. In order to analyze distinctive biological characteristics of TKI-resistant LSCs, we isolated the CD34 (+) CD38(-)CD26(+), CD34 (+) CD38(-)CD26(-)and CD34 (+) CD38 (+) cells from 8 CML patients utilizing magnetic and flow sorting, and analyzed the global proteomic expression through high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis. In the work, we discovered that a list of dysregulated proteins involved in energy metabolism and carcinogenesis, including PPARD, IL1-RAP, HNF, S15A2, PCLO, VA0D1, CKLF5, were extremely upregulated in the CD26 (+) LSCs while some majoring in DNA mismatch repair or related to cell senescence, such as MLH3, NOLC1, were downregulated. Additionally, we verified the upregulation of PPARD in both CML patients-derived CD26 (+) LSCs and donor-derived BCR-ABL1 overexpressed HSCs.

As a group, EBV-TNKLPD are more commonly encountered in Asians and Native Americans from Central and South America compared to Western populations. They encompass a spectrum of entities that range from non-neoplastic lesions such as EBV-associated haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH) to more chronic conditions with variable outcomes such as chronic active EBV infections (CAEBV) of T- and NK-cell type (cutaneous and systemic forms) and malignant diseases such as systemic EBV-positive T-cell lymphoma of childhood, aggressive NK-cell leukaemia, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type, and primary EBV-positive nodal T/NK-cell lymphoma. Due to their rarity, broad clinicopathological spectrum and significant morphological and immunophenotypic overlap, the diagnosis and precise classification of EBV-TNKLPD often pose a challenge to clinicians and pathologists. Correct classification of this group of rare diseases relies heavily on the age of onset, disease presentation, duration of symptoms and cell of origin (T- vs NK-cell lineage). In this review, we provide an update on the clinicopathological and molecular features of the various EBV-TNKLPD entities occurring in non-immunocompromised patients and present a practical algorithmic approach for the general pathologist who is confronted with these disorders in routine clinical practice.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.

Mutations in LUC7L2, PRPF8, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 genes occur at various frequencies ranging between 40% and 85% in different subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 5% and 10% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In some instances, splicing factor (SF) mutations have provided diagnostic utility and information on clinical outcomes as exemplified by SF3B1 mutations associated with increased ring sideroblasts (RS) in MDS-RS or MDS/MPN-RS with thrombocytosis. SF3B1 mutations are associated with better survival outcomes, while SRSF2 mutations are associated with a shorter survival time and increased AML progression, and U2AF1 mutations with a lower remission rate and shorter survival time. Beside the presence of mutations, transcriptomics technologies have shown that one third of genes in AML patients are differentially expressed, leading to altered transcript stability, interruption of protein function, and improper translation compared to those of healthy individuals. The detection of SF mutations demonstrates the importance of splicing abnormalities in the hematopoiesis of MDS and AML patients given the fact that abnormal splicing regulates the function of several transcriptional factors (PU.1, RUNX1, etc.) crucial in hematopoietic function.

Net O2 tension within many tumors may not only depend on O2 delivery but also depend strongly on O2 demand. Thus, tumor O2 consumption rates may influence tumor hypoxia up to true anoxia. Recent reports have shown that many human tumors in vivo depend primarily on oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), not glycolysis, for energy generation, providing a driver for consumptive hypoxia and an exploitable vulnerability. In this regard, IACS-010759 is a novel high affinity inhibitor of OxPhos targeting mitochondrial complex-I that has recently completed a Phase-I clinical trial in leukemia. However, in solid tumors, the effective translation of OxPhos inhibitors requires methods to monitor pharmacodynamics in vivo. Herein, (18)F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside ([(18)F]FAZA), a 2-nitroimidazole-based hypoxia PET imaging agent, was combined with a rigorous test-retest imaging method for non-invasive quantification of the reversal of consumptive hypoxia in vivo as a mechanism-specific pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker of target engagement for IACS-010759. Neither cell death nor loss of perfusion could account for the IACS-010759-induced decrease in [(18)F]FAZA retention.

Here, we explored the cellular processes of Jurkat cells exposed to nanosecond pulsed electric field. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were acquired from the GEO2R, followed by analysis with a series of bioinformatics tools. Subsequently, 3D protein models of hub genes were modeled by Modeller 9.21 and Rosetta 3.9. Then, a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation for each hub protein was performed with GROMACS 2018.2. Finally, three kinds of nsPEF voltages (0.01, 0.05, and 0.5 mV/mm) were used to simulate the molecular dynamics of hub proteins for 100 ns. A total of 1769 DEGs and eight hub genes were obtained. Molecular dynamic analysis, including root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and the Rg, demonstrated that the 3D structure of hub proteins was built, and the structural characteristics of hub proteins under different nsPEFs were acquired. In conclusion, we explored the effect of nsPEF on Jurkat cell signaling pathway from the perspective of molecular informatics, which will be helpful in understanding the complex effects of nsPEF on acute T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells.",,"['Li, Huijuan', 'Liu, Shibin', 'Yang, Xue', 'Du, Yongqian', 'Luo, Jiezhang', 'Tan, Jie', 'Sun, Yulong']","['Li H', 'Liu S', 'Yang X', 'Du Y', 'Luo J', 'Tan J', 'Sun Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6811-5926'],"[""School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China."", ""School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China."", ""School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China."", ""School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China."", ""School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China."", ""School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China."", ""Key Laboratory for Space Biosciences & Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, China.""]",['eng'],"['No. 61873209/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'No. 61704139/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'No. 3102017OQD038/Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities', 'No. 2017M623250/China Postdoctoral Science Foundation', 'No. 2018BSHYDZZ48/Shaanxi Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation', 'No. ZZ2019154/Seed Foundation of Innovation and Creation for Graduate Students in', 'Northwestern Polytechnical University']",['Journal Article'],20191121,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,,IM,"['Electric Stimulation/methods', '*Electricity', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Essential/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Jurkat', 'bioinformatics analysis', 'microarray', 'molecular dynamics simulation', 'nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF)']",2019/11/27 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2019/11/27 06:00'],"['2019/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20235847 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20235847 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Nov 21;20(23). pii: ijms20235847. doi: 10.3390/ijms20235847.,PMC6929111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of SAHA and DAC attenuated cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death of KG-1 and U937 cell lines. Besides, their sequential combination improved the obtained anti-neoplastic effect: significant augmentation of growth inhibition and apoptosis induction as compared to cells treated with either drug alone. This effect was featured by the upregulated expression of Bax, cytochrome c1, p21, and cleaved caspases 8, 9, and 3, signifying the activation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis.

Recent studies detected genomic aberrations affecting JAK and STAT genes in T-PLL. Due to the limited number of primary patient samples available, genomic analyses of the JAK/STAT pathway have been performed in rather small cohorts. Therefore, we conducted-via a primary-data based pipeline-a meta-analysis that re-evaluated the genomic landscape of T-PLL. It included all available data sets with sequence information on JAK or STAT gene loci in 275 T-PLL. We eliminated overlapping cases and determined a cumulative rate of 62.1% of cases with mutated JAK or STAT genes. Most frequently, JAK1 (6.3%), JAK3 (36.4%), and STAT5B (18.8%) carried somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), with missense mutations in the SH2 or pseudokinase domains as most prevalent. Importantly, these lesions were predominantly subclonal. We did not detect any strong association between mutations of a JAK or STAT gene with clinical characteristics. Irrespective of the presence of gain-of-function (GOF) SNVs, basal phosphorylation of STAT5B was elevated in all analyzed T-PLL. Fittingly, a significant proportion of genes encoding for potential negative regulators of STAT5B showed genomic losses (in 71.4% of T-PLL in total, in 68.4% of T-PLL without any JAK or STAT mutations). They included DUSP4, CD45, TCPTP, SHP1, SOCS1, SOCS3, and HDAC9. Overall, considering such losses of negative regulators and the GOF mutations in JAK and STAT genes, a total of 89.8% of T-PLL revealed a genomic aberration potentially explaining enhanced STAT5B activity. In essence, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis on the highly prevalent genomic lesions that affect genes encoding JAK/STAT signaling components. This provides an overview of possible modes of activation of this pathway in a large cohort of T-PLL. In light of new advances in JAK/STAT inhibitor development, we also outline translational contexts for harnessing active JAK/STAT signaling, which has emerged as a 'secondary' hallmark of T-PLL.",,"['Wahnschaffe, Linus', 'Braun, Till', 'Timonen, Sanna', 'Giri, Anil K', 'Schrader, Alexandra', 'Wagle, Prerana', 'Almusa, Henrikki', 'Johansson, Patricia', 'Bellanger, Dorine', 'Lopez,

Given its relapsing and fatal features, curing cancer seems to be something hardly possible for the majority of patients. In view of the development in cancer therapies, this article summarizes currently available cancer therapeutics and cure potential by cancer type and stage at diagnosis, based on literature and database reviews. Currently common cancer therapeutics include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. However, treatment with curative intent by these methods are mainly eligible for patients with localized disease or treatment-sensitive cancers and therefore their contributions to cancer curability are relatively limited. The prognosis for cancer patients varies among different cancer types with a five-year relative survival rate (RSR) of more than 80% in thyroid cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. The most dismal prognosis is observed in patients with small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, oesophagal cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer, and gastric cancer with a five-year RSR ranging between 7% and 28%.

The role of cranial radiation therapy (CRT) in the development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, a predecessor of overt HF, remains unclear. Our aim was to compare LV function and systemic arterial properties according to past CRT in young adult survivors of anthracycline-treated ALL. We studied young adult survivors of childhood ALL at a median of 16 years from diagnosis treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, with (n = 12) or without (n = 30) CRT. In addition to fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF), LV function was quantified by tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus. Aortic strain/distensibility and arterial compliance were derived from echocardiography and simultaneously recorded pulse pressure. Despite similar FS and EF, peak mitral annular systolic velocity (median (interquartile range): 9.0 (7.5-10.0) vs. 10.0 (8.8-11.5) cm/s, p = 0.05), and early diastolic velocity (13.8 (13.0-14.8) vs. 15.5 (14.0-17.3), p = 0.01) were decreased after chemotherapy combined with CRT compared to chemotherapy without CRT. Systemic arterial compliance was lower in post-CRT subjects (1.0 (0.8-1.2 vs. 1.4 (1.1-1.7) mL/mmHg, p = 0.002). Aortic strain and distensibility were similar regardless of prior CRT. In conclusion, lower arterial compliance and subclinical LV dysfunction may be possible late consequences of past CRT in adult survivors of childhood ALL. Whether arterial stiffening is associated with future HF development in CRT-exposed ALL survivors remains to be investigated.",,"['Sulicka-Grodzicka, Joanna', 'Chyrchel, Bernadeta', 'Toton-Zuranska, Justyna', 'Nowak, Ewelina', 'Wolkow, Pawel P', 'Surdacki, Andrzej', 'Grodzicki, Tomasz']","['Sulicka-Grodzicka J', 'Chyrchel B', 'Toton-Zuranska J', 'Nowak E', 'Wolkow PP', 'Surdacki A', 'Grodzicki T']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5970-238X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9322-5545', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7949-3140']","['Department of Rheumatology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 10 Sniadeckich Street, 31-531 Cracow, Poland.', 'Second Department of Cardiology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 17 Kopernika Street, 31-501 Cracow, Poland.', 'Center for Medical Genomics OMICRON, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 7C Kopernika Street, 31-034 Cracow, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Gerontology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 10 Sniadeckich Street, 31-531 Cracow, Poland.', 'Center for Medical Genomics OMICRON, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 7C Kopernika Street, 31-034 Cracow, Poland.', 'Second Department of Cardiology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 17 Kopernika Street, 31-501 Cracow, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Gerontology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 10 Sniadeckich Street, 31-531 Cracow, Poland.']",['eng'],['2015/17/D/NZ7/02165/Narodowe Centrum Nauki'],['Journal Article'],20191113,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cardiovascular disease', 'childhood cancer survivors', 'cranial irradiation', 'echocardiography', 'systemic arterial compliance']",2019/11/27 06:00,2019/11/27 06:01,['2019/11/27 06:00'],"['2019/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/27 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm8111952 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm8111952 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2019 Nov 13;8(11). pii: jcm8111952. doi: 10.3390/jcm8111952.,PMC6912438,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the role of miR-563 and its molecular mechanism in the initiation and progression of cancers has not been previously explored. In this study, we aimed to provide clues to the function of miR-563 and its direct target in lung cancer. METHODS: Online informatics software was applied to predict the target genes of miR-563. MiR-563 targeting LIN28B was evaluated through the luciferase reporter gene analysis. The effect of miR-563 on LIN28B at the level of RNA and protein was detected using RT-PCR and immunoblotting. The ability of proliferation of human lung cancer A549 was examined by MTT assay. RNA interference targeting LIN28B was examined through immunoblotting. The level of miR-563 and LIN28B and their correlation were analyzed in 27 cases of lung tumor tissues by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Oncogenic LIN28B was identified as one of the target genes of miR-563 in lung cancer cells. MiR-563 dose-dependently decreased the LIN28B RNA level and subsequently its protein level in the cells. Cell proliferation was suppressed by ectopic miR-563 expression and was accelerated after endogenous miR-563 was knocked down by its inhibitor. However, silence in LIN28B reversed promotion of cell proliferation by the inhibition of miR-563. In lung cancer tissues, miR-563 was decreased and negative correlation of miR-563 and LIN28B was shown. CONCLUSION: MiR-563 plays a tumor suppressive role in lung cancer progression via targeting oncogenic LIN28B.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can provide prolonged overall survival in CML patients, resulting in life expectancy nearly to general population, and now approximately half of patients who achieved deep molecular response (DMR) can sustain durable molecular remission after discontinuation TKIs. However, residual leukemic cells still detected in the patients who sustained in molecular remission after discontinuation TKIs with the sensitive BCL-ABL1 transcript detection method. Given the fact that residual leukemic cells can exist in these patients, host immune systems can protect the patients to develop CML progression derived from residual leukemic cells. The human immune system is generally composed by innate and adaptive immune systems, corresponding to their functional diversities. Natural killer (NK) cells are major components of the innate immune system, while T lymphocytes (T cells) are major components of the adaptive immune system, and both NK cell and T cell mediate immune responses have an important role in CML. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that promote expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), leading to host immune suppression, are also important. Although regulation mechanism of these immune system has not been fully elucidated, tumor antigen (e.g. Wilms tumor-1), and surface receptors (e.g. killer immunoglobulin-like receptor and natural killer group 2) on NK cells, are pivotal role in these immune system regulations.

It was found that the PPCs were able to increase the post-radiation viability of PBMCs by inhibiting apoptosis, while they did not protect the leukemic cells against radiation-induced apoptotic death. The PPCs offered an efficient protection of PBMCs through scavenging of intracellular ROS and decreasing DNA damage, while they provided no reduction of the oxidative stress and DNA damage in K562 cells.

Alternative donor transplantations with an unrelated donor (URD) or a partially matched related donor (PMRD) carry an increased risk of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and mortality compared with matched related donor transplantations. We hypothesized that a strategy of partial CD3(+)/CD19(+) depletion for URD or PMRD peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) would attenuate the risks of GVHD and mortality. We enrolled 84 pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin between April 2005 and February 2015. Two patients (2.4%) experienced primary graft failure. Relapse occurred in 23 patients (27.4%; cumulative incidence 26.3%), and 17 patients (20.2%) experienced nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Grade III-IV acute GVHD was observed in 18 patients (21.4%), and chronic GVHD was observed and graded as limited in 24 patients (35.3%) and extensive in 8 (11.7%). Three-year overall survival (OS) was 61.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.2% to 71.4%) and event-free survival (EFS) was 52.0% (95% CI, 40.3% to 62.4%). Age >/=15 years was associated with decreased OS (P= .05) and EFS (P= .05). Relapse was more common in children in second complete remission (P = .03). Partially CD3(+)-depleted alternative donor PSCT NRM, OS, and EFS compare favorably with previously published studies of T cell-replete PSCT. Historically, T cell-replete PSCT has been associated with a higher incidence of extensive chronic GVHD compared with limited chronic GVHD, which may explain the comparatively low relapse and NRM rates in our study cohort despite similar overall rates of chronic GVHD. Partial T cell depletion may expand donor options for children with malignant transplantation indications lacking a matched related donor by mitigating, but not eliminating, chronic GVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We recently identified that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is one of novel NDRG2 binding proteins and the knockdown of PRMT5 induces cell apoptosis with degradation of several signaling molecules. To investigate how the apoptosis is induced by the knockdown PRMT5 expression, heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90A) was identified as a binding protein for NDRG2 or PRMT5 by immunoprecipitation-mass analysis. NDRG2/PP2A complex inhibited arginine methyltransferase activity of PRMT5 through dephosphorylation at Serine 335 (S335); however, in NDRG2(low) ATL-related cells, highly phosphorylated PRMT5 at S335 was mainly localized in cytoplasm with binding to HSP90A, resulting in enhancing arginine-methylation at the middle domain (R345 and R386). Since knockdown of PRMT5 expression or forced expression of HSP90A with alanine replacement of R345 or R386 induced apoptosis with the degradation of client proteins in NDRG2(low) ATL-related and other cancer cells, we here identified that the novel arginine methylations of HSP90A are essential for maintenance of its function in NDRG2(low) ATL and other cancer cells.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The inter-seasonal differences in the cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were estimated by single-factor analysis of variance. During 1998-2014 number of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases changed within the interval 10 - 20 in Spring, 10-27 in Summer, 10-29 Autumn and 8-19 cases in Winter. The median of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia consisted 13,3 in Spring, 15,4 in Summer, 13,7 in Autumn and 10 in Winter. The average number of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Spring was (15,49+/-1,13), in Summer (15,89+/-1,08) and in Autumn (15,71+/-1,21) practically were equal (small er, Cyrillic>0,05) and was significantly (small er, Cyrillic<0,05) higher than the same data in Winter (11,07+/-0,76). In total, during 1998-2014 number of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases in Summer was higher than the same number in Winter up to 1,24 times. The risk of the incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia earlier than age of 29 years in Winter in Azerbaijan is relatively low. The increase of morbidity risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is specific for Spring, Summer and Autumn are at the same degree. The seasonal risks of acute lymphoblastic leukemia morbidity are not universal. They change depending on conditions of the year.

However, AML is still characterized by a high relapse rate and poor overall survival. In addition to conventional NKs that can be considered the innate counterparts of CD8 T cells, another family of innate lymphocytes has been recently described with phenotypes and functions mirroring those of helper CD4 T cells. Here, in blood and tissues, we identified a CD56+ innate cell population harboring mixed transcriptional and phenotypic attributes of conventional helper innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and lytic NK cells. These CD56+ ILC1-like cells possess strong cytotoxic capacities that are impaired in AML patients at diagnosis but are restored upon remission. Their cytotoxicity is KIR independent and relies on the expression of TRAIL, NKp30, NKp80, and NKG2A. However, the presence of leukemic blasts, HLA-E-positive cells, and/or transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) strongly affect their cytotoxic potential, at least partially by reducing the expression of cytotoxic-related molecules. Notably, CD56+ ILC1-like cells are also present in the NK cell preparations used in NK transfer-based clinical trials. Overall, we identified an NK cell-related CD56+ ILC population involved in tumor immunosurveillance in humans, and we propose that restoring their functions with anti-NKG2A antibodies and/or small molecules inhibiting TGF-beta1 might represent a novel strategy for improving current immunotherapies.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Salome, Berengere', 'Gomez-Cadena, Alejandra', 'Loyon, Romain', 'Suffiotti, Madeleine', 'Salvestrini, Valentina', 'Wyss, Tania', 'Vanoni, Giulia', 'Ruan, Dan Fu', 'Rossi, Marianna', 'Tozzo, Alessandra', 'Tentorio, Paolo', 'Bruni, Elena', 'Riether, Carsten', 'Jacobsen, Eva-Maria', 'Jandus, Peter', 'Conrad, Curdin', 'Hoenig, Manfred', 'Schulz, Ansgar', 'Michaud, Katarzyna', 'Della Porta, Matteo Giovanni', 'Salvatore, Silvia', 'Ho, Ping-Chih', 'Gfeller, David', 'Ochsenbein, Adrian', 'Mavilio, Domenico', 'Curti, Antonio', 'Marcenaro, Emanuela', 'Steinle, Alexander', 'Horowitz, Amir', 'Romero, Pedro', 'Trabanelli, Sara', 'Jandus, Camilla']","['Salome B', 'Gomez-Cadena A', 'Loyon R', 'Suffiotti M', 'Salvestrini V', 'Wyss T', 'Vanoni G', 'Ruan DF', 'Rossi M', 'Tozzo A', 'Tentorio P', 'Bruni E', 'Riether C', 'Jacobsen EM', 'Jandus P', 'Conrad C', 'Hoenig M', 'Schulz A', 'Michaud K', 'Della Porta MG', 'Salvatore S', 'Ho PC', 'Gfeller D', 'Ochsenbein A', 'Mavilio D', 'Curti A', 'Marcenaro E', 'Steinle A', 'Horowitz A', 'Romero P', 'Trabanelli S', 'Jandus C']",,"['Department of Oncology UNIL CHUV, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Department of Oncology UNIL CHUV, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncology UNIL CHUV, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncology UNIL CHUV, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Specialistic, Diagnostic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""Seragnoli,"" University Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology UNIL CHUV, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncology UNIL CHUV, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Cancer Center IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Pediatric Department, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Unit of Clinical and Experimental Immunology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Rozzano-Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Clinical and Experimental Immunology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Rozzano-Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnologies and Translational Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Division of Immunology and Allergology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital and Medical Faculty, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'University Center of Legal Medicine Lausanne-Geneva, Lausanne University Hospital, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Cancer Center IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.', 'Pediatric Department, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology UNIL CHUV, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncology UNIL CHUV, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Unit of Clinical and Experimental Immunology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Rozzano-Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnologies and Translational Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology L. e A.

In a 2-step stratification, patients were allocated to receive either low- or high-risk treatment, based on initial white blood cell count, age, and immunophenotype. A second stratification was performed according to the results of in vitro pharmacosensitivity toward prednisolone, vincristine, and asparaginase (PVA score) and in vivo response after induction therapy (minimal residual disease [MRD]). Therapy was reduced for both risk groups in patients with a low PVA score or negative MRD result, and intensified in patients with a high PVA score. Overall outcome improved significantly compared with the predecessor CoALL 06-97 trial, with identical therapy backbone despite treatment reduction in 15.8% of patients (10-year probability of event-free survival, 83.5% vs 73.9%; overall survival, 90.7% vs 83.8%). Outcome for patients in the reduced treatment arms was superior to that of patients in the standard arms, associated with a profound reduction in frequency and severity of infectious complications. Importantly, we observed a lack of correlation between in vitro and in vivo drug response, as well as a lower predictive value of in vitro drug testing, reflecting an intrinsic limitation of this methodology that prevents its use for treatment stratification in future trials. In conclusion, it might be possible to reduce chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia selected by stringent in vivo measurement of MRD without jeopardizing overall outcome.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Schramm, Franziska', 'Zur Stadt, Udo', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Jorch, Norbert', 'Pekrun, Arnulf', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Imschweiler, Thomas', 'Christiansen, Holger', 'Faber, Jorg', 'Schmid, Irene', 'Feuchtinger, Tobias', 'Beron, Gerhard', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Horstmann, Martin A', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta E', 'Escherich, Gabriele']","['Schramm F', 'Zur Stadt U', 'Zimmermann M', 'Jorch N', 'Pekrun A', 'Borkhardt A', 'Imschweiler T', 'Christiansen H', 'Faber J', 'Schmid I', 'Feuchtinger T', 'Beron G', 'den Boer ML', 'Pieters R', 'Horstmann MA', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Escherich G']",,"['Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre, Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg, Germany.', 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre, Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Bremen-Mitte, Bremen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Helios Hospital, Krefeld, Germany.', 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', ""Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany."", ""Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Helios Hospital, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands; and.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands; and.', 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre, Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Centre, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre, Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg, Germany.', 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre, Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2019/11/26 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2019/11/26 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['428872 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000576 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Nov 26;3(22):3688-3699. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000576.,PMC6880907,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New targeted drugs have emerged, including venetoclax to target B-cell lymphoma 2, midostaurin and gilteritinib to target FLT3, and ivosidenib and enasidenib to target mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2, respectively. Other additions include reapproval of gemtuzumab ozogomycin to target CD33, glasdegib to target the hedgehog pathway, and a liposomal formulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine (CPX-351). Genomically heterogeneous AML has a tendency to evolve, particularly under selective treatment pressure. For decades, treatment decisions have largely centered around chemotherapy drug intensity. Physicians now have access to an increasing number of drugs with novel mechanisms of action and distinctive side-effect profiles. Key issues faced by hematologists in this era of new drugs include (1) the timely identification of actionable mutations at diagnosis and at relapse; (2) deciding which drug to use among several therapeutic options; and (3) increasing awareness of how to anticipate, mitigate, and manage common complications associated with these new agents.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the serum biomarkers and echocardiography parameters in children with ALL treated with AC in order to determine the most useful element for early detection of cardiotoxicity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study, troponin I (TnI) and heart-type fatty acid binding protein (HFABP) were assessed five times during the first year after the onset of ALL. Serial Tissue Doppler Imaging and conventional cardiac echography were performed by two pediatric cardiologists (intraclass correlation coefficient over 0.85 for all measurements) in three periods during the study protocol. RESULTS: We evaluated 48 children with ALL. TnI increased during therapy, without returning to baseline values one year after diagnosis. HFABP did not show significant changes during the study protocol. Left ventricle outflow tract time-velocity integral and peak systolic septal mitral annulus velocity decreased during chemotherapy and returned to baseline levels at one year after diagnosis, while peak systolic tricuspid annulus velocity and excursion, maintained a descending tendency. Early filling transmitral flow velocity and E/A ratio were also transiently influenced by chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed signs of transient cardiotoxicity in the left ventricle and diastolic parameters after chemotherapy, compared to right ventricle parameters which maintained low values even one year after diagnosis. TnI proved to be directly proportional to chemotherapy doses but HFABP was not useful in this setting.",,"['Radu, Letitia Elena', 'Ghiorghiu, Ioana', 'Oprescu, Alina', 'Dorobantu, Dan', 'Arion, Constantin', 'Colita, Anca']","['Radu LE', 'Ghiorghiu I', 'Oprescu A', 'Dorobantu D', 'Arion C', 'Colita A']",,"['Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania. letitia_radu@yahoo.com.', '""Prof. Dr. Victor Gomoiu"" Children\'s Hospital, Bucharest, Romania. ioanagh2001@yahoo.com.', 'Monza Hospital, Bucharest, Romania. alyna_e@yahoo.com.', '""Prof. Dr. C.

In this study, we investigated the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-35 and IL-18 in children with ALL to compare with healthy subjects and find their relationship with prognostic factors and response to therapy. IL-35 and IL-18 serum concentrations in 40 children diagnosed with ALL and 35 age-matched and sex-matched healthy children were measured using ELISA. The association between cytokine levels and patients' clinical and laboratory data were determined. A significant difference was found in IL-35 serum levels between the patients (3.6+/-1.5 ng/mL) and controls (2.5+/-1.8 ng/mL) (P=0.007). No significant difference in IL-18 serum levels between these groups was observed. A positive correlation between IL-35 and IL-18 levels was detected (P=0.001). The authors found that patients with lower platelet count had higher IL-35 concentration (P=0.003). By considering a cut-off value of 6.21 ng/mL (mean+/-2SD of controls) for IL-35, it was found that white blood cell (WBC) count was higher in patients with IL-35 >6.21 ng/mL (P=0.016), and the majority of these patients had T-ALL (P=0.01). Although the mean overall survival in patients with IL-35 >6.21 ng/mL was shorter (937+/-381 d) than in those with IL-35 </=6.21 ng/mL (1567+/-103 d), but the result was not significant (P=0.1, log-rank test). The IL-18 level was associated with a lower hemoglobin level (P=0.027). These data suggested a role for IL-35 in ALL development.

Together, a number of retrospective and prospective clinical trials have provided insight into patient outcomes with different sequencing and combination strategies. While rituximab does not appear to provide significant additional benefit to ibrutinib, the incorporation of venetoclax appears to enable a deeper response and allow for a shorter duration of therapy.

Studies on higher concentrations of indoor radon and childhood leukemia have conflicting but largely negative results. In this study, we aimed to create a sophisticated statistical model to predict indoor radon concentrations and apply it to a Finnish childhood leukemia case-control dataset. Methods Prediction was based on ~80 000 indoor radon measurements, which were linked to national registries for potential indoor radon predictors based on the literature. In modelling, we used classical methods, random forests and deep neural networks. We had 1093 cases and 3279 controls from a nationwide case-control study. We estimated odds ratio (OR) for childhood leukemia using conditional logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. Results The r (2)of the final log-linear model was 0.21 for houses and 0.20 for apartments. Using random forest method, we were able to obtain slightly better fit for both houses (r (2)= 0.28) and apartments (r (2)= 0.23). In a risk analysis based on the case-control data with log-linear model, we observed a non-significant (P=0.54) increase with predicted radon concentrations [OR for the 2 (nd)quartile 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77-1.50, OR 1.10 with 95% CI 0.79-1.53 for the 3 (rd), and 1.29 with 95% CI 0.93-1.77 for the highest quartile]. Conclusions Our modelling and the previously published models performed similarly but involves major uncertainties, and the results should be interpreted with caution. We observed a slight non-significant increase in risk of childhood leukemia related to higher average indoor radon concentrations.",,"['Nikkila, Atte', 'Arvela, Hannu', 'Mehtonen, Juha', 'Raitanen, Jani', 'Heinaniemi, Merja', 'Lohi, Olli', 'Auvinen, Anssi']","['Nikkila A', 'Arvela H', 'Mehtonen J', 'Raitanen J', 'Heinaniemi M', 'Lohi O', 'Auvinen A']",,"['Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University Arvo Ylpon katu 34, 33520 Tampere, Finland. atte.nikkila@tuni.fi.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191125,Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Radioactive/*analysis', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/*analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/analysis', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Radon/*analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,,2019/11/26 06:00,2021/03/27 06:00,['2019/11/26 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['3867 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.3867 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 2020 May 1;46(3):278-292. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.3867.

Among unrelated donor HCT recipients with acute myelogenous leukemia, one recent pilot study linked low SES to increased expression of a stress-related gene expression profile known as the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which involves up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes and down-regulation of genes involved in type I interferon response and antibody synthesis. Methods: This study examined these relationships using additional measures in a larger archival sample of 261 adults who received an unrelated donor HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia to 1) identify cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in SES-related differences in pre-transplant leukocyte transcriptome profiles, and 2) evaluate pre-transplant CTRA biology associations with clinical outcomes through multivariable analysis controlling for demographic-, disease-, and transplant-related covariates. Results: Low SES individuals showed increases in classic monocyte activation and pro-inflammatory transcription control pathways as well as decreases in activation of nonclassic monocytes, all consistent with the CTRA biological pattern. Transplant recipients in the highest or lowest quartiles of the CTRA pro-inflammatory gene component had a more than 2-fold elevated hazard of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44 to 4.24), P = .001; HR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.46 to 4.34, P = .001) and more than 20% reduction in leukemia-free survival (HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.28, P = .012; HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.04 to 2.15, P = .03) compared with the middle quartiles. Conclusions: These findings identify SES- and CTRA-associated myeloid- and inflammation-related transcriptome signatures in recipient pre-transplant blood samples as a potential novel predictive biomarker of HCT-related clinical outcomes.",['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

In contrast to whole-genome (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES), targeted genomic sequencing (TS) focuses on a panel of genes or targets known to have strong associations with pathogenesis of disease and/or clinical relevance, offering greater sequencing depth with reduced costs and data burden. This allows targeted sequencing to identify low frequency variants in targeted regions with high confidence, thus suitable for profiling low-quality and fragmented clinical DNA samples. As a result, TS has been widely used in clinical research and trials for patient stratification and the development of targeted therapeutics. However, its transition to routine clinical use has been slow. Many technical and analytical obstacles still remain and need to be discussed and addressed before large-scale and cross-centre implementation. Gold-standard and state-of-the-art procedures and pipelines are urgently needed to accelerate this transition. In this review we first present how TS is conducted in cancer research, including various target enrichment platforms, the construction of target panels, and selected research and clinical studies utilising TS to profile clinical samples. We then present a generalised analytical workflow for TS data discussing important parameters and filters in detail, aiming to provide the best practices of TS usage and analyses.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.'],"['Bewicke-Copley, Findlay', 'Arjun Kumar, Emil', 'Palladino, Giuseppe', 'Korfi, Koorosh', 'Wang, Jun']","['Bewicke-Copley F', 'Arjun Kumar E', 'Palladino G', 'Korfi K', 'Wang J']",,"['Centre for Cancer Genomics and Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'Centre for Cancer Genomics and Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'Centre for Cancer Genomics and Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'Centre for Cancer Genomics and Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191107,Netherlands,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,101585369,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BAM, Binary Alignment Map', 'BWA, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner', 'Background error', 'CLL, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia', 'COSMIC, Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer', 'Cancer genomics', 'Clinical samples', 'ESP, Exome Sequencing Project', 'FF, Fresh Frozen', 'FFPE, Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded', 'FL, Follicular Lymphoma', 'GATK, Genome Analysis Toolkit', 'ICGC, International Cancer Genome Consortium', 'MBC, Molecular Barcode', 'NCCN, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network(R)', 'NGS, Next Generation Sequencing', 'NHL, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma', 'NSCLC, Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'PCR duplicates', 'QC, Quality Control', 'SAM, Sequence Alignment Map', 'TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'TS, Targeted Sequencing', 'Targeted sequencing', 'UMI, Unique Molecular Identifiers', 'VAF, Variant Allele Frequency', 'Variant calling', 'WES, Whole Exome Sequencing', 'WGS, Whole Genome Sequencing', 'tFL, Transformed Follicular Lymphoma']",2019/11/26 06:00,2019/11/26 06:01,['2019/11/26 06:00'],"['2019/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.csbj.2019.10.004 [doi]', 'S2001-0370(19)30147-3 [pii]']",epublish,Comput Struct Biotechnol J. 2019 Nov 7;17:1348-1359. doi: 10.1016/j.csbj.2019.10.004. eCollection 2019.,PMC6861594,,,,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated that DOCK1 had adverse prognostic effect in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We first analyzed data of 85 AML patients who were treated with chemotherapy and had available DOCK1 to DOCK11 expression information and found that DOCK1 and DOCK2 had prognostic significance in AML. In view of the known prognosis of DOCK1 in AML, we then explored the prognostic role of DOCK2. One hundred fifty-six AML patients with DOCK2 expression data were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and enrolled in this study. Patients were divided based on treatment modality into the chemotherapy group and the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) group. Each group was divided into two groups by the median expression levels of DOCK2. In the chemotherapy group, high DOCK2 expression was associated with longer event-free survival (EFS, P=0.001) and overall survival (OS, P=0.007).

Multivariate analysis showed that high DOCK2 expression was an independent favorable prognostic factor for both EFS and OS in all patients (all P<0.05).

Method: 100 AML cases and 100 healthy controls were recruited from the Riyadh regional hospital. In the GST gene, GSTM1 and GSTT1 variants were genotyped by multiplex PCR, and GSTP1 variants were genotyped by PCR-RFLP analysis. Statistical analysis between AML cases and controls included anthropometric measurements and evaluation of the genotypic and allelic frequencies. Result: The null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 showed no association with AML [OR 0.56 (0.26-1.19); p=0.31 and OR 0.65 (0.37-1.16); p=0.14]. Similarly, the GSTP1 genotype and allele frequencies did not indicate any association with AML [GG+AG vs. AA: OR 0.75 (0.43-1.31) and p=0.32; GG vs. AA: OR 1.73 (0.55-5.44) and p=0.34; G vs. A: OR 0.95 (0.61-1.46) and p=0.82]. Further, a haplotype analysis between AML cases and controls did not show any positive association (p<0.05). Conclusion: In conclusion, there was no statistical association of the genotypes and alleles in GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 with AML. Our results confirm the negative association of the investigated genetic markers with susceptibility to AML. Further association studies would be required in different ethnic populations to facilitate a meta-analysis in the future. Our findings suggest that the GST gene has no role in the pathogenesis of AML in patients from Saudi Arabia.","['(c) 2018 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud', 'University.']","['Farasani, Abdullah']",['Farasani A'],,"['College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jazan University, Jazan-45142, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181221,Saudi Arabia,Saudi J Biol Sci,Saudi journal of biological sciences,101543796,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'GST', 'GSTM1', 'GSTP1', 'GSTT1']",2019/11/26 06:00,2019/11/26 06:01,['2019/11/26 06:00'],"['2018/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.sjbs.2018.12.011 [doi]', 'S1319-562X(18)30308-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Saudi J Biol Sci. 2019 Nov;26(7):1525-1530. doi: 10.1016/j.sjbs.2018.12.011.

METHODS: HL60 cells were infected with Reo3 at different multiplicity of infection (MOI) with the uninfected HL60 cells as control group. After 48 h of infection, the activity of HL60 cells infected with virus at different MOI was detected by CCK8 method to investigate the influence of MOI to cell activity. Simultaneously, the apoptotic rate of HL60 cells was detected by flow cytometry, and the activation level of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and the expression of apoptotic-related protein in HL60 cells were detected by Western blot. Before infection with Reo3 for 48 h, HL60 cells were treated with 2-aminopurine (2-AP), a specific inhibitor of PKR, for 24 h. Afterward, the apoptotic level and expression of apoptotic related proteins were detected. RESULTS: Activity of HL60 cells was obviously inhibited after infected with Reo3 with a MOI of 1 for 48 h. The cell survival rate was (24.333+/-3.396)% and the apoptotic rate was (29.96+/-2.06)%. Both rates were all higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Western blot results showed that the expression levels of PKR, p-PKR, Bax, Caspase3 and cleaved Caspase3 in HL60 cells infected with Reo3 were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05), while the expression level of Bcl-2 was lower (P < 0.05). Compared with the group without inhibitor, the apoptotic rate of HL60 cells pretreated with 2-AP decreased (P < 0.05), the phosphorylation level of PKR and the expression level of apoptotic-related protein also decreased (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oncolytic virus Reo3 could activate PKR in HL60 cells and thus induce apoptosis of HL60 cells.","['Copyright(c) by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science', 'Edition).']","['Li, Chen', 'Mo, Jing', 'Shu, Li-Ping', 'Wu, Xi-Jun', 'Xu, Jian-Wei', 'Yang, Yan', 'He, Zhi-Xu']","['Li C', 'Mo J', 'Shu LP', 'Wu XJ', 'Xu JW', 'Yang Y', 'He ZX']",,"['Tissue Engineering and Stem Cell Research Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medicine University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Adult Stem Cell Translational Research, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Tissue Engineering and Stem Cell Research Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medicine University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Adult Stem Cell Translational Research, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Tissue Engineering and Stem Cell Research Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medicine University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Adult Stem Cell Translational Research, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Tissue Engineering and Stem Cell Research Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medicine University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Adult Stem Cell Translational Research, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Tissue Engineering and Stem Cell Research Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medicine University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Adult Stem Cell Translational Research, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Tissue Engineering and Stem Cell Research Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medicine University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Adult Stem Cell Translational Research, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Adult Stem Cell Translational Research, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563003, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

As the key feature of AML is the blockade of hematopoietic cell maturation, considerable attention has been paid to 'differentiation therapy' aimed at transforming AML cells into more mature, benign phenotypes using pharmacological agents. Here we report a hyaluronic acid-(-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (HA-EGCG) conjugate as a unique anti-leukemic agent, capable of selectively killing AML cells as well as promoting their terminal differentiation into monocytes and granulocytes. This 'two-pronged' effect of the HA-EGCG conjugate was demonstrated in two different AML cell lines (NB4 and HL60), but absent in a physical mixture (HA + EGCG), highlighting the importance of HA conjugation for targeting of EGCG moieties to AML cells. Moreover, administration of the HA-EGCG conjugate not only suppressed AML progression, but also prolonged survival in the HL60 xenograft mouse model.

The most common indications for autologous HCT are multiple myeloma and lymphoma, and for allogenic HCT are acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Older adults into their eighth decade of life can have favorable outcomes after autologous and allogeneic HCT, at least among select patients. Evaluation of older adults prior to HCT can be aided by utilizing a geriatric assessment (GA). GA can identify areas of vulnerability in older adults prior to HCT not captured by more traditional measures. In the future, GA may be utilized to guide interventions prior to HCT to improve outcomes of older adults. Further studies are needed to expand the paucity of data in utilizing GA to identify three groups of patients: those who clearly benefit from HCT, those who would clearly be harmed, and those who might benefit but would require additional support during and after HCT.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we show that Hesx1 is expressed in the preimplantation mouse embryo, where it is required during developmental diapause. Absence of Hesx1 leads to reduced expression of epiblast and primitive endoderm determinants and failure of diapaused embryos to resume embryonic development after implantation. Genetic deletion of Hesx1 impairs self-renewal and promotes differentiation toward epiblast by reducing the expression of pluripotency factors and decreasing the activity of LIF/STAT3 signaling. We reveal that Hesx1-deficient ESCs show elevated ERK pathway activation, resulting in accelerated differentiation toward primitive endoderm, which can be prevented by overexpression of Hesx1. Together, our data provide evidence for a novel role of Hesx1 in the control of self-renewal and maintenance of the undifferentiated state in ESCs and mouse embryos.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

However, due to side effects and resistance, BCR-ABL1(T315I)-mutated CML remains a clinical challenge. Hydroxyurea (HU) has been used for cytoreduction in CML for decades. We found that HU suppresses or even eliminates BCR-ABL1(T315I)+ sub-clones in heavily pretreated CML patients. Based on this observation, we investigated the effects of HU on TKI-resistant CML cells in vitro. METHODS: Viability, apoptosis and proliferation of drug-exposed primary CML cells and BCR-ABL1+ cell lines were examined by flow cytometry and (3)H-thymidine-uptake. Expression of drug targets was analyzed by qPCR and Western blotting. FINDINGS: HU was more effective in inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells harboring BCR-ABL1(T315I) or T315I-including compound-mutations compared to cells expressing wildtype BCR-ABL1. Moreover, HU synergized with ponatinib and ABL001 in inducing growth inhibition in CML cells. Furthermore, HU blocked cell cycle progression in leukemic cells, which was accompanied by decreased expression of CDK4 and CDK6. Palbociclib, a more specific CDK4/CDK6-inhibitor, was also found to suppress proliferation in primary CML cells and to synergize with ponatinib in producing growth inhibition in BCR-ABL1(T315I)+ cells, suggesting that suppression of CDK4/CDK6 may be a promising concept to overcome BCR-ABL1(T315I)-associated TKI resistance. INTERPRETATION: HU and the CDK4/CDK6-blocker palbociclib inhibit growth of CML clones expressing BCR-ABL1(T315I) or complex T315I-including compound-mutations. Clinical studies are required to confirm single drug effects and the efficacy of `ponatinib+HU and ponatinib+palbociclib combinations in advanced CML.

We explore ventricular repolarization dynamic changes and the influence of clinical factors in APL patients during arsenic trioxide induction therapy. METHODS: APL patients receiving arsenic trioxide induction therapy were included. Arsenic trioxide effects on ventricular repolarization-related indicators such as QTc, QT interval dispersion (QTd), heart rate-corrected J to T-peak (JTpC), and T-peak to T-end covariate (TpTec) interphase were statistically analyzed. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the correlation between various clinical factors and changes in repolarization indexes. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were recruited finally. Seven patients with QTc > 500 ms after arsenic trioxide treatment were discontinued from the study. QTc, QTd and JTpC interphase prolonged on day 8; TpTec prolongation was observed at the late induction stage. The risk factors were disease risk, hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase for QTc; hemoglobin for QTd; disease risk and hemoglobin for JTpC and TpTec. CONCLUSION: QTc, QTd and JTpC were prolonged in the early use of arsenic trioxide and in contrast with TpTec. Hypothrombinemia was a common risk factor of ventricular repolarization prolongation and should be considered in preventing cardiac adverse effects of arsenic trioxide in APL patients.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

Chronological aging is accompanied by decreasing stem cell and solid organ reserve as well as an increased incidence of medical comorbidity. For the older patient with AML, these patient-specific factors are compounded by an association with complexity of disease biology, chemoresistance, poor tolerance and early mortality with intensive induction therapy. However, the investigation and availability of therapies targeted against various molecular drivers of leukemogenesis, leukemic stem cell persistence, and chemoresistance have provided more options for the patient ineligible for intensive or classical induction therapy, often guided by age >60-65 years by some treatment algorithms. Many providers remain appropriately optimistic that such therapies may overtake the longstanding recommendation for frontline intensive therapy in certain circumstances.

Unfortunately, whether as a single agent, component of combined chemotherapy, or as a chemosensitizer or radiosensitizer combined with interventional therapy/radiotherapy, it did not benefit treatment of solid tumor (liver cancer, bladder cancer, glioma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma) as seen from the clinical trials reported from the published journals or FDA-approved trials in the past decades. The clinical outcome failed to live up to our expectations, which was attributed to severe systemic toxicity and inappropriate pharmacokinetic such as low delivery efficiency and rapid renal elimination. Nanomedicine is designed to fuel up pharmaceuticals and polish off adverse effects by the moderation of their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Nevertheless, quite a few nanodrugs (such as Doxil, Abraxane) were approved to be used clinically, and ""from bench to bedside"" it seems to be no easy way for most of them, such as nano-ATO. Encapsulating ATO into several types of nano-vehicles (liposome, polymer micelle, porous silicon, etc.), nano-TO can improve pharmacokinetic and become a prominent candidate to penetrate into tumor tissue, but so far no nano- ATO clinical trials have been approved around the world. On summarizing the clinical trials of ATO on solid tumor and preclinical study of nano-ATO, it is believed there is still a chance for ATO to play a critical co-helper in a comprehensive therapy to fight with solid tumor.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Fu, Xin', 'Li, Yan-Shu', 'Zhao, Jun', 'Yu, Lu-Lu', 'Luo, Rong-Guang', 'Liang, Qing-Rong', 'Tang, Qun']","['Fu X', 'Li YS', 'Zhao J', 'Yu LL', 'Luo RG', 'Liang QR', 'Tang Q']",,"['Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Supervision and Inspection Center for Medical Devices, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Institute for Advanced Study, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Medical Imaging and Interventional Radiology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Institute for Advanced Study, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Institute for Advanced Study, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Mini Rev Med Chem,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', 'Drug Compounding', 'Humans', 'Nanomedicine', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenic trioxide', 'comprehensive therapy', 'drug delivery', 'nanomedicine', 'pharmacokinetics', 'solid tumor.']",2019/11/26 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2019/11/26 06:00'],"['2019/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['MRMC-EPUB-101625 [pii]', '10.2174/1389557519666191018155426 [doi]']",ppublish,Mini Rev Med Chem. 2020;20(3):239-251. doi: 10.2174/1389557519666191018155426.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Recommendations are based on diligent reviews of clinical evidence with transparent incorporation of subjective factors, according to established AACE/ACE guidelines for guidelines protocols. Results: The Executive Summary of this 2019 updated guideline contains 58 numbered recommendations: 12 are Grade A (21%), 19 are Grade B (33%), 21 are Grade C (36%), and 6 are Grade D (10%). These detailed, evidence-based recommendations allow for nuance-based clinical decision-making that addresses multiple aspects of real-world care of patients. The evidence base presented in the subsequent Appendix provides relevant supporting information for the Executive Summary recommendations. This update contains 357 citations of which 51 (14%) are evidence level (EL) 1 (strong), 168 (47%) are EL 2 (intermediate), 61 (17%) are EL 3 (weak), and 77 (22%) are EL 4 (no clinical evidence). Conclusion: This CPG is a practical tool that practicing endocrinologists and regulatory bodies can refer to regarding the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of adults and patients transitioning from pediatric to adult-care services with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). It provides guidelines on assessment, screening, diagnostic testing, and treatment recommendations for a range of individuals with various causes of adult GHD. The recommendations emphasize the importance of considering testing patients with a reasonable level of clinical suspicion of GHD using appropriate growth hormone (GH) cut-points for various GH-stimulation tests to accurately diagnose adult GHD, and to exercise caution interpreting serum GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, as various GH and IGF-1 assays are used to support treatment decisions. The intention to treat often requires sound clinical judgment and careful assessment of the benefits and risks specific to each individual patient. Unapproved uses of GH, long-term safety, and the current status of long-acting GH preparations are also discussed in this document. LAY ABSTRACT This updated guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding the identification, screening, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment for a range of individuals with various causes of adult growth-hormone deficiency (GHD) and patients with childhood-onset GHD transitioning to adult care. The update summarizes the most current knowledge about the accuracy of available GH-stimulation tests, safety of recombinant human GH (rhGH) replacement, unapproved uses of rhGH related to sports and aging, and new developments such as long-acting GH preparations that use a variety of technologies to prolong GH action. Recommendations offer a framework for physicians to manage patients with GHD effectively during transition to adult care and adulthood. Establishing a correct diagnosis is essential before consideration of replacement therapy with rhGH. Since the diagnosis of GHD in adults can be challenging, GH-stimulation tests are recommended based on individual patient circumstances and use of appropriate GH cut-points. Available GH-stimulation tests are discussed regarding variability, accuracy, reproducibility, safety, and contraindications, among other factors. The regimen for starting and maintaining rhGH treatment now uses individualized dose adjustments, which has improved effectiveness and reduced reported side effects, dependent on age, gender, body mass index, and various other individual characteristics. With careful dosing of rhGH replacement, many features of adult GHD are reversible and side effects of therapy can be minimized. Scientific studies have consistently shown rhGH therapy to be beneficial for adults with GHD, including improvements in body composition and quality of life, and have demonstrated the safety of short- and long-term rhGH replacement.

In this study, to generate conditionally immortalized lymphoid progenitor (ciLP) cell lines, murine hematopoietic progenitor cells were transduced with an inducible lentiviral ""all-in-one"" vector expressing LMO2 under doxycycline (DOX) stimulation and the reverse tetracycline-regulated transactivator (rtTA3). For selection of LMO2-expressing ciLPs (LMO2-ciLPs) and longitudinal manipulation in T cell differentiation lymphoid conditions, we developed a robust approach based on coculture with OP9-DL1 stromal cells and improved cytokine conditions allowing a controlled balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro. LMO2-ciLP cell lines with the highest proliferation, vector copy number, and similar insertion pattern were selected for LMO2 ""on/off"" in vitro study. LMO2 expression under DOX induction resulted in a double negative (DN) 2 differentiation arrest and a propagation of CD44(+)CD25(-) myeloid cell population characterized by lymphoid and myeloid phenotypes, respectively. Both DN2 and CD44(+)CD25(-) myeloid cell subpopulations expressed c-KIT, suggesting that LMO2-ciLPs were similar to uncommitted progenitors under DOX supplementation. DOX removal resulted in cessation of ectopic LMO2 expression and LMO2-ciLPs continued T cell lymphoid differentiation accompanied by c-KIT downregulation and interleukin 7 receptor expression. Switching off LMO2 expression was accompanied by increased Notch signaling and significant reduction of the CD44(+)CD25(-) myeloid cell population under T cell differentiation lymphoid conditions. Although vector insertions in cooperation with LMO2 expression could influence the fate of LMO2-ciLPs and additional experiments are required to evaluate it, our approach provides a promising tool to investigate mechanisms underlying stem cell, leukemia, and lymphocyte biology, leading to novel approaches for disease modeling and therapy evaluation.",,"['Koniaeva, Ekaterina', 'Stahlhut, Maike', 'Lange, Lucas', 'Sauer, Martin G', 'Kustikova, Olga S', 'Schambach, Axel']","['Koniaeva E', 'Stahlhut M', 'Lange L', 'Sauer MG', 'Kustikova OS', 'Schambach A']",,"['Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence REBIRTH, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence REBIRTH, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence REBIRTH, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence REBIRTH, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence REBIRTH, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200124,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tetracyclines)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Plasmids/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Tetracyclines/*pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Transgenes']",['NOTNLM'],"['*LMO2', '*conditional immortalization', '*conditionally immortalized lymphoid progenitors', '*lentiviral ""all-in-one"" vector', '*lymphoid progenitor cell lines', '*tetracycline-regulated']",2019/11/26 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2019/11/26 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2019.212 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2020 Feb;31(3-4):183-198. doi: 10.1089/hum.2019.212.

The median age was 55 years [2-79] with 10/17 (59%) male subjects. The underlying diseases motivating IVIG infusion were neurologic diseases in 35% of cases (Guillain Barre syndrome = 2, peripheral neuropathy = 2, neurolupus = 1, myasthenia = 1), multiple myeloma with hypogammaglobulinemia (n = 2; 12%), primary hypogammaglobulinemia (n = 2; 12%), autoimmune cytopenias (n = 2; 12%), graft versus host cutaneous disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 1), anti-HLA antibodies after lung transplant (n = 1), cancer-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-haemolytic uremic syndrome (n = 1), Kawasaki disease (n = 1) and in experimental essay (n = 1). TRALI symptoms begin either after the start or during the infusion (n = 7; 41%), or after the infusion (n = 10; 59%, 10 min to 24 h). Besides respiratory distress, it was also noted shock (33%), fever (18 %), cough (18%), nausea/vomiting (18 %), chills (12%) and agitation (12%).

By measuring these adducts in neonatal blood spots (NBS), we obtain information regarding fetal exposures during the last month of gestation. To discover potential risk factors for childhood leukemia resulting from in utero exposures, we used untargeted adductomics to measure HSA-Cys34 adducts in 782 archived NBS, collected from incident cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and matched population-based controls. Among a total of 28 Cys34 modifications that were measured, we found no differences in adduct abundances between childhood leukemia cases and controls overall. However, cases of T-cell ALL had higher abundances of adducts of reactive carbonyl species and a Cys34 disulfide of homocysteine was present at lower levels in AML cases. These results suggest that oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation may be etiologic factors of T-cell ALL, and alterations in one-carbon metabolism and epigenetic changes may be predictors of AML.

There are five types of WBC. These are called Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils and Neutrophils. The number of WBC types and the total number of WBCs provide important information about our health status. Diseases such as leukemia, AIDS, autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, blood diseases can be diagnosed based on the number of WBCs. In this study, a computer-aided automated system that can easily identify and locate WBC types in blood images has been proposed. Current blood test devices usually detect WBCs with traditional image processing methods such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Deep learning methodology is superior to traditional image processing methods in literature. In addition, traditional methods require the appearance of the whole object to be able to recognize objects. Contrary to traditional methods, convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning architecture, can extract features from a part of an object and perform object recognition. In this case, a CNN-based system shows a higher performance in recognizing partially visible cells for reasons such as overlap or only partial visibility of the image. Therefore, it has been the motivation of this study to increase the performance of existing blood test devices with deep learning method. Blood cells have been identified and classified by Regional Based Convolutional Neural Networks. Designed architectures have been trained and tested by combining BCCD data set and LISC data set. Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (R - CNN) has been used as a methodology. In this way, different cell types within the same image have been classified simultaneously with a detector. While training CNN which is the basis of R - CNN architecture; AlexNet, VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet50 architectures have been tested with full learning and transfer learning. At the end of the study, the system has showed 100% success in determining WBC cells. ResNet50, one of the CNN architectures, has showed the best performance with transfer learning. Cell types of Lymphocyte were determined with 99.52% accuracy rate, Monocyte with 98.40% accuracy rate, Basophil with 98.48% accuracy rate, Eosinophil with 96.16% accuracy rate and Neutrophil with 95.04% accuracy rate.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we examined the early stages of hepatic organoid formation to identify key pathways affecting early liver development. METHODS: Single-cell RNA-sequencing and metabolomic analysis was performed on developing organoid cultures at the iPSC, hepatoblast (day 9) and mature organoid stage. The importance of the phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pathway to early liver development was examined in developing organoid cultures using iPSC with a CRISPR-mediated gene knockout and an over the counter medication (meclizine) that inhibits the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. Meclizine's effect on the growth of a human hepatocarcinoma cell line in a xenotransplantation model and on the growth of acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro was also examined. RESULTS: Transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of organoid development indicated that the phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pathway is essential for early liver development. Unexpectedly, early hepatoblasts were selectively sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of meclizine. We demonstrate that meclizine could be repurposed for use in a new synergistic combination therapy for primary liver cancer: a glycolysis inhibitor reprograms cancer cell metabolism to make it susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of meclizine. This combination inhibited the growth of a human liver carcinoma cell line in vitro and in a xenotransplantation model, without causing significant side effects. This drug combination was also highly active against acute myeloid leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis is a targetable pathway for cancer; meclizine may have clinical efficacy as a repurposed anti-cancer drug when used as part of a new combination therapy. LAY SUMMARY: The early stages of human liver development were modeled using human hepatic organoids. We identified a pathway that was essential for early liver development. Based upon this finding, a novel combination drug therapy was identified that could be used to treat primary liver cancer and possibly other types of cancer.","['Copyright (c) 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Here we review the principles behind SDM, discuss unique aspects of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that complicate the decision-making process, and provide one recommended framework for how to implement SDM into practice. DATA SOURCES: Published literature and clinical experiences. CONCLUSION: AML poses unique challenges to treatment decision-making. These challenges can be effectively addressed by following the SDM framework in practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses can play an important role in the AML treatment decision-making process.

However, mutations in the kinase domain contribute to drug resistance against TKIs which compromises the treatment response. Our aim is to explore regions outside the BCR-ABL oncoprotein to identify potential therapeutic targets to curb drug resistance by targeting growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 (Grb-2) which binds to BCR-ABL at the phosphorylated tyrosine (Y177) thereby activating the Ras and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. METHODS: We have used in silico methods to repurpose drugs for identifying their potential to inhibit the binding of Grb-2 with Y177 by occupying the active binding site of the BCR domain. RESULTS: Differentially expressed genes from GEO dataset were found to be associated with hematopoietic cell lineage, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, NF-kappaB and chemokine signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, histidine metabolism and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. The fold recognition method of SPARKS-X tool was used to model the BCR domain (Z-score = 8.21). Connectivity Map generated a drug list based on the gene expression profile, which were docked with BCR. Schrodinger XP glide docking identified Diphosphopyridine nucleotide, Hesperidin, Butirosin, Ovoflavin, and Nor-dihydroguaiaretic acid to show strong interaction in close proximity to the active binding pocket containing Y177 of the target protein and was further validated using iGEMDOCK and Parallelized Open Babel and AutoDock suite Pipeline (POAP). CONCLUSION: Our study not only extends our current knowledge about repurposing drugs for newer indications but also provides a route towards combinatorial therapy with standard drugs used for CML treatment. However, the efficacy of these repurposed drugs needs to be further investigated using in vitro and in vivo studies.<br />.",,"['Natarajan, Aparna', 'Thangarajan, Rajkumar', 'Kesavan, Sabitha']","['Natarajan A', 'Thangarajan R', 'Kesavan S']",,"['Department of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, India.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, India.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, Chennai, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191101,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Repositioning/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Grb-2', ""TKI's"", 'Tyrosine 177', 'computational drug repurposing']",2019/11/25 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/11/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2019.20.11.3399 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2019 Nov 1;20(11):3399-3406. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2019.20.11.3399.,PMC7063026,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some patients develop resistance to imatinib even after attaining a response. Mutation in ABCB1 efflux transporters is one of the known mechanisms of resistance to imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. This study was aimed to investigate the association of ABCB1 C1236T polymorphism in Indonesian chronic myeloid patients with molecular response to imatinib treatment. METHODS: We analyzed 120 samples from chronic myeloid leukemia patients in the chronic phase, who had been on imatinib treatment for at least 12 months. We analyzed the C1236T variant of the ABCB1 gene using PCR, followed by direct sequencing, and associate them with the achievement of major molecular response (MMR). RESULTS: The major molecular response was achieved in 28% of patients. The frequencies of the SNPs were CC (40%), CT (46%), and TT (14%). Our result showed that there was a lack of association between polymorphism of ABCB1 C1236T and imatinib response in Indonesian patients, with OR = 0.646 (95% CI: 0.283, 1.471; p>0.05).

The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of allogeneic HCT performed in CR2 comparing patients with prior consolidation by autologous HCT versus patients with chemotherapy consolidation. Included were 2619 adults with allogeneic HCT in CR2 from 2000 to 2017 with (n = 417) or without (n = 2202) prior autologous HCT. Patient groups were not entirely comparable; patients with prior autologous HCT were younger, had less often a favorable cytogenetic profile, had more commonly donors other than matched siblings, and more often received reduced-intensity conditioning. In multivariate analysis, nonrelapse mortality risks in patients with prior autologous HCT were 1.34 (1.07 to 1.67; P = .01) after adjustment for age, cytogenetic risk, transplant year, donor, conditioning intensity, sex matching, interval diagnosis-relapse, and relapse-allogeneic HCT as compared with chemotherapy consolidation. Similarly, risks of events in leukemia-free survival and graft-versus-host disease, relapse-free survival were higher with prior autologous HCT, 1.17 (1.01 to 1.35), P = .03 and 1.18 (1.03 to 1.35), P = .02, respectively. Risk of death was also higher, 1.13 (0.97 to 1.32), P = .1, but this was not significant.

The underlying etiology is most commonly compression secondary to a large herniated lumbosacral disk; however, any pathology affecting the rootlets can result in the syndrome. METHODS: We present a rare case of CES secondary to neoplastic polyradiculitis in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and review the pertinent literature. A 72-year-old male with a medical history of AML presented with 2 weeks of difficulty ambulating, followed by acute-onset low back pain radiating to the buttocks bilaterally. RESULTS: Imaging of the lumbar spine demonstrated diffuse enhancement and thickening of the cauda equina rootlets. Lumbar puncture showed numerous blasts with monocytoid features consistent with AML, and the patient was diagnosed with polyradiculopathy of the cauda equina secondary to diffuse metastatic infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Central nervous system involvement of leukemia is poorly understood, even though such lesions are not uncommon in advanced disease. As treatment has improved, many types of leukemia, such as AML, are believed to be curable, and patients with the disease are living longer. With improved survival, it is reasonable to suspect that such involvement by AML may become more common. Our patient is a classic presentation of CES secondary to diffuse infiltration by AML and serves as an example of this rare manifestation of hematologic malignancy.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The survival analysis showed that high AR mRNA is associated with poor survival of stomach adenocarcinoma and low-grade glioma, but better survival of adrenocortical carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, and skin cutaneous melanoma based on AR mRNA, protein or AR-score.

Despite substantial response rates, clinical use of the PLK inhibitor volasertib has been hampered by elevated side effects such as neutropenia and infections. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to analyse whether a reduced dose of volasertib was able to limit toxic effects on the healthy haematopoiesis while retaining its therapeutic effect. METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) of patients with MDS/sAML (n = 73) and healthy controls (n = 28) were treated with volasertib (1 muM to 1 nM) or vehicle control. Short-term viability analysis was performed by flow cytometry after 72 hours. For long-term viability analysis, colony-forming capacity was assessed after 14 days. Protein expression of RIPK3 and MCL-1 was quantified via flow cytometry. RESULTS: Reduced dose levels of volasertib retained high cell death-inducing efficacy in primary human stem and progenitor cells of MDS/sAML patients without affecting healthy haematopoiesis in vitro. Interestingly, volasertib reduced colony-forming capacity and cell survival independent of clinical stage or mutational status. CONCLUSIONS: Volasertib offers a promising therapeutic approach in patients with adverse prognostic profile. RIPK3 and MCL-1 might be potential biomarkers for sensitivity to volasertib treatment.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The themes addressed included cases with borderline features between hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions, the diagnostic spectrum of IgG4-related disease, T cell lymphoproliferations arising in extranodal sites with presumed indolent behaviour, diverse clinical presentations of intravascular large B cell lymphoma, diagnostic problems encountered with tumours displaying plasmablastic morphology, pitfalls concerning rare entities like adult T cell lymphoma/leukaemia (ATLL) and extranodal natural killer/T cell (NK/T) lymphomas, and unusual clinical presentations of various lymphomas. Altogether, within the frame of these two sessions, 75 cases remarkably differing in their clinical background, genetic features and overall need for a meticulous diagnostic approach were presented and discussed. In this paper, the salient points raised during the discussion of the cases, current diagnostic concepts and recommendations relevant to the diagnosis of these lymphoproliferations are described.",,"['Dotlic, Snjezana', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'King, Rebecca L', 'Oschlies, Ilske', 'Ferry, Judith', 'Calaminici, Maria', 'Montes-Moreno, Santiago', 'Goodlad, John R', 'Ott, German', 'Traverse-Glehen, Alexandra']","['Dotlic S', 'Ponzoni M', 'King RL', 'Oschlies I', 'Ferry J', 'Calaminici M', 'Montes-Moreno S', 'Goodlad JR', 'Ott G', 'Traverse-Glehen A']",,"['Department of Pathology and Cytology, University Hospital Centre Zagreb and Department of Pathology, University of Zagreb Medical School, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Ateneo Vita-Salute San Raffaele and Pathology Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph node Registry, University Hospitals Schleswig-Holstein, Christian-Albrecht-University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cellular Pathology, SIHMDS, Barts Health NHS Trust and Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Anatomic Pathology Service and Translational Hematopathology Lab, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla/IDIVAL, Santander, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, UK.', 'Abteilung fur Klinische Pathologie, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Auerbachstrasse 110, Stuttgart, Germany. german.ott@rbk.de.', ""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Service d'Anatomie Pathologique, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, UMR CNRS Universite Lyon 1, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191122,Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,,IM,"['Education', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G4-Related Disease/classification/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/classification/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T cell lymphoma/leukaemia', 'Extranodal Hodgkin lymphoma', 'Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma', 'High grade B cell lymphoma', 'IgG4-related disease', 'Indolent lymphoproliferations', 'Intravascular large B cell lymphoma', 'Plasmablastic lymphoma', 'Plasmablastic myeloma', 'Transformed and composite lymphomas']",2019/11/24 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/11/24 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00428-019-02702-w [doi]', '10.1007/s00428-019-02702-w [pii]']",ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2020 May;476(5):633-646. doi: 10.1007/s00428-019-02702-w.

Heart and renal involvement were more and less prevalent, respectively, with increasing BMPCs. Patients with >/=20% BMPCs had higher likelihood for classic myeloma phenotype with less skewed lambda restriction, a higher rate of intact immunoglobulin secretion, a lower hemoglobin and higher rates of hypercalcemia and bone lytic lesions. High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities were more common in >/=20% BMPCs. Complete hematological response was less frequent with rising BMPCs. The median survival was inversely associated with the BMPC groups (81, 33, 12 months for <5%, 5-19%, and >/=20% BMPCs, respectively; P < 0.001). Survival discrimination was maintained at 1-year landmark and in those who achieved a complete response. Multivariate analysis accounting for known prognostic markers yielded an independent prognostic role for >/=20% BMPCs, but not for the other BMPC groups.

We previously showed that the central transcriptional mediator of Wnt signaling LEF1 is able to cause AML in mice and acts as an independent prognostic factor in normal karyotype AML. Here, we show that treatment naive normal karyotype AML as well as samples AML LSCs predominantly express the long beta-catenin-binding isoform of LEF1 in sharp contrast to normal human hematopoietic stem cells, which lack expression of the long isoform, but express the short N-terminally truncated isoform with loss of the beta-catenin-binding site. Gene expression and ChiP-Seq analyses in mice linked the long isoform to Wnt-beta-catenin signaling and oncogenic pathways, the N-terminally truncated isoform to stemness associated genes. Approaches impairing binding of LEF1 to beta-catenin significantly impaired AML growth, but spared normal hematopoietic stem cells. This report now demonstrates a striking difference of LEF1 isoform expression between normal and AML cells, contributing to higher vulnerability of leukemic cells to approaches targeting beta-catenin/LEF1 interaction.",,"['Feder, Kristin', 'Edmaier-Schroger, Katrin', 'Rawat, Vijay P S', 'Kirsten, Nicole', 'Metzeler, Klaus', 'Kraus, Johann M', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Kestler, Hans A', 'Feuring-Buske, Michaela', 'Buske, Christian']","['Feder K', 'Edmaier-Schroger K', 'Rawat VPS', 'Kirsten N', 'Metzeler K', 'Kraus JM', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H', 'Kestler HA', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Buske C']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4759-5254'],"['Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, CCC and University Hospital of Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, CCC and University Hospital of Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, CCC and University Hospital of Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, CCC and University Hospital of Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, CCC and University Hospital of Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, CCC and University Hospital of Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany. christian.buske@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191122,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinogenesis', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', '*Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin']",,,2019/11/24 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/11/24 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0635-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0635-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Apr;34(4):1027-1037. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0635-1.

We report our experience with patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with indeterminate day 14 bone marrow biopsy results treated with reinduction chemotherapy versus observation alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to assess the outcomes of adult patients with newly diagnosed AML treated with or without reinduction chemotherapy for indeterminate day 14 bone marrow results. RESULTS: We identified 50 patients with indeterminate day 14 bone marrow results. Of the 50 patients, 25 (50%) had received reinduction therapy and 25 (50%) had not. Of the 50 patients, 24 (48%) had poor risk disease, 12 in the reinduction arm (10 with an abnormal karyotype and 2 with a normal karyotype with molecular abnormalities) and 12 in the observation arm (6 with an abnormal karyotype and 6 with a normal karyotype with molecular abnormalities). The overall response rate (complete remission plus complete remission with incomplete count recovery) was similar in both treatment arms (80% vs. 80%). No statistically significant difference was found in the median overall survival (13 months vs. 21 months; P = .88) or relapse-free survival (13 months vs. 33 months; P = .53) between the 2 treatment arms. CONCLUSION: Our study did not find a statistically significant difference in the overall response rates or survival outcome measures for patients with AML and indeterminate day 14 bone marrow in the 2 treatment groups. Our findings question the utility of immediate reinduction chemotherapy and raise concern regarding overtreatment in this patient population. Larger studies investigating similar outcomes are warranted to validate our clinical findings.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We performed orthotopic autotransplantation of 1 mm(3) testicular tissue fragments recovered form mice (aged 4-5 weeks). Fragments were either non-encapsulated, encapsulated in an alginate matrix, or encapsulated in an alginate matrix containing NECINH-NPs. Grafts were recovered 5- and 21-days post-transplantation. We evaluated tissue integrity (hematoxylin-eosin staining), germ cells survival (immunohistochemistry for promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger, VASA, and protein-boule-like), apoptosis (immunohistochemistry for active-caspase 3), and lipid peroxidation (immunohistochemistry for malondialdehyde). NECINH-NPs significantly improved testicular tissue integrity and germ cells' survival after 21 days. Oxidative stress was reduced after 5 days, regardless of nanoparticle incorporation.

Recently, high CALCRL expression has been shown to be associated with a poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We investigate, therefore, the functional role of the CGRP-CALCRL axis in AML. To this end, in silico analyses, human AML cell lines, primary patient samples, and a C57BL/6-based mouse model of AML are used. We find that CALCRL is up-regulated at relapse of AML, in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) versus bulk leukemic cells, and in LSCs versus normal hematopoietic stem cells. CGRP protects receptor-positive AML cell lines and primary AML samples from apoptosis induced by cytostatic drugs used in AML therapy, and this effect is inhibited by specific antagonists. Furthermore, the CGRP antagonist olcegepant increases differentiation and reduces the leukemic burden as well as key stem cell properties in a mouse model of AML. These data provide a basis for further investigations into a possible role of CGRP-CALCRL inhibition in the therapy of AML.",,"['Gluexam, Tobias', 'Grandits, Alexander M', 'Schlerka, Angela', 'Nguyen,

We previously found that FLT3-ITD activates the mTORC1/S6K/4EBP1 pathway cooperatively through the STAT5/PIM and PI3K/AKT pathways to promote proliferation and survival by enhancing the eIF4F complex formation required for cap-dependent translation. Here, we show that, in contrast to BCR/ABL causing Ph-positive leukemias, FLT3-ITD distinctively activates the serine/threonine kinases RSK1/2 through activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and PDK1 to transduce signals required for FLT3-ITD-dependent, but not BCR/ABL-dependent, proliferation and survival of various cells, including MV4-11. Activation of the MEK/ERK pathway by FLT3-ITD and its negative feedback regulation by RSK were mediated by Gab2/SHP2 interaction. RSK1 phosphorylated S6RP on S235/S236, TSC2 on S1798, and eIF4B on S422 and, in cooperation with PIM, on S406, thus activating the mTORC1/S6K/4EBP1 pathway and eIF4B cooperatively with PIM. RSK1 also phosphorylated Bad on S75 and downregulated BIM-EL in cooperation with ERK. Furthermore, inhibition of RSK1 increased sensitivities to BH3 mimetics inhibiting Mcl-1 or Bcl-2 and induced activation of Bax, leading to apoptosis, as well as inhibition of proliferation synergistically with inhibition of PIM or PI3K. Thus, RSK1 represents a promising target, particularly in combination with PIM or PI3K, as well as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, for novel therapeutic strategies against therapy-resistant FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",,"['Watanabe, Daisuke', 'Nogami, Ayako', 'Okada, Keigo', 'Akiyama, Hiroki', 'Umezawa, Yoshihiro', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Watanabe D', 'Nogami A', 'Okada K', 'Akiyama H', 'Umezawa Y', 'Miura O']",,"['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Medical Hospital, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['15K09467, 18K08349, 19K17852/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and', 'Technology']",['Journal Article'],20191120,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BIM', 'Bad', 'FLT3-ITD', 'PIM', 'RSK', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'eIF4B', 'mTOR']",2019/11/24 06:00,2019/11/24 06:01,['2019/11/24 06:00'],"['2019/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/24 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11121827 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11121827 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Nov 20;11(12). pii: cancers11121827. doi: 10.3390/cancers11121827.,PMC6966435,,,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

So far, alternative RUNX1 rearrangements have been reported only rarely in AML, and the few reports so far have focused on results based on cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction. Acknowledging the inherent limitations of these diagnostic techniques, the true incidence of rare RUNX1 rearrangements may be underestimated. In this report, we present two cases of adult AML, in which we detected rare RUNX1 rearrangements not by conventional cytogenetics but rather by next-generation panel sequencing. These include t(16;21)(q24;q22)/RUNX1-CBFA2T3 and t(7;21)(p22;q22)/RUNX1-USP42, respectively. In both patients the AML was therapy-related and associated with additional structural and numerical alterations thereby conferring bad prognosis. This is in line with previous reports on rare RUNX1 fusions in AML and emphasizes the clinical importance of their detection. In summary, our report not only confirms the clinical utility of NGS for diagnostics of rare reciprocal rearrangements in AML in a real-life scenario but also sheds light on the variety and complexity within AML. It further emphasizes the need for collection of additional cases for deepening insights on their clinical meaning as well as their frequency.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Flach, Johanna', 'Shumilov, Evgenii', 'Joncourt, Raphael', 'Porret, Naomi', 'Tchinda, Joelle', 'Legros, Myriam', 'Scarpelli, Ilaria', 'Hewer, Ekkehard', 'Novak, Urban', 'Schoumans, Jacqueline', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Flach J', 'Shumilov E', 'Joncourt R', 'Porret N', 'Tchinda J', 'Legros M', 'Scarpelli I', 'Hewer E', 'Novak U', 'Schoumans J', 'Bacher U', 'Pabst T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9128-0364', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8771-947X']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim of the Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medicine Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'University Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'University Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', ""Oncology Laboratory, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Center of Laboratory Medicine (ZLM), Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Cancer Genetics, Laboratory Department, CHUV, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Cancer Genetics, Laboratory Department, CHUV, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'University Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Center of Laboratory Medicine (ZLM), Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20191202,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CBFA2T3 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*myeloid gene panel', '*new minimal residual disease marker', '*next-generation sequencing', '*rare RUNX1 rearrangements']",2019/11/23 06:00,2020/10/06 06:00,['2019/11/23 06:00'],"['2019/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22829 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2020 Apr;59(4):268-274. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22829.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between adherence to nutrition-based guidelines for cancer prevention and CLL, in the MCC-Spain case-control study. METHODS: A total of 318 CLL cases and 1293 population-based controls were included in the present study. The World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRC/AICR) score based on the 2018 recommendations for cancer prevention (on body fatness, physical activity, and diet) was constructed. We used logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Individuals in the highest tertile of the WCRF/AICR score had an odds ratio for CLL of 1.25 (95 % CI 0.91; 1.73) compared with individuals with low adherence (p-trend=0.172). Each point increment in the score was associated with an OR for CLL of 1.06 (95 % CI 0.91; 1.23). Analyses by severity of disease did not show significant heterogeneity of effects. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results do not support an association between the WCRF/AICR score and CLL, yet we might have been limited by statistical power and study design to detect modest associations. Further research, ideally with a prospective design, long follow-up, and including additional lymphoma subtypes, is warranted to confirm the impact of composite healthy lifestyle behaviors on lymphoma risk.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

One of the most common molecular alterations in AML is the constitutive activation by internal tandem duplication of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). METHODS: This observational, retrospective, cohort study at the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) had two time periods: 1) a historical pre-midostaurin time period which consisted of the FLT3 mutated (FLT3m) and FLT3 wild type (FLT3wt) cohorts from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016, and 2) a post-midostaurin cohort which consisted of the FLT3 mutated midostaurin-user cohort (early mido) from May 01, 2017 to December 31, 2018. RESULTS: In total, 39 patients were included in the FLT3m cohort, 61 in the FLT3wt cohort, and seven in the early mido cohort. FLT3m patients spent fewer days in the hospital during the first consolidation regimen and received fewer consolidation cycles compared to FLT3wt patients. Overall survival (OS) was similar between FLT3m and FLT3wt patients. For patients without hematopoietic stem cell transplant, OS was significantly shorter for FLT3m patients compared to FLT3wt patients. Mean AML related inpatient charges and physician charges for FLT3m patients were significantly higher than FLT3wt patients. CONCLUSION: The FLT3 mutation is historically associated with a shorter time to transplant and increased total health care charges.

In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration required that unrelated UCBT be performed using either licensed UCB or unlicensed UCB under the Investigational New Drug (IND) program. The National Marrow Donor Program manages an IND under which 2456 patients (1499 adults and 957 children, 564 with malignant diseases and 393 with nonmalignant diseases) underwent single or double UCBT between October 2011 and December 2016. The median patient age was 31 years (range, <1 to 81 years), and 50% of children and 36% of adults were non-Caucasian. The median time to neutrophil engraftment (ie, absolute neutrophil count >/=500/mm(3)) was 22 days for adults, 20 days for pediatric patients with malignant diseases, and 19 days for pediatric patients with nonmalignant diseases, with corresponding rates of engraftment at 42 days of 89%, 88%, and 90%. In these 3 groups of patients, the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV was 35%, 32%, and 24%; the incidence of chronic GVHD was 24%, 26%, and 24%; and 1-year overall survival (OS) was 57%, 71%, and 79%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, younger age, lower Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index, early-stage chemotherapy-sensitive disease, and higher performance score were predictive of improved OS for adults. In a subset analysis of children with malignancies undergoing single UCBT, the use of either licensed UCB (n = 48) or unlicensed UCB (n = 382) was associated with similar engraftment and survival. The use of unlicensed UCB units is safe and effective and provides an important graft source for a diverse population.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

There are multiple front-line therapy options for the treatment of CLL, including chemoimmunotherapy (CIT), ibrutinib, and most recently venetoclax with obinutuzumab. The role of CIT has declined significantly for patients with CLL and novel agents are now being used more frequently in the front-line setting.Areas covered: Authors reviewed the latest data examining the role of CIT versus ibrutinib and ibrutinib combined with CIT for the treatment of CLL. Data reviewed here include: preliminary results from CLL12, long-term results of CLL8 and MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) data with FCR, 7-year follow-up of PCYC-1102/1103 (phase 2 data) with ibrutinib, results of two-phase 3 randomized trials comparing CIT to ibrutinib, E1912 and A041202, and results of HELIOS and other phase 2 trials evaluating CIT combined with ibrutinib.Expert opinion: Treatment approaches for patients with CLL should be individualized and that there is still a role, albeit diminished, for CIT in the treatment of CLL, predominately in the front-line setting. Clinicians should focus on prognostic factors, patient preference, and evaluate short and long-term effects of CIT versus novel agents.

Owing to the condition's rapid progression, it is difficult to identify what is most important to patients when making treatment decisions. Patients' needs can be better addressed by gaining a deeper understanding of their perspectives, which is valuable in the decision-making process. The Food and Drug Administration recently encouraged the use of social media as a tool to gain insight on patients' perspectives regarding symptoms experienced and the impacts of their disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use disease-specific social media posts by patients with AML or MDS who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy and their caregivers to capture factors they feel are most important, and to provide current evidence to inform and characterize these perspectives. METHODS: Posts by patients with AML or MDS and their caregivers were extracted from publicly available discussions on 3 large AML- or MDS-specific sites. These posts were manually reviewed to only include patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. A total of 1443 posts from 220 AML patients/caregivers and 2733 posts from 127 MDS patients/caregivers met the study inclusion criteria. A qualitative data analysis (QDA) of a sample of 85 patients'/caregivers' posts was conducted to identify themes, and a targeted QDA of posts from 79 users focused on treatment decision discussions. Posts were manually reviewed, and relevant text segments were coded and grouped into categories and overall themes. RESULTS: Eighty-six percent (73/85) of users in the overall QDA had relevant information about the key objectives. The most commonly discussed treatment experience theme was the humanistic burden of AML or MDS in terms of emotional/physical impact and impact on family (86%, 63/73 of users), followed by treatment decisions (56%, 41/73) and unmet needs (50%, 37/73). In the QDA of treatment decisions, 60 posts from 45 users contained relevant information. Patients commonly reported the desire to reach specific milestones, including birthdays and weddings. They wished for a better quality of life over quantity of life, did not want the risk of suffering from side effects, and expressed a clear preference to be at home rather than in a hospital or care home. CONCLUSIONS: This study was a novel application of disease-specific social media. It highlighted experiences in the current treatment of AML and MDS, including information gaps, patient/caregiver uncertainty, and the importance of understanding patients'/caregivers' goals and opinions. A clear finding from this research was the importance of reaching certain personal life goals and being at home with family and friends. The analysis showed that patients/caregivers face additional challenges, including humanistic impacts and a lack of information regarding treatment options.","['(c)Alison Booth, Timothy Bell, Sonia Halhol, Shiyu Pan, Verna Welch, Evie', 'Merinopoulou, Dimitra Lambrelli, Andrew Cox.

However, whether this phenomenon is general to other leukemogenic proteins remains unknown. Here, we show that two other leukemogenic proteins, nucleoporin-fusion SET-Nup214 and the NPM1 mutant, NPM1c, which contains a nuclear export signal (NES) at its C-terminus and is one of the most frequent mutations in acute myeloid leukemia, are recruited to the HOX cluster region via chromatin-bound CRM1, leading to HOX gene activation in human leukemia cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism is highly sensitive to a CRM1 inhibitor in leukemia cell line. Together, these findings indicate that CRM1 acts as a key molecule that connects leukemogenic proteins to aberrant HOX gene regulation either via nucleoporin-CRM1 interaction (for SET-Nup214) or NES-CRM1 interaction (for NPM1c).","['(c) 2019, Oka et al.']","['Oka, Masahiro', 'Mura, Sonoko', 'Otani, Mayumi', 'Miyamoto, Yoichi', 'Nogami, Jumpei', 'Maehara, Kazumitsu', 'Harada, Akihito', 'Tachibana, Taro', 'Yoneda, Yoshihiro', 'Ohkawa, Yasuyuki']","['Oka M', 'Mura S', 'Otani M', 'Miyamoto Y', 'Nogami J', 'Maehara K', 'Harada A', 'Tachibana T', 'Yoneda Y', 'Ohkawa Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0123-3060', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6440-9954']","['Laboratory of Nuclear Transport Dynamics, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition (NIBIOHN), Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biomedical Innovation, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Biomolecular Dynamics Group, Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Nuclear Transport Dynamics, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition (NIBIOHN), Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Nuclear Transport Dynamics, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition (NIBIOHN), Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biomedical Innovation, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition (NIBIOHN), Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medical Initiatives, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['16K14676/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International', '17H03679/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International', '25116008/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International', '16H04789/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International', '19H05244/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International', '18H05527/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International', '18H04802/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International', '17H03608/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International', 'MJCR16G1/Japan Science and Technology Agency/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191122,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Export Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Histone Chaperones/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Export Signals/genetics', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CRM1', '*HOX cluster', '*NPM1c', '*SET-Nup214', '*cell biology', '*chromosomes', '*gene expression', '*human', '*leukemia', '*nucleoporin']",2019/11/23 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/11/23 06:00'],"['2019/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7554/eLife.46667 [doi]', '46667 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2019 Nov 22;8. pii: 46667. doi: 10.7554/eLife.46667.,PMC6874418,,,,"['MO, SM, MO, YM, JN, KM, AH, TT, YY, YO No competing interests declared']",,,['GEO/GSE127983'],,,,,,,,

Five chromobox (CBX) homolog proteins, CBX2, CBX4, CBX6, CBX7, and CBX8, are incorporated into PRC1 complexes, where they mediate targeting to trimethylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) via the N-terminal chromodomain (ChD). Individual CBX paralogs have been implicated as drug targets in cancer; however, high similarities in sequence and structure among the CBX ChDs provide a major obstacle in developing selective CBX ChD inhibitors. Here we report the selection of small, focused, DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) against multiple homologous ChDs to identify modifications to a parental ligand that confer both selectivity and potency for the ChD of CBX8. This on-DNA, medicinal chemistry approach enabled the development of SW2_110A, a selective, cell-permeable inhibitor of the CBX8 ChD. SW2_110A binds CBX8 ChD with a Kd of 800 nM, with minimal 5-fold selectivity for CBX8 ChD over all other CBX paralogs in vitro. SW2_110A specifically inhibits the association of CBX8 with chromatin in cells and inhibits the proliferation of THP1 leukemia cells driven by the MLL-AF9 translocation. In THP1 cells, SW2_110A treatment results in a significant decrease in the expression of MLL-AF9 target genes, including HOXA9, validating the previously established role for CBX8 in MLL-AF9 transcriptional activation, and defining the ChD as necessary for this function. The success of SW2_110A provides great promise for the development of highly selective and cell-permeable probes for the full CBX family. In addition, the approach taken provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of how DELs can be used iteratively for optimization of both ligand potency and selectivity.",,"['Wang, Sijie', 'Denton, Kyle E', 'Hobbs, Kathryn F', 'Weaver, Tyler', 'McFarlane, James M B', 'Connelly, Katelyn E', 'Gignac, Michael C', 'Milosevich, Natalia', 'Hof, Fraser', 'Paci, Irina', 'Musselman, Catherine A', 'Dykhuizen, Emily C', 'Krusemark, Casey J']","['Wang S', 'Denton KE', 'Hobbs KF', 'Weaver T', 'McFarlane JMB', 'Connelly KE', 'Gignac MC', 'Milosevich N', 'Hof F', 'Paci I', 'Musselman CA', 'Dykhuizen EC', 'Krusemark CJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2505-1408', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4658-9132', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8356-7971', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2964-3520']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy , Purdue University and Purdue University Center for Cancer Research , 575 Stadium Mall Drive , West Lafayette , Indiana 47906 , United States.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy , Purdue University and Purdue University Center for Cancer Research , 575 Stadium Mall Drive , West Lafayette , Indiana 47906 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Carver College of Medicine , University of Iowa , 51 Newton Road , Iowa City , Iowa 52242 , United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Carver College of Medicine , University of Iowa , 51 Newton Road , Iowa City , Iowa 52242 , United States.', 'Department of Chemistry , University of Victoria , Victoria V8W 3V6 , Canada.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy , Purdue University and Purdue University Center for Cancer Research , 575 Stadium Mall Drive , West Lafayette , Indiana 47906 , United States.', 'Department of Chemistry , University of Victoria , Victoria V8W 3V6 , Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry , University of Victoria , Victoria V8W 3V6 , Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry , University of Victoria , Victoria V8W 3V6 , Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry , University of Victoria , Victoria V8W 3V6 , Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Carver College of Medicine , University of Iowa , 51 Newton Road , Iowa City , Iowa 52242 , United States.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy , Purdue University and Purdue University Center for Cancer Research , 575 Stadium Mall Drive , West Lafayette , Indiana 47906 , United States.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy , Purdue University and Purdue University Center for Cancer Research , 575 Stadium Mall Drive , West Lafayette , Indiana 47906 , United States.']",['eng'],"['U01 CA207532/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001108/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM128705/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NS101535/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM128894/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20191212,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CBX8 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Development', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Library', 'Histones/chemistry', 'Humans', '*Ligands', 'Ligases/metabolism', 'Lysine/chemistry', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2019/11/23 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2019/11/23 06:00'],"['2019/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.9b00654 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2020 Jan 17;15(1):112-131. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.9b00654.

The purpose was to evaluate the different clinical measurements of body composition and to compare with body mass index (BMI). Methods: cross-sectional study of 39 survivors with more than ten years of survivorship since diagnosis. Anthropometry and body composition accuracy measurements were determined and also obesity risk factors. Results: obesity prevalence by body fat percentage were: 38.5% for BMI; 46.1% for waist circumference; 51.3% for skinfolds and 56.4% for bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). There was a good correlation among the measurements, but BMI underestimated the percent body fat among childhood leukemia survivors in comparison with: waist circumference (-1.03 +/- 2.01), skinfolds (-2.95 +/- 5.78) and BIA (-3.78 +/- 7.4), and this bias appears to be more variable with increasing percent of body fat > 30%. Three patients showed sarcopenia and only one sarcopenic obesity. Waist circumference fat mass was the better predictor of cardiovascular risk factors (LDL-cholesterol: r = 0.703; HDL-cholesterol: r = -0.612; p < 0.05 and hypertension: OR 4.17; IC 95%: 1.012-19.3). Obesity risk factors were: female sex, high-risk tumor, radiotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Conclusions: BMI underestimates obese childhood leukemia survivors in comparison with waist circumference, skinfolds and bioelectrial impedance analysis. BMI use could misclassify obese survivors as non-obese.

In multiple malignancies, studies have shown that DDIT4 participates in tumorigenesis and impacts patient survival. We aimed to study the prognostic value of DDIT4 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is currently unclear. Firstly, The Cancer Genome Atlas was screened for AML patients with complete clinical characteristics and DDIT4 expression data. A total of 155 patients were included and stratified according to the treatment modality and the median DDIT4 expression levels. High DDIT4 expressers had shorter overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) than the low expressers among the chemotherapy-only group (all P < .001); EFS and OS were similar in the high and low DDIT4 expressers of the allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) group. Furthermore, in the DDIT4(high) group, patients treated with allo-HSCT had longer EFS and OS than those who received chemotherapy alone (all P < .01). In the DDIT4(low) group, OS and EFS were similar in different treatment groups. Secondly, we analysed two other cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) cohorts derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which confirmed that high DDIT4 expression was associated with poorer survival. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the genes related to DDIT4 expression were mainly concentrated in the acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia signalling pathways. Collectively, our study indicates that high DDIT4 expression may serve as a poor prognostic factor for AML, but its prognostic effects could be outweighed by allo-HSCT.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

For patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), this correlation is unknown. We retrospectively investigated the prognostic value of pretreatment acute phase protein levels in 282 consecutive newly diagnosed AML patients undergoing at least one cycle of intensive induction chemotherapy. We applied a new score integrating pre-treatment C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and albumin levels termed the CFA ratio, and we stratified patients into two groups: Patients with a CFA ratio below 3.06 had decisively better progression-free (26.2 vs 7.7 months; P < .001), disease-free (56.4 vs 8.7 months; P < .001), and overall survival (61.2 vs 13.8 months; P < .001). Results remained significant when adjusting for confounders including European Leukemia Network risk group. Early mortality also tended to be lower in the low CFA ratio group. Finally, patients with lower modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) similarly had better outcome. In conclusion, our data suggest that an elevated CFA ratio as well as a high mGPS are associated with adverse outcome in patients with newly diagnosed AML undergoing intensive induction. These parameters should undergo prospective evaluation for their contribution to risk profiling in AML patients.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Heini, Alexander D', 'Hugo, Rebecca', 'Berger, Martin D', 'Novak, Urban', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Heini AD', 'Hugo R', 'Berger MD', 'Novak U', 'Bacher U', 'Pabst T']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-947X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6055-5257']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital and University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital and University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital and University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital and University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital and University of Berne|, Berne, Switzerland.', 'Center of Laboratory Medicine, Inselspital, University Hospital and University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital and University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20191206,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['C-reactive protein', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'acute phase protein', 'albumin', 'fibrinogen', 'prognosis, outcome']",2019/11/23 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/11/23 06:00'],"['2019/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2696 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Feb;38(1):74-81. doi: 10.1002/hon.2696.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) significantly improves the effectiveness of ATRA. In this study, the effect of ATO on ATRA binding to human serum albumin (HSA) was investigated. Fluorescence and UV-Vis spectroscopy and equilibrium dialysis technique were used to determine ATRA binding to HSA in the presence and absence of ATO and of two compounds, warfarin and ibuprofen, specific for binding to HSA sites I and II, respectively (""site markers""). The association constants for ATRA binding and the number of binding sites as well as the thermodynamic parameters of complex formation, were obtained at different temperatures. Fluorescence results showed a static quenching mechanism for ATRA binding to HSA. The calculated thermodynamic parameters revealed that the binding reaction is a spontaneous and exothermic process and also that hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces have a central role in the binding of ATRA to HSA. Competitive experiments showed that none of markers seriously prevents ATRA binding to HSA. Interestingly, the fluorescence and equilibrium dialysis data showed that ATO increases the binding of ATRA to HSA, and converts the binding mode of ATRA from mainly hydrogen bonding to include hydrophobic interactions as well. These results suggest that ATO can prevent the metabolism of ATRA and keep it in the blood for longer by increasing the binding of ATRA to HSA.",,"['Bagheri, Soghra']",['Bagheri S'],,"['Medical Biology Research Center, Health Technology Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, PO Box 67155-1616, Kermanshah, Iran. sog_bagheri@kums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191121,Netherlands,J Fluoresc,Journal of fluorescence,9201341,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZIF514RVZR (Serum Albumin, Human)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide/*chemistry', 'Binding Sites', 'Energy Transfer', 'Humans', 'Serum Albumin, Human/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tretinoin/*chemistry/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Cancer', 'Chemotherapy', 'FRET', 'Fluorescence spectroscopy', 'RAR-alpha']",2019/11/23 06:00,2020/04/16 06:00,['2019/11/23 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10895-019-02458-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10895-019-02458-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Fluoresc. 2019 Nov;29(6):1277-1283. doi: 10.1007/s10895-019-02458-1.

We observe that the microbiota diversity and richness of the ALL group is significantly lower than that of the control group at diagnosis and during chemotherapy. The microbiota diversity is even lower in antibiotics-exposed ALL patients. Although the gut microbial diversity tends to stabilize after 1-year post-chemotherapy, their abundances were altered because of chemotherapy and prophylactic antibiotic treatments. Specifically, the abundances of mucolytic gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, including Ruminococcus gnavus and Ruminococcus torques, tended to increase during the chemotherapy regimen and continued to be elevated 1 year beyond the initiation of chemotherapy. This dysbiosis may contribute to the development of gastrointestinal complications in ALL children following chemotherapy.

Some studies have reported the prognostic impact of U2AF1 mutant in patients with de novo MDS, with discrepant results, so we do a meta-analysis about the relevant literatures to further investigate their prognostic impact on patients with de novo MDS. We conducted a literature search on databases such as PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to obtain studies on the prognosis of U2AF1 mutant in patients with de novo MDS published up to August 9, 2018. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoint was acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation. We extracted the hazard ratios (HRs) of OS and AML transformation and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analysis was performed by selecting a fixed-effect model or a random-effects model based on the heterogeneity between studies. A total of 14 cohort studies were included in the final meta-analysis, including 3322 patients with de no MDS, in which 390 patients were associated with U2AF1 mutant. The results showed that U2AF1 mutant had an adverse prognostic impact on OS (HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.45-2.33, P < 0.00001) and AML transformation (HR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.50-4.06, P = 0.0004).

To further understand the current status and trend for developing CAR-T cell based therapies for various solid tumors, this review emphasizes on CAR-T techniques, current obstacles, and strategies for application, as well as necessary companion diagnostics for treatment of solid tumors with CAR-T cells.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Ma, Shuo', 'Li, Xinchun', 'Wang, Xinyue', 'Cheng, Liang', 'Li, Zhong', 'Zhang, Changzheng', 'Ye, Zhenlong', 'Qian, Qijun']","['Ma S', 'Li X', 'Wang X', 'Cheng L', 'Li Z', 'Zhang C', 'Ye Z', 'Qian Q']",,"['Shanghai Baize Medical Laboratory, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Baize Medical Laboratory, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Baize Medical Laboratory, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Baize Medical Laboratory, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Shanghai Baize Medical Laboratory, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Baize Medical Laboratory, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Baize Medical Laboratory, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Cell Therapy Research Institute, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center for Cell Therapy, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Baize Medical Laboratory, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Cell Therapy Research Institute, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center for Cell Therapy, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190907,Australia,Int J Biol Sci,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Cytokine Release Syndrome', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/methods/*trends', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR-T cells', '*CTC', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*companion diagnostics', '*solid tumors']",2019/11/23 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2019/11/23 06:00'],"['2019/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijbs.34213 [doi]', 'ijbsv15p2548 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Biol Sci. 2019 Sep 7;15(12):2548-2560. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.34213. eCollection 2019.,PMC6854376,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally to a blinded two-expert manual annotation with consensus, we provide an algorithm-aided dataset, where potentially missed mitotic figures were detected by a deep neural network and subsequently assessed by two human experts. We included 262,481 annotations in total, out of which 44,880 represent mitotic figures. For algorithmic validation, we used a customized RetinaNet approach, followed by a cell classification network. We find F1-Scores of 0.786 and 0.820 for the manually labelled and the algorithm-aided dataset, respectively.

Hematopoietic stem cells precisely regulate self-renewal versus differentiation to balance the production of blood cells and maintenance of the stem cell pool. The canonical view of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is that it results from a combination of molecular events in a hematopoietic stem cell that block differentiation and drive proliferation. These events result in the accumulation of primitive hematopoietic blast cells in the blood and bone marrow. We used mathematical modeling to determine the impact of varying differentiation rates on myeloblastic accumulation. Our model shows that, instead of the commonly held belief that AML results from a complete block of differentiation of the hematopoietic stem cell, even a slight skewing of the fraction of cells that differentiate would produce an accumulation of blasts. We confirmed this model by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and sequencing of purified cell populations from patients with AML, which showed that different leukemia-causing molecular abnormalities typically thought to block differentiation were consistently present in mature myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocytes at similar levels to those in immature myeloid cells. These findings suggest reduced or skewed, rather than blocked, differentiation is responsible for the development of AML.

This study aimed to investigate changes in the efficacy of PBSC collection from two Japanese university hospitals over an eight-year period. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A series of 399 PBSC collection procedures from 239 patients with solid malignant tumors (ST, n = 42), malignant lymphoma (ML, n = 91), multiple myeloma (MM, n = 99), and others (amyloidosis and leukemia, n = 7) from two university hospitals from 2011 to 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. We also analyzed the effects of CD34+ pre-counting and plerixafor administration in improving CD34+ cell yield. RESULTS: Using CD34+ pre-count as a reference, the frequency of apheresis was reduced and the yield of CD34+ cells increased in patients with ST. When administrating plerixafor, especially with a CD34+ pre-count <20/muL, the yield of CD34+ cells was significantly increased in patients with ML (p = 0.02) and MM (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We verified that CD34+ cell counting and plerixafor administration contributed to effective PBSC collections in our hospitals for the eight-year study period. In patients with ST, CD34+ pre-count threshold for starting apheresis was >/=10/muL. CD34+ pre-count (<20/muL) was useful to select appropriate patients for plerixafor administration among the patients with ML and MM.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, whether miR-125b affects the apoptotic behavior of trophoblasts and the underlying molecular regulatory mechanisms remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of miR-125b on apoptosis of HTR-8/SVneo cells in vitro. Constructed wild-type reporter vector (Wt-3'UTR) or mutated type reporter vector (Mut-3'UTR) reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into 293T cells along with miR-125b mimics or a negative control. The luciferase reporter assay was used to validate whether the predicted MCL1 gene is a direct target of miR-125b. The HTR8/SVneo cells were transfected with miR-125 mimics, inhibitors, or a scramble control. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to analyze mRNA and protein expression of the target gene MCL1. Flow cytometry was used to determine the effects on apoptosis. The luciferase activity assay validated the ability of miR-125b to specifically attenuate MCL1 transcription in the 293T cell line, suggesting that MCL1 is a direct target of miR-125b. After transfection by miR-125b, relative expression and translation of the target gene MCL1 mRNA were repressed in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Trophoblast cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by overexpressing miR-125b in the HTR-8/SVneo cell line. In conclusion, MiR-125b may induced apoptosis of HTR8/SVneo cells by targeting MCL1. Our findings suggest that miR-125b may play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of placentation.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Iron exerts an important role on hematopoietic stem cell transformation and on mature white blood cell differentiation. Iron acts experimentally as an oncogenic cofactor but its exact role in the transformation of the myelodysplastic syndrome into leukemia continues to be discussed. Body iron overload frequently develops mainly as the result of multiple erythrocyte transfusions in patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, and, in the latter, as a result of increased ineffective erythropoiesis. Iron overload, especially through the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species, leads to organ damage that likely impacts the global outcome of patients, especially after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In these pathological settings (before and after HSCT), oral iron chelation should be considered whenever body iron overload has been firmly established, ideally by magnetic resonance imaging.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Recent studies have revealed a dichotomous role of EZH2 in physiology and in the pathogenesis of cancer. While it plays an essential role in the development of the lymphoid system, its deregulation, whether due to genetic or non-genetic causes, promotes B cell- and T cell-related lymphoma or leukemia. These findings triggered a boom in the development of therapeutic EZH2 inhibitors in recent years. Here, we discuss physiologic and pathogenic function of EZH2 in lymphoid context, various internal causes of EZH2 aberrance and how EZH2 modulates lymphomagenesis through epigenetic silencing, post-translational modifications (PTMs), orchestrating with surrounding tumor micro-environment and associating with RNA or viral partners.

However, it is difficult to expand the large numbers of highly pure NK cells from CB without cell sorting and feeder cells/multiple cytokines. In this study, we try to develop a simple, safe and economical method for ex vivo expansion and purification of NK cells from CB without cell sorting and feeder cells/multiple cytokines. RESULTS: The large numbers (mean: 1.59 x 10(10)) of highly pure (>/=90%) NK cells from CB could be obtained through interleukin-2, group A streptococcus and zoledronate stimulation of mononuclear cells using the 21-day culture approach. When compared to resting NK cells, expanded NK cells were a higher expression of activating receptors CD16, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46 and activating markers CD62L and CD69, while the inhibitory receptors, CD158a and CD158b remained largely unchanged. In addition, these cells showed a higher concentration of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and GM-CSF secretion and cytotoxicity to K562 cells and acute myeloid leukemia targets than resting NK cells.

Glioblastoma cells confer considerable resistance to induction of apoptosis, which may be due to overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins, or the reduction of the level of some pro-apoptotic proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can affect the cell biology pathways, including replication, autophagy, necrosis, and apoptosis by regulating gene expression. In this study, using bioinformatics methods, we selected the anti-apoptotic genes, BCL2L1 and MCL1, and microRNA that targeted them (miR-342). In the next step, the Lentiviral particles that contain miR-342 (LV-miR-342) were synthesized in HEK293T cell lines. Glioblastoma cell lines, U251 and U87, were transduced with LV-miR-342. The gene expression and apoptosis induction were then assayed by real-time PCR and flow cytometry respectively. The present study showed that increasing the expression of miR-342 reduced the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, BCL2L1 and MCL1. The results of luciferase assay reports confirmed that miR-342 targeted BCL2L1 and MCL1. In addition, flow cytometry analysis indicated that miR-342 overexpression induced apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. As well as, Western blotting results confirmed a decrease in BCL2L1 protein following overexpression of miR-342 in glioblastoma cells.

It is important to differentiate neoplastic processes from follicular hyperplasia and regressive follicular changes. Better understanding of germinal center development and dissolution also provides diagnostic clues to the underlying pathologic process. It is also important in identifying the immune basis of different pathologic entities as well as in immunotherapy decision making and follow up. In this study, we characterize the immunoarchitecture of lymphoid follicles with a focus on germinal center in one representative case, each of commonly encountered benign and malignant lymph node disorders, with morphologic and immunohistochemical alterations of germinal centers. The cases include reactive follicular hyperplasia (FH), florid follicular hyperplasia (FFH), follicular lymphoma (FL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), hyaline-vascular Castleman disease (HVCD), progressive transformation of germinal centers, nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma (LR-CHL), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated follicular dissolution and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with proliferation centers (PC). A panel of antibodies were used namely CD3, CD20, CD10, BCL2, BCL6, CD21, CD23, CD35, FOXP1, GCET1, HGAL/GCET2, LMO2, MUM1, IgD, Ki67, PD1 and PD-L1. We found that these entities show distinct immunoarchitectural patterns of germinal center formation, development and regression, particularly, the distribution of mantle zone B-cells, follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and FDC meshworks, confirming the influence of antigenic stimulation and status of immune system in these changes. This also confirms the interrelationship of underlying immunologic mechanisms in these disease processes.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, d-allose requires a relatively high concentration for the activity to be observed. Thus, developing more potent derivatives is needed for application. In cells, d-allose is converted to d-allose-6-phosphate (A6P), which is responsible for the anti-proliferative activity of d-allose. In this study, we synthesized A6P derivative 1 with biodegradable protecting groups, which showed higher anti-proliferative activity than A6P against a MOLT-4F human leukemia cell line. Similarly protected derivative of d-glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) (2) and tetraacetyl-A6P (3) showed weaker and less activity compared with 1, respectively, suggesting that both A6P moiety and the protecting group on the phosphate group are responsible for the activity. In addition, significantly weaker induction of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) expression by 1 compared with d-allose suggests that 1 exhibited cytotoxicity through the synergetic effect of inducing TXNIP expression and other mechanisms.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Genetic abnormalities are used as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers in patients with these diseases. Herein, we describe the clinical validation of the Oncomine Myeloid Research (OMR) next-generation sequencing panel that interrogates for 40 genes and 29 fusion genes commonly seen in myeloid neoplasms. Our validation set of 77 DNA samples included acute and chronic myeloid neoplasms, with 91 single-nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions. The 71 RNA samples from patients with AML included most of the AML-defining translocations. The OMR on the Ion Torrent S5 platform shows good performance in terms of depth of coverage, on-target reads, and uniformity. The panel achieved 91.3% and 100% concordance with reference DNA and RNA samples, respectively, with a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 96.7% and 100% for DNA and 99.8% and 100% for RNA, respectively. Precision and reproducibility were 100%, and the lower limit of detection was generally 5% variant allele fraction for DNA and 2-log reduction from initial value for RNA fusion genes. In conclusion, the OMR panel is a highly accurate and reproducible next-generation sequencing panel for the detection of common genetic alterations in myeloid neoplasms.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and WT1 transcript levels were simultaneously measured in 1299 bone marrow samples serially collected from 176 t(8;21) AML patients after allo-HSCT. The upper limit of the normal bone marrow WT1 level was 0.6%, which we previously reported to be the cutoff value for significant relapse prediction in AML as a whole.

Nonetheless, patients with WT1 levels of 0.6% to 1.2% and those with levels of >1.2% and 1.8% after HSCT had rates of cumulative incidence of relapse similar to those with a continuous WT1 level of </=0.6%, and both were significantly lower than that in patients with a WT1 level of >1.8%. WT1 expression was significantly related to RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels at WT1 levels of >1.8% but not at levels of 0.6% to 1.2% or >1.2% to 1.8%.

Despite initial clinical responses to FLT3 kinase inhibitors, patients eventually relapse. Mechanisms of resistance include the acquisition of secondary FLT3 mutations and protective stromal signaling within the bone marrow niche. Here we show that LAM-003, a prodrug of the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor LAM-003A, has cytotoxic activity against AML cell lines and primary samples harboring FLT3-ITD. LAM-003 regressed tumors in an MV-4-11 xenograft mouse model and extended survival in a MOLM-13 systemic model. LAM-003 displayed synergistic activity with chemotherapeutic drugs and FLT3 inhibitors, with the most robust synergy being obtained with venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor. This finding was verified in a MOLM-13 systemic survival model in which the combination significantly prolonged survival compared with the single agents. Importantly, LAM-003 exhibited equipotent activity against FLT3 inhibitor-resistant mutants of FLT3, such as D835 or F691, in cytotoxic and FLT3 degradation assays. LAM-003 also retained potency in AML cells grown in stromal-conditioned media that were resistant to FLT3 inhibitors. Lastly, a genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed epigenetic regulators, including KDM6A, as determinants of LAM-003 sensitivity in AML cell lines, leading to the discovery of synergy with an EZH2 inhibitor. Collectively, these preclinical findings support the use of LAM-003 in FLT3-ITD patients with AML who no longer respond to FLT3 inhibitor therapy either as a single agent or in combination with drugs known to be active in AML.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Beeharry, Neil', 'Landrette, Sean', 'Gayle, Sophia', 'Hernandez, Marylens', 'Grotzke, Jeff E', 'Young, Peter R', 'Beckett, Paul', 'Zhang, Xuan', 'Carter, Bing Z', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Halene, Stephanie', 'Xu, Tian', 'Rothberg, Jonathan', 'Lichenstein, Henri']","['Beeharry N', 'Landrette S', 'Gayle S', 'Hernandez M', 'Grotzke JE', 'Young PR', 'Beckett P', 'Zhang X', 'Carter BZ', 'Andreeff M', 'Halene S', 'Xu T', 'Rothberg J', 'Lichenstein H']",,"['AI Therapeutics, Guilford, CT.', 'AI Therapeutics, Guilford, CT.', 'AI Therapeutics, Guilford, CT.', 'AI Therapeutics, Guilford, CT.', 'AI Therapeutics, Guilford, CT.', 'AI Therapeutics, Guilford, CT.', 'AI Therapeutics, Guilford, CT.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Hematology and.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Genetics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'AI Therapeutics, Guilford, CT.', 'AI Therapeutics, Guilford, CT.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2019/11/22 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2019/11/22 06:00'],"['2019/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['428817 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001068 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Nov 26;3(22):3661-3673. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001068.,PMC6880894,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed a quasiexperimental implementation study of 2 antimicrobial stewardship interventions in a hematological malignancy unit: monthly antibiotic cycling for febrile neutropenia that included cefepime (+/- metronidazole) and piperacillin-tazobactam and a clinical prediction rule to guide anti-vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) therapy. We used interrupted time-series analysis to compare antibiotic use and logistic regression in order to adjust observed unit-level changes in resistant infections by background community rates. RESULTS: A total of 2434 admissions spanning 3 years pre- and 2 years postimplementation were included. Unadjusted carbapenem and daptomycin use decreased significantly. In interrupted time-series analysis, carbapenem use decreased by -230 days of therapy (DOT)/1000 patient-days (95% confidence interval [CI], -290 to -180; P < .001). Both VRE colonization (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81; P < .001) and infection (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.9; P = .02) decreased after implementation. This shift may have had a greater effect on daptomycin prescribing (-160 DOT/1000 patient-days; 95% CI, -200 to -120; P < .001) than did the VRE clinical prediction score (-30 DOT/1000 patient-days; 95% CI, -50 to 0; P = .08). Also, 46.2% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were carbapenem-resistant preimplementation compared with 25.0% postimplementation (P = .32). Unit-level changes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) incidence were explained by background community-level trends, while changes in AmpC ESBL and VRE appeared to be independent. The program was not associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: An antibiotic cycling-based strategy for febrile neutropenia effectively reduced carbapenem use, which may have resulted in decreased VRE colonization and infection and perhaps, in turn, decreased daptomycin prescribing.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Hence, peptides that mimic the active core domain of TGFbeta1 may be promising candidates for modulation of the allergic response. This study aimed to investigate a synthetic TGFbeta1 mimetic peptide (TGFbeta1-mim) for its ability to modulate the immune response during allergic sensitization to grass pollen allergens. METHODS: The in vitro action of TGFbeta1-mim was evaluated in human lung epithelial cells, Jurkat cells, and rat basophilic leukemia cells. The in vivo action was evaluated in a murine model of Phl p 5 allergic sensitization. Additionally, the Th2 modulatory response was evaluated in IL-4 reporter mice. RESULTS: In vitro, TGFbeta1-mim downregulated TNF-alpha production, IL-8 gene expression, and cytokine secretion, upregulated IL-10 secretion, and inhibited Phl p 5-induced basophil degranulation. During Phl p 5 sensitization in mice, TGFbeta1-mim downregulated IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IFN-gamma, upregulated IL-10, and induced Treg cell production. Furthermore, mice treated with TGFbeta1-mim had lower levels of IgE, IgG1, IgG2a and higher levels of IgA antibodies than control mice. In a reporter mouse, the mimetic inhibited Th2 polarization. CONCLUSION: The TGFbeta1-mim efficiently modulated various important events that exacerbate the allergic microenvironment, including the production of main cytokines that promote Th1 and Th2 differentiation, and the induction of allergen-specific regulatory T cells, highlighting its potential use in therapeutic approaches to modulate the immune response toward environmental allergens.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) controls JAK2 translation and protein stability and has been implicated in JAK2-driven diseases best exemplified by myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). By using novel classes of highly selective HDAC inhibitors and genetically deficient mouse models, we discovered that HDAC11 rather than HDAC6 is necessary for the proliferation and survival of oncogenic JAK2-driven MPN cells and patient samples. Notably, HDAC11 is variably expressed in primitive stem cells and is expressed largely upon lineage commitment. Although Hdac11is dispensable for normal homeostatic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell differentiation based on chimeric bone marrow reconstitution, Hdac11 deficiency significantly reduced the abnormal megakaryocyte population, improved splenic architecture, reduced fibrosis, and increased survival in the MPLW515L-MPN mouse model during primary and secondary transplantation. Therefore, inhibitors of HDAC11 are an attractive therapy for treating patients with MPN. Although JAK2 inhibitor therapy provides substantial clinical benefit in MPN patients, the identification of alternative therapeutic targets is needed to reverse MPN pathogenesis and control malignant hematopoiesis. This study establishes HDAC11 as a unique type of target molecule that has therapeutic potential in MPN.",,"['Yue, Lanzhu', 'Sharma, Vasundhara', 'Horvat, Nathan P', 'Akuffo, Afua A', 'Beatty, Matthew S', 'Murdun, Cem', 'Colin, Christelle', 'Billington, Julia M R', 'Goodheart, William E', 'Sahakian, Eva', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Powers, John J', 'Amin, Narmin E', 'Lambert-Showers, Que T', 'Darville, Lancia N', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Reuther, Gary W', 'Wright, Kenneth L', 'Conti, Chiara', 'Lee, Jennifer Y', 'Zheng, Xiaozhang', 'Ng, Pui Yee', 'Martin, Matthew W', 'Marshall, C Gary', 'Koomen, John M', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Verma, Amit', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Sotomayor, Eduardo M', 'Shao, Zonghong', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie K']","['Yue L', 'Sharma V', 'Horvat NP', 'Akuffo AA', 'Beatty MS', 'Murdun C', 'Colin C', 'Billington JMR', 'Goodheart WE', 'Sahakian E', 'Zhang L', 'Powers JJ', 'Amin NE', 'Lambert-Showers QT', 'Darville LN', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Reuther GW', 'Wright KL', 'Conti C', 'Lee JY', 'Zheng X', 'Ng PY', 'Martin MW', 'Marshall CG', 'Koomen JM', 'Levine RL', 'Verma A', 'Grimes HL', 'Sotomayor EM', 'Shao Z', 'Epling-Burnette PK']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Immunology, H.

Methods Real-time quantitative PCR and bioinformatics databases were utilized to analyze the expression level of LINC00324 in peripheral blood leukocytes and cell lines KG-1, THP-1 and U937 in AML patients. The relationships of the expression level of LINC00324 with the red blood cell and platelet count, the expression levels of LINC00324 and immunophenotypes in 40 AML patients were analyzed by Person correlation analysis. The immunophenotypes included CD14, CD68, CD64, CD11b, CD4, CD45, CD33, HLA-DR, CD163, CD2, CD58, CD117, CD43, CD34, CD99, CD8, CD38, CD10, CD13, CD56, CD7, TdT, CD235a, CD138, CD61, MPO and CD19. Simultaneously, the cBioPortal database datasets (TCGA, NEJM 2013) were used to analyze the clinical characteristics of 173 AML patients, and to analyze the correlations between the expression level of LINC00324 and the peripheral blood blast percentage and white blood cell count in tumor samples. Results The expression of LINC00324 in peripheral blood leukocytes of AML patients was down-regulated, and its expression level was significantly correlated with immunophenotype CD33, red blood cell and platelet count. Analysis of bioinformatics database showed that LINC00324 was under-expressed in myeloid leukemia cell lines. The expression of LINC00324 in AML patients was associated with multiple immunophenotypes such as CD33, CD117, CD11b, CD14 and CD64 and was negatively correlated with peripheral blood blast percentage and white blood cell count.

To assess reimbursement, utilization, and overall survival (OS) up to 1 year post-alloHCT for Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with AML, a unique merged dataset of Medicare claims and national alloHCT registry data was analyzed. Methods: Patients diagnosed with AML undergoing alloHCT from 2010 to 2011 were included for a retrospective cohort analysis with generalized linear model adjustment. One-year post-alloHCT reimbursement included Medicare, secondary payer, and beneficiary copayments (no coinsurance) (inflation adjusted to 2017 dollars). Cost-to-charge ratios were applied to estimate department-specific inpatient costs. Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to identify risk factors of 1-year OS post-alloHCT. Results: A total of 250 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean total reimbursement was $230 815 (95% confidence interval [CI] = $214 381 to $247 249) 1 year after alloHCT. Pharmacy was the most- costly inpatient service category. Adjusted mean total reimbursement was statistically higher for patients who received cord blood grafts (P = .01), myeloablative conditioning (P < .0001), and alloHCT in the Northeast and West (P = .03). Mortality increased with age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.17), poorer Karnofsky performance score (<90% vs >/=90%, HR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.35), and receipt of myeloablative conditioning (HR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.21 to 2.92). Conclusions: This merged dataset allowed adjustment for a richer set of patient- and HCT-related characteristics than claims data alone. The finding that nonmyeloablative conditioning was associated with lower reimbursement and improved OS 1 year post-alloHCT warrants further investigation.",['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

It is mostly known to cause pneumonia in individuals with known risk factors as immunocompromised status, tobacco use, chronic organ failure or age older than 50 years. Although parapneumonic pleural effusion is frequent in legionellosis, pleural empyema is very uncommon. In this study, we report a case of fatal pleural empyema caused by L. pneumophila serogroup 1 in an 81-year-old man with multiple risk factors. CASE SUMMARY: An 81-year-old man presented to the emergency with a 3 wk dyspnea, fever and left chest pain. His previous medical conditions were chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney failure, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, without tobacco use. Chest X-ray and comouted tomography-scan confirmed a large left pleural effusion, which puncture showed a citrine exudate with negative standard bacterial cultures. Despite intravenous cefotaxime antibiotherapy, patient's worsening condition after 10 d led to thoracocentesis and evacuation of 2 liters of pus. The patient progressively developed severe hypoxemia and multiorgan failure occurred. The patient was treated by antibiotherapy with cefepime and amikacin and with adequate symptomatic shock treatment, but died of uncontrolled sepsis. The next day, cultures of the surgical pleural liquid samples yielded L. pneumophila serogroup 1, consistent with the diagnosis of pleural legionellosis. CONCLUSION: L. pneumophila should be considered in patients with multiple risk factors and undiagnosed pleural empyema unresponsive to conventional antibiotherapy.","['(c)The Author(s) 2019.

We conducted a systematic review to synthesise existing evidence on the costs and cost-effectiveness of treating childhood cancers in LMICs. Methods: We searched multiple databases from their inception to March 2019. All studies reporting costs or cost-effectiveness of treating any childhood cancer in an LMIC were included. We appraised included articles using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Where possible, we extracted or calculated the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted using reported survival and country-specific life expectancy. Cost/DALY averted was compared with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) as per WHO-Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective guidelines to determine cost-effectiveness. Results: Of 2802 studies identified, 30 met inclusion criteria. Studies represented 22 countries and nine different malignancies. The most commonly studied cancers were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n=10), Burkitt lymphoma (n=4) and Wilms tumour (n=3). The median CHEERS checklist score was 18 of 24. Many studies omitted key cost inputs. Notably, only 11 studies included healthcare worker salaries. Cost/DALY averted was extracted or calculated for 12 studies and ranged from US$22 to US$4475, although the lower-end costs were primarily from studies that omitted key cost components. In all 12, cost/DALY averted through treatment was substantially less than country per capita GDP, and therefore considered very cost-effective. Conclusion: Many included studies did not account for key cost inputs, thus underestimating true treatment costs. Costs/DALY averted were nonetheless substantially lower than per capita GDP, suggesting that even if all relevant inputs are included, LMIC childhood cancer treatment is consistently very cost-effective. While additional rigorous economic evaluations are required, our results can inform the development of LMIC national childhood cancer strategies.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

One major complication is the development of the life-threatening graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) which limits beneficial effects of graft-vs.-leukemia (GvL) responses during allo-HSCT. Strengthening GvL effects without induction of severe GvHD is essential to decrease the relapse rate after allo-HSCT. An interesting player in this context is vitamin D3 since it has modulatory capacity in both preventing GvHD and boosting GvL responses. Current studies claim that vitamin D3 induces an immunosuppressive environment by dendritic cell (DC)-dependent generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Since vitamin D3 is known to support the antimicrobial defense by re-establishing the physical barrier as well as releasing defensins and antimicrobial peptides, it might also improve graft-vs.-infection (GvI) effects in patients. Beyond that, alloreactive T cells might be attenuated by vitamin D3-mediated inhibition of proliferation and activation. Despite the inhibitory effects of vitamin D3 on T cells, anti-tumor responses of GvL might be reinforced by vitamin D3-triggered phagocytic activity and antibody-based immunotherapy. Therefore, vitamin D3 treatment does not only lead to a shift from a pro-inflammatory toward a tolerogenic state but also promotes tumoricidal activity of immune cells. In this review we focus on vitamin D3 and its immunomodulatory effects by enhancing anti-tumor activity while alleviating harmful allogeneic responses in order to restore the immune balance.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Flamann, Peter, Kreutz and Bruns.']","['Flamann, Cindy', 'Peter, Katrin', 'Kreutz, Marina', 'Bruns, Heiko']","['Flamann C', 'Peter K', 'Kreutz M', 'Bruns H']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III - Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III - Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology/Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191105,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Vitamins)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cholecalciferol/*therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Vitamins/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*GvH', '*GvL', '*T cells', '*immune balance', '*infection', '*macrophages', '*vitamin D']",2019/11/22 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2019/11/22 06:00'],"['2019/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02586 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Nov 5;10:2586. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02586. eCollection 2019.,PMC6848223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis is very important in regulating the homeostasis of the hepatobiliary system. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is one of the signaling pathways that induce apoptosis. Moreover, the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)-induced apoptotic pathway is the main way; but its role in liver injury remains unclear. Yinchenhao decoction (YCHD) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula that alleviates liver injury and apoptosis, yet its mechanism is unknown. We undertook this study to investigate the effects of YCHD on the expression of ER stress proteins and hepatocyte apoptosis in rats with obstructive jaundice (OJ). AIM: To investigate whether YCHD can attenuate OJ-induced liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the PERK-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)-growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34) pathway and B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 related X protein (Bax)/B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) ratio. METHODS: For in vivo experiments, 30 rats were divided into three groups: control group, OJ model group, and YCHD-treated group. Blood was collected to detect the indicators of liver function, and liver tissues were used for histological analysis. For in vitro experiments, 30 rats were divided into three groups: G1, G2, and G3. The rats in group G1 had their bile duct exposed without ligation, the rats in group G2 underwent total bile duct ligation, and the rats in group G3 were given a gavage of YCHD. According to the serum pharmacology, serum was extracted and centrifuged from the rat blood to cultivate the BRL-3A cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect BRL-3A hepatocyte apoptosis. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in the medium were detected. Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses were used to detect protein and gene expression levels of PERK, CHOP, GADD34, Bax, and Bcl-2 in the liver tissues and BRL-3A cells. RESULTS: Biochemical assays and haematoxylin and eosin staining suggested severe liver function injury and liver tissue structure damage in the OJ model group. The TUNEL assay showed that massive BRL-3A rat hepatocyte apoptosis was induced by OJ. Elevated ALT and AST levels in the medium also demonstrated that hepatocytes could be destroyed by OJ. Western blot or qRT-PCR analyses showed that the protein and mRNA expression levels of PERK, CHOP, and GADD34 were significantly increased both in the rat liver tissue and BRL-3A rat hepatocytes by OJ. The Bax and Bcl-2 levels were increased, and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was also increased. When YCHD was used, the PERK, CHOP, GADD34, and Bax levels quickly decreased, while the Bcl-2 levels increased, and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio decreased.

The DC are identified phenotypically as HLA-DR(+) cells that lack major cell surface lineage markers for T cells (CD3), B cells (CD19, CD20), NK cells (CD56), red blood cells (CD235a), hematopoietic stem cells (CD34), and Mo that express CD14. Both DC and Mo can be phenotypically divided into subsets. DC are divided into plasmacytoid DC, which are CD11c(-) , CD304(+) , CD85g(+) , and myeloid DC that are CD11c(+) . The CD11c(+) DC are readily classified as CD1c(+) DC and CD141(+) DC. Monocytes are broadly divided into the CD14(+) CD16(-) (classical) and CD14(dim) CD16(+) subsets (nonclassical). A population of myeloid-derived cells that have DC characteristics, that is, HLA-DR(+) and lacking lineage markers including CD14, but express CD16 are generally clustered with CD14(dim) CD16(+) monocytes. We used high-dimensional clustering analyses of fluorescence and mass cytometry data, to delineate CD14(+) monocytes, CD14(dim) CD16(+) monocytes (CD16(+) Mo), and CD14(-) CD16(+) DC (CD16(+) DC). We sought to identify the functional and kinetic relationship of CD16(+) DC to CD16(+) Mo. We demonstrate that differentiation of CD16(+) DC and CD16(+) Mo during activation with IFNgamma in vitro and as a result of an allo-hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in vivo resulted in distinct populations. Recovery of blood CD16(+) DC in both auto- and allo-(HCT) patients after myeloablative conditioning showed similar reconstitution and activation kinetics to CD16(+) Mo. Finally, we show that expression of the cell surface markers CD300c, CCR5, and CLEC5a can distinguish the cell populations phenotypically paving the way for functional differentiation as new reagents

Their successful therapeutic implementation requires upfront identification of patients who could benefit from a SM-based treatment but biomarkers for SM sensitivity have not yet been described. Here, we analyzed the intrinsic activity of two monovalent (AT406 and LCL161) and two bivalent (Birinapant and BV6) SMs on unselected patient-derived pediatric precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) identifying a subset of patient samples to be particularly sensitive to SM-induced cell death. This subset was defined by a characteristic gene expression signature with 127 differentially regulated genes, amongst them TNFRSF1A encoding TNFR1, and a critical role of TNFR1 in SM-induced cell death in sensitive BCP-ALL was confirmed on the functional level. Interestingly, samples with intermediate or low sensitivity to SMs were sensitized to SM-induced cell death by inhibition of caspases using zVAD.fmk or Emricasan, a pan-caspase inhibitor in clinical trials. When we compared our expression data to published data sets, we identified an overlap of four genes to be commonly differentially regulated in SM-sensitive BCP-ALL, that is, TSPAN7, DIPK1C, MTX2 and, again, TNFRSF1A. Functional testing revealed that this set of genes identified samples with high sensitivity to SM treatment. In summary, our data suggest using this gene signature as biomarker predicting response to SM treatment and point to the development of new combinatorial treatments consisting of SMs and pan-caspase inhibitors for a successful clinical implementation of SMs in treatment of BCP-ALL.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel are the first US FDA-approved CD19-targeted CAR T cells. While various different CD19 CAR T cells are in development, tisagenlecleucel is the only CAR T cell approved for pediatric patients. The multicenter phase II trial that led to the approval of tisagenlecleucel demonstrated excellent responses in individuals with highly refractory disease. Other high-risk groups of patients with B-ALL who experience poor outcomes with standard therapy may also benefit from treatment with tisagenlecleucel. After receiving CAR T cells, patients must be closely monitored for unique toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and B-cell aplasia. The management of patients with relapsed or refractory disease after administration of CD19 CAR T cells can be challenging, and treatment options vary according to the characteristics of the disease present at relapse.

One regimen is cladribine, cytarabine, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (CLAG), but little is known about its efficacy and safety in children with RR-AML. METHODS: We enrolled RR-AML patients aged 0-18 years who received modified CLAG regimen for re-induction between July 1, 2015 and April 1, 2018, or conventional induction between August 1, 2011 and April 1, 2018. Patients were followed up to March 31, 2019. Patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) or chemotherapy after the induction of complete remission (CR). The CR rate, survival, and side effects were analyzed. RESULTS: The CR rate for induction was 66.7% after one cycle and 75.0% after two cycles of the CLAG regimen in 12 children. The nine children who received conventional chemotherapy had a CR rate of 22.2% after one cycle and 33.3% after two cycles (P = 0.087 vs. CLAG). The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) of the CLAG group and the conventional treatment group were 44.4 +/- 15.7% and 22.2 +/- 13.8% (P = 0.112). The 3-year overall survival of the two groups were 59.5 +/- 16.2% and 22.2% +/- 13.8% (P = 0.057). The 3-year EFS for allo-SCT and chemotherapy after CLAG regimen was 66.7 +/- 19.2% and 25.0 +/- 21.7% (P = 0.015). A single case of chemotherapy-related death was recorded. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a promising CR rate using CLAG salvage treatment in childhood RR-AML. Allo-SCT after CR may improve the long-term outcome in these patients.",,"['Zhang, Na', 'Shao, Jing-Bo', 'Li, Hong', 'Yang, Jing-Wei', 'Chen, Kai', 'Zhu, Jia-Shi', 'Jiang, Hui']","['Zhang N', 'Shao JB', 'Li H', 'Yang JW', 'Chen K', 'Zhu JS', 'Jiang H']",,"[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No. 24, lane 1400, West Beijing Road, Shanghai 200040, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No. 24, lane 1400, West Beijing Road, Shanghai 200040, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No. 24, lane 1400, West Beijing Road, Shanghai 200040, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No. 24, lane 1400, West Beijing Road, Shanghai 200040, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No. 24, lane 1400, West Beijing Road, Shanghai 200040, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No. 24, lane 1400, West Beijing Road, Shanghai 200040, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No. 24, lane 1400, West Beijing Road, Shanghai 200040, China. jhui0111@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['No.14411950602/Shanghai science and Technology Committee Projects', 'No.18ZR1431200/Shanghai science and Technology Committee Projects']","['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20191120,Switzerland,World J Pediatr,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,101278599,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Remission Induction', 'Retreatment', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Children', 'Cladribine', 'Refractory', 'Relapsed']",2019/11/22 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2019/11/22 06:00'],"['2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12519-019-00321-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12519-019-00321-8 [pii]']",ppublish,World J Pediatr. 2020 Apr;16(2):152-158. doi: 10.1007/s12519-019-00321-8.

NP23-NHD13 double transgenic mice were generated by interbreeding NP23 and NHD13 mice. Remarkably, 100% of the NP23-NHD13 double transgenic mice developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) within three months, characterized by replacement of the thymus with leukemic myeloblasts. The marked infiltration of thymus led to the intriguing hypothesis that AML generated in NP23-NHD13 mice arose in the thymus, as opposed to the bone marrow (BM). Transplantation of CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) thymocytes (which were also negative for Mac1 and Gr1) from leukemic NHD13/NP23 mice demonstrated that DN thymocytes could transmit AML, and limiting dilution studies showed that leukemia initiating cells were increased 14-fold in the thymus compared to BM. Further thymocyte fractionation demonstrated that DN1 and DN2, but not DN3 or DN4 fractions transmitted AML, and a marked expansion (100-fold) of Lineage-Sca1 + Kit + (LSK) cells in the thymus of the NP23-NHD13 mice. Taken together, these results show that the thymus of NP23-NHD13 mice acts as a reservoir for AML initiating cells and that thymic progenitors can transmit AML.",,"['Kundu, Subhadip', 'Park, Eun Sil', 'Chung, Yang Jo', 'Walker, Robert L', 'Zhu, Yuelin J', 'Negi, Vijay', 'Meltzer, Paul S', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Kundu S', 'Park ES', 'Chung YJ', 'Walker RL', 'Zhu YJ', 'Negi V', 'Meltzer PS', 'Aplan PD']",,"['Genetics Branch, Center for cancer Research, NCI/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for cancer Research, NCI/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Health Science, Gyeongsang National University College of Medicine, Gyeongsang, South Korea.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for cancer Research, NCI/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for cancer Research, NCI/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for cancer Research, NCI/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for cancer Research, NCI/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for cancer Research, NCI/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for cancer Research, NCI/NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. aplanp@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],['ZIA SC010378/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20191120,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (HOXD13 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (PHF23 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Thymocytes/*cytology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2019/11/22 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2019/11/22 06:00'],"['2019/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-53610-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-53610-7 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Nov 20;9(1):17213. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-53610-7.,PMC6868234,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcriptomic studies were carried out in nine newly diagnosed pPCL and ten MM samples, all of which harbored the 17p deletion. Unsupervised cluster analysis clearly distinguished pPCL from MM samples. In total 3584 genes and 20033 isoforms were found to be deregulated between pPCL and MM. There were 2727 significantly deregulated isoforms of non-differentially expressed genes. Strangely enough, significant differences were observed in the expression of spliceosomal machinery components between pPCL and MM, in respect of the gene, isoform and the alternative splicing events expression.

These NWAs use human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) as a host cell receptor for virus entry. The most prevalent of the pathogenic NWAs is Junin virus (JUNV), the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Small animal models of JUNV infection are limited because most laboratory rodent species are refractory to disease. Only guinea pigs are known to develop disease following JUNV infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate marked susceptibility of Hartley guinea pigs to uniformly lethal disease when challenged with as few as 4 PFU of the Romero strain of JUNV. In vitro, we show that infection of primary guinea pig macrophages results in greater JUNV replication compared to infection of hamster or mouse macrophages. We provide evidence that the guinea pig TfR1 (gpTfR1) is the principal receptor for JUNV, while hamster and mouse orthologs fail to support viral entry/infection of pseudotyped murine leukemia viruses expressing pathogenic NWA glycoproteins or JUNV. Together, our results indicate that gpTfR1 serves as the primary receptor for pathogenic NWAs, enhancing viral infection in guinea pigs.IMPORTANCE JUNV is one of five known NWAs that cause viral hemorrhagic fever in humans. Countermeasures against JUNV infection are limited to immunization with the Candid#1 vaccine and immune plasma, which are available only in Argentina. The gold standard small animal model for JUNV infection is the guinea pig. Here, we demonstrate high sensitivity of this species to severe JUNV infection and identify gpTfR1 as the primary receptor. Use of hTfR1 for host cell entry is a feature shared by pathogenic NWAs. Our results show that expression of gpTfR1 or hTfR1 comparably enhances JUNV virus entry/infectivity. Our findings shed light on JUNV infection in guinea pigs as a model for human disease and suggest that similar pathophysiological mechanisms related to iron sequestration during infection and regulation of TfR1 expression may be shared between humans and guinea pigs.

FeLV transmission occurs mainly by close social contact of infected and susceptible cats. Developing procedures for the diagnosis of feline retroviruses is crucial to reduce negative impacts on cat health and increase the number of animals tested. Blood collection requires physical or chemical restraint and is usually a stressful procedure for cats. Our objective was to evaluate the use of samples obtained from oral, conjunctival, and rectal mucosae for the molecular diagnosis of FeLV. Whole blood and oral, conjunctival, and rectal swabs were collected from a total of 145 cats. All samples were subjected to the amplification of a fragment of the gag gene of proviral DNA. Compared to blood samples used in this study as a reference, the accuracies for each PCR were 91.72, 91.23, and 85.50% for samples obtained by oral, conjunctival, and rectal swabs, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 86.11 and 97.26% for the oral swabs, 90 and 92.59% for the conjunctival swabs, and 74.24 and 95.77% for the rectal swabs, respectively. The kappa values for oral, conjunctival, and rectal swabs were 0.834, 0.824, and 0.705, respectively. The diagnosis of these samples showed the presence of proviral DNA of FeLV in oral and conjunctival mucosae. In conclusion, mucosal samples for the molecular diagnosis of FeLV are an excellent alternative to venipuncture and can be safely used.

Whereas the venerable anthracyclines keep challenging patients and clinicians with risk of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, other newer drugs cause substantially different clinical phenotypes of cardiovascular toxicity. In particular, Session II not only focused on arterial thrombosis and venous thromboembolism, but also hypertension or cardiomyopathy or atrial fibrillation induced by many otherwise life-saving drugs. Dr Breccia (Rome, Italy) reviewed incidence, mechanisms, risk factors, and principles for prevention of cardiovascular events induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors of hematologic interest, such as those used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. Dr Carver (Philadelphia) reviewed the incidence, predisposing factors, and principles for proactive management of cardiovascular events in patients treated by conventional chemotherapy or new drugs for treatment of multiple myeloma. Dr Szmit (Warsaw, Poland) discussed on how coagulation disorders should be classified according to patient- or drug-related factors and how they should be diagnosed and treated in patients with solid or hematologic tumors. Dr Minotti (Rome. Italy) illustrated some potential pitfalls of accelerated drug development and approval and their possible impact on clinical incidence of cardiovascular events induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors of hematologic interest.

The introduction of small molecule inhibitors has shown remarkable clinical efficacy in both previously untreated and relapsed CLL patients. However, these therapies are associated with an increased risk of specific adverse events. Selection of the best therapeutic approach for patients with CLL should be based on an assessment of general condition, comorbidities, and most importantly, the individual risk of serious side effects.Areas covered: The review presents available data about the occurrence, prophylaxis and management of the most common and clinically most relevant adverse events associated with novel therapy in CLL.Expert opinion: The incorporation of novel drugs, such as B-cell receptor inhibitors and venetoclax, a selective inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma, influences the CLL management paradigm. An individualized approach to CLL is now possible with targeted therapies. The appropriate and optimal use of current therapies requires a precise understanding of their mechanisms of action, efficacy and adverse effect profiles. A fuller understanding of the prophylaxis and management of specific adverse events stemming from CLL therapy could minimize its associated morbidity and mortality.

During transcription, BRD4 travels with the elongation complex. Since most alternative splicing events take place co-transcriptionally, we asked if BRD4 plays a role in regulating alternative splicing. We report that distinct patterns of alternative splicing are associated with a conditional deletion of BRD4 during thymocyte differentiation in vivo. Similarly, the depletion of BRD4 in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells alters patterns of splicing. Most alternatively spliced events affected by BRD4 are exon skipping. Importantly, BRD4 interacts with components of the splicing machinery, as assessed by both immunoprecipitation (IP) and proximity ligation assays (PLAs), and co-localizes on chromatin with the splicing regulator, FUS. We propose that BRD4 contributes to patterns of alternative splicing through its interaction with the splicing machinery during transcription elongation.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

We explore epigenome and transcriptome in EZH2(WT/WT) and EZH2(WT/Mu) aggressive lymphomas and show that mutual interference and compensatory function of co-expressed EZH1 and EZH2 rearrange their own genome-wide distribution, thereby establishing restricted chromatin and gene expression signatures. Direct comparison of leading compounds introduces potency and a mechanism of action of the EZH1/2 dual inhibitor (valemetostat). The synthetic lethality is observed in all lymphoma models and primary adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) cells. Opposing actions of EZH1/2-polycomb and SWI/SNF complexes are required for facultative heterochromatin formation. Inactivation of chromatin-associated genes (ARID1A, SMARCA4/BRG1, SMARCB1/SNF5, KDM6A/UTX, BAP1, KMT2D/MLL2) and oncovirus infection (HTLV-1, EBV) trigger EZH1/2 perturbation and H3K27me3 deposition.

Important clues from works in mouse have paved the way to investigate the role of low O2 levels in hematopoiesis. However, whether hypoxia impacts the initial steps of human lymphopoiesis remains unexplored. Here, we show that hypoxia regulates cellular and metabolic profiles of umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells. Hypoxia more specifically enhances in vitro lymphoid differentiation potentials of lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs) and pro-T/natural killer (NK) cells and in vivo B cell potential of LMPPs. In accordance, hypoxia exacerbates the lymphoid gene expression profile through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha (for LMPPs) and HIF-2alpha (for pro-T/NK). Moreover, loss of HIF-1/2alpha expression seriously impedes NK and B cell production from LMPPs and pro-T/NK. Our study describes how hypoxia contributes to the lymphoid development of human progenitors and reveals the implication of the HIF pathway in LMPPs and pro-T/NK-cell lymphoid identities.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

Despite 20 years of persistent research efforts, targeting STAT3 has been very challenging. We report herein the structure-based discovery of potent small-molecule STAT3 degraders based upon the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) concept. We first designed SI-109 as a potent, small-molecule inhibitor of the STAT3 SH2 domain. Employing ligands for cereblon/cullin 4A E3 ligase and SI-109, we obtained a series of potent PROTAC STAT3 degraders, exemplified by SD-36. SD-36 induces rapid STAT3 degradation at low nanomolar concentrations in cells and fails to degrade other STAT proteins. SD-36 achieves nanomolar cell growth inhibitory activity in leukemia and lymphoma cell lines with high levels of phosphorylated STAT3. A single dose of SD-36 results in complete STAT3 protein degradation in xenograft tumor tissue and normal mouse tissues. SD-36 achieves complete and long-lasting tumor regression in the Molm-16 xenograft tumor model at well-tolerated dose-schedules.

Tissue forms of the fungus Paecilomyces variotii or their cytoskeletons were revealed in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes in patients with allergy and bronchial asthma in paecilomycosis. Our study was aimed at investigating the role of red blood cells in the mechanisms of the nonspecific protection of the host in conditions of chronic persistent infection of the blood with the fungus of the genus Paecilomyces. We examined a total of eighty-four 16-to-72-year-old patients (39 men and 45 women) presenting with activation of paecilomyces infection in blood. We used laboratory, biochemical, allergic-and-immunological and microbiological methods of study. Fungal cultures were identified phenotypically and by means of phylogenetic analysis.Our findings are suggestive of a new type of the oxygen-dependent mechanism of cytotoxicity of erythrocytes, which is caused by permanent formation of reactive oxygen species as a result of non-enzymatic oxidation of haemoglobin to methaemoglobin. The resulting superoxide anion radical (O2(-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (OH(-)) exhibit a powerful bactericidal action which is, probably, activated when the fungal cells are captured and immersed in the erythrocyte cytoplasm or in a closed cavity formed by RBCs around large fungal cells.

While this model remains tractable, there are several limitations, presumably due to the constitutional Pkrdcscid (SCID, severe combined immune deficiency) mutation which affects DNA repair in all tissues of the mouse. These include the inability to combine preconditioning with subsequent chemotherapy, the inability to repeat chemotherapy cycles, and the increased sensitivity of the host hematopoietic cells to genotoxic stress. Here we attempt to address these drawbacks through the use of alternative strains with RAG-based immune deficiency (NRG and NRGS). We find that RAG-based mice tolerate a busulfan preconditioning regimen in combination with either AML or 4-drug acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) chemotherapy, expanding the number of samples that can be studied. RAG-based mice also tolerate multiple cycles of therapy, thereby allowing for more aggressive, realistic modeling. Furthermore, standard AML therapy in RAG mice was 3.8-fold more specific for AML cells, relative to SCID mice, demonstrating an improved therapeutic window for genotoxic agents. We conclude that RAG-based mice should be the new standard for preclinical evaluation of therapeutic strategies involving genotoxic agents.",,"['Wunderlich, Mark', 'Manning, Nicole', 'Sexton, Christina', 'Sabulski, Anthony', 'Byerly, Luke', ""O'Brien, Eric"", 'Perentesis, John P', 'Mizukawa, Benjamin', 'Mulloy, James C']","['Wunderlich M', 'Manning N', 'Sexton C', 'Sabulski A', 'Byerly L', ""O'Brien E"", 'Perentesis JP', 'Mizukawa B', 'Mulloy JC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2166-5146', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1124-0002']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America.""]",['eng'],"['R01 CA215504/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA211404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191120,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2019/11/21 06:00,2020/03/24 06:00,['2019/11/21 06:00'],"['2019/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0225532 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-20568 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Nov 20;14(11):e0225532. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0225532. eCollection 2019.,PMC6867639,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A total of 136 AYA patients with ALL who received TBI before allo-SCT between 1998 and 2018 were reviewed. Twenty patients received cranial radiation in their initial treatment before conditioning for transplant and were excluded. Competing risk analysis was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used to calculate overall survival (OS) and to identify factors predictive of relapse. OS and time to relapse were calculated from date of allo-SCT. Results: One hundred sixteen patients were included in the analysis. Median age was 27 years and median follow-up time was 42 months. Twenty-six patients suffered a disease relapse and 49 died, 26 of posttransplantation complications. The median time to relapse was 7 months and the 5-year OS was 60%. Seven patients had a CNS relapse: 4 of 20 patients (25%) with pre-SCT CNS disease had a post-allo-SCT CNS relapse compared to 3 of 97 (3.1%) without pre-SCT CNS disease. Median time to CNS relapse was 7 months. Patients with post-SCT CNS relapse had median OS of 19 months.

The K562 cells were treated with emodin and AZT, and the rates of cell inhibition and apoptosis were determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The mRNA expression of EGR1 was detected by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) analysis. The expression of EGR1 was silenced using siRNA, and then protein expression of betacatenin was detected by western blotting. The results demonstrated that AZT enhanced the inhibitory effect of emodin in K562 cells. The IC50 of the emodin/AZT combination at 24, 48 or 72 h was 23.6/235.6, 10.2/101.6 or 5.9/58.5 micromol/l, respectively, which was significantly lower compared with the IC50 of emodin (all >32 micromol/l) or AZT (all >320 micromol/l) alone. There was a dosedependent response to the combined emodin and AZT treatment, and the calculation of the combination index yielded values <1, demonstrating the synergistic effect of the combined treatment compared with the control (P<0.05). Furthermore, the combination of emodin and AZT increased apoptosis in K562 cells (P<0.05). Apoptosis was higher in the combination group compared with that of either treatment alone or control groups. The expression of early growth response1 (EGR1) in K562 cells was upregulated in a timedependent manner. The expression of EGR1 was higher in the combination group compared with that in the emodin or AZT alone groups. The expression of the Wnt/betacatenin signaling pathway in the combination group was lower compared with that in the emodin or AZT alone groups. The expression of the Wnt/betacatenin signaling pathway was significantly increased following EGR1 siRNA transfection. These data suggest that treating K562 cells with a combination of emodin and AZT exhibits reduced toxicity and improves therapeutic efficacy, and that the growth, inhibition, apoptosis and regulation of the Wnt/betacatenin signaling pathway in human chronic myeloid leukemia cells by emodin and AZT may be associated with the expression of EGR1.",,"['Ma, Wenjuan', 'Liu, Fang', 'Yuan, Lingyan', 'Zhao, Chuan', 'Chen, Che']","['Ma W', 'Liu F', 'Yuan L', 'Zhao C', 'Chen C']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics and Molecular Biology, Clinical Medical College, Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, P.R.

However, studies on the functions of Ski in osteosarcoma (OS) are limited. In this study, firstly the differential expression of Ski in OS tissues and osteochondroma tissues was detected, and the expression of Ski in both human OS cell lines (MG63 and U2OS) and normal osteoblasts (hFoB1.19) was then detected. The results demonstrated that Ski expression was significantly upregulated in both human OS tissues and cell lines. The results led us to hypothesize that Ski may play an essential role in the pathological process of OS. Thus, Ski specific small interfere RNA (SkisiRNA) was used. The results revealed that OS cell proliferation was markedly inhibited following the knockdown of Ski, which was identified by CCK8 assay, EdU staining and cell cycle analysis. In addition, OS cell migration was significantly suppressed following Ski knockdown, which was identified by wound healing assay. Moreover, the protein levels of pPI3K and pAkt in OS cells declined prominently following Ski knockdown. On the whole, the findings of this study revealed that Ski expression was significantly upregulated in OS tissue and OS cells. The knockdown of Ski decreased OS cell proliferation and migration, which was mediated by blocking the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Thus, DNA extracted from an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line presented a decreased intensity of the 1005 cm(-1) band of 5-methylcytosine compared to normal DNA, in line with the well-described hypomethylation of cancer DNA. The unique methylation pattern of cancer DNA also influences the DNA adsorption geometry, resulting in higher adenine SERS intensities for cancer DNA. The possibility of detecting cancer DNA based on its SERS spectrum was validated on peripheral blood genomic DNA samples from n = 17 AML patients and n = 17 control samples, yielding an overall classification of 82% based on the 1005 cm(-1) band of 5-methylcytosine. By demonstrating the potential of SERS in assessing the methylation status in the case of real-life DNA samples, the study paves the way for novel methods of diagnosing cancer.

Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics. Rituximab-containing regimens were often prescribed in clinical practice. The most frequently prescribed regimens were fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + rituximab (FCR, 29.3%), bendamustine + rituximab (BR, 17.7%), and other rituximab-containing regimens (22.0%) in the treatment-naive setting (n = 604), other non-FCR/BR rituximab-containing regimens (38.7%) and non-rituximab-containing regimens (28.5%) in the relapsed/refractory setting (n = 945). Adjusted HRs (95% CI) for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively, with ibrutinib versus real-world regimens were 0.23 (0.14-0.37; p < 0.0001) and 0.40 (0.22-0.76; p = 0.0048) in the treatment-naive setting, and 0.21 (0.16-0.27; p < 0.0001) and 0.29 (0.21-0.41; p < 0.0001) in the relapsed/refractory setting. When comparing real-world use of ibrutinib (n = 53) versus other real-world regimens in relapsed/refractory CLL (objective 3), adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 0.37 (0.22-0.63; p = 0.0003) for PFS and 0.53 (0.27-1.03; p < 0.0624) for OS.

CAR expression was demonstrated across the different NK-cell subsets. CAR.CD19-NK cells display higher antileukemic activity toward CD19(+) cell lines and primary blasts obtained from patients with B-cell precursor ALL compared with unmodified NK cells. In vivo animal model data showed that the antileukemia activity of CAR.CD19-NK cell is superimposable to that of CAR-T cells, with a lower xenograft toxicity profile.

ERalpha requires co-activators to mediate transcription via mechanisms that are largely uncharacterized. Herein, using growth-regulating estrogen receptor binding 1 (GREB1) as an ERalpha target gene in Ishikawa cells, we demonstrate that nuclear receptor co-activator 6 (NCOA6) is essential for estradiol (E2)/ERalpha-activated GREB1 transcription. We found that NCOA6 associates with the GREB1 promoter and enhancer in an E2-independent manner and that NCOA6 knockout reduces chromatin looping, enhancer-promoter interactions, and basal GREB1 expression in the absence of E2. In the presence of E2, ERalpha bound the GREB1 enhancer and also associated with its promoter, and p300, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia protein 4 (MLL4), and RNA polymerase II were recruited to the GREB1 enhancer and promoter. Consequently, the levels of the histone modifications H3K4me1/3, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac were significantly increased; enhancer and promoter regions were transcribed; and GREB1 mRNA was robustly transcribed. NCOA6 knockout reduced ERalpha recruitment and abolished all of the aforementioned E2-induced events, making GREB1 completely insensitive to E2 induction. We also found that GREB1-deficient Ishikawa cells are much more resistant to chemotherapy and that human endometrial cancers with low GREB1 expression predict poor overall survival. These results indicate that NCOA6 has an essential role in ERalpha-mediated transcription by increasing enhancer-promoter interactions through chromatin looping and by recruiting RNA polymerase II and the histone-code modifiers p300 and MLL4. Moreover, GREB1 loss may predict chemoresistance of endometrial cancer.",['(c) 2019 Tong et al.'],"['Tong, Zhangwei', 'Liu, Yonghong', 'Yu, Xiaobin', 'Martinez, Jarrod D', 'Xu, Jianming']","['Tong Z', 'Liu Y', 'Yu X', 'Martinez JD', 'Xu J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8208-9162'],"['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Dan L.

Notably, although the multiagent chemotherapy of leukemia leads to a high rate of complete remission, options for salvage therapy for relapsed/refractory disease are limited due to the serious side effects of augmenting cytotoxic chemotherapy. We report that ablation of HSF1, a key transcriptional regulator of the chaperone response and cellular bioenergetics, from mouse T-ALL tumors driven by PTEN loss or human T-ALL cell lines, has significant therapeutic effects in reducing tumor burden and sensitizing malignant cell death. From a mechanistic perspective, the enhanced sensitivity of T-ALLs to HSF1 depletion resides in the reduced MAPK-ERK signaling and metabolic and ATP-producing capacity of malignant cells lacking HSF1 activity. Impaired mitochondrial ATP production and decreased intracellular amino acid content in HSF1-deficient T-ALL cells trigger an energy-saving adaptive response featured by attenuation of the mTORC1 activity, which is coregulated by ATP, and its downstream target proteins (p70S6K and 4E-BP). This leads to protein translation attenuation that diminishes oncogenic signals and malignant cell growth. Collectively, these metabolic alterations in the absence of HSF1 activity reveal cancer cell liabilities and have a profound negative impact on T-ALL progression. IMPLICATIONS: Targeting HSF1 and HSF1-dependent cancer-specific anabolic and protein homeostasis programs has a significant therapeutic potential for T-ALL and may prevent progression of relapsed/refractory disease.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Eroglu, Binnur', 'Pang, Junfeng', 'Jin, Xiongjie', 'Xi, Caixia', 'Moskophidis, Demetrius', 'Mivechi, Nahid F']","['Eroglu B', 'Pang J', 'Jin X', 'Xi C', 'Moskophidis D', 'Mivechi NF']",,"['Molecular Chaperone Biology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Molecular Chaperone Biology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Molecular Chaperone Biology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Molecular Chaperone Biology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Molecular Chaperone Biology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia. nmivechi@augusta.edu dmoskofidis@augusta.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Molecular Chaperone Biology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia. nmivechi@augusta.edu dmoskofidis@augusta.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA062130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132640/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20191119,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hsf1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2019/11/21 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2019/11/21 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['1541-7786.MCR-19-0217 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-19-0217 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2020 Mar;18(3):463-476. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-19-0217.

The 5-year survival rate is approximately 25%, and recent therapeutic developments have yielded little survival benefit. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets. We previously demonstrated that acid ceramidase (ASAH1, referred to as AC) is upregulated in AML and high AC activity correlates with poor patient survival. Here, we characterized a novel AC inhibitor, SACLAC, that significantly reduced the viability of AML cells with an EC50 of approximately 3 mumol/L across 30 human AML cell lines. Treatment of AML cell lines with SACLAC effectively blocked AC activity and induced a decrease in sphingosine 1-phosphate and a 2.5-fold increase in total ceramide levels. Mechanistically, we showed that SACLAC treatment led to reduced levels of splicing factor SF3B1 and alternative MCL-1 mRNA splicing in multiple human AML cell lines. This increased proapoptotic MCL-1S levels and contributed to SACLAC-induced apoptosis in AML cells. The apoptotic effects of SACLAC were attenuated by SF3B1 or MCL-1 overexpression and by selective knockdown of MCL-1S. Furthermore, AC knockdown and exogenous C16-ceramide supplementation induced similar changes in SF3B1 level and MCL-1S/L ratio. Finally, we demonstrated that SACLAC treatment leads to a 37% to 75% reduction in leukemic burden in two human AML xenograft mouse models.

Despite the 2004 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines advocating for the option of hormonal therapy alone, trends in utilization rates of RT in this group are not well-documented. We analyzed our institutional experience with implementation of the guidelines over time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We identified 564 patients aged >/= 60 years with favorable breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery from 2000 to 2017. Patients met criteria for Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9343, Postoperative Radiotherapy in Minimum Risk Elderly (PRIME II), or the very-low risk cohort identified in the Toronto-British Columbia study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the magnitude of association between omission status, grade, and tumor size while controlling for age and year of diagnosis. RESULTS: Overall RT omission rates were 17.6% prior to the 2004 NCCN update and 45% after the publication of the 10-year CALGB data in 2013. The overall RT omission rate was 29%. Patients with grade 1 to 2 histology (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-7.7; P = .01) and tumors < 1 cm (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-0.9; P = .007) were more likely to omit RT than those with higher grade or larger tumors. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a slight decrease in the use of RT over time, suggesting a move towards adoption of the NCCN guidelines. There remains a fundamental need to continue to individualize breast cancer care based on risk stratification and make evidenced-based treatment recommendations with equitable use of health care resources.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on SKM-1 cells (an AML-MDS cell line) and its underlying mechanisms. SKM-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of metformin. Cell proliferation was assayed by CCK-8. Apoptosis and cell cycle phases were detected by flow cytometry, while cell cycle related proteins and AMPK were tested by Western blot. SKM-1 cells were transfected with LV-AMPKalpha1-RNAi to reduce the expression of AMPK. Metformin inhibited cell proliferation in a dose and time dependent manner by inducing G0/G1 phase arrest rather than apoptosis induction. Metformin promoted the expression of p-AMPK, P53, P21(CIP1) and P27(KIP1), while inhibited the expression of CDK4 and CyclinD1. AMPK knockdown attenuated the effects of metformin on SKM-1 cells.

Peripheral blood eosinophilia is often present. Infections, drugs, allergens, toxic agents have to be evaluated as possible causes of eosinophilic lung infiltrates. The category of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1 and PCM1-JAK2 represents an uncommon cause of eosinophilic lung infiltrate. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 70-year old man complaining of dry cough and dyspnea. Ground glass-opacities were seen on imaging studies and peripheral blood eosinophilia was present. A thorough step-wise patient's evaluation led to identify the clonal nature of eosinophilia and the diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA was made. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation with clinical history, laboratory tests and imaging studies is essential to achieve the correct diagnosis when facing with eosinophilic lung infiltrates. A prolonged eosinophilia can cause life-threatening organ damage. Identification of PDGFRA rearrangement, as in the present case, is particularly critical given the sensitivity and excellent response to imatinib, which has completely changed the natural history of this neoplasm.",,"['Zanelli, Magda', 'Smith, Maxwell', 'Zizzo, Maurizio', 'Carloni, Angelo', 'Valli, Riccardo', 'De Marco, Loredana', 'Foroni, Moira', 'Palicelli, Andrea', 'Martino, Giovanni', 'Ascani, Stefano']","['Zanelli M', 'Smith M', 'Zizzo M', 'Carloni A', 'Valli R', 'De Marco L', 'Foroni M', 'Palicelli A', 'Martino G', 'Ascani S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9841-7856'],"['Pathology Unit, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Surgical Oncology Unit, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy. zizzomaurizio@gmail.com.', 'Clinical and Experimental Medicine PhD Program, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy. zizzomaurizio@gmail.com.', 'Radiology Unit, Ospedale di Terni, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, CREO, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Ospedale di Terni, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20191119,England,BMC Pulm Med,BMC pulmonary medicine,100968563,['Pdgfra-Associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia'],IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Pulmonary Eosinophilia/*etiology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",['NOTNLM'],"['Eosinophilia', 'Lung', 'Lymphoid', 'Myeloid', 'Neoplasm', 'PDGFRA']",2019/11/21 06:00,2020/04/30 06:00,['2019/11/21 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12890-019-0967-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12890-019-0967-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Pulm Med. 2019 Nov 19;19(1):216. doi: 10.1186/s12890-019-0967-7.,PMC6862820,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Following the general analytical strategy used in GBD 2016, the age-, sex-, and province-specific incidence, mortality, and prevalence of lymphoma in China were analyzed. Trends in the incidence, mortality, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were assessed from 2006 to 2016. RESULTS: It was estimated that there were 75,400 new cases and 40,500 deaths of lymphoma in 2016 in China, of which 6900 new cases and 2900 deaths were due to HL, while 68,500 new cases and 37,600 deaths were due to NHL. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), mortality rate (ASMR), and prevalence rate (ASPR) per 100,000 were 0.46, 0.19, and 1.75 for HL, and 4.29, 2.45, and 14.9 for NHL, respectively. An upward trend with age in incidence and mortality was observed. Males had higher incidence and mortality rates than females in all age groups. Sociodemographic index had a correlation with the ASIR (r = 0.75), ASMR (r = - 0.74), ASPR (r = 0.84), and age-standardized DALYs (r = - 0.75) of HL, as well as with the ASIR (r = 0.80), ASPR (r = 0.83), and age-standardized DALYs (r = - 0.33) of NHL. From 2006 to 2016, the age-standardized DALYs of HL decreased significantly, while the age-standardized DALYs of NHL increased from 2006 to 2013 and remained stable from 2013 to 2016. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of lymphoma in China showed unexpected patterns varied by sex, age, and provinces, with an increased trend of NHL and a decreased trend of HL from 2006 to 2016.",,"['Liu, Weiping', 'Liu, Jiangmei', 'Song, Yuqin', 'Zeng, Xinying', 'Wang, Xiaopei', 'Mi, Lan', 'Cai, Cai', 'Wang, Lijun', 'Ma, Jun', 'Zhu, Jun']","['Liu W', 'Liu J', 'Song Y', 'Zeng X', 'Wang X', 'Mi L', 'Cai C', 'Wang L', 'Ma J', 'Zhu J']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3479-2547'],"['Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.', 'National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.', 'National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Institute of Survey and Mapping, Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Urban Spatial Information Engineering, Beijing, China.', 'National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China. wanglijun@ncncd.chinacdc.cn.', 'Department of Hematology & Oncology, Harbin Institute of Hematology & Oncology, Harbin, China. majun0322@126.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China. zhu-jun2017@outlook.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191119,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Global Burden of Disease', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Epidemiology', ""*Hodgkin's disease"", '*Incidence', '*Lymphoma', '*Mortality', '*Non-Hodgkin', '*Prevalence']",2019/11/21 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2019/11/21 06:00'],"['2019/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-019-0785-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-019-0785-7 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2019 Nov 19;12(1):115. doi: 10.1186/s13045-019-0785-7.,PMC6862726,,,,,,,,,"['Union for China Leukemia Investigators of the Chinese Society of Clinical', 'Oncology', 'Union for China Lymphoma Investigators of the Chinese Society of Clinical', 'Oncology']",,,,,,

Anthracyclines, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic derivatives are the most important developments for the treatment of APL. ATRA promotes the terminal differentiation of malignant promyelocytes to mature neutrophils. We aimed to compare platelet and neutrophil recovery time after induction chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and APL.Materials and Methods: Two hundred and fifteen patients with AML and APL, who were diagnosed and treated in our tertiary care center between the years of 2001 and 2018 were evaluated.Results: One hundred and eighty one AML patients (84.2%) and 34 (15.8%) APL patients were included in this study. The time between neutrophil nadir after induction chemotherapy and neutrophil recovery was longer in APL patients than in AML patients [30.5 (4-52) vs. 20 (5-58), p < 0.001]. The time between platelet nadir after induction chemotherapy and platelet recovery was longer in APL patients than in AML patients [21.5 (4-42) vs. 17 (4-45), p = 0.02].Conclusion: Neutrophil and platelet recovery times were longer in APL patients than in AML patients in our present study. In 60 days, mortality rate was higher in APL patients than AML patients. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) rate was similar between two groups. There was a significant difference between two groups in terms of NRM causes. Platelet and neutrophil recovery time is very important because infection is the most important cause of NRM.",,"['Ciftciler, Rafiye', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C', 'Ozcebe, Osman', 'Aksu, Salih', 'Sayinalp, Nilgun', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Demiroglu, Haluk', 'Buyukasik, Yahya']","['Ciftciler R', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Ozcebe O', 'Aksu S', 'Sayinalp N', 'Goker H', 'Demiroglu H', 'Buyukasik Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5687-8531'],"['Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",20191119,England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Kinetics', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myloid leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'neutrophil recovery', 'platelet recovery']",2019/11/21 06:00,2020/10/06 06:00,['2019/11/21 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08923973.2019.1692865 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2020 Feb;42(1):17-21. doi: 10.1080/08923973.2019.1692865.

This study examined pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples for PTEN and AKT1 gene variations and evaluated the clinical findings. Materials and Methods: Fifty diagnostic bone marrow samples of childhood T-ALL cases were investigated for the hotspot regions of the PTEN and AKT1 genes by targeted next-generation sequencing. Results: A total of five PTEN variations were found in three of the 50 T-ALL cases (6%). Three of the PTEN variations were first reported in this study. Furthermore, one patient clearly had two different mutant clones for PTEN. Two intronic single-nucleotide variations were found in AKT1 and none of the patients carried pathogenic AKT1 variations. Conclusion: Targeted deep sequencing allowed us to detect both low-level variations and clonal diversity. Low-level PTEN/AKT1 variation frequency makes it harder to investigate the clinical associations of the variants.

In an attempt to find an effective and safe AML treatment, vitamin E derivatives, including tocopherols were considered as potential anti-tumor compounds. Recently, other isoforms of vitamin E, namely tocotrienols have been proposed as potential potent anti-cancerous agents, displaying promising therapeutic effects in different cancer types. In this study we evaluated the anti-cancerous effects of gamma-tocotrienol, on AML cell lines in vitro. For this purpose, AML cell lines incubated with gamma-tocotrienol were examined for their viability, cell cycle status, apoptotic cell death, DNA fragmentation, production of reactive oxygen species and expression of proapoptotic proteins.

Likewise, the growing knowledge of interactions between nutrients and the expression of certain genes could lead to cancer therapies based on precision nutrition strategies. This review aims to identify the recent advances in the knowledge of the mechanistic role of bioactive phytochemicals in foodstuffs in tumor progression, metastasis, and chemo-resistance in order to assess their potential use in precision nutrition therapies targeting relapse in lung, breast, colon, and prostate cancer, and leukemia. A considerable number of bioactive phytochemicals in foodstuffs were identified in the literature with proven effects modulating tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. In addition, the use of foodstuffs in cancer, and specifically in relapse therapies, is being reinforced by the development of different formulations that significantly increase the therapeutic efficiency of these products.

We examined antiviral humoral immunity in 39 adults with B-cell malignancies who achieved durable complete remission without additional therapy for >6 months after CD19-CARTx. Despite CD19+ B-cell aplasia in all patients, the incidence of viral infections occurring >90 days post-CD19-CARTx was low (0.91 infections per person-year). Because long-lived plasma cells are CD19- and should not be direct targets of CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cells, we tested the hypothesis that humoral immunity was preserved after CD19-CARTx based on linear mixed-effects models of changes in serum total immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration, measles IgG concentration, and the number of viruses or viral epitopes to which serum IgG was directed (the ""antivirome"") using the novel VirScan assay. Samples were tested pre-CD19-CARTx and approximately 1, 6, and 12 months post-CD19-CARTx. Although total IgG concentration was lower post-CD19-CARTx (mean change, -17.5%), measles IgG concentration was similar (mean change, 1.2%). Only 1 participant lost measles seroprotection post-CD19-CARTx but had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation before CD19-CARTx. The antivirome was also preserved, with mean absolute losses of 0.3 viruses and 6 viral epitopes detected between pre- and post-CD19-CARTx samples. Most participants gained IgG to >/=2 epitopes for >/=2 viruses, suggesting that humoral immunity to some viruses may be maintained or recover after successful CD19-CARTx.

METHODS: From 12 subjects, 3-mm skin punch biopsies were collected 1-4 days postmortem from the proximal leg and distal leg, with a mean (range) interval from the death of 37 (15-91) hours. Causes of death varied broadly, including hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, generalized atherosclerosis, progressive supranuclear palsy, Parkinson disease, emphysema, and obesity. The mean (range) number of sections evaluated from each biopsy was 5.08 (2-6) from the proximal leg and 5.92 (5-6) from the distal leg. Sections were stained with PGP 9.5 for blinded counting using bright field microscopy. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of feasibility included a comparison of fiber staining with that in healthy subjects and mean IENFD in postmortem samples. Interobserver reliability was assessed among 3 blinded raters by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients and percentage variability of IENFD in at least 4 sections from biopsies in 5 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Intraobserver and interobserver correlation coefficients of blinded IENFD counts undertaken by 4 authors were consistently >0.80, and the coefficient of variation was </=10%. The quality of staining in postmortem samples was comparable with that in healthy subjects and was not substantially affected by time from death to specimen collection of up to nearly 4 days. Mean (range) IENFD from postmortem samples in the proximal and distal leg was 2.73 (0-7.65) and 1.93 (0-4.91) fibers/mm of skin, respectively.

Inactivation of the LOX gene in osteoblasts by DNA methylation and JAK signaling has been reported to cause loss of cross-links and an increased risk of fractures. Tocotrienols (T3s) have proven benefits on bone strength, but their potential effects on LOX remain largely unknown. Thus, the present study investigates the in vitro effects of T3s on LOX expression in human osteoblastic MG-63 cells. Results indicated that Tocotrienol-Rich Fraction (TRF), the delta-T3 rich oil extracted from Annatto was the most effective and significantly increased LOX expression. TRF treatment decreased de-novo methyltransferases (DNMTs), DNMT3A and DNMT3B levels. In addition, TRF significantly inhibited JAK2 activation and decreased expression of Fli1, a transcription factor of DNMTs. We conclude that TRF induced an increase in LOX expression via inhibition of de-novo methylation and reduction of Fli1 expression by the inactivation of JAK2.Abbreviations: CpG: cytosine-guanine dinucleotide; DNMT: DNA methyltransferase; Fli1: friend leukemia virus integration 1; JAK: janus kinase; LOX: lysyl oxidase; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; STAT: signal transducers and activators of transcription; T3s: tocotrienols; TPs: tocopherols; TRF: Tocotrienol-Rich Fraction.",,"['Kohno, Kakeru', 'Yamada, Wakana', 'Ishitsuka, Aya', 'Sekine, Miki', 'Virgona, Nantiga', 'Ota, Masako', 'Yano, Tomohiro']","['Kohno K', 'Yamada W', 'Ishitsuka A', 'Sekine M', 'Virgona N', 'Ota M', 'Yano T']",,"['Graduate School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, Toyo University, Itakura, Gunma, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Life Innovation, Toyo University, Itakura, Gunma, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Life Innovation, Toyo University, Itakura, Gunma, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Life Innovation, Toyo University, Itakura, Gunma, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Life Innovation, Toyo University, Itakura, Gunma, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, Toyo University, Itakura, Gunma, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Life Innovation, Toyo University, Itakura, Gunma, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, Toyo University, Itakura, Gunma, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Life Innovation, Toyo University, Itakura, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191119,England,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",9205717,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tocotrienols)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', '6PQP1V1B6O (annatto)', 'EC 1.4.3.13 (Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase)']",IM,"['Bixaceae/*metabolism', 'Carotenoids/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Osteoblasts/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*metabolism', 'Protein-Lysine 6-Oxidase/*metabolism', 'Tocotrienols/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Tocotrienol-Rich Fraction from Annatto', 'bone quality', 'human osteoblastic cell', 'lysyl oxidase']",2019/11/20 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/11/20 06:00'],"['2019/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09168451.2019.1693252 [doi]'],ppublish,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2020 Mar;84(3):526-535. doi: 10.1080/09168451.2019.1693252.

Latest studies report that long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) play an essential role in diversified pathological processes of ESCC, although the mechanism by which they do so remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the parts of lncRNA taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) in ESCC tissues and cells, its biofunctional effect and its underlying regulatory mechanism in ESCC. METHODS: The levels of TUG1 and miR-148a-3p were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in ESCC cells and tissues. The biofunctional effects were examined by MTT, flow cytometry, and transwell assay. The protein expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins and MCL-1 were determined by western blot analysis. The binding sites between miR-148a-3p and TUG1 or MCL-1 were predicted by online software starBase and confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of TUG1 was significantly upregulated in ESCC tissues or cells, and was negatively correlated to miR-148a-3p expression in tissues. Knockdown of TUG1 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion, promoted apoptosis, and relieved the EMT progression in EC9706 and OE19 cells. Besides, knockdown of miR-148a-3p inverted positive effects from TUG1 deletion on ESCC cells. Besides, MCL-1 reversed the inhibitive effects from TUG1 deletion on expression of EMT-associated proteins (Wnt1, C-myc, CyclinD1, and beta-catenin) above subsequently. CONCLUSION: TUG1 regulated the biofunction and EMT progression of ESCC by mediating miR-148a-3p/MCL-1/Wnt/beta-catenin axis in vitro.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

In this study we examined the accuracy of two clinical predictors, back pain and lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS BMD), to derive four case-finding paradigms for detection of prevalent VF (PVF). Subjects were 400 children at risk for PVF (leukemia 186, rheumatic disorders 135, nephrotic syndrome 79). Back pain was assessed by patient report, LS BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and PVF were quantified on spine radiographs using the modified Genant semiquantitative method. Forty-four patients (11.0%) had PVF. Logistic regression analysis between LS BMD and PVF produced an odds ratio (OR) of 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 2.5) per reduction in Z-score unit, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.79), and an optimal BMD Z-score cutoff of -1.6. Case identification using either low BMD alone (Z-score < -1.6) or back pain alone gave similar results for sensitivity (55%, 52%, respectively), specificity (78%, 81%, respectively), positive predictive value (PPV; 24%, 25%, respectively), and negative predictive value (NPV; 93%, 93%, respectively). The paradigm using low BMD plus back pain produced lower sensitivity (32%), higher specificity (96%), higher PPV (47%), and similar NPV (92%). The approach using low BMD or back pain had the highest sensitivity (75%), lowest specificity (64%), lowest PPV (20%), and highest NPV (95%). All paradigms had increased sensitivities for higher fracture grades. Our results show that BMD and back pain history can be used to identify children with the highest risk of PVF so that radiography can be used judiciously. The specific paradigm to be applied will depend on the expected PVF rate and the clinical approach to the use of radiography.

Basiliximab may also be used for prophylaxis and treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); however, the PK of basiliximab in this setting are not known. Clinical transplant providers expect variation in the volume of distribution and clearance after nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation (NMAT) compared with solid organ transplantation. Blood loss, organ site-specific antibody accumulation, and differences in blood product use during the two transplantation approaches may generate differences in basiliximab PK. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the PK of basiliximab after its addition to a minimally intense NMAT regimen, in conjunction with cyclosporine, for GVHD prophylaxis in patients with hematologic malignancies. DESIGN: Population PK analysis of a single-center, single-arm, phase II clinical trial. SETTING: Academic cancer research center. PATIENTS: Fourteen adults with hematologic malignancies (acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, myelofibrosis, or severe aplastic anemia) and undergoing NMAT with a fully HLA-matched (10 of 10 antigen matched) related or unrelated donor. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Basiliximab was used in conjunction with cyclosporine to deplete activated T cells in vivo as GVHD prophylaxis. We developed a novel competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method using recombinant interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain (IL-2Ra) and a commercially available soluble sIL-2R ELISA kit to permit the quantification of serum basiliximab concentrations and characterization of the PK properties of the drug in this patient population. Using a nonlinear mixed effects model with NONMEM software, a one-compartment model with first-order elimination best described the PK, as covariate analysis using stepwise covariate modeling did not improve the base model. CONCLUSION: We suggest a one-compartment population model with first-order elimination to capture the PK profile for basiliximab for this patient population.","['(c) 2019 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']","['Podichetty, Jagdeep T', 'Brinda, Bryan J', 'Nelson, Robert P', 'Karr, Alissa H', 'Prasad, Nagendra K', 'Quinney, Sara', 'Foxworthy Scott, Susanna', 'Kiel, Patrick J']","['Podichetty JT', 'Brinda BJ', 'Nelson RP', 'Karr AH', 'Prasad NK', 'Quinney S', 'Foxworthy Scott S', 'Kiel PJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6046-2317'],"['Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.', 'Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191220,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9927MT646M (Basiliximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Basiliximab/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",['NOTNLM'],"['*allogeneic', '*basiliximab', '*graft-versus-host', '*transplant']",2019/11/20 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/11/20 06:00'],"['2019/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/phar.2347 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2020 Jan;40(1):26-32. doi: 10.1002/phar.2347.

The multiple sclerosis drug Fingolimod (FTY720) is a potent S1P receptor agonist that causes peripheral lymphopenia. Recent research has demonstrated direct neuroprotective properties of FTY720 in several neurodegenerative paradigms; however, neuroprotective properties of the native ligand S1P have not been established. We aimed to establish the significance of neurotrophic factor up-regulation by S1P for neuroprotection, comparing S1P with FTY720. S1P induced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB), and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) gene expression in primary human and murine astrocytes, but not in neurons, and to a much greater extent than FTY720. Accordingly, S1P but not FTY720 protected cultured neurons against excitotoxic cell death in a primary murine neuron-glia coculture model, and a neutralizing antibody to LIF blocked this S1P-mediated neuroprotection. Antagonists of S1PR1 and S1PR2 both inhibited S1P-mediated neurotrophic gene induction in human astrocytes, indicating that simultaneous activation of both receptors is required. S1PR2 signaling was transduced through Galpha13 and the small GTPase Rho, and was necessary for the up-regulation and activation of the transcription factors FOS and JUN, which regulate LIF, BDNF, and HBEGF transcription. In summary, we show that S1P protects hippocampal neurons against excitotoxic cell death through up-regulation of neurotrophic gene expression, particularly LIF, in astrocytes. This up-regulation requires both S1PR1 and S1PR2 signaling. FTY720 does not activate S1PR2, explaining its relative inefficacy compared to S1P.",['(c) 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.'],"['Tran, Collin', 'Heng, Benjamin', 'Teo, Jonathan D', 'Humphrey, Sean J', 'Qi, Yanfei', 'Couttas, Timothy A', 'Stefen, Holly', 'Brettle, Merryn', 'Fath, Thomas', 'Guillemin, Gilles J', 'Don, Anthony S']","['Tran C', 'Heng B', 'Teo JD', 'Humphrey SJ', 'Qi Y', 'Couttas TA', 'Stefen H', 'Brettle M', 'Fath T', 'Guillemin GJ', 'Don AS']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8105-4470', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1655-1184']","['School of Medical Sciences, UNSW Sydney, Kensington, NSW, Australia.', 'Centenary Institute, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.', 'MND Research Centre, Neuroinflammation group, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Centenary Institute, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.', 'School of Life and Environmental Sciences, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.', 'Centenary Institute, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.', 'Centenary Institute, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.', 'Dementia Research Centre and Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'School of Medical Sciences, UNSW Sydney, Kensington, NSW, Australia.', 'School of Medical Sciences, UNSW Sydney, Kensington, NSW, Australia.', 'Dementia Research Centre and Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'MND Research Centre, Neuroinflammation group, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Centenary Institute, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.', 'NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191206,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Receptor Modulators)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Hippocampus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysophospholipids/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Receptor Modulators/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*FTY720', '*Fingolimod', '*LIF', '*S1P', '*neuroprotection', '*sphingosine 1-phosphate']",2019/11/20 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2019/11/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jnc.14917 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 2020 Apr;153(2):173-188. doi: 10.1111/jnc.14917.

METHODS: The authors assessed bone marrow aspirates from 421 patients with newly diagnosed AML using next-generation sequencing for ASXL1, DNMT3A, JAK2, TET2, and TP53 mutations, defined as the presence of mutations in ASXL1, DNMT3A, JAK2, TET2, or TP53 with a minimum variant allele frequency (VAF) of 5%. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients (17%) had ASXL1 mutations, 104 patients (25%) had DNMT3A mutations, 16 patients (4%) had JAK2 mutations, 82 patients (20%) had TET2 mutations, and 86 patients (20%) had TP53 mutations. Among patients with each mutation, the median VAF of ASXL1 was 34.31% (range, 1.17%-58.62%), the median VAF of DNMT3A was 41.76% (range, 1.02%-91.66%), the median VAF of JAK2 was 46.70% (range, 10.4%-71.7%), the median VAF of TET2 was 42.78% (range, 2.26%-95.32%), and the median VAF of TP53 was 45.47% (range, 1.15%-93.74%). The composite complete response rate was 60%, and was 77% in patients with AML with and without ASXL1, DNMT3A, JAK2, TET2, or TP53 mutations, respectively (P = .006); the median overall survival was 11 months and 27 months, respectively (P < .001). Multivariate analysis identified age; an antecedent history of dysplasia; white blood cell count; adverse cytogenetic risk; previous treatment with an FLT3 inhibitor; and the VAF of ASXL1, DNMT3A, JAK2, TET2, TP53, and NPM1 mutations by next-generation sequencing as prognostic factors for overall survival.

Despite increasing awareness of the psychosocial issues experienced by this group, a paucity of psychosocial interventions has been developed. This study aims to investigate the Framed Portrait Experience (FPE) as an intervention to promote well-being among AYA cancer survivors. A pilot study was conducted using a quasi-experimental design. The sample included 18 AYA leukemia survivors. Individuals in the intervention group (n = 10) participated in the FPE, a psychosocial program consisting of two sessions. In the first one, starting from the illness narrative recollected by the individual, pictures representing the subject in meaningful contexts are taken. Then, a selected number of pictures are used in a second encounter with a therapist to integrate the disease within past, present, and future of the participant. Survivors in the comparison group (n = 8) were offered usual psychosocial care at the participating institute. Measures of personality traits, coping, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and body image were compared at pre-test and 3 months later. Significant differences in self-efficacy and self-esteem scores were identified at post-test between the intervention and comparison group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were identified for body self-esteem. These findings provide initial evidence supporting the FPE as a low-cost and easy-to-implement intervention to promote self-efficacy and self-esteem among AYA survivors.

There is a growing concern about BPA as a weak estrogenic compound that can affect human endocrine function. Chemicals structurally similar to BPA, such as bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS), have been developed as substitutes in the manufacturing industry. Whether these bisphenol substitutes have adverse effects on human endocrine and reproductive systems remains largely unknown. This study investigated the effects of BPA, BPF, and BPS on regulating the function of decidualized human primary endometrial stromal cells on trophoblast outgrowth and invasion by indirect and direct co-culture models. All three bisphenols did not affect the stromal cell decidualization process. However, BPA- and BPF-treated decidualized stromal cells stimulated trophoblastic spheroid invasion in the indirect coculture model. The BPA-treated decidualized stromal cells had upregulated expressions of several invasion-related molecules including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), whereas both BPA- and BPF-treated decidualized stromal cells had downregulated expressions of anti-invasion molecules including plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) . Taken together, BPA and BPF altered the expression of invasive and anti-invasive molecules in decidualized stromal cells modulating its function on trophoblast outgrowth and invasion, which could affect the implantation process and subsequent pregnancy outcome.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

There is scant Indian data on MRD by flowcytometry in T-ALL including gating strategies, clinical correlation etc. The primary aim of this retrospective observational study was to define the clinico-hematologic characteristics and prognostic significance of patients with ETP/near-ETP versus non-ETP immunophenotype, especially in terms of minimal residual disease at different time points as well as event-free survival (1 year). Baseline hematologic characteristics along with post-induction (Day-35) and post-consolidation (Day-78) MRD in bone marrow samples from newly diagnosed T-ALL patients were studied. 14.3% patients had ETP-ALL immunophenotype, 11.4% were near-ETP ALL patients and the remaining 74.5% were of non-ETP subtype. The ETP/near ETP patients was significantly associated with higher risk of MRD positivity ( > 0.01%) at the end of induction in comparison to the non-ETP patients (p = 0.033). Also, these patients showed a trend towards proclivity to anemia (p = 0.06) and higher rates of induction failure (p = 0.07) However, no difference was observed between the two subgroups in terms of age, high TLC, thrombocytopenia, adverse cytogenetics, steroid responsiveness on Day + 8 of induction, MRD-positivity > 0.01% at the end of consolidation and EFS-1 year.

Fifty-two patients with a median age of 50 (28-87) years were enrolled in the study. 38 patients (73%) were male and male to female ratio was 2.7. First line therapy was cladrabine in 36 patients (69.2%). The overall response rate was 97%. CR and PR rates were 86.1% and 11.1%, respectively. Interferon was used in 10(19.2%) patients who were diagnosed before 2000s years. CR and PR rates were 70% and 30%, respectively.

We present data on cytogenetics of ALL from a tertiary centre in India correlating it with clinical factors. Karyotyping of bone marrow samples of 204 patients with newly diagnosed ALL was performed with standard G-banding technique. Clinical data of patients was obtained from case records. Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meir curves and compared by the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done for survival with age, sex, immunophenotype, hyperleukocytosis, risk type, remission status and cytogenetics. The most common karyotypes observed were normal in 39.7% (N = 81), hyperdiploidy in 12.7% (N = 26), t(9;22) in 4.4% (N = 9), t(1;19) in 3.9% (N = 8). Adults with ALL had worse survival compared with pediatric patients (HR 3.62; 2.03-6.45 95% CI, p < 0.001). Patients not in morphologic remission after induction chemotherapy fared poorly (HR 4.86; 2.67-8.84 95% CI, p < 0.001). Patients with favourable cytogenetics had better overall survival (HR 0.36; 0.12-1.05 95% CI, p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, achievement of morphologic remission emerged as single most significant predictor of survival (p < 0.001). MLL gene rearrangement and t(12;21) were seen less commonly as compared to Western data.

On 8th day, the number of lymphoblasts was counted in the peripheral blood. Based on the number of blasts patients were classified as good steroid responders and poor steroid responders. Following pre-induction steroids patients were given induction therapy. During this phase on day 14 and day 35 bone marrow (BM) aspiration study was done. Later day 8 steroid response, Day 14 BM status and day 35 BM status were correlated. Results showed that there was a statistically significant correlation between day 8 steroid response and day 14 BM status (both by morphology and flow cytometry).

Since there are metabolic differences between the hematopoietic stem cells and their immediate descendants, we aim at manipulating the energy sources with which that could have an effect on leukemia stem cells while sparing the normal blood cells. In this review we summarize the metabolic characteristics of distinct leukemias such as acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, T cell lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other leukemia associated hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome.

Early diagnosis may significantly improve the prognosis of these patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 54-year-old man, successfully treated for acute myeloid leukemia with cytosine arabinoside, admitted to the intensive care unit with severe shock, refractory to standard therapy with antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressors. Early diagnosis of acute primary abdominal syndrome was made based on an intra-abdominal pressure of 20 mm Hg (3 kPa) with new onset organ failure, after which decompressive laparotomy was performed. Stool cultures grew Clostridium difficile. Despite abdominal decompression, the abdominal compartment syndrome persisted with the development of toxic megacolon and a total colectomy was performed with favorable evolution. METHODS: A systematic review of published case reports was performed describing a primary ACS due to C. difficile toxic megacolon. A PubMed database search was performed with the following search terms, single or in combination: 'clostridium difficile', 'toxic megacolon', 'abdominal compartment syndrome', and 'CDI'. The latest search was performed for March 2019; only case reports after 1998 were included. RESULTS: We found a total of 19 case reports with C. difficile toxic megacolon (including the present case). The male/female ratio was 12/7, and there were 3 children. The mean age was 48.7 +/- 23.5 years. The reason for admission was sepsis in 6, trauma in 2, postoperative in 4, enterocolitis in 5, pregnancy in 1 and abdominal complaints after topical antibiotics in 1. Three patients did not develop diarrhea. Five patients presented with diarrhea on average 5.8 +/- 5.1 (median 4, 1-14) days prior to hospital admission while 7 patients developed diarrhea on average after 10 +/- 19.6 (median 3, 0-54) days during admission. The intra-abdominal pressure (measured in 6 patients, including ours) was 29.2 +/- 11 (20-50) mm Hg (3-7 kPa). Treatment consisted of (a combination of) vancomycin (orally or via rectal enemas), metronidazole (orally or intravenously), and surgical intervention (with decompressive laparotomy). Three patients died (15.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure allows early detection of abdominal compartment syndrome and is warranted in patients with C. difficile infection and/or toxic megacolon. Early decompression can lead to improved outcomes in patients with severe shock and organ failure.",,"['Carmeliet, Tom', 'Zachee, Pierre', 'Dits, Hilde', 'Regenmortel, Niels', 'Malbrain, Manu']","['Carmeliet T', 'Zachee P', 'Dits H', 'Regenmortel N', 'Malbrain M']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Brussels, Laerbeeklaan, Jette, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Ziekenhuis Netwerk Antwerpen, ZNA Stuivenberg, Antwerpen, Belgium.', 'Department of Intensive Care, Ziekenhuis Netwerk Antwerpen, ZNA Stuivenberg, Antwerpen, Belgium.', 'Department of Intensive Care, Ziekenhuis Netwerk Antwerpen, ZNA Stuivenberg, Antwerpen, Belgium.', 'Department of Intensive Care, University Hospital of Brussels (UZB), Jette, Belgium.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",,Poland,Anaesthesiol Intensive Ther,Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,101472620,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage', 'Clostridioides difficile/isolation & purification', 'Clostridium Infections/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Colectomy/methods', 'Decompression, Surgical/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intra-Abdominal Hypertension/*diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Laparotomy/methods', 'Male', 'Megacolon, Toxic/*diagnosis/microbiology/therapy', 'Middle Aged']",['NOTNLM'],"['* Clostridium difficile', '* abdominal compartment syndrome', '* abdominal hypertension', '* colitis', '* sepsis', '* septic shock', '* toxic megacolon', '*abdominal pressure']",2019/11/20 06:00,2020/08/29 06:00,['2019/11/20 06:00'],"['2019/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['38376 [pii]', '10.5114/ait.2019.89189 [doi]']",ppublish,Anaesthesiol Intensive Ther. 2019;51(4):273-282. doi: 10.5114/ait.2019.89189.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 5-FU resistant subclone (HL-60/5FU) of the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line was selected by the conventional method of continuous exposure of the cells to the drug up to 0.08 mmol/L concentration. HL-60/5FU cells exhibited six-fold enhanced resistance to 5-FU than HL-60 cells. RT-PCR and ELISA assay showed significant overexpression of MDR-related ABC transporters, ABCB1, ABCG2 but especially ABCC1 in the HL-60/5FU as compared with the parental cell line. Three novel synthetic 5-methylidenedihydrouracil analogs, U-236, U-332 and U-359, selected as highly cytotoxic for HL-60 cells in MTT test, showed similar cytotoxicity in the resistant cell line. When co-incubated with 5-FU, these analogs were found to down-regulate the expression of all three transporters. However, the most pronounced effect was caused by U-332 which almost completely abolished ABCC1 expression in the resistant HL-60/5FU cells. Additionally, U-332 inhibited the activity of ATPase, an enzyme which catalyzes hydrolysis of ATP, providing energy to efflux drugs from the cells through the cellular membranes. Taken together, the obtained data suggest that acquired 5-FU resistance in HL-60/5FU cells results from overexpression of ABCC1 and that targeting ABCC1 expression could be a potential approach to re-sensitize resistant leukemia cells to 5-FU. The synthetic uracil analog U-332, which can potently down-regulate ABC transporter expression and therefore disturb drug efflux, can be considered an efficient ABCC1 regulator in cancer cells.",,"['Dlugosz-Pokorska, Angelika', 'Pieta, Marlena', 'Janecki, Tomasz', 'Janecka, Anna']","['Dlugosz-Pokorska A', 'Pieta M', 'Janecki T', 'Janecka A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5178-4464'],"['Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, Lodz, Poland.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Institute of Organic Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Lodz, Poland.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Institute of Organic Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, Lodz, Poland. anna.janecka@umed.lodz.pl.']",['eng'],['No DEC-2017/25/N/NZ3/01039/Narodowe Centrum Nauki'],['Journal Article'],20191118,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1', 'ABCC1', 'ABCG2', 'ATP-ase activity', 'MDR phenotype']",2019/11/20 06:00,2020/05/02 06:00,['2019/11/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-019-05017-w [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-019-05017-w [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2019 Dec;46(6):5831-5839. doi: 10.1007/s11033-019-05017-w.

METHODS: Qualitative interviews with national experts and blood cancer survivors aided the development of an online survey distributed to a survivorship clinic director or staff at 63 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers. RESULTS: Staff at 71% of centers participated (n = 45). Survivorship needs identified as most important-follow-up for health issues due to treatment side effects, healthy behavior programming, and individual mental health services-were reported as offered at 91%, 84%, and 84% of centers, respectively. However, respondents indicated that satellite centers offered these services 20% of the time or less. Forty-five percent reported that they believed the majority of survivorship needs of patients with blood cancer who have completed treatment were not adequately met by their center or other organizations. Most frequently indicated barriers to accessing services were distance from the patient's home and lack of primary care physician adherence to best practices or knowledge of late/long-term effects. CONCLUSIONS: To enhance survivorship services for patients with blood cancer, NCI-Designated Cancer Centers and non-profits should focus on increasing access to services for survivors who do not reside near the main center and improving coordination between oncology, mental health, and primary care. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Understanding survivorship service delivery is an important step toward developing solutions that help survivors seek and access support at their site of care and from other non-profit organizations.",,"['Reinhart, Crystal A', 'Sae-Hau, Maria', 'Lee, Carol A', 'Weiss, Elisa S']","['Reinhart CA', 'Sae-Hau M', 'Lee CA', 'Weiss ES']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6525-9513'],"['Center for Prevention Research and Development, University of Illinois, 510 Devonshire Drive, Champaign, IL, 61820, USA. reinhrt@illinois.edu.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY, USA.', 'School of Social Work, University of Illinois, Champaign, IL, USA.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191118,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Delivery of Health Care/*methods', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Humans', 'National Cancer Institute (U.S.)', '*Survivorship', 'United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Health services accessibility', '*Hematologic malignancy', '*Survivorship']",2019/11/20 06:00,2020/09/24 06:00,['2019/11/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11764-019-00823-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11764-019-00823-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2020 Feb;14(1):43-47. doi: 10.1007/s11764-019-00823-4.

FMRP upregulates and downregulates the activity of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing in the 3' UTR of a subset of mRNAs through its interaction with RNA helicase Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10). This bi-functional role is modulated through RNA secondary structures known as G-Quadruplexes. We elucidated the mechanism of FMRP's role in suppressing Argonaute (AGO) family members' association with mRNAs by mapping the interacting domains of FMRP, MOV10 and AGO and then showed that the RGG box of FMRP protects a subset of co-bound mRNAs from AGO association. The N-terminus of MOV10 is required for this protection: its over-expression leads to increased levels of the endogenous proteins encoded by this co-bound subset of mRNAs. The N-terminus of MOV10 also leads to increased RGG box-dependent binding to the SC1 RNA G-Quadruplex and is required for outgrowth of neurites. Lastly, we showed that FMRP has a global role in miRNA-mediated translational regulation by recruiting AGO2 to a large subset of RNAs in mouse brain.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

To examine its prevalence and clinical impact in all WHO classification-based subcategories, we analyzed eosinophil counts in 2350 mastocytosis patients using the dataset of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis. Ninety percent of patients had normal eosinophil counts, 6.8% mild eosinophilia (0.5-1.5 x 10(9)/l), and 3.1% hypereosinophilia (HE; >1.5 x 10(9)/l). Eosinophilia/HE were mainly present in patients with advanced SM (17%/19%), and only rarely recorded in patients with indolent and smoldering SM (5%/1%), and some patients with cutaneous mastocytosis. The eosinophil count correlated with organomegaly, dysmyelopoiesis, and the WHO classification, but not with mediator-related symptoms or allergy. Eosinophilia at diagnosis had a strong prognostic impact (p < 0.0001) on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), with a 10-year OS of 19% for patients with HE, 70% for those with mild eosinophilia, and 88% for patients with normal eosinophil counts. In 89% of patients with follow-up data (n = 1430, censored at start of cytoreductive therapy), eosinophils remained stable. In those with changing eosinophil counts (increase/decrease or mixed pattern), OS and PFS were inferior compared with patients with stable eosinophil counts.

LGLL patients can be asymptomatic or develop cytopenia, mostly neutropenia. Somatic STAT3 and STAT5b mutations have been recently reported in approximately 40% of patients. The aim of this study is to analyze clinical and biological features of a large cohort of LGLL patients to identify prognostic markers affecting patients' outcome. In 205 LGLL patients, neutropenia (ANC < 1500/mm(3)) was the main feature (38%), with severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm(3)) being present in 20.5% of patients. STAT3 mutations were detected in 28.3% patients and were associated with ANC < 500/mm(3) (p < 0.0001), Hb < 90 g/L (p = 0.0079) and treatment requirement (p < 0.0001) while STAT5b mutations were found in 15/152 asymptomatic patients. By age-adjusted univariate analysis, ANC < 500/mm(3) (p = 0.013), Hb < 90 g/L (p < 0.0001), treatment requirement (p = 0.001) and STAT3 mutated status (p = 0.011) were associated to reduced overall survival (OS). By multivariate analysis, STAT3 mutated status (p = 0.0089) and Hb < 90 g/L (p = 0.0011) were independently associated to reduced OS. In conclusion, we identified clinical and biological features associated to reduced OS in LGLL and we demonstrated the adverse impact of STAT3 mutations in patients' survival, suggesting that this biological feature should be regarded as a potential target of therapy.",,"['Barila, Gregorio', 'Teramo, Antonella', 'Calabretto, Giulia', 'Vicenzetto, Cristina', 'Gasparini, Vanessa Rebecca', 'Pavan, Laura', 'Leoncin, Matteo', 'Vedovato, Susanna', 'Frigo, Anna Chiara', 'Facco, Monica', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Zambello, Renato']","['Barila G', 'Teramo A', 'Calabretto G', 'Vicenzetto C', 'Gasparini VR', 'Pavan L', 'Leoncin M', 'Vedovato S', 'Frigo AC', 'Facco M', 'Semenzato G', 'Zambello R']",,"['Department of Medicine (DIMED), Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine (DIMED), Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine (DIMED), Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine (DIMED), Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine (DIMED), Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine (DIMED), Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine (DIMED), Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine (DIMED), Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Cardiac-Thoracic-Vascular Sciences and Public Health, Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Public Health Unit, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine (DIMED), Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine (DIMED), Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy. g.semenzato@unipd.it.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy. g.semenzato@unipd.it.', 'Department of Medicine (DIMED), Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Padua University School of Medicine, Padua, Italy. r.zambello@unipd.it.', 'Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy. r.zambello@unipd.it.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191118,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate']",,,2019/11/20 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/11/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0644-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0644-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Apr;34(4):1116-1124. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0644-0.

It triggers the release of type I interferons (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines inducing an adaptive cellular immune response. We investigated the therapeutic potential of systemic RIG-I activation by short 5'-triphosphate-modified RNA (ppp-RNA) for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the syngeneic murine C1498 AML tumor model. ppp-RNA treatment significantly reduced tumor burden, delayed disease onset and led to complete remission including immunological memory formation in a substantial proportion of animals. Therapy-induced tumor rejection was dependent on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, but not on NK or B cells, and relied on intact IFN and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) signaling in the host. Interestingly, ppp-RNA treatment induced programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on AML cells and established therapeutic sensitivity to anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade in vivo. In immune-reconstituted humanized mice, ppp-RNA treatment reduced the number of patient-derived xenografted (PDX) AML cells in blood and bone marrow while concomitantly enhancing CD3(+) T cell counts in the respective tissues. Due to its ability to establish a state of full remission and immunological memory, our findings show that ppp-RNA treatment is a promising strategy for the immunotherapy of AML.",,"['Ruzicka,

Then we proceeded to a survival analysis and prognostic risk analysis between the expression levels of PDE7B gene and CN-AML patients. The result showed that the event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly shorter in CN-AML patients with high PDE7B levels in each dataset.

We retrospectively analyzed SCT2 outcomes in 556 patients, median age 46 years, relapsing after first transplant given in CR1. Patients were divided into three groups based on SCT2 donor (donor2): same donor (n = 163, sib/sib-112, UD/UD-51), different matched donor (n = 305, sib/different sib-44, sib/UD-93, UD/different UD-168), or haplo-donor (n = 88, sib/haplo-45, UD/haplo-43). Two-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate after SCT2 was 23.5%, 23.7%, and 21.8%, respectively (P = 0.30). Multivariate analysis showed no effect of donor2 type on relapse: hazard ratio (HR) 0.89 (P = 0.57) and 1.11 (P = 0.68) for different donor and haplo-donor compared to same donor, respectively. However, donor2 did predict for non-relapse mortality (NRM) after SCT2: HR 1.21 (P = 0.50) and 2.08 (P = 0.03), respectively, and for LFS: HR 1.00 (P = 0.97) and 1.43 (P = 0.07), respectively. In conclusion, SCT2 with the same or different matched donor is associated with similar outcomes in patients with relapsed AML. Non-T-depleted haplo-identical transplant may be associated with higher NRM, similar relapse rate and with no better results in this setting.",,"['Shimoni, Avichai', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Gramatzki, Martin', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Stoelzel, Friedrich', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Holler, Ernst', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Shimoni A', 'Labopin M', 'Finke J', 'Ciceri F', 'Deconinck E', 'Kroger N', 'Gramatzki M', 'Stelljes M', 'Blaise D', 'Stoelzel F', 'Chevallier P', 'Holler E', 'Fegueux N', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5684-9447'],"['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. ashimoni@sheba.health.gov.il.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France."", 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation & Immunotherapy, 2nd Medical Department, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine A, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Medical Clinic and Policlinic, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Clinical Hematology, Nantes University Hospital, Nantes, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.', 'Department of Haematology, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party of EBMT, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191118,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Donor Selection', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/11/20 06:00,2020/05/16 06:00,['2019/11/20 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-019-0251-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-019-0251-3 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2019 Nov 18;9(12):88. doi: 10.1038/s41408-019-0251-3.,PMC6861251,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we identified TME-related genes associated with AML prognosis. Gene expression profiles from AML patients were downloaded from TCGA database, and immune and stromal scores were calculated using the ESTIMATE algorithm. Immune scores were correlated with clinical features such as FAB subtypes and patient's age. After categorizing AML cases into high and low score groups, an association between several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and overall survival was identified. Functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs showed that they were primarily enriched in the immune response, inflammatory response, and cytokine activity, and were involved in signaling processes related to hematopoietic cell lineage, B cell receptor, and chemokine pathways. Two significant modules, dominated respectively by CCR5 and ITGAM nodes, were identified from the PPI network, and 20 hub genes were extracted. A total of 112 DEGs correlated with poor overall survival of AML patients, and 11 of those genes were validated in a separate TARGET-AML cohort.

Naive ESCs resemble peri-implantation stages and primed ESCs the pre-gastrulation epiblast. In mouse, primed ESCs give rise to definitive endoderm in response to the pathways downstream of Nodal and Wnt signalling. However, when these pathways are activated in naive ESCs, they differentiate to a cell type resembling early primitive endoderm (PrE), the blastocyst-stage progenitor of the extra-embryonic endoderm. Here, we apply this context dependency to human ESCs, showing that activation of Nodal and Wnt signalling drives the differentiation of naive pluripotent cells toward extra-embryonic PrE, or hypoblast, and these can be expanded as an in vitro model for naive extra-embryonic endoderm (nEnd). Consistent with observations made in mouse, human PrE differentiation is dependent on FGF signalling in vitro, and we show that, by inhibiting FGF receptor signalling, we can simplify naive pluripotent culture conditions, such that the inhibitor requirements closer resemble those used in mouse. The expandable nEnd cultures reported here represent stable extra-embryonic endoderm, or human hypoblast, cell lines.This article has an associated 'The people behind the papers' interview.",['(c) 2019.

All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) has been successfully applied for the treatment of M3-type AML (APL, 10 %), but it fails to demonstrate a significant efficacy on the remaining patients with non-APL AML (90 %). Therefore, the research for strategies to extend the efficacy of ATRA-based therapy to non-APL AML is a key avenue of investigation. Here, we evaluate the synergetic effect of CDK2 inhibition and ATRA in AML both in vitro and in vivo. We have determined that both the CDK2 depletion and pharmacological inhibitor of CDK2 significantly sensitize three subtypes of AML cells (including two non-APL cells) to ATRA-induced cell differentiation. RNA-sequence results indicate that transcription activation of differentiation and maturation pathways plays an important role in this synergetic effect. Furthermore, the down-regulation of CDK2 sensitized AML cells to ATRA-induced engraftment prevention of leukemia cells in NOD-SCID mice and promotes the primary AML blasts differentiation when combined with ATRA. Thus, our work not only provides relevant experimental evidence for further validating CDK2 as a target for differentiation therapy, but also uncovers the future clinical application of CDK2 inhibitors in ATRA-based differentiation therapeutics for AML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, whether the same is true in rodent placenta remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokine LIF on the induction of CRH in mouse trophoblast stem cells (mTSCs). During differentiation, the CRH levels in mTSCs gradually increased. On days 3 and 5 after LIF supplementation, Crh expression in the differentiated mTSCs was significantly increased with LIF treatment than those without LIF treatment. Moreover, the CRH concentration in the culture media increased. Thereafter, we examined the contribution of the downstream pathways of LIF to CRH induction in differentiated mTSCs. The LIF-induced upregulation of CRH was attenuated by inhibition of PI3K/AKT and MAPK phosphorylation but not by inhibition of JAK/STAT3. Therefore, in mTSCs, LIF increased Crh expression through activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways but not by the JAK/STAT3 pathway.

Compared with the rs3758149 T allele, the C allele showed significantly higher transcriptional activity in luciferase reporter assays, as well as a stronger binding affinity for the nuclear protein extracts in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

Despite the availability of these agents, it is not uncommon for some patients to experience treatment failure across several lines of therapy. Sequencing the available treatment options is a challenging task that becomes more complex after patients fail the more potent second- and third-generation TKIs.

Although clinical advances in AML have been made, especially in young patients, long-term disease-free survival remains poor, making this disease an unmet therapeutic challenge. Epigenetic alterations and mutations in epigenetic regulators contribute to the pathogenesis of AML, supporting the rationale for the use of epigenetic drugs in patients with AML. While hypomethylating agents have already been approved in AML, the use of other epigenetic inhibitors, such as histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi), is under clinical development. HDACi such as Panobinostat, Vorinostat, and Tricostatin A have been shown to promote cell death, autophagy, apoptosis, or growth arrest in preclinical AML models, yet these inhibitors do not seem to be effective as monotherapies, but rather in combination with other drugs. In this review, we discuss the rationale for the use of different HDACi in patients with AML, the results of preclinical studies, and the results obtained in clinical trials. Although so far the results with HDACi in clinical trials in AML have been modest, there are some encouraging data from treatment with the HDACi Pracinostat in combination with DNA demethylating agents.",,"['San Jose-Eneriz, Edurne', 'Gimenez-Camino, Naroa', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Prosper, Felipe']","['San Jose-Eneriz E', 'Gimenez-Camino N', 'Agirre X', 'Prosper F']",,"['Area de Hemato-Oncologia, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), Universidad de Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Area de Hemato-Oncologia, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), Universidad de Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Area de Hemato-Oncologia, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), Universidad de Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Area de Hemato-Oncologia, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), Universidad de Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Hematologia, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Universidad de Navarra, 31008 Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191114,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'epigenetic', 'histone deacetylases', 'histone deacetylases inhibitors']",2019/11/20 06:00,2019/11/20 06:01,['2019/11/20 06:00'],"['2019/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/20 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11111794 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11111794 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Nov 14;11(11). pii: cancers11111794. doi: 10.3390/cancers11111794.,PMC6896008,,,,['Authors declare no conflicts of interest related to the present manuscript.'],,,,,,,,,,,

In adults, regenerative responses to tissues damage can require a replay of these same developmental pathways. Errors in reassigning positional identity during regeneration can cause metaplasias-normal tissue arising in an abnormal location-and this in turn, is a well-recognized cancer risk factor. In animal models, a gain of Cdx2 function can elicit a posterior shift in tissue identity, modeling intestinal-type metaplasias of the esophagus (Barrett's esophagus) and stomach. Conversely, loss of Cdx2 function can elicit an anterior shift in tissue identity, inducing serrated-type lesions expressing gastric markers in the colon. These metaplasias are major risk factors for the later development of esophageal, stomach and colon cancer.

METHODS: Based on lncRNA expression profiles downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs (DELs) between good prognosis and bad prognosis samples were screened, from which prognosis-related lncRNAs were selected using uni-variate and multi-variate Cox regression analysis. Based on the expression profiles of these signature prognosis-related lncRNAs, a risk scoring system was developed and applied to a training set and validated on a testing set. With sample-matched mRNAs of the signature lncRNAs, lncRNA-mRNA networks were built, followed by function analysis for the mRNAs in these networks. RESULT: Total 66 DELs were identified between good prognosis and bad prognosis samples. Among these DELs, LINC01003, CTD-2234N14, RP1-137K24, and RP11-834C111 were found to be independent predictors of prognosis. A risk scoring system based on the expressions of the 4 signature lncRNAs was developed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis found that the risk score system could classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different survival outcomes. Function analysis showed that the mRNAs in these lncRNA-mRNA networks were significantly linked to mTOR signaling pathway, apoptosis, Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, and T cell receptor signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study suggested a promising 4 prognostic lncRNAs-based risk scoring system in AML. These 4 lncRNAs may play roles in regulating prognosis partly via mTOR signaling pathway, apoptosis, and some immune-related pathways.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The patient was eventually evaluated using molecular diagnostic techniques, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and next generation sequencing (NGS) assays that demonstrated PICALM-MLLT10 fusion and a NOTCH1 mutation in the absence of BCL2/IGH fusion. The use of NGS, specifically mate-pair sequencing (MPseq), subsequently confirmed an in-frame PICALM-MLLT10 fusion. Our retrospective analysis showed that PICALM-MLLT10 fusion has no association with CD3/TdT negativity, as 6/49 T-ALL/LBL cases from Mayo Clinic database (01/1998-09/2018), including this case, were noted to have PICALM-MLLT10 fusion; however, none of the other cases were associated with CD3/TdT negativity.

We analyzed 166 patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy at our institution. Eleven patients did not achieve a minimal residual disease (MRD)- deep remission, whereas 67 patients had a recurrence after achieving a MRD- deep remission: 28 patients with CD19+ leukemia and 39 patients with CD19- leukemia. Return of CD19+ leukemia was associated with loss of CAR T-cell function, whereas CD19- leukemia was associated with continued CAR T-cell function. There were no significant differences in efficacy of CAR T cells in CD19-dim B-ALL, compared with CD19-normal or -bright B-ALL. Consistent with this, CAR T cells recognized and lysed cells with very low levels of CD19 expression in vitro. The presence of dim CD19 or rare CD19- events by flow cytometry did not predict nonresponse or recurrence after CAR T-cell therapy. However, prior therapy with the CD19-directed, bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab was associated with a significantly higher rate of failure to achieve MRD- remission or subsequent loss of remission with antigen escape.

However, cellular stress responses trigger the reactivation of HTLV-1, enabling the virus to transmit to a new host cell. Using single-molecule RNA FISH, we measured the kinetics of the HTLV-1 transcriptional reactivation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from HTLV-1+ individuals. The abundance of the HTLV-1 sense and antisense transcripts was quantified hourly during incubation of the HTLV-1-infected PBMCs ex vivo. We found that, in each cell, the sense-strand transcription occurs in two distinct phases: the initial low-rate transcription is followed by a phase of rapid transcription. The onset of transcription peaked between 1 and 3 hours after the start of in vitro incubation. The variance in the transcription intensity was similar in polyclonal HTLV-1+ PBMCs (with tens of thousands of distinct provirus insertion sites), and in samples with a single dominant HTLV-1+ clone. A stochastic simulation model was developed to estimate the parameters of HTLV-1 proviral transcription kinetics. In PBMCs from a leukemic subject with one dominant T-cell clone, the model indicated that the average duration of HTLV-1 sense-strand activation by Tax (i.e. the rapid transcription) was less than one hour. HTLV-1 antisense transcription was stable during reactivation of the sense-strand. The antisense transcript HBZ was produced at an average rate of ~0.1 molecules per hour per HTLV-1+ cell; however, between 20% and 70% of HTLV-1-infected cells were HBZ-negative at a given time, the percentage depending on the individual subject. HTLV-1-infected cells are exposed to a range of stresses when they are drawn from the host, which initiate the viral reactivation. We conclude that whereas antisense-strand transcription is stable throughout the stress response, the HTLV-1 sense-strand reactivation is highly heterogeneous and occurs in short, self-terminating bursts.",,"['Miura, Michi', 'Dey, Supravat', 'Ramanayake, Saumya', 'Singh, Abhyudai', 'Rueda, David S', 'Bangham, Charles R M']","['Miura M', 'Dey S', 'Ramanayake S', 'Singh A', 'Rueda DS', 'Bangham CRM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6943-3782', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4718-8728', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1451-2838', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4657-6323']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, United States of America.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, United States of America.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Single Molecule Imaging Group, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['206292/Z/17/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'UKRI MC-A658-5TY10/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K019090/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R01 GM126557/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '100291 /WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 GM124446/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '100291/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_UP_1102/5/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191118,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kinetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*virology', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Activation/*genetics', 'Virus Latency/*genetics', 'Virus Replication']",,,2019/11/19 06:00,2020/03/05 06:00,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1008164 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-19-00760 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2019 Nov 18;15(11):e1008164. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008164. eCollection 2019 Nov.,PMC6886867,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

These radiation exposures are typically anticipated, and the exposure is typically well below 1 Gy. When radiation-induced (actually ROS-induced) DNA mutation is prevented, then so too are downstream radiation-induced cancers. Currently, there is no protection available against the effects of such <1 Gy radiation exposures. In this study, we address whether the new PrC-210 ROS-scavenger is effective in protecting p53-deficient (p53(-/-)) mice against X-ray-induced accelerated tumor mortality; this is the most sensitive radiation tumorigenesis model currently known. Six-day-old p53(-/-) pups received a single intraperitoneal PrC-210 dose [0.5 maximum tolerated dose (MTD)] or vehicle, and 25 min later, pups received 4.0 Gy X-ray irradiation. At 5 min postirradiation, blood was collected to quantify white blood cell c-H2AX foci. Over the next 250 days, tumor-associated deaths were recorded. Findings revealed that when administered 25 min before 4 Gy X-ray irradiation, PrC-210 reduced DNA damage (c-H2AX foci) by 40%, and in a notable coincidence, caused a 40% shift in tumor latency/incidence, and the 0.5 MTD PrC210 dose had no discernible toxicities in these p53(-/-) mice. Essentially, the moles of PrC-210 thiol within a single 0.5 MTD PrC-210 dose suppressed the moles of ROS generated by 40% of the 4 Gy X-ray dose administered to p53(-/-) pups, and in doing so, eliminated the lifetime leukemia/lymphoma risk normally residing ""downstream"" of that 40% of the 4 Gy dose. In conclusion: 1. PrC-210 is readily tolerated by the 6-day-old p53(-/-) mice, with no discernible lifetime toxicities; 2. PrC-210 does not cause the nausea, emesis or hypotension that preclude clinical use of earlier aminothiols; and 3. PrC-210 significantly increased survival after 4 Gy irradiation in the p53(-/-) mouse model.",,"['Fahl, William E', 'Jermusek, Frank', 'Guerin, Thomas', 'Albrecht, Dawn M', 'Fahl, Carol J Sarabia', 'Dreischmeier, Emma', 'Benedict, Chelsea', 'Back, Susan', 'Eickhoff, Jens', 'Halberg, Richard B']","['Fahl WE', 'Jermusek F', 'Guerin T', 'Albrecht DM', 'Fahl CJS', 'Dreischmeier E', 'Benedict C', 'Back S', 'Eickhoff J', 'Halberg RB']",,"['Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'Department of Medicine, Department of Oncology, UW Carbone Cancer Center.', 'Department of Medicine, Department of Oncology, UW Carbone Cancer Center.', 'Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin.', 'Department of Medicine, Department of Oncology, UW Carbone Cancer Center.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191118,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (3-(methylamino)-2-((methylamino)methyl)propane-1-thiol)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Diamines/blood/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/genetics/*mortality/pathology/prevention & control', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/blood/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency']",,,2019/11/19 06:00,2020/04/28 06:00,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1667/RR15439.1 [pii]', '10.1667/RR15439.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2020 Jan;193(1):88-94. doi: 10.1667/RR15439.1.

Since the advent of chemoimmunotherapy, great progress has been made in its treatment. However, some patients develop a more aggressive form of the disease and are included in the group of high-risk CLL patients with a dismal prognosis and a need for new therapies. OBJECTIVE: Maltotriose-modified poly(propylene imine) dendrimers were presented as potential agents in targeted therapy for CLL in the murine xenograft model. METHODS: Tumour, brain and internal organs resected from NOD scid gamma mice were subjected to gross and histopathological evaluation. RESULTS: The results of ex vivo tissue examination indicated that open-shell glycodendrimers prevented/inhibited the spread of CLL into the brain and internal organs and its transformation into a more aggressive form. CONCLUSION: The results of the study have a potentially important impact on the design of future personalized therapies as well as clinical trials.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Ziemba, Barbara', 'Sikorska, Hanna', 'Jander, Magdalena', 'Kuncman, Wojciech', 'Danilewicz, Marian', 'Appelhans, Dietmar', 'Bryszewska, Maria', 'Borowiec, Maciej', 'Franiak-Pietryga, Ida']","['Ziemba B', 'Sikorska H', 'Jander M', 'Kuncman W', 'Danilewicz M', 'Appelhans D', 'Bryszewska M', 'Borowiec M', 'Franiak-Pietryga I']",,"['GeneaMed LTD, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical and Laboratory Genetics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Bio-Assistance, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'GeneaMed LTD, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pathomorphology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pathomorphology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of General Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical and Laboratory Genetics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'GeneaMed LTD, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical and Laboratory Genetics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, CA, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dendrimers)', '0 (Polypropylenes)', '0 (Trisaccharides)', '0 (poly(propyleneimine))', '639K0T34IK (maltotriose)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendrimers/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Development', 'Heterografts/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Polypropylenes/*chemistry', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Trisaccharides/*chemistry', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Poly(propylene imine)', '*anticancer therapy', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*dendrimer', '*ex vivo', '*in vivo', '*tumour.']",2019/11/19 06:00,2021/02/04 06:00,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-101641 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520619666191019093558 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2020;20(3):325-334. doi: 10.2174/1871520619666191019093558.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: To investigate whether the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters correlate with the histological characteristics of infiltrated marrow in AL patients and compare the difference between acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). STUDY TYPE: Prospective. POPULATION MODEL: Forty newly diagnosed patients with AL, including 20 AML and 20 ALL. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5T/T1 WI and IVIM. ASSESSMENT: IVIM-derived parameters (true diffusion coefficient D, pseudodiffusion coefficient D*, and perfusion fraction, f) were measured in lumbar marrow. Histopathological analyses were performed from samples of marrow biopsy. STATISTICAL TESTS: The correlations between IVIM parameters and histological parameters used the Spearman correlation test. The difference of IVIM parameters and histological parameters between ALL and AML groups used the unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test, as appropriate. RESULTS: The f was positively correlated with microvessel density (MVD) in patients with ALL, AML, and AL (r = 0.740, P = 0.006; r = 0.771, P < 0.001; and r = 0.750, P < 0.001, respectively). There were no significant correlations between D and bone marrow cellularity in the three groups (r = -0.289, P = 0.362; r = 0.281, P = 0.292; and r = 0.058, P = 0.769, respectively). D and f values of ALL were higher than that of AML group (t = 3.332, P = 0.003 and t = 2.600, P = 0.014, respectively). MVD was higher in ALL than AML (t = 2.120, P = 0.044), whereas bone marrow cellularity had no significant difference between AML and ALL (t = -0.682, P = 0.501). DATA CONCLUSION: The f value derived from IVIM in bone marrow was positively correlated with MVD, while f might be able to show a difference of vascularity between ALL and AML. Therefore, the f value can be used as an alternative imaging marker of angiogenesis in marrow of AL patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical Efficacy Stage: 3 J. Magn. Reson.

Hepatic dysfunction was attributed to depletion of L-asparagine and glutamine, which impairs mitochondrial beta-oxidation and induces steatosis. We reiterate the role of L-carnitine and vitamin B complex for the treatment of asparaginase-induced hepatotoxicity.","['(c) 2019 The Author(s).

However, the known conclusions of currently known polymorphic loci (677 C > T and 1298 A > C) remain controversial. This study was to investigate new genetic biomarkers for ALL by analyzing the MTHFR polymorphisms at the 3'-untranslated region, which is a location bound by miRNAs. Methods: Polymorphisms of rs4846049 (miR-555 binding) were assessed by PCR amplification and direct sequencing in 110 ALL patients and 105 healthy controls. The relative expression of MTHFR was detected by qRT-PCR. Results: Overall, genotype distribution or allele carrier frequencies were not significantly different between patients with ALL and healthy controls (P > 0.05). Subgroup analysis results showed that T allele (OR = 0.134, 95% CI = 0.028-0.639; P=0.005) or genotypes with T allele (TT + GT) (OR = 0.133, 95% CI: 0.024-0.727; P=0.017) may be a protective factor for ALL susceptibility in patients with age >8 years. This conclusion was also true for the group only focusing on the precursor B-cell ALL patients. Furthermore, karyotype abnormality was more commonly observed in patients with the GG genotype (56.0%) compared to carriers of TT (0%) or GT (40.6%) genotypes, while c-myc break frequency was significantly higher in TT carriers (33%) than that of patients with GT (3.1%) or GG (0%) genotypes. PCR analysis showed patients carrying the GG genotype of rs4846049 exhibited the reduced mRNA expression of MTHFR. Conclusion: MTHFR rs4846049 polymorphism may be associated with increased risk of childhood with ALL and MTHFR mRNA expression.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Xiaolei Li et al.'],"['Li, Xiaolei', 'Zhang, Shunguo', 'Yu, Feng']","['Li X', 'Zhang S', 'Yu F']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0720-1086'],"['School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province 211198, China.', ""Shanghai Children's Medical Center Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200127, China."", ""Shanghai Children's Medical Center Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200127, China."", 'School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province 211198, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191013,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (MTHFR protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,,2019/11/19 06:00,2020/04/04 06:00,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/4631091 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Oct 13;2019:4631091. doi: 10.1155/2019/4631091. eCollection 2019.,PMC6815600,,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Acute CRT-related toxicities are well defined, however, less is known about late toxicities. The aim of the study was to examine the outcomes and late toxicities in Stage III NSCLC treated with CRT. Methods: A retrospective review of the data from patients with stage III NSCLC treated with CRT was performed between May 2000 and June 2010. Demographics, tumour and treatment characteristics, toxicities and survival data were examined from hospital records of the patients. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by standard Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The censor date was set on 31 October 2016. Results: Sixty-three patients were identified with a median age of 66.6 years [interquartile range (IQR) 57.2-72.1], two-third (n=41, 65.1%) were male, majority were current or ex-smokers (n=52, 82.5%), 42 (66.7%) patients had stage IIIB disease and 21 (33.3%) had stage IIIA disease. The most common histologic subtype was adenocarcinoma 30 (47.6%). The median PFS and OS of the whole population was 10.6 months (95% CI, 4.1-17.3 months) and 21 months (95% CI, 12.7-29.3 months) respectively. The 5-year OS rates for stage IIIA and IIIB were 24% and 16% respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates for all patients were 63.5%, 46% and 18.7% respectively. Acute grade 3 and 4 toxicities included 28 haematological and 17 non-haematological events. The incidence of late toxicities was 58.9%. Thirty-three events of late grade 3 and 4 toxicities were recorded. The most common late toxicity was symptomatic radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (39.3%), others include ototoxicity (7.1%), persistent dysphagia (7.1%) and one case of acute myeloid leukaemia. All patients that were alive at the censor date had developed radiation-induced fibrosis with associated symptoms of respiratory insufficiency. Conclusions: The 5-year OS of patients with stage III NSCLC treated with CRT was in keeping with survival figures reported from prospective clinical trials. There is, however, significant morbidity associated with long-term survival and this should be taken into account when making informed treatment decisions.",['2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Although great progress has been achieved for the treatment of CML patients in chronic stage, effective drugs with good safety are not available for those in advanced stages of CML patients. In present study, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), was used to screen for microRNA that can target Bcr-Abl. Methods: RT-qPCR was used to determine Bcr-Abl and miR-4433 transcription level in CML cells. In CML cells, Proteins including PARP, caspase-3, acetyl-histone 3, histone 3 and Bcr-Abl, as well as Bcr-Abl downstream proteins were detected using western blot. Cell viability and apoptosis were monitored respectively by MTS assay and flow cytometry. The correlation between miR-4433 and Bcr-Abl was determined by luciferase reporter assay. The anti-tumor effect of miR-4433 to K562 cells was evaluated by nude mouse xenograft model in vivo. Results: SAHA up-regulated the acetylation level of histone 3, and effectively inhibited Bcr-Abl mRNA level and its downstream signal transduction pathway, while inhibiting the growth of CML cells and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, bioinformatics tools predicted that miR-4433 is a putative microRNA targeting Bcr-Abl and that the expression level of miR-4433 was significantly increased after SAHA treatment in K562 cells. Luciferase activity analysis revealed that miR-4433 directly targets Bcr-Abl. Additionally, transient expression of miR-4433 abrogated Bcr-Abl activity and its downstream signaling pathways while inducing apoptosis in K562 cells. Moreover, stable expression of miR-4433 suppressed Bcr-Abl and its downstream signaling pathway, and inhibited the growth of K562 cells in vitro and the growth of K562-xenografts in nude mice. Conclusion: miR-4433 was identified as a microRNA targeting Bcr-Abl, which may be subject to epigenetic regulation of SAHA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The findings of this study provide a molecular basis from another angle for the use of SAHA in the treatment of CML.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Wu, Haiyan', 'Yin, Jingyi', 'Ai, Zhengdong', 'Li, Guiming', 'Li, Yan', 'Chen, Li']","['Wu H', 'Yin J', 'Ai Z', 'Li G', 'Li Y', 'Chen L']",,"['Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan 650500, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan 650500, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan 650500, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan 650500, China.', 'Department of Cadre Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, Yunnan, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Medical School, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan 650500, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190907,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'SAHA', 'apoptosis', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'growth', 'miR-4433']",2019/11/19 06:00,2019/11/19 06:01,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.34972 [doi]', 'jcav10p5671 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2019 Sep 7;10(23):5671-5680. doi: 10.7150/jca.34972. eCollection 2019.,PMC6843884,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Although the overall survival of children with ALL is now more than 90%, leukaemia remains one of the leading causes of death from disease. In developed countries, the overall survival of patients with ALL has increased to more than 80%; however, those children cured from ALL still show a significant risk of short- and long-term complications as a consequence of their treatment. Accordingly, there is a need not only to develop new methods of diagnosis and prognosis but also to provide patients with less toxic therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ribonucleic acids (RNA), usually without coding potential, that regulate gene expression by directing their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for degradation or translational suppression. In paediatric ALL, several miRNAs have been observed to be overexpressed or underexpressed in patient cohorts compared to healthy individuals, while numerous studies have identified specific miRNAs that can be used as biomarkers to diagnose ALL, classify it into subgroups, and predict prognosis. Likewise, a variety of miRNAs identify as candidate targets for treatment, although there are numerous obstacles to overcome before their clinical use in patients. Here, we summarise the roles played by different miRNAs in childhood leukaemia, focussing primarily on their use as diagnostic tools and potential therapeutic targets, as well as a role in predicting treatment outcome. Finally, we discuss the potential roles of miRNA in immunotherapy and the novel contributions made by gut miRNAs to regulation of the host microbiome.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Carle Grobbelaar and Anthony M.

To prove the hypothesis of cross-reactivity, we analyzed by applying next-generation sequencing the T cell receptor ss (TCR- ss) repertoire of CMV- and alloantigen-reactive T cells enriched from peripheral pre-transplant blood of 11 CMV-seropositive and HLA class I mismatched patients. Moreover, the TCR-repertoire was also analyzed in the allograft biopsies of those patients. There was a significant association between the presence of pre-transplant CMV immediate-early protein 1 (IE-1)-specific effector/memory T cells and acute renal allograft rejection and function (p = 0.01). Most importantly, we revealed shared TCR-ss sequences between CMV-IE1 and donor alloantigen-reactive T cells in all pre-transplant peripheral blood samples analyzed in CMV-seropositive patients who received HLA class I mismatched grafts. Identical TCR sequences were also found in particular in post-transplant allograft biopsies of patients with concomitant CMV infection and rejection. Our data show the presence of functional, cross-reactive T cells and their clonotypes in peripheral blood and in kidney allograft tissue. It is therefore likely that CMV-donor cross-reactivity as well as CMV specific T cell elicited inflammation is involved in the processes that affect allograft outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Stranavova, Pelak, Svaton, Hruba, Fronkova, Slavcev, Osickova,', 'Maluskova, Hubacek, Fronek, Reinke, Volk, Kalina and Viklicky.']","['Stranavova, Lucia', 'Pelak, Ondrej', 'Svaton, Michael', 'Hruba, Petra', 'Fronkova, Eva', 'Slavcev, Antonij', 'Osickova, Klara', 'Maluskova, Jana', 'Hubacek, Petr', 'Fronek, Jiri', 'Reinke, Petra', 'Volk, Hans-Dieter', 'Kalina, Tomas', 'Viklicky, Ondrej']","['Stranavova L', 'Pelak O', 'Svaton M', 'Hruba P', 'Fronkova E', 'Slavcev A', 'Osickova K', 'Maluskova J', 'Hubacek P', 'Fronek J', 'Reinke P', 'Volk HD', 'Kalina T', 'Viklicky O']",,"['Transplant Laboratory, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czechia.', 'Transplant Laboratory, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Immunogenetics, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Nephrology, Transplant Centre, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Transplant Pathology, Transplant Centre, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine and Motol University Hospital, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Transplant Surgery, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'BIH Centre for Regenerative Therapies, Berlin Centre for Advanced Therapies, Charite University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'BIH Centre for Regenerative Therapies, Berlin Centre for Advanced Therapies, Charite University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czechia.', 'Transplant Laboratory, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Nephrology, Transplant Centre, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191031,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', 'Biopsy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', '*Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Isoantigens/genetics/immunology', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology', '*T-Lymphocytes/microbiology/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ELISPOT', '*TCR repertoire', '*cross-reactivity', '*cytomegalovirus', '*heterologous immunity', '*kidney transplantation', '*rejection']",2019/11/19 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02549 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Oct 31;10:2549. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02549. eCollection 2019.,PMC6834532,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-three transplantations were performed in 60 patients. Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 27 patients were diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, and in eight other hematological malignancies were diagnosed. Twenty-three were in first complete remission (CR), 20 in second CR, 20 beyond second CR. Four patients developed graft failure. Median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 14 (range 9-25) and 10 days (range 7-30), respectively. The probability of non-relapse mortality (NRM) by day +100 after transplantation was 10 +/- 4%. With a median follow-up of 28 months, the probability of relapse was 32 +/- 6% and disease-free survival was 52 +/- 6%. Immune reconstitution was leaded by NK cells. As such, a high CD56(dim/)CD56(bright) NK cell ratio early after transplantation was associated with better disease-free survival (DFS) (>/=3.5; 77 +/- 8% vs. <3.5; 28 +/- 5%; p = 0.001) due to lower relapse incidence (>/=3.5; 15 +/- 7% vs. <3.5; 37 +/- 9%; p = 0.04). T-cell reconstitution was delayed and associated with severe infections after transplant. Viral reactivation/disease and presence of venooclusive disease of liver in the non-caucasian population had a significant impact on NRM. alphabeta(+) T-cell receptor/CD19(+) cell-depleted haploidentical transplant is associated with good outcomes especially in patients in early phase of disease. A rapid expansion of ""mature"" natural killer cells early after transplantation resulted on lower probability of relapse, suggesting a graft vs. leukemia effect independent from graft-vs.-host reactions.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Diaz, Zubicaray, Molina, Abad, Castillo, Sebastian, Galvez,', 'Ruiz, Vicario, Ramirez, Sevilla and Gonzalez-Vicent.']","['Diaz, Miguel A', 'Zubicaray, Josune', 'Molina, Blanca', 'Abad, Lorea', 'Castillo, Ana', 'Sebastian, Elena', 'Galvez, Eva', 'Ruiz, Julia', 'Vicario, Jose Luis', 'Ramirez, Manuel', 'Sevilla, Julian', 'Gonzalez-Vicent, Marta']","['Diaz MA', 'Zubicaray J', 'Molina B', 'Abad L', 'Castillo A', 'Sebastian E', 'Galvez E', 'Ruiz J', 'Vicario JL', 'Ramirez M', 'Sevilla J', 'Gonzalez-Vicent M']",,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Infantil Universitario ""Nino Jesus"", Madrid, Spain.', 'Blood Bank and Graft Manipulation Unit, Division of Hematology, Hospital Infantil Universitario ""Nino Jesus"", Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Infantil Universitario ""Nino Jesus"", Madrid, Spain.', 'Oncology/Hematology Laboratory, Hospital Infantil Universitario ""Nino Jesus"", Madrid, Spain.', 'Oncology/Hematology Laboratory, Hospital Infantil Universitario ""Nino Jesus"", Madrid, Spain.', 'Blood Bank and Graft Manipulation Unit, Division of Hematology, Hospital Infantil Universitario ""Nino Jesus"", Madrid, Spain.', 'Blood Bank and Graft Manipulation Unit, Division of Hematology, Hospital Infantil Universitario ""Nino Jesus"", Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Infantil Universitario ""Nino Jesus"", Madrid, Spain.', 'Histocompatibility Laboratory, Community Transfusion Center of Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Oncology/Hematology Laboratory, Hospital Infantil Universitario ""Nino Jesus"", Madrid, Spain.', 'Blood Bank and Graft Manipulation Unit, Division of Hematology, Hospital Infantil Universitario ""Nino Jesus"", Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Infantil Universitario ""Nino Jesus"", Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191030,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Immune Reconstitution', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/metabolism', 'Ligands', '*Lymphocyte Depletion/methods', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR/genetics', 'Recurrence', '*Transplantation, Haploidentical', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NK cells', '*T-cell depletion', '*acute leukemia', '*children', '*haploidentical transplantation', '*immune reconstitution']",2019/11/19 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02504 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Oct 30;10:2504. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02504. eCollection 2019.,PMC6831520,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with proven and probable S. clavata infection at the University Hospital, Hradec Kralove, Czechia between March 2005 and December 2017. Previous cases were identified from the literature and FungiScope((R)) database. Results: Six new cases (5 females, 1 male) of blood-stream S. clavata infections at the hemato-oncological department were described including epidemiological data of additional 48 patients colonized with the species. Overall, 116 strains of S. clavata were isolated from different clinical specimens of 54 patients; most of them belonged to the respiratory tract (60.3%). S. clavata was the most frequent species among arthroconidial yeasts (Trichosporon, Galactomyces, Magnusiomyces) recovered from the blood. All our patients with S. clavata infection had profound neutropenia, a central venous catheter, broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal prophylaxis; four had a history of a biliary tract system disease. The diagnosis was based on a positive blood culture in all patients. Four patients died of multiorgan failure and sepsis despite treatment with lipid-based amphotericin B and/or voriconazole. From the literature and FungiScope database, 67 previous cases of S. clavata infections were evaluated in context of our cases. Conclusion: Saprochaete clavata infection represents a life-threatening mycosis in severely immunocompromised patients. The successful outcome of treatment seems to be critically dependent on the early diagnosis and the recovery of underlying conditions associated with immune dysfunction or deficiency.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Buchta, Bolehovska, Hovorkova, Cornely, Seidel and Zak.']","['Buchta, Vladimir', 'Bolehovska, Radka', 'Hovorkova, Eva', 'Cornely, Oliver A', 'Seidel, Danila', 'Zak, Pavel']","['Buchta V', 'Bolehovska R', 'Hovorkova E', 'Cornely OA', 'Seidel D', 'Zak P']",,"['Department of Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Faculty Hospital in Hradec Kralove, Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czechia.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Diagnostics, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Faculty Hospital in Hradec Kralove, Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czechia.', 'The Fingerland Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Faculty Hospital in Hradec Kralove, Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czechia.', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, ECMM Diamond Center of Excellence in Medical Mycology, German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Clinical Trials Centre Cologne (ZKS Koln), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, ECMM Diamond Center of Excellence in Medical Mycology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine - Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Faculty Hospital in Hradec Kralove, Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czechia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191029,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FungiScopeTM', 'Geotrichum', 'Magnusiomyces', 'Saprochaete', 'diagnosis', 'fungemia', 'leukemia', 'therapy']",2019/11/19 06:00,2019/11/19 06:01,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2019.02196 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2019 Oct 29;10:2196. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2019.02196. eCollection 2019.,PMC6830389,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, Env facilitates viral genome delivery to CNS target cells through receptor binding and membrane fusion. Second, Env expression within one or more targets indirectly alters the physiology of certain neurons. Although the major Env expressing CNS cell types have been identified for many neurovirulent RVs, it remains unresolved, which targets play a causal role in neuropathogenesis. Moreover, this issue is complicated by the potential for post-infection virus suppression. To address these questions we explored herein, whether and how cryptic neurotropism differences between ecotropic and amphotropic murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) impacted neurovirulence. Neurotropism was first explored ex vivo using (1) acute primary glial cell cultures and (2) neural progenitor cell (NPC)- neural stem cell (NSC) neural sphere (NPH) chimeras. These experiments indicated that primary astrocytes and NPCs acutely restrict amphotropic but not ecotropic virus entry. CNS tropism was investigated using NSC transplant-based Cre-vector pseudotyping wherein mTmG transgenic fluorescent protein reporter mice revealed both productive and suppressed infection. Cre-pseudotyping with FrCasE, a prototypic neurovirulent ecotropic virus, identified glia and endothelia, but not neurons, as targets. Almost two-thirds (62%) of mGFP+ cells failed to show Env expression, suggesting widespread virus suppression. To circumvent RV superinfection interference confounds, targets were also identified using ecotropic packaging NSCs. These experiments identified known ecotropic targets: microglia, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and endothelia. Additionally, one third of mGFP+ cells were identified as protoplasmic astrocytes, cells that rarely express virus in vivo. A CNS targeting comparison between isogenic ecotropic (FrCasE) and amphotropic (FrAmE) viruses showed a fourfold higher astrocyte targeting by FrCasE. Since ecotropic Env pseudotyping of amphotropic virus in the CNS dramatically exacerbates neurodegeneration, these results strongly suggest that astrocyte infection is a major disease requirement. Moreover, since viral Env protein expression is largely subdetectable in astrocytes, minimal viral protein expression appears sufficient for affecting neuronal physiology. More broadly, these findings raise the specter that subdetectable astrocyte expression of exogenous or endogenous RVs could play a major role in human and animal neurodegenerative diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Cardona, Dunphy, Das, Lynch and Lynch.']","['Cardona, Sandra M', 'Dunphy, Jaclyn M', 'Das, Alvin S', 'Lynch, Connor R', 'Lynch, William P']","['Cardona SM', 'Dunphy JM', 'Das AS', 'Lynch CR', 'Lynch WP']",,"['Department of Integrative Medical Sciences, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, OH, United States.', 'Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Kent State University, Kent, OH, United States.', 'Department of Integrative Medical Sciences, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, OH, United States.', 'Program in Neuroscience, School of Biomedical Sciences, Kent State University, Kent, OH, United States.', 'Department of Integrative Medical Sciences, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, OH, United States.', 'Department of Integrative Medical Sciences, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, OH, United States.', 'Department of Integrative Medical Sciences, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, OH, United States.', 'Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Kent State University, Kent, OH, United States.', 'Program in Neuroscience, School of Biomedical Sciences, Kent State University, Kent, OH, United States.', 'Brain Health Research Institute, Kent State University, Kent, OH, United States.']",['eng'],['R15 NS108107/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20191029,Switzerland,Front Neurosci,Frontiers in neuroscience,101478481,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['astrocytes', 'glia', 'neural progenitor cells', 'neural stem cells', 'neurotropism', 'retrovirus', 'spongiform neurodegeneration', 'virus suppression']",2019/11/19 06:00,2019/11/19 06:01,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fnins.2019.01166 [doi]'],epublish,Front Neurosci. 2019 Oct 29;13:1166. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2019.01166. eCollection 2019.,PMC6828646,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combining scid and Il2rg(null) mutations results in severe immunodeficiency by impairing the maturation, survival, and functionality of interleukin 2-dependent immune cells, including T, B, and natural killer lymphocytes. While NSG mice are reportedly resistant to developing spontaneous lymphomas/leukemias, there are reports of hematopoietic cancers developing. In this study, we characterized the immunophenotype of spontaneous lymphoma/leukemia in 12 NSG mice (20 to 38 weeks old). The mice had a combination of grossly enlarged thymus, spleen, or lymph nodes and variable histologic involvement of the bone marrow and other tissues. All 12 lymphomas were diffusely CD3, TDT, and CD4 positive, and 11 of 12 were also positive for CD8, which together was consistent with precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (pre-T-LBL). A subset of NSG tissues from all mice and neoplastic lymphocytes from 8 of 12 cases had strong immunoreactivity for retroviral p30 core protein, suggesting an association with a viral infection.

METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we estimated the number of childhood cancer survivors on December 31, 2016 for each childhood cancer diagnosis, multiplied this by the proportion of carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) study, and projected the resulting number onto the U.S. POPULATION: RESULTS: Based on genome sequence data, 11.8% of 2450 SJLIFE participants carry a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in one of 156 cancer predisposition genes. Given this information, we estimate that 21 800 adult survivors of childhood cancer in the United States carry a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in one of these genes. The highest estimated absolute number of variant carriers are among survivors of central nervous system tumors (n = 4300), particularly astrocytoma (n = 1800) and other gliomas (n = 1700), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 4300), and retinoblastoma (n = 3500). The most frequently mutated genes are RB1 (n = 3000), NF1 (n = 2300), and BRCA2 (n = 800). CONCLUSION: Given the increasing number of childhood cancer survivors in the United States, clinicians should counsel survivors regarding their potential genetic risk, consider referral for genetic counseling and testing, and, as appropriate, implement syndrome-specific cancer surveillance or risk-reducing measures.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Wilson, Carmen L', 'Wang, Zhaoming',

METHODS: Seventeen patients with PID who developed malignancies or malignant-like diseases were evaluated for demographics, clinical features, treatment, toxicity, and prognosis. RESULTS: The median age of malignancy was 12.2 years (range, 2.2-26). Lymphoma was the most frequent malignancy (n = 7), followed by adenocarcinoma (n = 3), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 2), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1), Wilms tumor (n = 1), and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 1). Nonneoplastic lymphoproliferation mimicking lymphoma was observed in five patients. The total overall survival (OS) was 62.5% +/- 12.1%. The OS for lymphoma was 62.2% +/- 17.1% and found to be inferior to non-PID patients with lymphoma (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients with PIDs, malignancy may occur and negatively affect the OS. The diagnosis can be challenging in the presence of nonneoplastic lymphoproliferative disease or bone marrow abnormalities. Awareness of susceptibility to malignant transformation and early diagnosis with multidisciplinary approach can save the patients' lives.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kiykim, Ayca', 'Eker, Nursah', 'Surekli, Ozlem', 'Nain, Ercan', 'Kasap, Nurhan', 'Akturk, Hacer', 'Dogru, Omer', 'Canbolat, Aylin', 'Somer, Ayper', 'Koc, Ahmet', 'Tokuc, Gulnur', 'Bozkurt, Suheyla', 'Turkoz, Kemal', 'Karakoc-Aydiner, Elif', 'Ozen, Ahmet', 'Baris, Safa']","['Kiykim A', 'Eker N', 'Surekli O', 'Nain E', 'Kasap N', 'Akturk H', 'Dogru O', 'Canbolat A', 'Somer A', 'Koc A', 'Tokuc G', 'Bozkurt S', 'Turkoz K', 'Karakoc-Aydiner E', 'Ozen A', 'Baris S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5821-3963', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2560-9210', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5432-4076', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4150-5200', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9065-1901', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4730-9422']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Jeffrey Modell Diagnostic and Research Center for Primary Immunodeficiencies, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Jeffrey Modell Diagnostic and Research Center for Primary Immunodeficiencies, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Jeffrey Modell Diagnostic and Research Center for Primary Immunodeficiencies, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Goztepe Training and Research Hospital, Medeniyet University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Jeffrey Modell Diagnostic and Research Center for Primary Immunodeficiencies, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Jeffrey Modell Diagnostic and Research Center for Primary Immunodeficiencies, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, School of Medical, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Jeffrey Modell Diagnostic and Research Center for Primary Immunodeficiencies, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191117,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*classification/*diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases/*complications/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*lymphoid proliferation', '*lymphoma', '*malignancy', '*primary immune deficiency', '*prognosis']",2019/11/19 06:00,2020/04/23 06:00,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28091 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Feb;67(2):e28091. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28091.

The rarity of these events makes it difficult to discern the specific risk factors; however, age, sex, presence of central venous lines, inherited thrombophilia, and mediastinal mass may play a role. The primary aim of this study is to identify prognostic characteristics of children diagnosed with non-lymphoblastic lymphomas associated with a greater risk of developing a TE early on in their disease, with an increased focus on mediastinal mass characteristics. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients diagnosed with non-lymphoblastic lymphoma between 2004 and 2014 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. RESULTS: TE occurred in 8.5% (n = 28/330) of individuals at a median of 21 days from the diagnosis of a non-lymphoblastic lymphoma, with 60% of TEs occurring within 30 days of diagnosis. Of the variables evaluated, only presence of a peripherally inserted central catheter (odds ratio [OR]: 3.14 [95% CI: 1.24-7.98; P = 0.02]) and degree of superior vena cava (SVC) compression of > 25% increased the odds of developing a TE (OR: 2.2 [95% CI: 1.01-4.93; P = 0.048]). CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients with non-lymphoblastic lymphoma are at increased risk of developing TEs. In contrast to previous studies, the presence of a mediastinal mass alone was not associated with a higher risk of TE, but individuals with a mediastinal mass with 25% or greater degree of SVC compression were more likely to develop a TE. This finding highlights a high-risk group of children who may benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gartrell, Jessica', 'Kaste, Sue C', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Flerlage, Jamie', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Estepp, Jeremie', 'Metzger, Monika L']","['Gartrell J', 'Kaste SC', 'Sandlund JT', 'Flerlage J', 'Zhou Y', 'Cheng C', 'Estepp J', 'Metzger ML']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1722-2924', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4182-9355']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', 'University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Hematology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191117,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombosis/*etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*hematology', '*hemostasis and thrombosis', '*lymphoma', '*non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*pediatric hematology/oncology']",2019/11/19 06:00,2020/04/23 06:00,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28057 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Feb;67(2):e28057. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28057.

DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on the presence of sustained (>3 months) peripheral blood monocytosis (>/=1 x 10(9) /L; monocytes >/=10%), along with bone marrow dysplasia. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities occur in ~ 30% of patients, while >90% have gene mutations. Mutations involving TET2 (~60%), SRSF2 (~50%), ASXL1 (~40%) and the oncogenic RAS pathway (~30%) are frequent; while the presence of ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations and the absence of TET2 mutations negatively impact over-all survival. RISK STRATIFICATION: Molecularly integrated prognostic models include; the Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies (GFM), Mayo Molecular Model (MMM) and the CMML specific prognostic model (CPSS-Mol). Risk factors incorporated into the MMM include presence of nonsense or frameshift ASXL1 mutations, absolute monocyte count>10 x 10(9) /L, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, platelet count <100 x 10(9) /L and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells. The MMM stratifies CMML patients into four groups; high (>/=3 risk factors), intermediate-2 (2 risk factors), intermediate-1 (1 risk factor) and low (no risk factors), with median survivals of 16, 31, 59 and 97 months, respectively. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacitidine and decitabine are commonly used, with overall response rates of ~40%-50% and complete remission rates of ~7%-17%; with no impact on mutational allele burdens. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only potentially curative option, but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Patnaik MM', 'Tefferi A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6998-662X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4605-3821']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', '*Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Risk Assessment', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2019/11/19 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25684 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Jan;95(1):97-115. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25684.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is phenotypically heterogeneous with a highly unstable genome and provides few common therapeutic targets. We found that MCL1, Cofilin1 (CFL1) and SRC mRNA were highly expressed by a wide range of these cancers, suggesting that a strategy of dual MCL-1 and SRC inhibition might be efficacious for many patients. Immunohistochemistry revealed that MCL-1 protein was present at high levels in 94.7% of patients in a cohort of PDACs from Australian Pancreatic Genome Initiative (APGI). High MCL1 and Cofilin1 mRNA expression was also strongly predictive of poor outcome in the TCGA dataset and in the APGI cohort. In culture, MCL-1 antagonism reduced the level of the cytoskeletal remodeling protein Cofilin1 and phosphorylated SRC on the active Y416 residue, suggestive of reduced invasive capacity. The MCL-1 antagonist S63845 synergized with the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib to reduce cell viability and invasiveness through 3D-organotypic matrices. In preclinical murine models, this combination reduced primary tumor growth and liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer xenografts.

Here, we report that BCR-ABL is localized to stress granules and that its granular localization contributes to BCR-ABL-dependent leukemogenesis. BCR-ABL-positive granules were not colocalized with any markers for membrane-bound organelles but were colocalized with HSP90a, a component of RNA granules. The number of such granules increased with thapsigargin treatment, confirming that the granules were stress granules. Given that treatment with the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib and elimination of the N-terminal region of BCR-ABL abolished granule formation, kinase activity and the coiled-coil domain are required for granule formation. Whereas wild-type BCR-ABL rescued the growth defect in IL-3-depleted Ba/F3 cells, mutant BCR-ABL lacking the N-terminal region failed to do so. Moreover, forced tetramerization of the N-terminus-deleted mutant could not restore the growth defect, indicating that granule formation, but not tetramerization, through its N-terminus is critical for BCR-ABL-dependent oncogenicity. Our findings together provide new insights into the pathogenesis of CML by BCR-ABL and open a window for developing novel therapeutic strategies for this disease.Key words: BCR-ABL, subcellular localization, stress granule.",,"['Kashiwagi, Sayaka', 'Fujioka, Yoichiro', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Satoh, Aya O', 'Yoshida, Aiko', 'Fujioka, Mari', 'Sasajima, Hitoshi', 'Amano, Maho', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Ohba, Yusuke']","['Kashiwagi S', 'Fujioka Y', 'Kondo T', 'Satoh AO', 'Yoshida A', 'Fujioka M', 'Sasajima H', 'Amano M', 'Teshima T', 'Ohba Y']",,"['Department of Cell Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Cell Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Cell Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Cell Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Cell Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Cell Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Cell Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Cell Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191115,Japan,Cell Struct Funct,Cell structure and function,7608465,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*enzymology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Optical Imaging', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'stress granule', 'subcellular localization']",2019/11/19 06:00,2020/04/28 06:00,['2019/11/19 06:00'],"['2019/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1247/csf.19033 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Struct Funct. 2019 Dec 26;44(2):195-204. doi: 10.1247/csf.19033.

We investigated the role of surgical resection. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated six patients who underwent surgical resection of suspected pulmonary fungal disease prior to allogeneic HSCT between April 2007 and June 2016 at our medical center. RESULTS: We present six patients who underwent surgical resection of suspected pulmonary fungal disease prior to allogeneic HSCT. In our case series, three of four patients who were given a presurgical diagnosis of possible IFD were given a proven diagnosis after surgery, including two cases of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and one case of mucormycosis. All surgeries were performed by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for lobectomy without major complications. Recurrence of IFD was not observed after allogeneic HSCT in any of the six patients.

The nano-composite system (L-V) abrogated the original VP16 generated mitochondrial mediated mESCs toxicity totally, surprisingly maintained the pluripotency without leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and prevented the down-regulation of ectoderm marker expression during spontaneous embryoid bodies differentiation. Fetal growth retardation, the related placenta and skeletal structural abnormalities and long-term toxicity in the offspring were generated when pregnant mice exposed to VP16, while these detrimental effects were abolished when substituted with L-V. The different uterine drug accumulation of VP16 and L-V contributed to partly cause for the functional variation. And further transcriptome analysis confirmed developmental related BMP4-SMAD6 signaling pathway is of crucial importance.

The anticancer effects of realgar and EGCG were greatly improved following formulation as nanoparticles. EGCG has received increased attention as a drug carrier. The aim of this study was to prepare a new nanomedicine, (EGCG-RNPs), in which encapsulated nano-realgar. EGCG-RNPs were prepared by coprecipitation and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), particle size and zeta potential, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and in vitro release. Furthermore, we evaluated the antiproliferative effects of EGCG-RNPs on HL-60 cells in vitro, antitumor effect by intratumoral injection of EGCG-RNPs into solid tumors derived from APL HL-60 cells in vivo. Possible mechanisms were evaluated using uptake and efflux experiments in HL-60 cells. The results showed that the average particle size and zeta potentials of EGCG-RNPs was 200.3 +/- 1.23 nm and -46.8 +/- 1.31 mV. Controlled release of EGCG-RNPs was sustained and continued up to 72 h in vitro. Compared with nano-realgar and EGCG + RNPs (EGCG and nano-realgar physical mixing), EGCG-RNPs significantly inhibited growth of HL-60 cells. In a solid tumor model, EGCG-RNPs decreased tumor volumes, with an inhibitory rate of 60.18% at a dose of 70 mg . kg(-1). The mechanisms of antitumor improvement may correlate with the increased uptake of realgar and prolonged the retention time of realgar in HL-60 cells due to EGCG as a carrier.

This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the impact of a medication management service (MMS) on adherence to TKIs and clinical outcomes. METHODS: A parallel RCT was conducted in two hospitals in Malaysia, where 129 CML patients were randomised to MMS or control (usual care) groups using a stratified 1:1 block randomisation method. The 6-month MMS included three face-to-face medication use reviews, CML and TKI-related education, two follow-up telephone conversations, a printed information booklet and two adherence aids. Medication adherence (primary outcome), molecular responses and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores were assessed at baseline, 6th and 12th month. Medication adherence and HRQoL were assessed using medication possession ratio and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment in Cancer questionnaire (EORTC_QLQ30_CML24) respectively. RESULTS: The MMS group (n = 65) showed significantly higher adherence to TKIs than the control group (n = 64) at 6th month (81.5% vs 56.3%; p = 0.002), but not at 12th month (72.6% vs 60.3%; p = 0.147). In addition, a significantly higher proportion of participants in the MMS group achieved major molecular response at 6th month (58.5% vs 35.9%; p = 0.010), but not at 12th month (66.2% vs 51.6%; p = 0.092). Significant deep molecular response was also obtained at 12th month (24.6% vs 10.9%; p = 0.042). Six out of 20 subscales of EORTC-QLQ30-CML24 were significantly better in the MMS group. CONCLUSIONS: The MMS improved CML patients' adherence to TKI as well as achieved better clinical outcomes.

A significant fraction of these neoplasms harbor deletions on the locus 9p21, targeting the tumor suppressor CDKN2A but also deleting the aconitase 1 (ACO1) gene, a neighboring housekeeping gene involved in cytoplasm and mitochondrial metabolism. Here we show that reducing the aconitase activity with fluorocitrate decreases the viability of T-cell lymphoblastic neoplasia cells in correlation to the differential aconitase expression. The consequences of the treatment were evidenced in vitro using T-cell lymphoblastic neoplasia cell lines exhibiting 9p21 deletions and variable levels of ACO1 expression or activity. Similar results were observed in melanoma cell lines, suggesting a true potential for fluorocitrate in different cancer types. Notably, ectopic expression of ACO1 alleviated the susceptibility of cell lines to fluorocitrate and, conversely, knockdown experiments increased susceptibility of resistant cell lines. These findings were confirmed in vivo on athymic nude mice by using tumor xenografts derived from two T-cell lines with different levels of ACO1. Taken together, our results indicate that the non-targeted ACO1 deficiency induced by common deletions exerts a collateral cellular lethality that can be used as a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of several types of cancer.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Therefore, new therapeutic strategies combining conventional and novel therapies are urgently needed. Since telomerase is involved in oncogenesis and tumor progression but is silent in most human normal somatic cells, it may be an interesting target for CML therapy by selectively targeting cancer cells while minimizing effects on normal cells. Here, we report that hTERT expression is associated with CML disease progression. We also provide evidence that hTERT-deficient K-562 cells do not display telomere shortening and that telomere length is maintained through the ALT pathway. Furthermore, we show that hTERT depletion exerts a growth-inhibitory effect in K-562 cells and potentiates imatinib through alteration of cell cycle progression leading to a senescence-like phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that hTERT depletion potentiates the imatinib-induced reduction of the ALDH(+)-LSC population. Altogether, our results suggest that the combination of telomerase and TKI should be considered as an attractive strategy to treat CML patients to eradicate cancer cells and prevent relapse by targeting LSCs.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ALV can be transmitted horizontally and vertically, and the latter often give rise to more adverse pathogenicity. However, the propagation and evolution of ALV underlying vertical transmission remain not-well understood. Herein, an animal model for the evolution of variants of ALV subgroup J (ALV-J) in the vertical transmission was built and different organs from infected hens and plasma from their ALV-positive progenies were collected, and then three segments in the hypervariable regions of ALV (gp85-A, gp85-B, LTR-C) were amplified and sequenced using conventional Sanger sequencing and MiSeq high-throughput sequencing, respectively. The results showed that the genomic diversity of ALV-J occurred in different organs from ALV-J infected hen, and that the dominant variants in different organs of parental hens, especially in follicle, changed significantly compared with original inoculum strain. Notably, the dominant variants in progenies exhibited higher homologies with variants in parental hens' follicle (88.9%-98.9%) than other organs (85.6%-91.1%), and most consistent mutations in the variants were observed between the progenies and parental hen's follicle. Furthermore, HyPhy analysis indicated that the global selection pressure value (omega) in the follicle is significantly higher than those in other organs. In summary, an animal model for vertical transmission was built and our findings revealed the evolution of variants of ALV in the process of vertical transmission, moreover, the variants were most likely to be taken to the next generation via follicle, which may be related to the higher selection pressure follicle underwent.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Although dasatinib is the first-line treatment for CML, it has inhibitory activity against CYP3A4; this might increase the blood concentration of tacrolimus (administered to KT patients for immune suppression). Furthermore, tacrolimus can also increase blood concentrations of dasatinib through P-glycoprotein inhibition. METHODS: Here, we report a case of sustained molecular remission of CML with prolonged first-line dasatinib therapy in a KT recipient being treated with tacrolimus. A 61-year-old woman developed CML-chronic phase (CML-CP) 38 months post KT. Her maintenance immunosuppressive therapy consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone. Considering the potential drug interaction with tacrolimus, dasatinib was administered at a low dose of 50 mg/day. Her immune status was evaluated regularly by assessing the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) using an intracellular carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeling technique; immunosuppressive therapy was adjusted accordingly. RESULTS: The patient achieved complete hematologic remission (CHR) after 1 month of dasatinib treatment. Six months after dasatinib treatment, she achieved a major molecular response. During the observation period, neither antibody-mediated nor acute cellular rejection were encountered in the patient. She remained in CHR with a major molecular response 12 months after the diagnosis of CML-CP. CONCLUSION: Data obtained from immune monitoring assays using CFSE-MLR helped us to successfully manage a KT recipient with CML-CP being treated with dasatinib. Drug-drug interactions are a key consideration while designing treatment regimens; such strategies would ensure that drug-drug interactions do not negatively affect the treatment outcomes.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the application of the R-DRI for rare diseases has remained unclear. METHODS: We evaluated 135 patients who underwent allo HSCT for hematological malignancies including rare diseases, such as acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage, acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, extranodal natural killer T-cell lymphoma, and lymphoblastic lymphoma, at our institute. RESULTS: According to the R-DRI, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival at 2 years for patients with the low, intermediate, high, and very high groups were 66.7% and 66.7%, 60.8% and 56.0%, 27.1% and 23.7%, and 5.9% and 5.1%, respectively (P < .0001 and P < .0001, respectively). OS showed no significant difference between B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T-NHL) (P = .71). Moreover, OS at 1 year was 80%, 14.3%, 60%, and 0% for the intermediate risk group, the very high-risk group of B-NHL, the intermediate risk group, and the high-risk group of T-NHL, respectively (P = .035). CONCLUSION: We showed the applicability of the R-DRI for hematological malignancies, including rare disorders. However, we suggest that T-NHL patients may be better to be assigned between the nodal group and the extranodal group in the R-DRI.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Current round of study made use of potential morphological and immature fraction-related parameters (cell population data) generated during complete blood cell count (CBC), through artificial neural network (ANN) predictive modeling for early flagging of APML cases. We collected classical CBC items along with cell population data (CPD) from hematology analyzer at diagnosis of 1067 study subjects with hematological neoplasms. For morphological assessment, peripheral blood films were examined. Statistical and machine learning tools including principal component analysis (PCA) helped in the evaluation of predictive capacity of routine and CPD items. Then selected CBC item-driven ANN predictive modeling was developed to smartly use the hidden trend by increasing the auguring accuracy of these parameters in differentiation of APML cases. We found a characteristic triad based on lower (53.73) platelet count (PLT) with decreased/normal (4.72) immature fraction of platelet (IPF) with addition of significantly higher value (65.5) of DNA/RNA content-related neutrophil (NE-SFL) parameter in patients with APML against other hematological neoplasm's groups. On PCA, APML showed exceptionally significant variance for PLT, IPF, and NE-SFL. Through training of ANN predictive modeling, our selected CBC items successfully classify the APML group from non-APML groups at highly significant (0.894) AUC value with lower (2.3 percent) false prediction rate. Practical results of using our ANN model were found acceptable with value of 95.7% and 97.7% for training and testing data sets, respectively. We proposed that PLT, IPF, and NE-SFL could potentially be used for early flagging of APML cases in the hematology-oncology unit. CBC item-driven ANN modeling is a novel approach that substantially strengthen the predictive potential of CBC items, allowing the clinicians to be confident by the typical trend raised by these studied parameters.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

However, 5 years later, some issues relating to this disorder still remain including the fact that with ibrutinib only a relatively small proportion of patients achieve complete remission and that ibrutinib-resistant CLL clones can develop in about 20% of patients. In addition, therapy must still be given continuously, and toxicities leading to drug discontinuation occur in about 30% of patients. In the meantime second-generation BTK inhibitors have already aroused considerable interest and gathered momentum. A possible strategy to overcome some of these obstacles is to combine ibrutinib with other targeted agents especially in high-risk disease, such as previously treated refractory patients or those with TP53 aberrations or complex karyotypes, in whom rapid eradication of disease is most desirable. Therapy with single agent ibrutinib should be part of a sequential approach for patients with low risk disease, especially in older patients (aged >70 years) with a higher burden of comorbidities. Long-term results of ongoing studies combining Ibrutinib with (chemo)-immunotherapy or other targeted agents are eagerly awaited. Future clinical trials are indeed still needed to provide answers to these open questions.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Molica, Stefano', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Tam, Constantine', 'Polliack, Aaron']","['Molica S', 'Matutes E', 'Tam C', 'Polliack A']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2795-6507'],"['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Haematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona University, Barcelona, Spain.', ""St Vincent's Hospital, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew-University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191210,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'ibrutinib', 'ibrutinib combinations', 'long-term follow-up']",2019/11/17 06:00,2020/04/18 06:00,['2019/11/17 06:00'],"['2019/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2695 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Apr;38(2):129-136. doi: 10.1002/hon.2695.

This study explored genetic features associated with highly malignant behavior of lung adenocarcinoma with the MP component. METHODS: The MP and papillary (PaP) components were captured separately in three patients. Comprehensive mRNA expressions of somatic variants were compared between the MP and PaP components of each patient using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The protein expression of the NGS-detected variant was validated by immunohistochemistry. The prognostic impact of the detected variant was evaluated in 288 adenocarcinoma patients with resection of pN0M0. RESULTS: In two cases, NGS suggested higher RNA expression of EGFR L858R in the MP component than in the PaP component (allele frequency, 0.485 vs. 0.155 and 1.000 vs. 0.526, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Immunohistochemistry validated intense expression of L858R in the MP component of 27 MP-positive (MP+) patients. Among 288 pN0M0 patients, L858R was more frequently harbored in the MP+ patients than in the MP-negative (MP-) patients. The MP+ patients harboring L858R showed significantly worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) than the MP+ patients without L858R (median RFS 38.7 and 55.0 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 3.004; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.306-9.132; P = 0.012). Multivariate analysis of the MP+ patients showed that positive L858R status was associated with poorer RFS (HR 2.976; 95% CI 1.190-7.442; P = 0.020).

The eradication of JAK2V617F hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is critical for achieving molecular remissions and cure. We investigate the distinct effects of two therapies, ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), on the disease-initiating HSC population. Whereas ruxolitinib inhibits Stat5 activation in erythroid progenitor populations, it fails to inhibit this same pathway in HSCs. In contrast, IFN-alpha has direct effects on HSCs. Furthermore, STAT1 phosphorylation and pathway activation is greater after IFN-alpha stimulation in Jak2V617F murine HSCs with increased induction of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage and reduction in quiescence after chronic IFN-alpha treatment. Interestingly, ruxolitinib does not block IFN-alpha induced reactive oxygen species and DNA damage in Jak2V617F murine HSCs in vivo. This work provides a mechanistic rationale informing how pegylated IFN-alpha reduces JAK2V617F allelic burden in the clinical setting and may inform future clinical efforts to combine ruxolitinib with

In this study, we developed a humanized anti-CD19 scFv CAR-T (hCAR-T) to treat patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this one-arm, open-labeled study, we infused the T cells modified with hCAR to patients with r/r ALL. Patients were evaluated with long-term follow-up for response and safety of the treatment. The study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02349698). RESULTS: Ten patients with r/r ALL were recruited for this study. All were response evaluable and all achieved CR; eight patients remained CR, and six were in CR for over 18 months without further treatment. A long-term persistence of hCAR T cells was observed in most of the patients. Among these patients, four of them with high tumor burden and rapidly progressive disease (median, 58%) experienced grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. These severe CRSs were successfully controlled by tocilizumab, glucocorticoid, and plasma exchange.

Their mode of action against cancer cells and the mechanism of biosynthesis of the characteristic [4.4.3] propellane framework in neomacrophorin X have not been reported. The isolation and characterization of neomacrophorins IV (4), V (5), and VI (6) is reported. Epoxyquinones 1, 4, and 6 potently induced apoptotic cell death in human acute promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells, while epoxysemiquinols 2, 3, and 5 showed weak activity. This indicates that the epoxyquinone moiety is crucial for apoptosis-inducing activities of neomacrophorins. We also found that neomacrophorins inhibit proteasome in vitro, and 1, 4, and 6 induced significant accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in HL60 cells. These activities were completely suppressed by a nucleophile, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). The analysis of reaction mechanisms using LC-MS suggested that C2' and C7' of neomacrophorins could be Michael acceptors in the reaction with NAC methyl ester (NACM). These findings indicated that the electrophilic properties of neomacrophorins are responsible for both their potent biological effects and the biosynthesis of unique [4.4.3] propellane framework in neomacrophorin X.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We searched PubMed from inception to 14 February 2018 for meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cancer immunotherapies. Re-analyses were performed to estimate the summary effect size under random-effects, the 95% confidence interval (CI), heterogeneity, and the 95% prediction interval, and we determined the strength of the evidence. We examined publication bias and excess significance bias. 63 articles corresponding to 247 meta-analyses were eligible. Nine meta-analyses were classified to have convincing evidence, and 75 were classified as suggestive evidence. The clinical benefit of immunotherapy was supported by convincing evidence in the following settings: anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy for treating advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the combination of rituximab and chemotherapy for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, adoptive cell immunotherapy for NSCLC, and the combination of interferon alpha and chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma. A further meta-analysis of 16 RCTs showed that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb therapy had a benefit in patients with solid tumors (overall survival; hazard ratio = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.68-0.79; p < 0.001), supported by convincing evidence.

We prospectively explored a novel strategy, including mandatory fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, weekly surveillance cultures (SC) and targeted antimicrobial therapy for febrile neutropenia, aimed to reduce infectious mortality due to MR-GNBI. Over 146 cycles of chemotherapy, cumulative incidence of colonization was 50%. Half of the colonizations occurred in the consolidation phase of treatment. Application of this strategy led to a significant reduction in the incidence of GNB and carbapenemase-producing Klebisella pneumoniae (cpKp) species, resulting in a reduction of infectious mortality (HR 0.35 [95%, CI 0.13-0.96], p = 0.042). In multivariate analysis, fluroquinolone prophylaxis in addition to SC was associated with improved survival (OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.38-0.79], p = 0.001). Targeted therapy for colonized patients did not overcome the risk of death once cpKp or XDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were developed. Mortality rate after transplant was similar between colonized and not colonized patients. However only 9% of transplanted patients were colonized by cpkp.

New curative strategies rely on an understanding of the pathobiology that derives from systematically dissecting each cancer's genetic and molecular landscape.

Thus, targeting the Trx system has emerged as a promising approach to treating AML. Both arsenicals and azelaic acid (AZA) are thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibitors and possess antileukemic effects. In this study, to exploit agents with higher potency and lower toxicity, we got some organic arsenicals and further synthesized a series of targeted compounds by binding AZA to organic arsenicals, and then screened the most effective one, N-(4-(1, 3, 2-dithiarsinan-2-yl) phenyl)-azelamide (A-Z2). A-Z2 showed a stronger inhibitory effect against TrxR activity and in AML cell lines than did AZA or arsenicals. Additionally, A-Z2 was less toxic to healthy cells compared with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. A-Z2 induces apoptosis by collapsing of mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing ATP level, releasing of cytochrome c and TNF-alpha, activating of caspase 9, 8 and 3. Analysis of the mechanism revealed that A-Z2 activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by directly selectively targeting TrxR/Trx and indirectly inhibiting NF-kappaB. A-Z2's better efficacy and safety profile against arsenicals and azelaic acid were also evident in vivo. A-Z2 had better plasma stability and biological activity in rats. A-Z2-treated mice displayed significant symptom relief and prolonged survival in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) AML model.

METHODS: In a large, multicenter cohort including 6042 patients with TC treated between 1976 and 2006, cause-specific mortality was compared with general population mortality rates. Associations with treatment were assessed with proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 17.6 years, 800 patients died; 40.3% of these patients died because of TC. The cumulative mortality was 9.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.5%-10.7%) 25 years after TC treatment. In comparison with general population mortality rates, patients with nonseminoma experienced 2.0 to 11.6 times elevated mortality from lung, stomach, pancreatic, rectal, and kidney cancers, soft-tissue sarcomas, and leukemia; 1.9-fold increased mortality (95% CI, 1.3-2.8) from IHD; and 3.9-fold increased mortality (95% CI, 1.5-8.4) from pneumonia. Seminoma patients experienced 2.5 to 4.6 times increased mortality from stomach, pancreatic, bladder cancer and leukemia. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy were associated with 2.1 (95% CI, 1.8-2.5) and 2.5 times higher SMN mortality (95% CI, 2.0-3.1), respectively, in comparison with the general population. In a multivariable analysis, patients treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy had a 2.5-fold increased hazard ratio (HR; 95% CI, 1.8-3.5) for SMN mortality in comparison with patients without platinum-containing chemotherapy. The HR for SMN mortality increased 0.29 (95% CI, 0.19-0.39) per 100 mg/m(2) platinum dose administered (Ptrend < .001). IHD mortality was increased 2.1-fold (95% CI, 1.5-4.2) after platinum-containing chemotherapy in comparison with patients without platinum exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Platinum-containing chemotherapy is associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk of SMN mortality.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Consequently, studies related to the mechanisms underlying drug resistance, the molecular pathways involved in this phenomenon, and alternate therapies have attracted the attention of researchers. Among a variety of therapeutic modalities, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are of special interest due to their potential clinical use. Therapies involving MSCs are showing increasing promise in cancer treatment and anticancer drug screening applications; however, results have been inconclusive, possibly due to the heterogeneity of MSC populations. Most recently, the effect of MSCs on different types of cancer, such as hematologic malignancies, their mechanisms, sources of MSCs, and its advantages and disadvantages have been discussed. There are many proposed mechanisms describing the effects of MSCs in hematologic malignancies; however, the most commonly-accepted mechanism is that MSCs induce tumor cell cycle arrest.

Methods: In this study, we retrospectively investigated 88 patients newly diagnosed with AML who received intensive induction chemotherapy at Kyungpook National University Hospital from March 2015 to July 2017. The selection criteria included the presence of results on genetic abnormalities including NPM1 and FLT3-ITD. Results: According to the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk classification, 25 patients (28%) were categorized as favorable, 44 (50%) as intermediate, and 19 (22%) as adverse risk. Among the intermediate-risk patients, 40 were identified as NPM1 (wt)/FLT3-ITD(neg/low). Among the patients with NPM1 (wt)/FLT3-ITD(neg/low), complete remission (CR) was achieved in 26 patients out of 40 (65%). One-year overall survival (OS) rate was 100% in the favorable-risk group and 87.9% in the NPM1 (wt)/FLT3-ITD(neg/low) group (P=0.233). Among the intermediate-risk NPM1 (wt)/FLT3-ITD(neg/low) patients, there was no survival benefit with allo-HCT (N=19) compared to consolidation chemotherapy (N=21; P=0.372). In the multivariate analysis, the ELN risk group [hazard ratio (HR), 6.36; P=0.019] and the achievement of CR (HR, 2.95; P=0.017) were both identified as factors affecting OS of patients with newly diagnosed AML. Conclusion: Among the AML patients, intermediate-risk NPM1 (wt)/FLT3-ITD(neg/low) patients and favorable-risk patients showed similar OS rates. Our results suggested that allo-HCT might have limited clinical benefit for the intermediate-risk NPM1 (wt)/FLT3-ITD(neg/low) patients.

Within the last 3 years alone, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved 8 new targeted agents for the treatment of AML. With their introduction comes a new sense of optimism, along with questions about how to best use these agents.

In this paper, we propose a novel planar microchip integrated with microelectrochemical cell array toward to a feasible solution for ion channel screening with high resolution and long life-time. In order to reduce the interference from the leakage currents, a synthetic lipid bilayer is applied to form a high sealing resistance. The whole-cell electrical access can be constructed via electroporating the lipid bilayer in close proximity to the cell membrane. Parameters of electroporation including amplitude and time scale are firstly optimized by using parallel electroporation to the lipid bilayers. In this approach, individual cells can be trapped to the target positions by applying dielectrophoresis (DEP) manipulation. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is employed with low concentration to facilitate the closed contact between the cells and the lipid bilayer to increase the efficiency of the whole-cell mode construction. Through this chip based method, stable current recordings through inward rectifier potassium (Kir) ion channels embedded in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cell membrane are achieved with high electrical sealing resistance (over 1 GOmega).

To address whether HT itself can affect endometrial receptivity accompanied by implantation alterations, a euthyroid HT model was established in mice. METHODS: Female NOD mice were immunized twice with thyroglobulin and adjuvant to induce the experimental HT model. Four weeks after the second treatment, the mice were normally mated, and pregnant ones were sacrificed in implantation window for thyroid-related parameter and steroid hormones measurements by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and implantation site number calculation by uptake of Chicago Blue dye. In addition, certain morphological features of endometrial receptivity were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and scanning electron microscopy, and the expression of other receptivity markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR or Western Blot. RESULTS: HT mice displayed intrathyroidal monocyte infiltration and elevated serum thyroid autoantibody levels without thyroid dysfunction, defined as euthyroid HT in humans. Euthyroid HT resulted in implantation failure, fewer pinopodes, retarded pinopode maturation, and inhibited expression of receptivity markers: estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), integrin beta3, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Interestingly, despite this compromised endometrial receptivity response, no statistical differences in serum estradiol or progesterone level between groups were found. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are the first to indicate that HT induces a nonreceptive endometrial milieu in the euthyroid state, which may underlie the detrimental effects of HT itself on embryo implantation.",,"['Wu, Zhangbi', 'Cai, Yaojun', 'Xia, Qin', 'Liu, Tiantian', 'Yang, Hao', 'Wang, Fen', 'Wang, Nan', 'Yu, Zhen', 'Yin, Chunying', 'Wang, Qunan', 'Zhu, Defa']","['Wu Z', 'Cai Y', 'Xia Q', 'Liu T', 'Yang H', 'Wang F', 'Wang N', 'Yu Z', 'Yin C', 'Wang Q', 'Zhu D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6600-0423'],"['Department of Geriatric Endocrinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330006, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Endocrinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Endocrinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Endocrinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Endocrinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China.', 'Department of Geriatric Endocrinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health and Genetics, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China.', 'Center for Integrative Imaging, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China. wqn@ahmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Geriatric Endocrinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China. zdfa0168@sina.com.']",['eng'],"['8187121167/the National Natural Science Foundation of China', '1908085QH339/Natural Science Foundation of Anhui province']",['Journal Article'],20191115,England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/metabolism/*physiopathology/ultrastructure', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hashimoto Disease/blood/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3/genetics/metabolism', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Pregnancy', 'Testosterone/blood', 'Thyrotropin/blood']",['NOTNLM'],"['Embryo implantation', 'Endometrial receptivity', ""Hashimoto's thyroiditis"", 'Pinopodes', 'Receptivity markers']",2019/11/16 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12958-019-0526-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12958-019-0526-3 [pii]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2019 Nov 15;17(1):94. doi: 10.1186/s12958-019-0526-3.,PMC6857235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the results of health-related quality of life (HRQL) analyses from this study. METHODS: From June 15, 2012 to August 21, 2014, 416 patients with R/R CLL were enrolled; 207 patients were randomized to the idelalisib arm and 209 to the placebo arm. In the 416 patients randomized to receive bendamustine/rituximab and either oral idelalisib 150 mg twice-daily or placebo, HRQL was assessed at baseline and throughout the blinded part of the study using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu) and EuroQoL Five-Dimension (EQ-5D) visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaires. The assessments were performed at scheduled patient visits; every 4 weeks for the first 6 months from the initiation of treatment, then every 8 weeks for the next 6 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter until end of study. Least-squares mean changes from baseline were estimated using a mixed-effects model by including treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction, and stratification factors as fixed effects. Time to first symptom improvement was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: In mixed-effects model analysis, idelalisib + bendamustine/rituximab treatment led to clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in leukemia-associated symptoms. Moreover, per Kaplan-Meier analysis, the proportion of patients with symptom improvement was higher and time to improvement was shorter among patients in the idelalisib-containing arm compared with those who did not receive idelalisib. The physical and social/family FACT-Leu subscale scores, along with the self-rated health assessed by EQ-VAS, showed improvement with idelalisib over placebo, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The functional and emotional FACT-Leu subscale scores remained similar to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of idelalisib to bendamustine/rituximab, apart from improving PFS and OS, had a neutral to beneficial impact on HRQL in patients with R/R CLL, particularly by reducing leukemia-specific disease symptoms.

Peripheral eosinophilia is defined by a blood eosinophil count > 500 cells/muL. It is classified into mild (500-1500 cells/mul), moderate (1500-5000 cells/mul) and severe for an eosinophil count > 5000 cells /mul. The term ""hypereosinophilia"" defines a condition characterized by a blood eosinophil count >1500 cells/mul in at least two consecutive tests made with a minimum of a 4-week interval. The causes of eosinophilia are various, and can be summarized by the acronym ""APLV"" which refers to Allergic disorders, Parasitic infections, Leukemia/ Lymphomas (and solid tumors) and Vasculitis-Immunodeficiency diseases, with allergic disorders and parasitic infections representing the most commonly identified causes. Allergic disorders are usually associated with mild eosinophilia, whereas values >20.000 cell/mul are highly suggestive for myeloproliferative disorders. Eosinophils may also be directly responsible for organ damage, mainly at cardiac, pulmonary and cutaneous level, deriving from the release of the granule products, of lipidic mediators and cytokines. Therefore, in the physician's approach to a patient with persistent hypereosinophilia, it is also important to investigate the presence of organ involvement. In this review, we propose a diagnostic algorithm for children presenting with either blood eosinophilia or hypereosinophilia. This algorithm focuses on the patient's history and clinical manifestations as the first step and the level and persistence of blood eosinophilia as the second, and this can help the physician to identify patients presenting with an elevated blood eosinophil count that need further laboratory or instrumental investigations.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Costagliola, Giorgio', 'Marco, Serena Di', 'Comberiati, Pasquale', ""D'Elios, Sofia"", 'Petashvili, Nino', 'Di Cicco, Maria Elisa', 'Peroni, Diego']","['Costagliola G', 'Marco SD', 'Comberiati P', ""D'Elios S"", 'Petashvili N', 'Di Cicco ME', 'Peroni D']",,"['Section of Paediatrics, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Paediatrics, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Paediatrics, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Paediatrics, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Tbilisi State Medical University, Tbilisi, Georgia.', 'Section of Paediatrics, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Paediatrics, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pediatr Rev,Current pediatric reviews,101240290,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Child', 'Clinical Decision-Making/methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Eosinophilia/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/complications/diagnosis', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/diagnosis', 'Severity of Illness Index']",['NOTNLM'],"['Allergy', 'DRESS', 'asthma', 'atopic dermatitis', 'eosinophil', 'eosinophilia', 'hypereosinophylic syndromes', 'parasites.']",2019/11/16 06:00,2021/03/26 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPR-EPUB-102379 [pii]', '10.2174/1573396315666191114150438 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pediatr Rev. 2020;16(2):81-88. doi: 10.2174/1573396315666191114150438.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, drug resistance can occur by defective DNA repair activity coupled with the ability of DNA polymerases to misreplicate unrepaired DNA lesions. This study demonstrates that the efficacy of doxorubicin can be improved by using an artificial nucleoside to efficiently and selectively inhibit this activity. METHODS: In vitro studies using acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines define the mechanism of cell death caused by combining an artificial nucleoside with doxorubicin. RESULTS: Flow cytometry experiments demonstrate that combining an artificial nucleoside with doxorubicin potentiates the cell killing effects of the drug by increasing apoptosis. The potentiation effect correlates with expression of TdT, a specialized DNA polymerase overexpressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cell cycle experiments demonstrate that this combination blocks cells at S-phase prior to inducing apoptosis. Finally, the unique chemical composition of the nucleoside analog was used to visualize the replication of damaged DNA in TdT-positive cells. This represents a potential diagnostic tool to easily identify doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Studies demonstrate that a novel artificial nucleoside improves the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin, thereby reducing the risk of potential side effects caused by the DNA-damaging agent.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Since their emergence spatially and temporally overlap and phenotypic markers are often shared, the specifics regarding their origin, development, lineage restriction and mutual relationships have not been fully determined. The identification of wave-specific markers would aid to resolve these uncertainties. Here, we show that toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed during early mouse embryogenesis. We provide phenotypic and functional evidence that the expression of TLR2 on E7.5 c-kit(+) cells marks the emergence of precursors of erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) and provides resolution for separate tracking of EMPs from primitive progenitors. Using in vivo fate mapping, we show that at E8.5 the Tlr2 locus is already active in emerging EMPs and in progenitors of adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Together, this data demonstrates that the activation of the Tlr2 locus tracks the earliest events in the process of EMP and HSC specification.",,"['Balounova, Jana', 'Splichalova, Iva', 'Dobesova, Martina', 'Kolar, Michal', 'Fiser, Karel', 'Prochazka, Jan', 'Sedlacek, Radislav', 'Jurisicova, Andrea', 'Sung, Hoon-Ki', 'Korinek, Vladimir', 'Alberich-Jorda, Meritxell', 'Godin, Isabelle', 'Filipp, Dominik']","['Balounova J', 'Splichalova I', 'Dobesova M', 'Kolar M', 'Fiser K', 'Prochazka J', 'Sedlacek R', 'Jurisicova A', 'Sung HK', 'Korinek V', 'Alberich-Jorda M', 'Godin I', 'Filipp D']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7265-3268', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8577-8388', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2506-9330']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Czech Centre for Phenogenomics & Laboratory of Transgenic Models of Diseases, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Genomics and Bioinformatics, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Czech Centre for Phenogenomics & Laboratory of Transgenic Models of Diseases, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Czech Centre for Phenogenomics & Laboratory of Transgenic Models of Diseases, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Cell and Developmental Biology, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Hematooncology, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute Gustave Roussy PR1, INSERM U1170, Villejuif, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic. dominik.filipp@img.cas.cz.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191115,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice/*embryology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2019/11/16 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-13150-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-13150-0 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2019 Nov 15;10(1):5176. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13150-0.,PMC6858454,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We analyzed the age, gender, PRES symptoms and signs, cranial MRI findings, therapeutic effect, and prognosis of children with ALL who developed PRES during chemotherapy from January 2010 to December 2013 at the Hematology Oncology Center of Beijing Children's Hospital. Changes in cranial MRI findings were analyzed, and intelligence (IQ) and cognitive function were evaluated using the Wechsler Scale and the Wisconsin Card Score Test after the children completed chemotherapy. RESULTS: There were 850 children with newly diagnosed ALL in this period; 13 (1.5%), 6 boys and 7 girls, developed PRES. All were diagnosed as B-cell ALL. The median age at PRES onset was 7 years (2-11 years). The median day of PRES onset was day 28 (day 17-34) of remission induction chemotherapy. Of the 13 children with PRES onset and seizures, 4 had visual disturbances and 2 had consciousness disturbances. Cranial MRI showed hyperintensity in the subcortical white matter on T2-weighted axial and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. The lesion locations were as follows: occipital lobe, 12 (92.3%) patients; frontal lobe, 7 (53.8%) patients; temporal lobe, 5 (38.4%) patients; parietal lobe, 3 (23.1%) patients; and cerebellum, 1 (7.7%) patient. There were 8 (61.5%) patients with vasogenic edema and 5 (38.5%) with cytotoxic edema. After treatment, all children recovered within one month,when their PRES symtoms were relieved, they continued to receive chemotherapy. However, 1 child (1.07%) died of severecentral nervous system infection one year after PRES treatment, and 3 (25%) had recurrent seizures and were diagnosed with epilepsy after three months of PRES treatment. Their cranial MRIs showed cytotoxic edema, which was acute stage on day 15, with aggravated lesions on cranial MRI. The cranial MRI lesions returned to normal at one month in 3 (23.1%) patients, at three months in 6 (46.1%) patients, at one year in 8 (61.5%) patients, and at two years in 12 (92.3%) patients. The 12 surviving children all returned to school, and their full-scale, verbal, and performance IQs were normal, with no significant differences in intelligence or cognitive function compared with children with ALL without PRES during the same period. CONCLUSIONS: PRES can occur during remission induction chemotherapy treatment of children with ALL, but the incidence is low. Cranial MRI can be used for diagnosis and to characterize lesions. The children recover about a month after treatment, and cranial MRI lesions return to normal within two years. The time for complete resolution of MRI lesions differs, and children with cytotoxic edema have worse prognosis with sequelae, such as epilepsy, which requires close monitoring. PRES does not affect intelligence or cognitive development.",,"['Lin, Wei', 'Xie, Jing', 'Zhang, Jishui', 'Cheng, Hua', 'Cui, Haijing', 'Zhang, Yuanyuan', 'Wu, Ying', 'Yu, Jiaole', 'Qi, Peijing', 'Fan, Jia', 'Gao, Huifang', 'Wang, Fang', 'Zhang, Ruidong', 'Zheng, Huyong']","['Lin W', 'Xie J', 'Zhang J', 'Cheng H', 'Cui H', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu Y', 'Yu J', 'Qi P', 'Fan J', 'Gao H', 'Wang F', 'Zhang R', 'Zheng H']",,"[""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Psychiatry, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Imaging Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Intelligence Laboratory, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Psychiatry, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China - zhenghuyong@yeah.net.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191111,Italy,Minerva Pediatr,Minerva pediatrica,0400740,,IM,,,,2019/11/16 06:00,2019/11/16 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0026-4946.19.05675-5 [pii]', '10.23736/S0026-4946.19.05675-5 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Minerva Pediatr. 2019 Nov 11. pii: S0026-4946.19.05675-5. doi: 10.23736/S0026-4946.19.05675-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heterozygous CS females are clinically asymptomatic. LAMP2 mutations cause Danon disease (DD). Cardiomyopathy is a dominant feature of DD present in both males and heterozygous females. No monogenic phenotypes have been associated with mutations in ATP1B4, TMEM255A, and ZBTB33 genes. To facilitate diagnostics and counseling in CS and DD families, we present a female DD patient with a de novo Alu-mediated Xq24 rearrangement causing a deletion encompassing CUL4B, LAMP2, and also the other three neighboring genes. Typical to females heterozygous for CUL4B mutations, the patient was CS asymptomatic, however, presented with extremely skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ratios in peripheral white blood cells. As a result of the likely selection against CUL4B deficient clones, only minimal populations (~3%) of LAMP2 deficient leukocytes were identified by flow cytometry. On the contrary, myocardial LAMP2 protein expression suggested random XCI.

The present study evaluated the clinical significance of relapsed childhood ALL in Taiwan. Diagnostic and/or relapsed bone marrow or peripheral blood was obtained from 111 children with relapsed ALL who were initially treated by using Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group (TPOG) ALL protocols from January 1997 to May 2018. Mutations were detected by PCR and sequencing, as well as by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to detect copy number alterations. Copy number and/or sequence alterations of TP53 were detected in 29% (28 of 98) and in 46% (6 of 13) of patients with relapsed B-cell and T-cell ALL, respectively. This incidence was much higher than that in several similar studies conducted in Caucasian populations. Seventy percent of all TP53 alterations were gained at relapse in 67 matched samples by back-tracking matched diagnostic samples. TP53 alterations were associated with lower 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates (P = .013 and P = .0002, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic significance of TP53 alterations. Forty-five patients received hematopoietic stem-cell transplantations post-relapse. Patients with TP53 alterations (14/45) had inferior 5-year EFS and OS than patients without TP53 alterations after transplantation (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively). The significance of these TP53 alterations for patients who received transplantations was confirmed by multivariate analysis. In conclusion, TP53 alterations were enriched and useful as prognostic markers in relapsed childhood ALL.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Unusual variations in appearance of white blood cells indicate leukemia. In this paper, an automated method for detection of leukemia using image processing approach is proposed. In the present study, 1159 images of different brightness levels and color shades were acquired from Leishman stained peripheral blood smears. SVM classifier was used for classification of white blood cells into normal and abnormal, and also for detection of leukemic WBCs from the abnormal class. Classification of the normal white blood cells into five sub-types was performed using NN classifier. Overall classification accuracy of 98.8% was obtained using the combination of NN and SVM.",,"['Hegde, Roopa B', 'Prasad, Keerthana', 'Hebbar, Harishchandra', 'Singh, Brij Mohan Kumar', 'Sandhya, I']","['Hegde RB', 'Prasad K', 'Hebbar H', 'Singh BMK', 'Sandhya I']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4138-6814'],"['Manipal School of Information Sciences, MAHE, Manipal, 576104, India. roopabhegde@gmail.com.', 'Department of ECE, NMAM Institute of Technology (Visvesvaraya Technological Univerity, Belagavi), Nitte, Karnataka, 574110, India. roopabhegde@gmail.com.', 'Manipal School of Information Sciences, MAHE, Manipal, 576104, India.', 'Manipal School of Information Sciences, MAHE, Manipal, 576104, India.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion KMC, MAHE, Manipal, Karnataka, 576104, India.', 'Department of Pathology, A J Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Center, Kuntikana, Mangalore, 575004, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Digit Imaging,Journal of digital imaging,9100529,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', '*Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Leukocytes']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Classification', '*Computer aided detection', '*Leukemia', '*Peripheral blood smear analysis']",2019/11/16 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10278-019-00288-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10278-019-00288-y [pii]']",ppublish,J Digit Imaging. 2020 Apr;33(2):361-374. doi: 10.1007/s10278-019-00288-y.,PMC7165227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the help of this review, we aim to summarize key concepts with regards to CMML biology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapeutics. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on recent studies, CMML is hallmarked by a relatively low genetic complexity, which contrasts with a compelling phenotypical heterogeneity, largely driven by epigenetic mechanisms. Recent advances in the characterization of CMML biology has led to an improvement in risk-stratification, by means of incorporating prognostically relevant gene mutations. This, however, has not significantly impacted available therapies and outcomes continue to remain poor. Advances in CMML biology have better explained the phenotypic heterogeneity, while continuing to define the genetic and epigenetic landscape. In spite of recent advances, limited effective therapies exist and developing rationally derived therapeutic approaches is much needed.",,"['Coltro, Giacomo', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M']","['Coltro G', 'Patnaik MM']",,"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. patnaik.mrinal@mayo.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191114,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', '*Clonal architecture', '*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*Myeloproliferative neoplasms', '*Prognostication', '*Target therapy']",2019/11/16 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-019-0855-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-019-0855-6 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2019 Nov 14;21(11):101. doi: 10.1007/s11912-019-0855-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been found recently that many planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) derivatives, previously known as carcinogenic, display anticancer activity through DNA cross-linking. However, the practical use of these PAHs is substantially limited by their low therapeutic efficiency and selectivity toward most tumors. Herein, the anticancer property of a nonplanar PAH named [4]helicenium, which exhibits highly selective cytotoxicity toward liver, lung cancer, and leukemia cells compared with normal cells, is reported. Moreover, [4]helicenium effectively inhibits tumor growth in liver cancer-bearing mice and shows little side effects in normal mice. RNA sequencing and confirmatory results demonstrate that [4]helicenium induces more DNA damage in tumor cells than in normal cells, resulting in tumor cell cycle arrest and apoptosis increment. This study reveals an unexpected role and molecular mechanism for PAHs in selectively killing tumor cells and provides an effective strategy for precision cancer therapies.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to use the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) to examine the effect of comorbidities on OS among patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted between January 2006 and October 2016 and included 247 CML patients treated at the Basra Oncology & Haematology Centre, Basra, Iraq. Information from hospital records was used to calculate CCI scores and patients were divided into groups based on scores of 2-3 (CCI1 group) or >/=4 (CCI2 group). The OS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: There were 177 (71.7%) patients in the CCI1 group and 70 (28.3%) in the CCI2 group. Overall, patients in the CCI1 group were significantly younger compared to those in the CCI2 group (median age: 35 versus 60 years; P <0.001); however, the gender distribution was similar in both groups (male-to-female ratio of 1:1.06 versus 1:1.18, respectively; P = 0.683). Diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity (17%), followed by hypertension (12%) and gastrointestinal diseases (6%). There were no significant differences in mortality between the groups (9.6% versus 8.6%; P = 0.801). In total, 69.6% of all deaths were related to CML progression rather than to the presence of comorbidities. Conclusion: No significant correlation was found between CCI score and OS among CML patients in Basra. However, larger long-term prospective studies are needed to evaluate associations with median age at diagnosis and disease severity and to develop region-specific prognostic scales.","['(c) Copyright 2019, Sultan Qaboos University Medical Journal, All Rights', 'Reserved.']","['Abood, Rafid A', 'Hasson, Hasson M', 'Khalaf, Asaad A', 'Saleh, Elaf M']","['Abood RA', 'Hasson HM', 'Khalaf AA', 'Saleh EM']",,"['Department of Medicine, Basra College of Medicine, Basra, Iraq.', 'Basra Oncology & Haematology Centre, Basra, Iraq.', 'Basra Oncology & Haematology Centre, Basra, Iraq.', 'Department of Public Health, Basra Health Directorate, Basra, Iraq.', 'Basra Oncology & Haematology Centre, Basra, Iraq.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191105,Oman,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J,Sultan Qaboos University medical journal,101519915,,IM,"['Adult', '*Comorbidity', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iraq/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*mortality/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Diseases', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Comorbidity', 'Iraq', 'Mortality', 'Survival Analysis']",2019/11/16 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2018/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.18295/squmj.2019.19.03.010 [doi]', 'squmj1908-e236-241 [pii]']",ppublish,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J. 2019 Aug;19(3):e236-e241. doi: 10.18295/squmj.2019.19.03.010.

It can cause T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and HTLV-associated myelopathy. Case presentation: A 31-year-old woman was admitted after 2 months of cramps, paraparesis, and fecal/urinary incontinence. She was diagnosed with neurosyphilis according to the cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Despite treatment with crystalline penicillin there was no recovery, and anti-HTLV-1/2 tests were positive; therefore, the diagnosis of HTLV-associated myelopathy was made. The patient rejected glucocorticoid treatment; baclofen and carbamazepine were used to treat spasticity and cramps, respectively. The patient has not had progression. Discussion: HTLV-associated myelopathy is generated by an exaggerated inflammatory response in the central nervous system with clonal expansion of CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T lymphocytes. There is not a specific and useful treatment; glucocorticoids can reduce inflammation, but do not improve clinical functional outcomes. There is a high prevalence of syphilis and human T-lymphotropic virus co-infection in tropical countries; however, myelopathy as the first clinical manifestation is unusual. The treatment of neurosyphilis could reduce the inflammation into the central nervous system and could decrease the progression of sequelae.

Here, we show that aging hematopoietic progenitor cells particularly of the myeloid branch exhibit enhanced resistance to bulky DNA lesions-a relevant type of DNA damage induced by toxins such as cancer drugs or endogenous aldehydes. We identified aging-associated activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway to be connected to this phenotype. Inhibition of Hh signaling reverts DNA damage tolerance and DNA damage-resistant proliferation in aged hematopoietic progenitors. Vice versa, elevating Hh activity in young hematopoietic progenitors is sufficient to impair DNA damage responses. Altogether, these findings provide experimental evidence for aging-associated increases in Hh activity driving DNA damage tolerance in myeloid progenitors and myeloid-skewed differentiation. Modulation of Hh activity could thus be explored as a therapeutic strategy to prevent DNA damage tolerance, myeloid skewing, and disease development in the aging hematopoietic system.",,"['Scheffold, Annika', 'Baig, Ali H', 'Chen, Zhiyang', 'von Lohneysen, Sarah E', 'Becker, Friedrich', 'Morita, Yohei', 'Avila, Alush I', 'Groth, Marco', 'Lechel, Andre', 'Schmid, Florian', 'Kraus, Johann M', 'Kestler, Hans A', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Philipp, Melanie', 'Burkhalter, Martin D']","['Scheffold A', 'Baig AH', 'Chen Z', 'von Lohneysen SE', 'Becker F', 'Morita Y', 'Avila AI', 'Groth M', 'Lechel A', 'Schmid F', 'Kraus JM', 'Kestler HA', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Philipp M', 'Burkhalter MD']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9199-8990', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0221-6959', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4759-5254']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz Lipmann Institute, 07745, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz Lipmann Institute, 07745, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz Lipmann Institute, 07745, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz Lipmann Institute, 07745, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz Lipmann Institute, 07745, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz Lipmann Institute, 07745, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging, Fritz Lipmann Institute, 07745, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Ulm University, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenomics, Division of Pharmacogenomics, University of Tubingen, 72074, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Ulm University, 89081, Ulm, Germany. martin.burkhalter@uni-tuebingen.de.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenomics, Division of Pharmacogenomics, University of Tubingen, 72074, Tubingen, Germany. martin.burkhalter@uni-tuebingen.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191114,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Veratrum Alkaloids)', 'ZH658AJ192 (cyclopamine)']",IM,"['*Aging', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Veratrum Alkaloids/pharmacology']",,,2019/11/16 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2019/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0641-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0641-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Apr;34(4):1125-1134. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0641-3.

The JAK2V617F mutation plays a central role in these disorders and can be found in 90% of PV and ~50-60% of ET and PMF. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a master transcriptional regulator of the response to decreased oxygen levels. We demonstrate the impact of pharmacological inhibition and shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of HIF-1alpha in JAK2V617F-positive cells. Inhibition of HIF-1 binding to hypoxia response elements (HREs) with echinomycin, verified by ChIP, impaired growth and survival by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in Jak2V617F-positive 32D cells, but not Jak2WT controls. Echinomycin selectively abrogated clonogenic growth of JAK2V617F cells and decreased growth, survival, and colony formation of bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and iPS cell-derived progenitor cells from JAK2V617F-positive patients, while cells from healthy donors were unaffected. We identified HIF-1 target genes involved in the Warburg effect as a possible underlying mechanism, with increased expression of Pdk1, Glut1, and others. That was underlined by transcriptome analysis of primary patient samples.

We investigated the effect of Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (ATG) on acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) relapse by pretransplant MRD status. AML patients undergoing allo-HCT in first complete remission from either a matched sibling or unrelated donor during the 2006-2017 period were selected. Outcomes of 1509 patients (MRD(+), n = 426) were studied. ATG was used in 561 (52%) and 239 (58%) patients within the MRD(-) and MRD(+) cohorts, respectively. In MRD(-) patients, ATG did not affect relapse incidence (RI) (HR = 0.80, p = 0.17), but was associated with reduced incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD, grade II-IV and chronic GVHD, reduced nonrelapse mortality (HR = 0.66, p = 0.05), improved leukemia-free survival (HR = 0.74, p = 0.02), overall survival (HR = 0.69, p = 0.01), and GVHD-relapse free survival (HR = 0.62, p < 0.01). In MRD(+) patients, ATG was associated with a lower incidence of chronic GVHD (total, HR 0.56 p = 0.03; extensive, HR 0.40 P = 0.01), without an impact on other allo-HCT outcome parameters, including RI(HR = 1.02, p = 0.92).

We analyzed DNA methylation data from IDH1/2 mutant acute myeloid leukemia, oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, solid papillary breast carcinoma with reverse polarity, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, which clustered by their embryonal origin. Hypermethylated common probes affect predominantly gene bodies while promoters in IDH1/2 mutant cancers remain unmethylated. Enhancers showed global hypermethylation, however commonly hypomethylated enhancers were associated with tissue differentiation and cell fate determination. We demonstrate that some chromosomes, chromosomal arms and chromosomal regions are more affected by IDH1/2 mutations while others remain resistant to IDH1/2 mutation induced methylation changes.

To understand why these treatments fail to induce robust cytotoxic responses despite appropriately targeting oncogenic drivers, here we systematically interrogated the dependence of cancer cells on the BCL-2 family of apoptotic proteins after drug treatment. We observe that multiple targeted therapies, including BRAF or EGFR inhibitors, rapidly deplete the pro-apoptotic factor NOXA, thus creating a dependence on the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1. This adaptation requires a pathway leading to destabilization of the NOXA mRNA transcript. We find that interruption of this mechanism of anti-apoptotic adaptive resistance dramatically increases cytotoxic responses in cell lines and a murine melanoma model. These results identify NOXA mRNA destabilization/MCL-1 adaptation as a non-genomic mechanism that limits apoptotic responses, suggesting that sequencing of MCL-1 inhibitors with targeted therapies could overcome such widespread and clinically important resistance.",,"['Montero, Joan', 'Gstalder, Cecile', 'Kim, Daniel J', 'Sadowicz, Dorota', 'Miles, Wayne', 'Manos, Michael', 'Cidado, Justin R', 'Paul Secrist, J', 'Tron, Adriana E', 'Flaherty, Keith', 'Stephen Hodi, F', 'Yoon, Charles H', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Fisher, David E', 'Haq, Rizwan']","['Montero J', 'Gstalder C', 'Kim DJ', 'Sadowicz D', 'Miles W', 'Manos M', 'Cidado JR', 'Paul Secrist J', 'Tron AE', 'Flaherty K', 'Stephen Hodi F', 'Yoon CH', 'Letai A', 'Fisher DE', 'Haq R']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9567-3982', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3402-0478', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1993-9013', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1290-9276']","['Division of Hematologic Neoplasia/Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, 02115, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, 02115, MA, USA.', 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, C/Baldiri Reixac 15-21, Ed.

We have developed a novel computational approach, the Lineage Maturation Index (LMI), to define the changes in differentiation state of hematopoietic malignancies based on their gene expression profiles. We have confirmed that the LMI approach can detect known changes of differentiation state in both normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. To discover novel differentiation therapies, we applied this approach to analyze the gene expression profiles of HL-60 leukemia cells treated with a small molecule drug library. Among multiple drugs that significantly increased the LMIs, we identified mebendazole, an anti-helminthic clinically used for decades with no known significant toxicity. We tested the differentiation activity of mebendazole using primary leukemia blast cells isolated from human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. We determined that treatment with mebendazole induces dramatic differentiation of leukemia blast cells as shown by cellular morphology and cell surface markers. Furthermore, mebendazole treatment significantly extended the survival of leukemia-bearing mice in a xenograft model.

Rearrangements of MLL protein (MLL-r) in complexes that contain the histone methyltransferase DOT1L are common, which elicit abnormal methylation of lysine 79 of histone H3 at MLL target genes. Phase 1 clinical studies with pinometostat (EPZ-5676), an inhibitor of DOT1L activity, demonstrated the therapeutic potential for targeting DOT1L in MLL-r leukemia patients. We previously reported that down-regulation of DOT1L increases influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus replication and decreases the antiviral response. Here we show that DOT1L inhibition also reduces Sendai virus-induced innate response and its overexpression decreases influenza virus multiplication, reinforcing the notion of DOT1L controlling viral replication. Accordingly, genes involved in the host innate response against pathogens (RUBICON, TRIM25, BCL3) are deregulated in human lung epithelial cells treated with pinometostat. Concomitantly, deregulation of some of these genes together with that of the MicroRNA let-7B, may account for the beneficial effects of pinometostat treatment in patients with MLL-r involving DOT1L. These results support a possible increased vulnerability to infection in MLL-r leukemia patients undergoing pinometostat treatment. Close follow up of infection should be considered in pinometostat therapy to reduce some severe side effects during the treatment.",,"['Marcos-Villar, Laura', 'Nieto, Amelia']","['Marcos-Villar L', 'Nieto A']",,"['Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia (CNB-CSIC), Darwin 3, Cantoblanco, 28049, Madrid, Spain. lmarcos@cnb.csic.es.', 'CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias CIBERES, Madrid, Spain. lmarcos@cnb.csic.es.', 'Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia (CNB-CSIC), Darwin 3, Cantoblanco, 28049, Madrid, Spain. anieto@cnb.csic.es.', 'CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias CIBERES, Madrid, Spain. anieto@cnb.csic.es.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191114,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Proteins)', '0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (EPZ-5676)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RUBCN protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM25 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein/genetics/immunology', 'Benzimidazoles/*adverse effects', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/immunology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/*genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Influenza, Human/chemically induced/genetics/immunology/virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/*chemically induced/genetics/immunology/virology', 'Sendai virus/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/immunology', 'Virus Replication']",,,2019/11/16 06:00,2020/10/31 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2019/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-53239-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-53239-6 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Nov 14;9(1):16862. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-53239-6.,PMC6856118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite increasing the abundance of pro-apoptotic BIM and BMF, ERK1/2 pathway inhibition is predominantly cytostatic, reflecting residual pro-survival BCL2 family activity. Here, we show that uniquely low BCL-XL expression in melanoma biases the pro-survival pool towards MCL1. Consequently, BRAF or MEK1/2 inhibitors are synthetic lethal with the MCL1 inhibitor AZD5991, driving profound tumour cell death that requires BAK/BAX, BIM and BMF, and inhibiting tumour growth in vivo. Combination of ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors with BCL2/BCL-w/BCL-XL inhibitors is stronger in CRC, correlating with a low MCL1:BCL-XL ratio; indeed the MCL1:BCL-XL ratio is predictive of ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor synergy with MCL1 or BCL2/BCL-w/BCL-XL inhibitors. Finally, AZD5991 delays acquired BRAFi/MEKi resistance and enhances the efficacy of an ERK1/2 inhibitor in a model of acquired BRAFi + MEKi resistance.

Temporal trends in incidence are dynamic and multifactorial; for instance, the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma increased around the turn of the century, in part because of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. Most leukemias and lymphomas are sporadic and the specific etiology remains elusive. Still, research shows that these malignancies often develop in the context of genetic abnormalities, immunosuppression, and exposure to risk factors like ionizing radiation, carcinogenic chemicals, and oncogenic viruses. The prognosis varies by subtype, with poorer survival outcomes for acute leukemias among adults, and more favorable outcomes for Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Long-lasting treatment periods with impaired immune system, hygienic and social restrictions challenge patient well-being and rehabilitation as compared with other individuals with cancer. This study elucidates how AL patients, treated with curative intent in an outpatient setting, assess their physical, psychosocial and existential capability during and following treatment, and furthermore reports on the health initiatives offered to support their rehabilitation. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We conducted qualitative, semi-structured individual interviews with 16 AL patients, 6 months after end of treatment in the patients' homes. This was the final interview, in a line of three, carried out as part of a larger qualitative study. RESULTS: The data were analysed thematically through an inductive ongoing process consisting of four steps. The final step, selective coding, resulted in the three categories: physical activity, mental well-being and social activity. None of the patients were satisfied with their physical capability at the time of interview and experienced substantial impairment of functional capabilities. All patients struggled with anxiety and expressed a need for continuous progress in treatment and well-being to feel safe. It took an unexpected large effort to regain a meaningful social life, and patients still had to prioritise activities. CONCLUSIONS: AL patients suffered physically, psychologically and existentially throughout their illness trajectory. Rehabilitation initiatives deriving from the healthcare system and municipalities held room for improvement.

METHOD: The study was a cross-sectional, descriptive-correlative study. It was conducted on a sample of 117 mothers whose children were undergoing treatment in a public hospital in Bam, Iran. The Norbeck Social Support Scale and the Caregiver Burden Scale were used to measuring study variables. The data were analyzed using Pearson's correlations, t-tests, ANOVAs, and linear regressions. RESULTS: Significant correlations were observed between CB and SS availability (r = -0.499, p < 0.001), SS satisfaction (r = -0.543, p < 0.001), the age of the child with cancer (r = -0.22, p = 0.01), and duration of treatment (r = 0.336, p < 0.001). Married mothers experienced less CB than those that were widowed or divorced. Within the regression equation, SS satisfaction, SS availability, marital status, and duration of treatment were the predictors of CB. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Based on the results of the current study, mothers who have less SS, especially those who are single mothers, with younger children, and who have taken care of their child for an extended duration should be given special attention. Furthermore, it appears that there are distinct cultural variations amongst Iranian mothers which suggest that culture may impact upon SS availability. Results also suggest a need for interventions that enhance nurses' ability to provide support to caregivers and the broader family unit as a whole. Nurses in cancer care need to have psychological competencies to help family members of cancer patients especially mothers and more so those that are single mothers. As integral members of the patient care experience, nurses may be uniquely positioned to provide this needed psychosocial support.",,"['Arab, Mansour', 'Bernstein, Colleen', 'Haghshenas, Aboutaleb', 'Ranjbar, Hadi']","['Arab M', 'Bernstein C', 'Haghshenas A', 'Ranjbar H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3672-7266'],"['Physiology Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Psychology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.', 'School of Nursing and Midwifery, Bam University of Medical Sciences, Bam, Iran.', 'Mental Health Research Center, Tehran Institute of Psychiatry - School of Behavioral Sciences and Mental Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Palliat Support Care,Palliative & supportive care,101232529,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Caregiver Burden/*etiology/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Male', '*Mother-Child Relations', 'Mothers/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/psychology', 'Psychometrics/instrumentation/methods', 'Social Support', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Chemotherapy', '*Children', '*Family caregivers', '*Mother', '*Social support']",2019/11/16 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1017/S1478951519000853 [doi]', 'S1478951519000853 [pii]']",ppublish,Palliat Support Care. 2020 Aug;18(4):405-412. doi: 10.1017/S1478951519000853.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment response is assessed using bone marrow samples. MicroRNAs (miRs) easily traffic among fluid spaces and are more stable than most other RNA classes. We examined the role of circulating miRs as putative less invasive MRD biomarkers. METHODS: In an exploratory experiment, expression of 46 preselected miRs was studied in platelet-free blood plasma samples of 15 de novo, 5 relapsed ALL patients and 10 controls by Custom TaqMan Array Advanced MicroRNA Card. Based on their high expression in ALL compared to controls, and on the reduction observed along the induction therapy, four miRs were selected for further analyses: miR-128-3p, -181a-5p, -181b-5p and 222-3p. Their expression was measured by qPCR at 4 time points in 27 de novo ALL patients treated in the ALL IC-BFM 2009 study. RESULTS: The expression of all 4 miRs significantly decreased over the first week of therapy (miR-128-3p: log2 fold change - 2.86; adjusted p 3.6 x 10(-7); miR-181b-5p: log2 fold change - 1.75; adjusted p 1.48 x 10(-2); miR-181a-5p: log2 fold change -1.33; adjusted p 3.12 x 10(-2); miR-222-3p: log2 fold change - 1.25; adjusted p 1.66 x 10(-2)). However, no significant further reduction in miR expression was found after the 8th day of therapy. Measured drop in expression of 2 miRs at day 8 strongly correlated with day 15 bone marrow flow cytometry MRD results (miR-128-3p: Pearson's r = 0.88, adjusted p = 2.71 x 10(-4); miR-222-3p: r = 0.81, adjusted p = 2.99 x 10(-3)). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these circulating miRs might act as biomarkers of residual leukemia. MiR-128-3p and miR-222-3p in blood predict day 15 flow cytometry MRD results 7 days earlier. Although, their sensitivity falls behind that of bone marrow flow cytometry MRD at day 15.",,"['Rzepiel, Andrea', 'Kutszegi, Nora', 'Gezsi, Andras', 'Sagi, Judit C', 'Egyed, Balint', 'Peter, Gyorgy', 'Butz, Henriett', 'Nyiro, Gabor', 'Muller, Judit', 'Kovacs, Gabor T', 'Szalai, Csaba', 'Semsei, Agnes F', 'Erdelyi, Daniel J']","['Rzepiel A', 'Kutszegi N', 'Gezsi A', 'Sagi JC', 'Egyed B', 'Peter G', 'Butz H', 'Nyiro G', 'Muller J', 'Kovacs GT', 'Szalai C', 'Semsei AF', 'Erdelyi DJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5544-9209'],"['2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Immune-Proteogenomics Extracellular Vesicle Research Group, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Measurement and Information Systems, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', ""Heim Pal Children's Hospital, Budapest, Hungary."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Molecular Medicine Research Group, Hungarian Academy of Sciences and Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', ""Heim Pal Children's Hospital, Budapest, Hungary."", 'Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary. erdelyi.daniel@med.semmelweis-univ.hu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191114,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Circulating MicroRNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/*genetics', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Circulating MicroRNA/*blood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*blood/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Biomarker', '*MicroRNA', '*Minimal residual disease', '*Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2019/11/16 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/11/16 06:00'],"['2019/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-019-2114-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-019-2114-x [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2019 Nov 14;17(1):372. doi: 10.1186/s12967-019-2114-x.,PMC6854698,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, ROR1 was identified as a new client of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) via a mass spectrometry-based screen for ROR1-associated partners followed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis. A binding motif (ELHHPNIV) on ROR1 for HSP90 was revealed, which forms a alphaC-beta4 loop and is necessary for HSP90-facilitated ROR1 stabilization. We also found that targeting HSP90 leads to ROR1 degradation in a ubiquitin-proteasome dependent pathway, by which pro-survival ROR1 signaling was attenuated in CLL. Based on our previous finding that a humanized monoclonal antibody against ROR1 increases the activity of Ibrutinib against CLL, which is currently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials for the treatment of B-cell lymphoid malignancies, we then provided evidence that treatment with HSP90 inhibitor (17-DMAG) enhances anti-CLL activity of Ibrutinib in vitro and in vivo, by down-modulating ROR1. iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis of other HSP90 oncogenic clients in addition to ROR1, followed by GO/KEGG enrichment analysis, showed that Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), B-lymphoid Tyrosine Kinase (BLK), Lymphocyte-specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase (LCK), or LCK/YES-Related Novel Protein Tyrosine Kinase (LYN), as HSP90 clients, were significantly involved in 11 biological processes and 6 signaling pathways. However, immunoblotting validation confirmed that Ibrutinib treatment dramatically deprived HSP90 inhibitors, 17-DMAG, AUY922 or PU-H71, of inducing the degradation of BTK, BLK, LCK or LYN, but not ROR1. Collectively, our data suggested that depletion of ROR1 induced by targeting HSP90 might facilitate the enhancement of Ibrutinib activity against CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Effects of single use of homoharringtonine (HHT), approved for the treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), on CRC, are unknown. According to the TCGA database, EphB4 is aberrantly overexpressed in CRC patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of HHT on CRC and its underlying mechanism. HHT significantly suppressed LoVo cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the S phase. Mechanistic investigation using western blotting revealed that HHT suppressed EphB4, and this suppression was augmented by both HHT and NVP-BHG712 co-administration and EphB4 overexpression, indicating that HHT targets EphB4 to suppress LoVo cell growth. HHT inhibited EphB4 downstream pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK/EKR1/2, resulting in the regulation of cell cycle-related molecules (cyclinA2 and CDC2), and the molecules in the Bcl-2 mitochondrial apoptosis pathway including Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bax, Bad, caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9.

This study aimed at evaluating the clinico-pathological spectrum of t(8;21)-positive AML and ascertaining prognostic factors influencing its outcome in the Indian subcontinent. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 75 cases of t(8;21)-positive AML diagnosed over a period of six years (2013-2018) was carried out. Detailed clinical and laboratory data of the patients were collected from the electronic medical records and reviewed. RESULTS: Median age was 19.5 years (range 5-75 years) with a M:F of 1.7. Myeloid sarcoma was observed in 9.3% cases. There were 85% FAB AML-M2, 8% AML-M1, and 7% AML-M4 subtypes. Prominent morphological characteristics included dyspoiesis in maturing myeloid cells (83%), long thin tapered Auer rods (58%), cytoplasmic vacuoles (58%), eosinophilia (50%), and mast cells (22%). Auer rods in maturing granulocytes (4% cases) were highly suggestive of the translocation. Additional cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 53% cases. Seventy-one percent (25/35) achieved CR. The overall survival (OS) was 40%, with a median follow-up of 27 months (range 4-57 months). None of the hematological or cytogenetic factors correlated with OS, except for the presence of myeloid sarcoma which had a trend toward poor survival (P = .07). CONCLUSION: Outcome of t(8;21) AML is not influenced by any of the clinico-pathological parameters, except for a myeloid sarcoma, which may herald a poor prognosis. Recognition of this distinct subtype of AML would facilitate further molecular screening for risk stratification in resource-constrained settings.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Gupta, Ruchi', 'Yadav, Sanjeev', 'Parashar, Yatendra', 'Rahman, Khaliqur', 'Singh, Manish Kumar', 'Chandra, Dinesh', 'Gupta, Anshul', 'Nityanand, Soniya']","['Gupta R', 'Yadav S', 'Parashar Y', 'Rahman K', 'Singh MK', 'Chandra D', 'Gupta A', 'Nityanand S']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3427-9188', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8285-2092', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7558-2656']","['Department of Hematology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191114,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/metabolism', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/metabolism', '*Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/blood/genetics', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/blood/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Sarcoma, Myeloid/blood/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['RUNX1-RUNX1T1 AML', 'cytogenetics', 'morphology', 'prognosis']",2019/11/15 06:00,2020/10/03 06:00,['2019/11/15 06:00'],"['2019/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13121 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Feb;42(1):37-45. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13121.

We found that serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2 D] levels were significantly decreased in aging Cyp27b1(+/-) mice, which displayed an osteoporotic phenotype. This was accompanied by a reduction of expression of the B lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) insertion region 1 (Bmi1) at both gene and protein levels. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and a luciferase reporter assay, we then showed that 1,25(OH)2 D3 upregulated Bmi1 expression at a transcriptional level via the vitamin D receptor (VDR). To determine whether Bmi1 overexpression in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could correct bone loss induced by 1,25(OH)2 D deficiency, we overexpressed Bmi1 in MSCs using Prx1-driven Bmi1 transgenic mice (Bmi1(Tg) ) mice. We then compared the bone phenotypes of Bmi1(Tg) mice on a Cyp27b1(+/-) background, with those of Cyp27b1(+/-) mice and with those of WT mice, all at 8 months of age. We found that overexpression of Bmi1 in MSCs corrected the bone phenotype of Cyp27b1(+/-) mice by increasing osteoblastic bone formation, reducing osteoclastic bone resorption, increasing bone volume, and increasing bone mineral density. Bmi1 overexpression in MSCs also corrected 1,25(OH)2 D deficiency-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage, and cellular senescence of Cyp27b1(+/-) mice by reducing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), elevating serum total superoxide dismutase levels, reducing the percentage of gammaH2 A.X, p16, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha-positive cells and decreasing gammaH2A.X, p16, p19, p53, p21, IL-1beta, and IL-6 expression levels. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2 D stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, both ex vivo and in vitro, from WT mice but not from Bmi1(-/-) mice and 1,25(OH)2 D administration in vivo increased osteoblastic bone formation in WT, but not in Bmi1 (-/-) mice. Our results indicate that Bmi1, a key downstream target of 1,25(OH)2 D, plays a crucial role in preventing bone loss induced by 1,25(OH)2 D deficiency.

There is a lack of studies assessing the influence of sex in ALL. We documented this influence in a homogenous cohort. Three hundred three ALL Hispanic patients 1 to 20 years of age diagnosed over 10 years at a university hospital were evaluated. Patients were divided by sex and stratified by age. Survival rates were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. The median age for female individuals was 6 years versus 9 years for male individuals (P=0.002). In the whole cohort, there was a male preponderance (P=0.025), with a 1.3 male-to-female ratio. For male individuals, the 5-year relapse-free survival was 46%; for female individuals, it reached 58.7%, (P=0.009). Male individuals 1-9 years of age had a lower 5-year relapse-free survival than female individuals, 51.5% versus 66.7% (95% confidence interval, 65.35-68.01; P=0.020); this was not the case for overall survival (P=0.660). The male-to-female ratio in the 10 to 15 years' group was 1.59, and 2.35 in the 16 to 20 years' group. Incidence and relapse of ALL were higher in male individuals.

We conducted a phase II multicenter study comparing palonosetron plus aprepitant to palonosetron alone in patients undergoing a range of induction chemotherapy regimens for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Patients were randomized to palonosetron (0.25 mg) every other day until the last dose of chemotherapy alone or with aprepitant on days 1-3. Patients mainly received an anthracycline on days 1-3 plus cytarabine administered for 5-10 days. The primary end point was complete response (CR; no emesis and no rescue medication) over the whole study period (days of chemotherapy plus two additional days). Unplanned analysis of time to anti-emetic treatment failure (TTF) was also performed. RESULTS: Of the 134 patients enrolled in the study, 130 were evaluable: 68 subjects received palonosetron plus aprepitant and 62 received palonosetron alone. Although the primary end point of CR was similar between the treatment arms (72% vs 69%; P = .55), a higher proportion of patients treated with palonosetron plus aprepitant were free from nausea during the whole study period (43% vs 27%; P = .03). There was also a significant difference in favor of the two-drug regimens in TTF (median: 5 days vs 3 days; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that every-other-day palonosetron plus 3-day aprepitant can add clinical benefit to the control of CINV caused by multiple-day, corticosteroid-free chemotherapy for AML. In this challenging setting of CINV, further investigations of palonosetron in combination with aprepitant administered with an expanded schedule are warranted.

However, TBI is known to be associated with an increased risk of late effects, and therefore, non-TBI regimens have also been utilized successfully. A recent study showed that patients that were next-generation sequencing-minimal residual disease (NGS-MRD) negative prior to allogeneic HSCT had a very low risk of relapse, and perhaps could avoid exposure to TBI without compromising disease control. We examined outcomes at our institution in patients that received a TBI or non-TBI regimen, as well as explored the impact of NGS-MRD status in predicting risk of relapse post transplant. PROCEDURES: This retrospective analysis included 57 children and young adults with ALL that received their first myeloablative allogeneic HSCT from 2012 to 2017 at the University of California San Francisco. Our primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years post transplant. RESULTS: We demonstrated similar cumulative incidence of relapse for patients treated with either a TBI or non-TBI conditioning regimen, while NGS-MRD positivity prior to transplant was highly predictive of relapse. The presence of acute graft-versus-host disease was associated with decreased relapse rates, particularly among patients that received a TBI conditioning regimen and patients that were NGS-MRD positive prior to HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the decision to use either a TBI or non-TBI regimens in ALL should depend on NGS-MRD status, with conditioning regimens based on TBI reserved for patients that cannot achieve NGS-MRD negativity prior to allogeneic HSCT.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Friend, Brian D', 'Bailey-Olson, Mara', 'Melton, Alexis', 'Shimano, Kristin A', 'Kharbanda, Sandhya', 'Higham, Christine', 'Winestone, Lena E', 'Huang, James', 'Stieglitz, Elliot', 'Dvorak, Christopher C']","['Friend BD', 'Bailey-Olson M', 'Melton A', 'Shimano KA', 'Kharbanda S', 'Higham C', 'Winestone LE', 'Huang J', 'Stieglitz E', 'Dvorak CC']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8652-4400', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9982-1594', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7032-4623', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6146-3952']","[""Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas."", ""Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California."", ""Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California."", ""Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California."", ""Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California."", ""Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California."", ""Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California."", ""Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California."", ""Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology, and Blood & Marrow Transplantation, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, California.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191114,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*mortality', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*allogeneic transplantation', '*conditioning regimen', '*next-generation sequencing']",2019/11/15 06:00,2020/04/23 06:00,['2019/11/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28079 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Feb;67(2):e28079. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28079.

Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor with activity in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Adding bortezomib to standard reinduction chemotherapy in relapsed and refractory pediatric ALL has produced very good response rates in prior studies. METHODS: We evaluated bortezomib in combination with reinduction therapy (ALL R3) in 10 children with relapsed or refractory ALL. Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2) /dose) was administered to patients on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. In addition, patients received mitoxantrone, dexamethasone, pegaspargase, vincristine, and intrathecal methotrexate over 4 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 10 patients, eight (80%) achieved a complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete recovery (CRi). Of the patients in CR, two had undetectable minimal residual disease by flow cytometry (<0.01%). Five patients were subsequently treated with a stem cell transplant. All eight patients that achieved CR or CRi eventually relapsed. One patient remains alive following treatment with tisagenlecleucel after relapse. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in four out of 10 patients, and other toxicities commonly associated with bortezomib were not seen. CONCLUSIONS: In children with relapsed or refractory ALL, the addition of bortezomib to reinduction chemotherapy that includes mitoxantrone produces a complete response in the majority of cases and does not lead to excessive toxicity.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['August, Keith J', 'Guest, Erin M', 'Lewing, Karen', 'Hays, J Allyson', 'Gamis, Alan S']","['August KJ', 'Guest EM', 'Lewing K', 'Hays JA', 'Gamis AS']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5690-0855', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2482-5608']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191114,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*chemotherapy', '*children']",2019/11/15 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/11/15 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28062 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Mar;67(3):e28062. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28062.

However, researchers have not investigated the impact that the type of cancer diagnosis has on caregiver anxiety, depression, distress, and family functioning. The purpose of this study was to longitudinally investigate the early trajectory of caregiver psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression, distress, and family functioning near diagnosis and 6 months later by cancer type, and to examine the demographic factors that may be associated with caregiver emotional and family functioning outcomes. METHODS: Caregivers (n = 122) of children with a recent diagnosis of leukemia/lymphoma or solid tumor completed self-report measures of psychological and family functioning (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Distress Thermometer, and Family Environment Scale). RESULTS: In general, caregivers endorsed elevated psychological symptoms at the time of diagnosis, which decreased 6 months later. Caregivers of children with solid tumors endorsed greater anxiety across time than caregivers of children with leukemia/lymphoma did. In addition to caring for a child with a solid tumor, female sex, non-White ethnicity, and non-English language spoken in the home were factors associated with anxious and depressive symptoms and poorer family functioning.

Chromobox 4 (CBX4), a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) family of epigenetic regulatory factors, enhances cellular proliferation and promotes cancer cell migration. However, the effect of CBX4 in the progression of lung cancer is not fully understood. We found that CBX4 is highly expressed in lung tumours compared with adjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of CBX4 significantly promotes cell proliferation and migration in human lung cancer cell lines. The knockdown of CBX4 obviously suppresses the cell growth and migration of human lung cancer cells in vitro. Also, the proliferation and metastasis in vivo are blocked by CBX4 knockdown. Furthermore, CBX4 knockdown effectively arrests cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase through suppressing the expression of CDK2 and Cyclin E and decreases the formation of filopodia through suppressing MMP2, MMP9 and CXCR4. Additionally, CBX4 promotes proliferation and metastasis via regulating the expression of BMI-1 which is a significant regulator of proliferation and migration in lung cancer cells. Taken together, these data suggest that CBX4 is not only a novel prognostic marker but also may be a potential therapeutic target in lung cancer.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

METHODS: A total of 212 AML patients and 70 controls were consecutively recruited. Their bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were isolated, and lncRNA MVIH was detected by reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. In AML patients, complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. In vitro, lncRNA MVIH expression in AML cell lines was determined, and the effect of lncRNA MVIH on AML cell proliferation and apoptosis was assessed. RESULTS: LncRNA MVIH expression was increased in AML patients compared to controls, and receiver operating characteristic curve showed that lncRNA MVIH predicted elevated AML risk (area under curve: 0.742 [95% CI: 0.674-0.810]). In AML patients, no correlation of lncRNA MVIH expression with French-American-British classification was observed, while lncRNA MVIH high expression correlated with worse risk stratification. Moreover, lncRNA MVIH expression negatively correlated with CR achievement, EFS and OS. In vitro, lncRNA MVIH was overexpressed in AML cell lines (KG-1, ME-1, and HT-93) compared to normal BMMCs. Furthermore, lncRNA MVIH downregulation reduced KG-1 cell proliferation but increased apoptosis, whereas lncRNA MVIH upregulation raised HL-60 cell proliferation but decreased apoptosis. CONCLUSION: LncRNA MVIH may not only serve as a prognostic marker but also act as a therapeutic target in AML.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

METHODS: This is the biggest multicentre analysis on 1320 APL patients treated with AIDA-induction and risk-adapted consolidation between 1996 and 2012. Patients body mass index (BMI) was classified as underweight (<18.5 kg/m(2) ), normal (18.5-25 kg/m(2) ), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m(2) ), and obese (>/=30 kg/m(2) ) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Relationship between male gender, older age, and other known laboratory abnormalities in overweight/obese patients was significant. The induction mortality rate was significantly higher in APL with BMI >/=25 vs BMI <25 (10% vs 6%; P = .04). APL patients with BMI >/=25 had a trend to lower OS (74% vs 80%; P = .06). However, in the multivariate analysis, BMI did not retain the independent predictive value (P = .46). There was no higher incidence of differentiation syndrome with BMI >/=25, but there was a trend in obese. There was no difference in relapse rate according to the BMI. In summary, overweight/obesity does not represent an independent risk factor for APL outcomes.

Among these changes, an increase in CD4(+) T cells was reported. CD4(+) T cells are a heterogeneous population and distinct subsets have been described to exert pro- and anti-tumour functions. In CLL, controversial reports describing the dominance of IFNgamma-expressing Th1 T cells or of IL-4-producing Th2 T cells exist. Our study shows that blood of CLL patients is enriched in Th1 T cells producing high amounts of IFNgamma. Moreover, we observed that their frequency remains relatively stable in CLL patients over a time course of five years. Furthermore, we provide evidence for an accumulation of Th1 T cells in the Emicro-TCL1 mouse model of CLL. As TBET (encoded by Tbx21) is a crucial transcription factor for Th1 polarization, we generated Tbx21(-/-) bone marrow chimaeric mice which showed a lower number of IFNgamma-producing Th1 T cells, and used them for adoptive transfer of Emicro-TCL1 leukaemia. Disease development in these mice was, however, comparable to that in wild-type controls, excluding a major role for TBET-expressing Th1 cells in Emicro-TCL1 leukaemia. Collectively, our data highlight that Th1 T cells accumulate in CLL but reducing their number has no impact on disease development.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Results from clinical trials across multiple institutions report remarkable remission rates with CD19-directed CAR-modified T-cell therapy. These remissions are also proving to be durable in many patients with a relapse-free survival (RFS) of approximately 50% to 60% at 1 year across several trials and institutions in this population that has been historically very difficult to treat. In addition, new products are being developed to enhance upon the original CAR T-cell products, which include a humanized CAR, allogeneic CARs, and both CD22 and biallelic CD19 and CD22 constructs. Toxicity after CAR-modified T-cell therapy is characterized by cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity in the acute post-infusion period and B-cell aplasia as a long-term consequence of treatment. This review will summarize the published data thus far on the use of CAR-modified T-cell therapy in pediatric B-ALL and outline the various CAR products now being developed for this population. Delivery of this therapy and the decision to pursue hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) after treatment will be discussed.","['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

Fusion genes are hallmarks of ALL, and they are used as biomarkers for risk stratification as well as targets for precision medicine. Hence, clinical diagnostics pursues broad and comprehensive strategies for accurate discovery of fusion genes. Currently, the gold standard methodologies for fusion gene detection are fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction; these, however, lack sensitivity for the identification of new fusion genes and breakpoints. In this study, we implemented a simple operating procedure (OP) for detecting fusion genes. The OP employs RNA CaptureSeq, a versatile and effortless next-generation sequencing assay, and an in-house as well as a purpose-built bioinformatics pipeline for the subsequent data analysis. The OP was evaluated on a cohort of 89 B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) pediatric samples annotated as negative for fusion genes by the standard techniques. The OP confirmed 51 samples as negative for fusion genes, and, more importantly, it identified known (KMT2A rearrangements) as well as new fusion events (JAK2 rearrangements) in the remaining 38 investigated samples, of which 16 fusion genes had prognostic significance. Herein, we describe the OP and its deployment into routine ALL diagnostics, which will allow substantial improvements in both patient risk stratification and precision medicine.","['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

They are characterized by increased production of myeloid cells with minimal effects on terminal differentiation but can undergo transformation to acute leukemias. PV is the most common chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm and in the majority of cases is characterized by a V617F point mutation in JAK2. This JAK2 activating mutation is also found in about half the patients with MF and ET. Such aberrant proteins offer great potential for the treatment of these diseases however inhibitors to JAK2 have had limited success in the clinic in terms of curing the disease. We have previously used advanced proteomic techniques to identify drug targets and thus develop novel treatment strategies to distinguish the leukemic clone in both CML and PV. Here, we build on our proteomic data sets to characterize a new target, the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. AXL is overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia and importantly small molecule inhibitors have been developed which are currently in clinical trial hence offer the opportunity to repurpose this drug for the treatment of MPNs. We demonstrate that AXL is upregulated and activated in JAK2 associated MPNs. Further we show that inhibition of AXL preferentially kills early hemopoietic stem cells from PV patients and as such represents a promising therapeutic approach for JAK2 driven MPNs.","['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

Those mutations that are systematically found in all the patients affected by a certain leukemia are called ""drivers"" as they are necessary to drive the development of leukemia. Those ones that accumulate over time but are different from patient to patient and, therefore, are not essential for leukemia development are called ""passengers."" The first studies highlighting a potential cooperating role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/RAS pathway mutations in the phenotype of KMT2A-rearranged leukemia was published 20 years ago. The recent development in more sensitive sequencing technologies has contributed to clarify the contribution of these mutations to the evolution of KMT2A-rearranged leukemia and suggested that these mutations might confer clonal fitness and enhance the evolvability of KMT2A-leukemic cells. This is of particular interest since this pathway can be targeted offering potential novel therapeutic strategies to KMT2A-leukemic patients. This review summarizes the recent progress on our understanding of the role of PI3K/RAS pathway mutations in initiation, maintenance, and relapse of KMT2A-rearranged leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

Platelet recovery may vary between incomplete and excess recovery among patients achieving remission. We analyzed platelet recovery after the first induction cycle in 291 consecutive AML patients. We defined excess platelet rebound (EPR) as platelet increase above 500 G/L. We observed EPR in 120 (41.2%) patients. EPR+ patients had lower platelets at diagnosis, higher marrow infiltration, more frequently NPM1 mutations, and were associated with ELN favorable risk. Absence of EPR correlated with complex karyotypes, ELN intermediate-I and adverse risk, and therapy-related AML. Overall survival was better in EPR+ patients than EPR- (median 125 vs 41 months; p = 0.04), as was disease-free survival. By multivariate analysis, EPR+ was an independent parameter associated with favorable survival. Plasma thrombopoietin (TPO) levels at diagnosis indicated EPR+ (p < 0.0001), while GATA-1, GATA-2, and MPL mRNA expression did not differ between EPR+ and EPR- patients. Finally, transcription factors blocking early megakaryopoiesis were upregulated in EPR- patients, while NFE2 involved in late megakaryocyte differentiation was increased in EPR+ patients.

Advances in monoclonal antibody technology have resulted in the development of newer generations of anti-CD20 antibodies with improved therapeutic effectiveness. In parallel, our knowledge about the distinctive biological characteristics of CLL has progressively deepened and has revealed the importance of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and upregulated antiapoptotic proteins for survival and expansion of malignant cell clones. This knowledge provided the basis for development of novel targeted agents that revolutionized treatment of CLL. Ibrutinib and idelalisib inhibit the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) delta, respectively, thus interfering with supportive signals coming from the microenvironment via the BCR. These drugs induce egress of CLL cells from secondary lymphoid organs and remarkably improve clinical outcomes, especially for patients with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes or with p53 abnormalities that do not benefit from classical treatment schemes. Latest clinical trial results have established ibrutinib with or without anti-CD20 antibodies as the preferred first-line treatment for most CLL patients, which will reduce the use of chemoimmunotherapy in the imminent future. Further advances are achieved with venetoclax, a BH3-mimetic that specifically inhibits the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 protein and thus causes rapid apoptosis of CLL cells, which translates into deep and prolonged clinical responses including high rates of minimal residual disease negativity. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of targeted CLL therapies, including new combination schemes, novel BTK and PI3K inhibitors, spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and cellular immunotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

The absence of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts in remission defines complete molecular response and correlates with a superior survival. However, a significant proportion of patients still relapses and defining molecular risk factors that identify patients at diagnosis or at molecular remission that are at risk of relapse could help tailor treatment strategies for those high risk patients. Here, we analyze a cohort of 94 patients that reach a molecular remission (MR) following intensive treatment and identify 21 patients that relapse despite achieving MR. Using targeted sequencing of 63 genes implicated in hematologic malignancies we show that at diagnosis patients who relapse following MR have a higher burden of co-mutated genes than patients that do not relapse (median = 2 vs median = 0; P = 0.0156). This resulted in a relapse free survival rate of 65% vs 86% at 2 years, respectively (>/=1 co-mutation vs no co-mutation, P = 0.02) with a trend for inferior overall survival (n.s.). Applying sensitive sequencing to reassess mutations at relapse in paired samples of 17/21 patients we demonstrate a net loss of co-mutations at relapse: median 2 (range 0-5) vs 1 (0-4) at diagnosis and relapse (P = 0.048). At relapse more patients had no detected co-mutation compared to diagnosis (47% vs 17%, P = 0.034). Co-mutations at diagnosis, therefore, might represent a general susceptibility of the AML clone to acquire mutations and the true nature of 2nd hit mutations that drive leukemia has to be defined for AML with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion.","['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

CAR T cells have demonstrated their powerful capacities in inducing complete and lasting remissions of leukemia/lymphoma in an increasing number of trials worldwide. Since the early 90's, the design of CARs went through various steps of optimization until the very recent developments which include CARs with logic gating in the recognition of antigen patterns on target cells and TRUCKs with a target recognition induced delivery of immune modulating agents.

The presence of measurable residual disease (MRD) in complete remission (CR) indicates high risk of relapse and worse outcome in AML patients. However, the prognostic impact of MN1 expression levels as MRD marker has not been evaluated. Digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a novel technique allowing sensitive and specific absolute gene expression quantification. We retrospectively analyzed 124 AML patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in CR or CR with incomplete peripheral recovery. Absolute MN1 copy numbers in peripheral blood were assessed prior to HSCT (median 7; range 0-29 days) using ddPCR. High pre-HSCT MN1/Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 gene (ABL1) copy numbers associated with a higher cumulative incidence of relapse after HSCT and-in relapsing patients-shorter time to relapse. In multivariable analysis, high pre-HSCT MN1/ABL1 copy numbers remained an independent prognosticator for relapse after HSCT. Patients with the highest pre-HSCT MN1/ABL1 copy numbers also had the highest risk of relapse. MN1 copy number assessment also added prognostic information to nucleophosmin 1 gene (NPM1) mutation- and brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic (BAALC) and Wilm's tumor gene 1 (WT1) expression-based MRD evaluation.

There is a long-standing debate as to whether AML driver mutations occur in hematopoietic stem or in more committed progenitor cells. Here, we review how different mouse models, despite their inherent limitations, have functionally demonstrated that cellular origin plays a critical role in the biology of the disease, influencing clinical outcome. AML driven by potent oncogenes such as mixed lineage leukemia fusions often seem to emerge from committed myeloid progenitors whereas AML without any major cytogenetic abnormalities seem to develop from a combination of preleukemic initiating events arising in the hematopoietic stem cell pool. More refined mouse models may serve as experimental platforms to identify and validate novel targeted therapeutic strategies.","['Copyright (c) 2018 the Author(s).

Randomized ELAM02 trial questioned if maintenance therapy with interleukin-2 (IL2), for 1 year, improves disease-free survival (DFS). Patients aged 0 to 18 years, with newly diagnosed AML (excluding patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia or down syndrome AML) were enrolled. They received 1 course of induction treatment (cytarabine and mitoxantrone) and 3 courses of consolidation treatment (high-dose cytarabine in courses 1 and 3). According to the cytogenetics risk, patients not undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, still in complete remission (CR) after the third course of consolidation treatment, were eligible for randomization to 1 year of maintenance therapy with monthly courses of IL2 or no maintenance treatment. There were 438 evaluable patients, 154 of whom were randomized to the IL2/no maintenance groups. Relapse occurred in 28 patients from the IL2+ group and 29 patients in the IL2- group. Survival was similar in the 2 groups, with a 4-year DFS of 62% without IL2 and 66% with IL2 (P = 0.75). In the CBF population, 4-year DFS was 55% without IL2 and 78% with IL2 (P = 0.07). No deaths from toxicity or excess of serious adverse events related to IL2 treatment were recorded. Prolonged IL2 for maintenance therapy after intensive chemotherapy is feasible and safe in pediatric AML patients in their first CR. Such treatment did not improve DFS in this study, but a positive trend was observed in favor of IL2 maintenance therapy among core binding factor acute myeloblastic leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2018 the Author(s).

A number of well-established abnormalities are routinely used in risk stratification for treatment. These include high hyperdiploidy and ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, classified as good risk, while Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive ALL and rearrangements of the KMT2A (MLL) gene define poor risk. A poor risk subgroup of intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21-ALL) has been described, in which intensification of therapy has greatly improved outcome. Until recently, no consistent molecular features were defined in around 30% of BCP-ALL (known as B-other-ALL). Recent studies are classifying them into distinct subgroups, some with clear potential for novel therapeutic approaches. For example, in 1 poor risk subtype, known as Ph-like/BCR-ABL1-like ALL, approximately 10% have rearrangements of ABL-class tyrosine kinases: including ABL1, ABL2, PDGFRB, PDGFRA, and CSF1R. Notably, they show a poor response to standard chemotherapy, while they respond to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib. In other Ph-like-ALL patients, deregulation of the cytokine receptor, CRLF2, and JAK2 rearrangements lead to activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, implicating a specific role for JAK inhibitors in their treatment. Other novel subgroups within B-other-ALL are defined by the IGH-DUX4 translocation, related to deletions of the ERG gene and a good outcome, while fusions involving ZNF384, MEF2D, and intragenic PAX5 amplification (PAX5 (AMP)) are linked to a poor outcome. Continued genetic screening will eventually lead to complete genomic classification of BCP-ALL and define more molecular targets for less toxic therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2018 the Author(s).

The authors established a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible transgenic mouse model ""iMLL-ENL"" in which induction in long-term hematopoietic stem cells, lymphoid primed multipotent progenitor cells, multipotent progenitors (MPP4) but not in more committed myeloid granulocyte-macrophage progenitors led to a fully reversible acute leukemia expressing myeloid and B-cell markers. iMLL-ENL leukemic cells generally expressed lower MLL-ENL mRNA than those obtained after retroviral transduction. Disease induction was associated with iMLL-ENL levels exceeding the endogenous Mll1 at mRNA and protein levels. In leukemic cells from t(11;19)(+) leukemia patients, MLL-ENL mRNA also exceeded the endogenous MLL1 levels suggesting a critical threshold for transformation. Expression profiling of iMLL-ENL acute leukemia revealed gene signatures that segregated t(11;19)(+) leukemia patients from those without an MLL translocation. Importantly, B220(+) iMLL-ENL leukemic cells showed a higher in vivo leukemia initiation potential than coexisting B220(-) cells. Collectively, characterization of a novel transgenic mouse model indicates that the cell-of-origin and the fusion gene expression levels are both critical determinants for MLL-ENL-driven acute leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2018 the Author(s).

Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitors such as ruxolitinib manage symptoms but do not substantially change the natural history of the disease. In this report, we show the effects of IMG-7289, an irreversible inhibitor of the epigenetically active lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in mouse models of MPN. Once-daily treatment with IMG-7289 normalized or improved blood cell counts, reduced spleen volumes, restored normal splenic architecture, and reduced bone marrow fibrosis. Most importantly, LSD1 inhibition lowered mutant allele burden and improved survival. IMG-7289 selectively inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of JAK2 (V617F) cells by concomitantly increasing expression and methylation of p53, and, independently, the pro-apoptotic factor PUMA and by decreasing the levels of its antiapoptotic antagonist BCLXL. These data provide a molecular understanding of the disease-modifying activity of the LSD1 inhibitor IMG-7289 that is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in patients with high-risk myelofibrosis. Moreover, low doses of IMG-7289 and ruxolitinib synergize in normalizing the MPN phenotype in mice, offering a rationale for investigating combination therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2018 the Author(s).

ZEB expression is also associated with the acquisition of cancer stem cell properties and therapy resistance. Consequently, expression levels of ZEB1/2 and of their direct target genes are widely seen as reliable prognostic markers for solid tumor aggressiveness and cancer patient outcome. Recent loss-of-function mouse models demonstrated that both ZEBs are also essential hematopoietic transcription factors governing blood lineage commitment and fidelity. Interestingly, both gain- and loss-of-function mutations have been reported in multiple hematological malignancies. Combined with emerging functional studies, these data suggest that ZEB1 and ZEB2 can act as tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes in blood borne malignancies, depending on the cellular context. Here, we review these novel insights and discuss how balanced expression of ZEB proteins may be essential to safeguard the functionality of the immune system and prevent leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2018 the Author(s).

We investigated the possibility that circulating erythrocytes store and then provide dasatinib to target cells. In vitro coincubation of dasatinib-treated cells with naive leukemic cells followed by analysis of kinase inhibition, apoptosis induction, fluorescent molecule exchanges, and dasatinib dosage were performed. Cells incubated with clinically relevant concentrations of dasatinib for a short time retained, after a washout procedure, an intracellular pool of dasatinib which was transferable to naive BCR-ABL1 expressing cells and induced their apoptosis. This was verified in total blood where the huge cellular volume of erythrocytes constituted a large reservoir of dasatinib able to induce apoptosis in naive BCR-ABL1 cell lines and primitive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) CD34+ cells. This dasatinib transfer necessitated a contact between donor and acceptor cells. A component exchange occurred during this contact, carrying dasatinib and other TKIs such as nilotinib or the fluorescent sunitinib. An active pool of dasatinib could be buried inside the circulating erythrocytes, out of reach of detoxifying mechanisms, but still available for target cells and thus extending the acute effect of the plasmatic pool of the drug.","['Copyright (c) 2018 the Author(s).

Idelalisib, a selective oral inhibitor of PI3Kdelta, has shown considerable single-agent activity in patients with heavily pretreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This study evaluated the safety and clinical activity of idelalisib in combination with bendamustine (IB) or rituximab (IR) or both (IBR) in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CLL. Idelalisib was given continuously at 100 or 150 mg twice daily in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m(2) weekly x 8 doses), bendamustine (70 or 90 mg/m(2), days 1 and 2 every 4 weeks x 6 cycles) or BR (rituximab, 375 mg/m(2) every 4 weeks and bendamustine, 70 mg/m(2), days 1 and 2 every 4 weeks x 6 cycles). The primary endpoint was safety; secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS). Fifty-two patients (median age 64 years) with a median of 3 prior therapies were enrolled. ORR was 84.6% (89.5% IR group, 77.8% IB group, and 86.7% IBR group). The overall median PFS was 25.6 months, and median DOR was 26.6 months. The most common grade >/=3 adverse events (>/=10% of patients) were pneumonia (19.2%), diarrhea (13.5%), and febrile neutropenia (17.3%). Idelalisib-based combination therapy with bendamustine and/or rituximab was highly active, resulting in durable tumor control in patients with heavily pretreated R/R CLL.

A better description of the pattern of molecular aberrations in childhood AML is needed to refine prognostication in such patients. We report here the comprehensive molecular landscape using both high-throughput sequencing focused on 36 genes and ligation-dependent RT-PCR in 385 children with de novo AML enrolled in the prospective ELAM02 trial and we evaluated their prognostic significance. Seventy-six percent of patients had at least 1 mutation among the genes we screened. The most common class of mutations involved genes that control kinase signaling (61%) followed by transcription factors (16%), tumor suppressors (14%), chromatin modifiers (9%), DNA methylation controllers (8%), cohesin genes (5%), and spliceosome (3%). Moreover, a recurrent transcript fusion was detected in about a half of pediatric patients. Overall, CBF rearrangements, NPM1 and double CEBPA mutations represented 37% of the cohort and defined a favorable molecular subgroup (3 years OS: 92.1%) while NUP98 fusions, WT1, RUNX1, and PHF6 mutations (15% of the cohort) segregated into a poor molecular subgroup (3 years OS: 46.1%). KMT2A-rearrangements (21% of the cohort) were associated with an intermediate risk. Despite some overlaps, the spectrum of molecular aberrations and their prognostic significance differ between childhood and adult AML. These data have important implications to contribute in refining risk stratification of pediatric AML and show the need for further validations in independent pediatric cohorts.","['Copyright (c) 2018 the Author(s).

After infusion into the patient, the CAR-expressing T cells recognize specific tumor targets and induce an immune response against them. The technology utilized is fundamentally different from previously available cancer treatments. Currently, most CAR-T cell therapies use autologous T cells. Tisagenlecleucel (formerly CTL019) is an anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy that was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Tisagenlecleucel has shown robust in vivo expansion and long-term persistence, clinically meaningful durable response and remission rates, and overall survival benefit in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL and in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Common adverse events (AEs) include cytokine release syndrome, which may require hospitalization and admission to an intensive care unit, neurological toxicities, and B-cell aplasia. These AEs are manageable when treated by an appropriately trained team. Additional research is required to further develop AE management protocols. In this review, we describe regulatory requirements, clinical considerations, and site-level requirements for clinical study implementation of CAR-T cell therapy in Europe. We also provide a case study of the European experience from the first global clinical trial for tisagenlecleucel, which may serve as a useful starting point for investigators and clinicians looking to implement CAR-T cell therapy at their institutions.","['Copyright (c) 2018 the Author(s).

Here we demonstrate the application of singscore to investigate transcriptional profiles associated with specific mutations or genetic lesions in acute myeloid leukemia. Using matched genomic and transcriptomic data available through the TCGA we show that scoring of appropriate signatures can distinguish samples with corresponding mutations, reflecting the ability of these mutations to drive aberrant transcriptional programs involved in leukemogenesis.

In contrast to tsRNAs, mature tRFs (tRF-3s, tRF-5s, and internal tRFs) are produced from mature tRNA sequences and are redundant fragments. We investigated tsRNA expression in CLL and determined tsRNA signatures in indolent CLL and aggressive CLL vs. normal B cells. We noticed that both ts-43 and ts-44 are derived from distinct genes of pre-tRNA(His), and are down-regulated in CLL 3- to 5-fold vs. normal B cells. Thus, we investigated expression levels of tRF-5 fragments from tRNA(His) in CLL samples and healthy controls, and determined that such fragments are down-regulated by 5-fold in CLLs vs. normal controls. Given these results, we investigated the expression of all mature tRFs in CLLs vs. normal controls. We found a drastic dysregulation of the expression of mature tRFs in CLL. In aggressive CLL, for the top 15 up-regulated fragments, linear fold change varied from 2,053- to 622-fold. For the top 15 down-regulated fragments in CLL, linear fold change varied from 314- to 52-fold. In addition, 964 mature tRFs were up-regulated at least 2-fold in CLL, while 701 fragments were down-regulated at least 2-fold. Similar results were obtained for indolent CLL.

One of the interferon-induced antiviral proteins, human Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10), a superfamily 1 RNA helicase, has been shown to inhibit retroviruses and several RNA viruses. However, it remains undetermined whether MOV10 also inhibits DNA viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV). Here, we report that MOV10 dramatically reduces the levels of intracellular HBV DNA, resulting in significant inhibition of both the HBV experimental strain and the clinical isolates. Mechanistic experiments revealed that MOV10 interacts with HBV RNA and blocks the early step of viral reverse transcription, thereby impairing viral DNA synthesis, without affecting viral gene expression and pregenomic RNA encapsidation. Moreover, mutation of the helicase domain of MOV10 caused loss of binding to HBV RNA and of the anti-HBV activity. Together, our results indicate that MOV10 restricts HBV replication, insights that may open new avenues to the development of anti-HBV therapeutics.",['(c) 2019 Liu et al.'],"['Liu, Tingting', 'Sun, Qingsong', 'Liu, Yong', 'Cen, Shan', 'Zhang, Quan']","['Liu T', 'Sun Q', 'Liu Y', 'Cen S', 'Zhang Q']",,"['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing 210008 China.', ""Department of Emergency, The Affiliated Huaian No.1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an 223301, China."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Molecular Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing 210008 China.', 'Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing 100050 China shancen@imb.pumc.edu.cn.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Molecular Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing 210008 China huanlezq44@126.com.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210008 China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191113,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['EC 2.7.7.- (Mov10 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['DNA Helicases/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Hepatitis B/virology', 'Hepatitis B virus/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'RNA Helicases/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', '*Reverse Transcription', '*Virus Replication']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA viruses', '*Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10)', '*RNA helicase', '*RNA silencing', '*hepatitis B virus (HBV, Hep B)', '*innate immunity', '*liver disease', '*viral replication', '*viral reverse transcription', '*virus-host interactions']",2019/11/15 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/11/15 06:00'],"['2019/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)30289-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA119.009435 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2019 Dec 20;294(51):19804-19813. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.009435.

CD19-specific CAR T-cells have been shown to be very effective as a treatment for relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. ICANS (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome) is one of the most frequently occurring toxicities of CAR T-cell treatment. We describe two cases of patients with neurologic symptoms following CAR T-cell infusion who were suspected to have ICANS, but in fact had cerebral toxoplasmosis and venous sinus thrombosis respectively. The focus on CRS and ICANS after CAR T-cell infusion may lead to less vigilance to the 'normal' threats faced by intensively pretreated patients with lymphoma such as infections and thrombosis. Both cases underscore the importance of a broad and thorough examination of patients if they experience neurologic symptoms after CAR T-cell treatment.","['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2019.

In this study, the potential underlying mechanism and functional role of miR-141-3p in T-ALL cells were determined. We found that the expression level of miR-141-3p was significantly downregulated, while that of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 5 (TRAF5) was strongly upregulated in tissues from patients with T-ALL compared with healthy controls. Subsequently, upregulation of miR-141-3p significantly repressed T-ALL cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. Conversely, downregulation of miR-141-3p significantly inhibited cell apoptosis and enhanced T-ALL cell proliferation. We also verified that TRAF5 was the direct target of miR-141-3p in T-ALL cells. Additionally, TRAF5 overexpression significantly repressed cell apoptosis and increased T-ALL cell proliferation.

The forms of transmission and clinical manifestations such as progressive motor incapacity, genitourinary disorders, in addition to restriction of maternal breastfeeding, impact daily life and can lead to social discrimination and stigma. The stigma denotes violation of social norms and reinforces prejudice and inequalities. This article aims to discuss the concept of stigma and its repercussions on persons living with HTLV. The discussion is based on a literature review on the theme and the authors' experience with care for persons affected by the infection and illness. The study found that both HTLV carrier status and HTLV-related illness can be stigmatizing for individuals, who feel inferior for being infected with a potentially serious and even fatal disease, although incompletely understood and loaded with derogatory stereotypes. This situation can have negative repercussions on access to health services, treatment adherence, and pursuit of rights. Public policies should help mitigate such stigmatization, ensuring the rights of individuals in a situation of vulnerability due to HTLV in order from them to live as protagonists in the exercise of their civil rights.",,"['Garcia, Ionara Ferreira da Silva', 'Hennington, Elida Azevedo']","['Garcia IFDS', 'Hennington EA']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3527-4397', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5280-8827']","['Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.', 'Escola Nacional de Saude Publica Sergio Arouca, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.']","['eng', 'por']",,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191111,Brazil,Cad Saude Publica,Cadernos de saude publica,8901573,,IM,"['Deltaretrovirus Infections/*physiopathology', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic', 'Prejudice', 'Social Discrimination', '*Social Stigma', 'Stereotyping']",,,2019/11/14 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/11/14 06:00'],"['2019/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0102-311X2019001303001 [pii]', '10.1590/0102-311X00005419 [doi]']",epublish,Cad Saude Publica. 2019 Nov 11;35(11):e00005419. doi: 10.1590/0102-311X00005419. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,HTLV: uma infeccao estigmatizante?,,,,,,,

However, the contribution of Fanconi-BRCA pathway deficiency to human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains undefined. We identified point mutations in 9 (23%) of 40 human T-ALL cases analyzed, with variant allele fractions consistent with heterozygous mutations early in tumor evolution. Two of these mutations were present in remission bone marrow specimens, suggesting germline alterations. BRCA2 was the most commonly mutated gene. The identified Fanconi-BRCA mutations encode hypomorphic or null alleles, as evidenced by their inability to fully rescue Fanconi-deficient cells from chromosome breakage, cytotoxicity and/or G2/M arrest upon treatment with DNA cross-linking agents. Disabling the tumor suppressor activity of the Fanconi-BRCA pathway is generally thought to require biallelic gene mutations. However, all mutations identified were monoallelic, and most cases appeared to retain expression of the wild-type allele. Using isogenic T-ALL cells, we found that BRCA2 haploinsufficiency induces selective hypersensitivity to ATR inhibition, in vitro and in vivo. These findings implicate Fanconi-BRCA pathway haploinsufficiency in the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL, and provide a therapeutic rationale for inhibition of ATR or other druggable effectors of homologous recombination.",,"['Pouliot, Gayle P', 'Degar, James', 'Hinze, Laura', 'Kochupurakkal, Bose', 'Vo, Chau D', 'Burns, Melissa A', 'Moreau, Lisa', 'Ganesa, Chirag', 'Roderick, Justine',

Two receptor tyrosine kinases, c-KIT and fms-tyrosine kinase (FLT3), are frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and these mutations are associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we discovered a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, compound 15a, with potent inhibition against single or double mutations of c-KIT developed in GISTs. Moreover, crystal structure analysis revealed the unique binding mode of 15a with c-KIT and may elucidate its high potency in inhibiting c-KIT kinase activity. Compound 15a inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by targeting c-KIT in c-KIT-mutant GIST cell lines. The antitumor effects of 15a were also demonstrated in GIST430 and GIST patient-derived xenograft models. Further studies demonstrated that 15a inhibited the proliferation of c-KIT- and FLT3-driven AML cells in vitro and in vivo.

The complexes are fully characterized using (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopies, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. Biomolecular interaction of complex 2a with human serum albumin (HSA) is studied by fluorescence, UV-vis, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. The binding constants (Kb) and number of binding sites (n) are evaluated using the Stern-Volmer equation. The intrinsic fluorescence of protein is quenched by a static quenching mechanism, with a binding constant of Kb approximately 10(5) reflecting a high affinity of complex 2a for HSA. The thermodynamic parameters (DeltaH degrees , DeltaG degrees , and DeltaS degrees ) indicate that the interaction is a spontaneous process and hydrophobic forces play a main role in the reaction. The displacement experiments demonstrate that the reactive binding sites of HSA to complex 2a are mainly located within its hydrophobic cavity in subdomain IIA (site I). Synchronous fluorescence spectra reveal that complex 2a affected the microenvironment of tryptophan-214 residues in subdomain IIA of HSA. In the case of interaction of complex 2b and HSA, because of overlapping of the emission spectra of complex 2b with HSA, chemometric approaches are applied. The results indicate significant interaction between the tryptophan residue of HSA and complex 2b. Moreover, the binding of Pt(II) complexes 2a and 2b causes a reduction of the alpha-helix content of HSA, as obtained by far-UV CD spectroscopy. The average binding distance (r) between Pt(II) complexes and HSA is obtained by Forster's resonance energy-transfer theory. Also, a molecular docking simulation reveals that pi-pi-stacking and hydrophobic interactions between these complexes and HSA are significant. Furthermore, the interactions of platinum complexes, 2, with calf-thymus DNA (CT-DNA) are investigated. The UV-vis results and ethidium bromide competitive studies support an intercalative interaction of both Pt(II) complexes with DNA. The new complexes 2 are also screened for anticancer activities. The results show that complexes 2 exhibit significant anticancer activity against the K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) cell line.",,"['Aseman, Marzieh Dadkhah', 'Aryamanesh, Shiva', 'Shojaeifard, Zahra', 'Hemmateenejad, Bahram', 'Nabavizadeh, S Masoud']","['Aseman MD', 'Aryamanesh S', 'Shojaeifard Z', 'Hemmateenejad B', 'Nabavizadeh SM']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2478-7480', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1830-6043', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3976-7869']","['Faculty of Chemistry , Kharazmi University , Tehran 15719-14911 , Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences , Shiraz University , Shiraz 71467-13565 , Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences , Shiraz University , Shiraz 71467-13565 , Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences , Shiraz University , Shiraz 71467-13565 , Iran.', 'Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center , Shiraz University of Medical Sciences , Shiraz , 71348-53734 , Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences , Shiraz University , Shiraz 71467-13565 , Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191113,United States,Inorg Chem,Inorganic chemistry,0366543,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '91080-16-9 (calf thymus DNA)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'ZIF514RVZR (Serum Albumin, Human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Density Functional Theory', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mercaptopurine/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Serum Albumin, Human/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thermodynamics']",,,2019/11/14 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/11/14 06:00'],"['2019/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b02696 [doi]'],ppublish,Inorg Chem. 2019 Dec 2;58(23):16154-16170. doi: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b02696.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) and thalidomide (THAL) are used for treatment of many types of hematologic malignancies. ATO prevents the proliferation of cells and induces apoptosis in some cancer cells. Moreover, THAL has immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic effects in malignant cells. The aim of present study was to examine the effects of ATO and THAL on U937 and KG-1 cells, and evaluation of mRNA expression level of VEGFs genes, PI3K genes and some of autophagy genes. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro experimental study, U937 and KG-1 cells were treated by ATO (0.4-5 muM) and THAL (5-100 muM) for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The apoptosis rate and cell cycle arrest were evaluated by flow cytometry (Annexin/PI) and cell cycle flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The effect of ATO/THAL on mRNAs expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: ATO/THAL combination enhanced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Also, ATO/THAL induced SubG1/ G1 phase arrest. mRNA expression levels of VEGFC (contrary to other VEGFs isoform), PI3K, AKT, mTOR, MEK1, PTEN, IL6, LC3 and P62 genes were upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells following treatment with ATO/THAL. Conclusion: Combined treatment with ATO and THAL can inhibit proliferation and invasion of AML cells by down-regulating ULK1 and BECLIN1 and up-regulating PTEN and IL6, and this effect was more marked than the effects of ATO and THAL alone.",['Copyright(c) by Royan Institute.

However, how lncRNA deleted in lymphocytic leukaemia 2 (DLEU2) contributes to NSCLC remains undocumented. The clinical significance of lncRNA DLEU2 and miR-30a-5p expression in NSCLC was analysed by using fluorescence in situ hybridization and TCGA cohorts. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments as well as a NSCLC tumour model were executed to determine the role of lncRNA DLEU2 in NSCLC. DLEU2-sponged miR-30a-5p was verified by luciferase reporter, and RIP assays. Herein, the expression of lncRNA DLEU2 was elevated in NSCLC tissues, and its high expression or low expression of miR-30a-5p acted as an independent prognostic factor of poor survival and tumour recurrence in NSCLC. Silencing of lncRNA DLEU2 repressed the tumorigenesis and invasive potential of NSCLC, whereas re-expression of lncRNA DLEU2 showed the opposite effects. Furthermore, lncRNA DLEU2 harboured a negative correlation with miR-30a-5p expression in NSCLC tissues and acted as a sponge of miR-30a-5p, which reversed the tumour-promoting effects of lncRNA DLEU2 by targeting putative homeodomain transcription factor 2 in NSCLC. Altogether, lncRNA DLEU2 promoted the tumorigenesis and invasion of NSCLC by sponging miR-30a-5p.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Extensive previous studies have revealed the functions and ontogeny of murine B1 cells, but the properties of human B1 cells have just begun to be uncovered over the past decade. The phenotype of human B1 cells has recently been proposed, facilitating further studies. Here, we review the latest knowledge on human B1 cells, especially their ontogeny. A previous study using xenotransplantation models showed that human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) derived from cord blood or adult bone marrow can produce B1 cells in vivo. A recent study by our group reported that human B1 cells in peripheral blood are derived from adult HSCs and persist for approximately 3 years in situ. These findings suggest that adult human HSCs have the ability to produce B1 cells and contribute to maintenance of the adult B1 cell pool in peripheral blood. Further understanding of human B1 cell functions and ontogeny may elucidate the pathogenesis of B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases.",,"['Kageyama, Yuki', 'Katayama, Naoyuki']","['Kageyama Y', 'Katayama N']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0564-2227'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, 514-8507, Mie, Japan. ykageyama@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, 514-8507, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],['17K09923/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191112,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Fetal Blood', 'Genes, abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/immunology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/immunology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype']",['NOTNLM'],"['Hematopoietic stem cell', 'Human B1 cell', 'Ontogeny']",2019/11/14 06:00,2020/09/08 06:00,['2019/11/14 06:00'],"['2019/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02775-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02775-y [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 May;111(5):628-633. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02775-y.

These conditions are presumably associated with total-body irradiation-related acquired lipodystrophy and may lead to cardiovascular disease. Metreleptin (recombinant leptin) may help improve the lipoprotein profile, insulin sensitivity, and quality of life of patients with total-body irradiation-related lipodystrophy. This report describes the safe and effective use of metreleptin supplementation for insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in acquired incomplete lipodystrophy. A 24-year-old Japanese woman with diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia was admitted to our hospital. She was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia at 3 years of age and had undergone systemic chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before allogeneic stem cell transplantation. She was also diagnosed with hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes mellitus at 11 years of age. She had a low adiponectin level, low-normal leptin level, and diabetes mellitus with marked insulin resistance. Thus, acquired incomplete lipodystrophy was diagnosed. Her serum triglyceride and lipoprotein profiles improved within 1 month of treatment initiation. Glycemic metabolism and insulin sensitivity in the skeletal muscles improved after 6 months. As previously reported, metreleptin therapy is effective in improving lipid and glycemic profiles in generalized lipodystrophy. In the present case, we considered that metreleptin supplementation could reduce the remnant VLDL cholesterol fraction and improve diabetes mellitus. We conclude that it may be an effective alternative therapy for improving the expected prognosis of patients with acquired incomplete lipodystrophy, including childhood cancer survivors.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Endocrine Society.'],"['Nagayama, Ayako', 'Ashida, Kenji', 'Moritaka, Kanoko', 'Hidaka, Mami', 'Gobaru, Mizuki', 'Tanaka, Seiji', 'Hasuzawa, Nao', 'Akasu, Shoko', 'Goto, Yuka', 'Motomura, Seiichi', 'Hara, Kento', 'Tsuruta, Munehisa', 'Wada, Nobuhiko', 'Nakayama, Hitomi', 'Tajiri, Yuji', 'Nomura, Masatoshi']","['Nagayama A', 'Ashida K', 'Moritaka K', 'Hidaka M', 'Gobaru M', 'Tanaka S', 'Hasuzawa N', 'Akasu S', 'Goto Y', 'Motomura S', 'Hara K', 'Tsuruta M', 'Wada N', 'Nakayama H', 'Tajiri Y', 'Nomura M']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8753-6016'],"['Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Internal Medicine, Kurume Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Internal Medicine, Kurume Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20190916,United States,J Endocr Soc,Journal of the Endocrine Society,101697997,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood cancer survivors', 'diabetes mellitus', 'irradiation', 'leptin', 'lipodystrophy', 'transplantation']",2019/11/14 06:00,2019/11/14 06:01,['2019/11/14 06:00'],"['2019/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1210/js.2019-00251 [doi]', '201900251 [pii]']",epublish,J Endocr Soc. 2019 Sep 16;3(11):2179-2183. doi: 10.1210/js.2019-00251. eCollection 2019 Nov 1.,PMC6830041,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLs were not sensitive to AKT1 knockdown, which induced massive cell death in pAKT(high) DLBCL cell lines. Likewise, BL cell lines show low sensitivity to pan-AKT inhibitors. Moreover, hyper-activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway by overexpression of a constitutively active version of AKT (myrAKT) or knockdown of PTEN repressed the growth of BL cell lines. This was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, and downregulation of DZ genes including the proto-oncogene MYB and the DZ marker CXCR4. In contrast to GCB-DLBCL, PTEN overexpression was tolerated by BL cell lines. We conclude that the molecular mechanisms instrumental to guarantee the survival of normal DZ B cells, including the tight regulation of the PTEN-PI3K-AKT axis, also operate in the survival/proliferation of BL.",,"['Gehringer, Franziska', 'Weissinger, Stephanie Ellen', 'Moller, Peter', 'Wirth, Thomas', 'Ushmorov, Alexey']","['Gehringer F', 'Weissinger SE', 'Moller P', 'Wirth T', 'Ushmorov A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3724-7253'],"['Institute of Physiological Chemistry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiological Chemistry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. thomas.wirth@uni-ulm.de.', 'Institute of Physiological Chemistry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. alexey.ushmorov@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191112,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2019/11/14 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2019/11/14 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0628-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0628-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Mar;34(3):857-871. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0628-0.

We previously demonstrated that the adoptive transfer of donor CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) at the time of BMT prevents aGvHD in murine models. Yet, the therapeutic potential of donor Treg for the treatment of established aGvHD has not yet been studied in detail. We now used in vitro expanded phenotypically and functionally stable murine Treg to explore their therapeutic efficacy in haploidentical aGvHD models. Upon transfer donor Treg ameliorate clinical and histologic signs of aGvHD and significantly improve survival. They migrate to lymphoid as well as aGvHD target organs, predominantly the gastrointestinal tract, where they inhibit the proliferation of conventional T cells, reduce the influx of myeloid cells, and the accumulation of inflammatory cytokines. Successfully treated animals restore aGvHD-induced tissue damage in target organs and lymphoid tissues, thereby supporting lymphocyte reconstitution. The therapeutically applied Treg population survives long term without conversion into pathogenic effector T cells.

Number of mutations was higher in tAML vs. tMDS cases (median 19 vs 13 mutations, p = 0.05). Focusing on 24 genes commonly mutated in hematological malignancies, 19/25 (76%) patients were found to share mutations between AML and tMN, mostly affecting epigenetic modifiers (21/32; 66%), splicing factors (6/32; 19%), and chromatin modifiers (3/32; 9%). Analysis of remission samples identified 13 persisting mutations in 10/22 patients, affecting DNMT3A (n = 6), TET2 (n = 5), IDH1 and SRSF2 (n = 1, each). Comparison of cytogenetics revealed that 9/12 patients with a normal karyotype (NK) in AML harbored aberrations in tMN, four aberrant AML cases presented with NK in tMN, four other patients showed unrelated cytogenetic aberrations.

We evaluated 64 bone marrow samples from 55 patients with MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) obtained prior to (n = 46) or after (n = 18) therapy with hypomethylating agents (HMAs).

To evaluate whether WT1-mRNA expression yields additional prognostic information, we measured peripheral blood (PB) WT1-mRNA expression in 94 MDS using a standardized assay offering a validated cut-off to discriminate between normal and WT1-mRNA overexpression. Overall, 54 patients (57%) showed WT1-mRNA overexpression, while 40 patients (43%) had normal WT1-mRNA expression. This enabled discrimination between MDS and both healthy controls and non-MDS cytopenias. Furthermore, WT1-mRNA expression correlated with WHO 2016 subcategories and IPSS-R as indicated by mean WT1-mRNA expression and frequency of WT1-mRNA overexpressing patients within respective subgroups. Regarding the entire group, PB WT1-mRNA expression was associated with prognosis, as those patients showing WT1-mRNA overexpression had higher risk for disease progression and AML transformation and accordingly shorter progression-free, leukemia-free and overall survival in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, prognostic impact of PB WT1-mRNA expression status was independent of IPSS-R and enabled more precise prediction of PFS, but not OS, within IPSS-R very low/low and intermediate risk groups.

We aimed to broaden our understanding of the pathogenesis of this fusion through transcriptome profiling. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Available RNA from children and young adults with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML; N = 1,049) underwent transcriptome sequencing (mRNA and miRNA). Transcriptome profiles for those with the CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion (N = 24) and without (N = 1,025) were contrasted to define fusion-specific miRNAs, genes, and pathways. Clinical annotations defined distinct fusion-associated disease characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: The CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion was restricted to infants <3 years old (P < 0.001), and the presence of this fusion was highly associated with adverse outcome (P < 0.001) across all morphologic classifications. Further, there was a striking paucity of recurrent cooperating mutations, and transduction of cord blood stem cells with this fusion was sufficient for malignant transformation. CBFA2T3-GLIS2 positive cases displayed marked upregulation of genes with cell membrane/extracellular matrix localization potential, including NCAM1 and GABRE. Additionally, miRNA profiling revealed significant overexpression of mature miR-224 and miR-452, which are intronic miRNAs transcribed from the GABRE locus. Gene-set enrichment identified dysregulated Hippo, TGFbeta, and hedgehog signaling, as well as NCAM1 (CD56) interaction pathways. Therapeutic targeting of fusion-positive leukemic cells with CD56-directed antibody-drug conjugate caused significant cytotoxicity in leukemic blasts. CONCLUSIONS: The CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion defines a highly refractory entity limited to infants that appears to be sufficient for malignant transformation. Transcriptome profiling elucidated several highly targetable genes and pathways, including the identification of CD56, providing a highly plausible target for therapeutic intervention.",['(c)2019

Here, we analysed the structure of eleven peptides binders of BCRs expressed in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients in order to identify the chemical features required for cross-reactive binding to different CLL clonotypes. Four cross-reactive (CR) and seven no-cross-reactive (NCR) peptides were analysed by means of GRID molecular interaction fields, ligand-based pharmacophore and 3D-QSAR approaches. Based on pharmacophore model, two peptides were generated by specific amino acids substitutions of the parental NCR peptides; these new peptides resumed the common chemical features of CR peptides and bound the CLL BCR clonotypes recognized by CR peptides and parental NCR peptides. Thus, our computational approach guided the pharmacophore modelling of CR peptides.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study consisted of 255 newly diagnosed patients with CML who received imatinib. Molecular response was analyzed at 3 and 6 months from the start of the treatment and then every 6 months, and long-term outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), were evaluated. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 34.8 months (range, 3-84 months, (the OS and PFS at 7 years were 94.3% and 92.9%, respectively. Eighty-four-month PFS rates in patients with a BCR-ABLIS </= 10% at 3 months and BCR-ABLIS </= 1% at 6 months were significantly higher than patients who did not obtain these levels of BCR-ABL transcripts (P = .004 and P < .0001, respectively). The proportion of patients who achieved major molecular response (MMR) was 44.1%, 52.97%, and 60.75% at 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. At 12, 18, and 84 months, the PFS rates in patients who achieved MMR were significantly higher than in patients who did not achieve MMR (P = .002, P < .0001, and P = .003, respectively).

Apelin and apela (ELABELA/ELA/Toddler) are two peptide ligands for a class A G-protein coupled receptor called apelin receptor. Studies have shown that ELA inhibits apoptosis by inhibiting apoptotic proteins and activating anti-apoptotic proteins. Proteins and genes involved in apoptosis are valuable for targeted cancer therapy. We hypothesized that serum levels may be increased in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia based on the antiapoptotic effect of ELA. We compared serum ELABELA levels of healthy volunteers and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We aimed to draw attention to a new molecule worthy of research in targeted cancer treatment. METHODS: Forty two untreated CLL patients and 41 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Serum ELA levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Dhanghai Sunred Biological Technology co. Ltd), automated ELISA reader (Thermo Scientific, FINLAND) and computer program (Scanlt for Multiscan F.C.2.5.1) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical analysis was done by Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows 20 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) ve MedCalc programs. ELA and variables related to CLL were correlated with Spearman correlation anlysis test. ROC analysis and Youden index method were used to determine a cut off point for ELA. All p-values were 2-sided with statistical significance at 0.05 alpha levels. RESULTS: In our study, we found that serum ELA levels were significantly higher in patients with CLL. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that ELA targeting may be a potential therapeutic option for treating CLL.",,"['Acik, Didar Yanardag', 'Bankir, Mehmet', 'Baylan, Filiz Alkan', 'Aygun, Bilal']","['Acik DY', 'Bankir M', 'Baylan FA', 'Aygun B']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7282-0188'],"['Department of Internal Medicine and Haematology, Adana City Education and Research Hospital, Mithat Ozsan Bulvari Kisla Mah. 4522 Sok.

RNA interference is a promising therapy in oncology, especially for refractory acute leukaemia. In this study, we delivered MLAA-34 siRNA into AML-M5 THP-1 cells using CpG(B)-MLAA-34 siRNA conjugates, in the absence of any other transfection reagent. The uptake efficiency and the rate of apoptosis were measured by using flow cytometry. The level of relevant mRNAs was measured by quantitative PCR. THP-1 cell invasion was assessed by transwell assay. Protein expression was analysed by western blotting. The spleen and liver of AML-M5 nude mice were measured and weighted after euthanisation. Spleen sections were analysed by immunohistochemistry. We found that MLAA-34 siRNA was successfully delivered into THP-1 cells and induced MLAA-34 gene silencing via the blockade of JAK2/STAT3 and Wnt/-catenin signalling pathways. In addition, CpG(B)-MLAA-34 siRNA upregulated Gsk3beta protein expression, resulting in retraining of the JAK2/STAT3 and Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathways. Importantly, CpG(B)-MLAA-34 siRNA reduced the survival and invasiveness of THP-1 cells. We further demonstrated that CAB39L was effectively downregulated by CpG(B)-MLAA-34 siRNA in vivo.

While MCL1 is an anti-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family proteins, MDM2 is an important cellular inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor. The key oncogene in AML is the FLT3 growth factor receptor gene. FLT3 signaling pathways including the MAPK cascade (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) are highly active in AML cells, leading to induced protein translation and cell proliferation as well as reduced apoptosis. Consequently, combined administration of MCL1-, MDM2-, and MEK-inhibitors may present a promising anti-leukemic treatment strategy. Here, we assessed the MCL1-antagonist S63845, the MDM2-inhibitor HDM201, and the MEK1/2-inhibitor trametinib as single agents and in combination in a variety of AML cell lines and mononuclear cells isolated from patients with hematological malignancies centered on myeloid leukemia, some lymphatic leukemia, as well as some lymphomas, for their ability to induce apoptosis and cell death. We observed a considerably varying anti-leukemic efficacy of the MCL1-inhibitor S63845 and the MEK1/2-inhibitor trametinib. Hematological cells with susceptibility to the single compounds as well as to the combined treatment were defined by elevated MCL1- and MEK-protein levels, independent of the mutational status of FLT3 and TP53. Our data indicate that hematological cells with elevated MCL1- and MEK-protein levels are most sensitive to the combined treatment with S63845 and trametinib.

The importance of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as an AML tumor suppressor is emerging. Therefore, here, we examined the potential role of endogenous PP2A inhibitor proteins as biomarkers predicting AML relapse in a standard patient population by using three independent patient materials: cohort1 (n = 80), cohort2 (n = 48) and The Cancer Genome Atlas Acute Myeloid Leukemia (TCGA LAML) dataset (n = 160). Out of the examined PP2A inhibitors (CIP2A, SET, PME1, ARPP19 and TIPRL), expression of ARPP19 mRNA was found to be independent of the current AML risk classification. Functionally, ARPP19 promoted AML cell viability and expression of oncoproteins MYC, CDK1, and CIP2A. Clinically, ARPP19 mRNA expression was significantly lower at diagnosis (p = 0.035) in patients whose disease did not relapse after standard chemotherapy. ARPP19 was an independent predictor for relapse both in univariable (p = 0.007) and in multivariable analyses (p = 0.0001) and gave additive information to EVI1 expression and risk group status (additive effect, p = 0.005).

Although current approaches to methylome analysis have been helpful in revealing an epigenetic influence in major human diseases, this type of analysis has proven inadequate for the translation of these advances to clinical diagnostics. As in any clinical test, the use of a methylation signal for diagnostic purposes requires the estimation of an optimal cutoff value for the signal, which is necessary to discriminate a signal induced by a disease state from natural background variation. To address this issue, we propose the application of a fundamental signal detection theory and machine learning approaches. Simulation studies and tests of two available methylome datasets from autism and leukemia patients demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in clinical diagnostics, providing high discriminatory power for the methylation signal induced by disease, as well as high classification performance. Specifically, the analysis of whole biomarker genomic regions could suffice for a diagnostic, markedly decreasing its cost.",,"['Sanchez, Robersy', 'Yang, Xiaodong', 'Maher, Thomas', 'Mackenzie, Sally A']","['Sanchez R', 'Yang X', 'Maher T', 'Mackenzie SA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5246-1453', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4971-2362']","['Departments of Biology and Plant Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.', 'Departments of Biology and Plant Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.', 'Departments of Biology and Plant Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.', 'Departments of Biology and Plant Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM134056/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'OPP1088661/Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation', 'R01 GM134056-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20191027,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Autistic Disorder/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Computer Simulation', '*DNA Methylation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Pregnancy']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'autism', 'clinical diagnostic', 'leukemia', 'machine learning', 'signal detection']",2019/11/14 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2019/11/14 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20215343 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20215343 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Oct 27;20(21). pii: ijms20215343. doi: 10.3390/ijms20215343.,PMC6862328,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploiting this finding for a possible therapeutic approach has showed efficacy in various solid and hematologic tumors, though not specifically tested in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: The efficacy of the combination between WEE1 and CHK1 inhibitors in B and T cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B/T-ALL) was evaluated in vitro and ex vivo studies. The efficacy of the therapeutic strategy was tested in terms of cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis, and changes in cell cycle profile and protein expression using B/T-ALL cell lines. In addition, the efficacy of the drug combination was studied in primary B-ALL blasts using clonogenic assays. RESULTS: This study reports, for the first time, the efficacy of the concomitant inhibition of CHK1/CHK2 and WEE1 in ALL cell lines and primary leukemic B-ALL cells using two selective inhibitors: PF-0047736 (CHK1/CHK2 inhibitor) and AZD-1775 (WEE1 inhibitor). We showed strong synergism in the reduction of cell viability, proliferation and induction of apoptosis. The efficacy of the combination was related to the induction of early S-phase arrest and to the induction of DNA damage, ultimately triggering cell death. We reported evidence that the efficacy of the combination treatment is independent from the activation of the p53-p21 pathway. Moreover, gene expression analysis on B-ALL primary samples showed that Chek1 and Wee1 are significantly co-expressed in samples at diagnosis (Pearson r = 0.5770, p = 0.0001) and relapse (Pearson r= 0.8919; p = 0.0001). Finally, the efficacy of the combination was confirmed by the reduction in clonogenic survival of primary leukemic B-ALL cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the combination of CHK1 and WEE1 inhibitors may be a promising therapeutic strategy to be tested in clinical trials for adult ALL.",,"['Ghelli Luserna Di Rora, Andrea', 'Bocconcelli, Matteo', 'Ferrari, Anna', 'Terragna, Carolina', 'Bruno, Samantha', 'Imbrogno, Enrica', 'Beeharry, Neil', 'Robustelli, Valentina', 'Ghetti, Martina', 'Napolitano, Roberta', 'Chirumbolo, Gabriella', 'Marconi, Giovanni', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Sartor, Chiara', 'Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Yen, Timothy J', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Ghelli Luserna Di Rora A', 'Bocconcelli M', 'Ferrari A', 'Terragna C', 'Bruno S', 'Imbrogno E', 'Beeharry N', 'Robustelli V', 'Ghetti M', 'Napolitano R', 'Chirumbolo G', 'Marconi G', 'Papayannidis C', 'Paolini S', 'Sartor C', 'Simonetti G', 'Yen TJ', 'Martinelli G']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9495-8388', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6954-969X']","['Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, 47014 Meldola, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. e A.

MLL-R leukemias are uniquely dependent on the epigenetic function of the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L, which is misdirected by MLL-FPs activating gene expression, driving transformation and leukemogenesis. Given the functional necessity of these leukemias to maintain adequate methylation potential allowing aberrant activating histone methylation to proceed, driving leukemic gene expression, we investigated perturbation of methionine (Met)/S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism as a novel therapeutic paradigm for MLL-R leukemia. Disruption of Met/SAM metabolism, by either methionine deprivation or pharmacologic inhibition of downstream metabolism, reduced overall cellular methylation potential, reduced relative cell numbers, and induced apoptosis selectively in established MLL-AF4 cell lines or MLL-AF6-expressing patient blasts but not in BCR-ABL-driven K562 cells. Global histone methylation dynamics were altered, with a profound loss of requisite H3K79 methylation, indicating inhibition of DOT1L function. Relative occupancy of the repressive H3K27me3 modification was increased at the DOT1L promoter in MLL-R cells, and DOT1L mRNA and protein expression was reduced.

In signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, SH2 domain interactions are critical for molecular activation and nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated STAT dimers to drive transcription. Sequencing analysis of patient samples has revealed the SH2 domain as a hotspot in the mutational landscape of STAT proteins although the functional impact for the vast majority of these mutations remains poorly characterized. Despite several well resolved structures for SH2 domain-containing proteins, structural data regarding the distinctive STAT-type SH2 domain is limited. Here, we review the unique features of STAT-type SH2 domains in the context of all currently reported STAT3 and STAT5 SH2 domain clinical mutations. The genetic volatility of specific regions in the SH2 domain can result in either activating or deactivating mutations at the same site in the domain, underscoring the delicate evolutionary balance of wild type STAT structural motifs in maintaining precise levels of cellular activity.

In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) it is commonly used in combination with rituximab (BR protocol) both in the first-line as well as subsequent lines of therapy, and in clinical trials it is often combined with new targeted therapies. Therefore, the data on its real-life safety and efficacy are of clinical significance. As the Polish Lymphoma Research Group (PLRG), we retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and tolerability of bendamustine monotherapy in 96 patients with CLL. The median number of bendamustine cycles was 5, and 44 patients did not complete the planned 6 cycles (46%). Among the adverse events associated with the earlier termination of bendamustine treatment, infections were the most common (20.5%), followed by neutropenia (15.9%) and thrombocytopenia (15.9%). Dose reductions and/or delays occurred in 31% of treatment cycles (132 of 425) with neutropenia (17.9%) as the most frequent cause. Efficacy analysis showed an overall response rate of 88.2% with complete remission and partial remission achieved in 43.8 and 41.7% of patients, respectively. At the 24th month of follow-up, progression-free survival was 52% and overall survival was 69.7%. Bendamustine in monotherapy was found to be safe and efficacious, at least in terms of early response. Special attention should be paid to infectious complications, and especially that immune disorders are characteristic in the clinical course of CLL. Our observations suggest efforts must be made to ensure the proper timing and proper dose in the administration of the drug, and to avoid the premature termination of the treatment.","['(c) 2019 S.

Several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with thromboembolism in the general population; however, their impact in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, particularly in children, remains uncertain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected constitutional DNA and prospectively registered thromboembolic events in 1252 patients, 1-45years, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia included in the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol in the Nordic and Baltic countries (7/2008-7/2016). Based on previously published data and a priori power calculations, we selected four single nucleotide polymorphisms: F5 rs6025, F11 rs2036914, FGG rs2066865, and ABO rs8176719. RESULTS: The 2.5year cumulative incidence of thromboembolism was 7.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.6-8.5). F11 rs2036914 was associated with thromboembolism (hazard ratio (HR) 1.52, 95%CI 1.11-2.07) and there was a borderline significant association for FGG rs2066865 (HR 1.37, 95%CI 0.99-1.91), but no association for ABO rs8176719 or F5 rs6025 in multiple cox regression. A genetic risk score based on F11 rs2036914 and FGG rs2066865 was associated with thromboembolism (HR 1.45 per risk allele, 95%CI 1.15-1.81), the association was strongest in adolescents 10.0-17.9years (HR 1.64). CONCLUSION: If validated, a F11 rs2036914/FGG rs2066865 risk prediction model should be tested as a stratification tool for prevention of thromboembolism in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We retrospectively analyzed the effects of HLA allele matching at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 in cord blood transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. In multivariate analysis, overall survival (OS) significantly deteriorated in the 4-allele or higher mismatch in pediatric cases (hazard ratio, 1.8 for 4/8 match [reference, 6/8 match] and 2.85 for 3-1/8 match) and the 5-allele or higher mismatch in adult cases (hazard ratio, 1.23 for 3-0/8 match). Incidence of grade to acute graft-versus-host disease was low in the 8/8 match and 1-allele mismatch in pediatric cases (hazard ratio, 0.19 for 8/8 match and 0.41 for 7/8 match) and the 8/8 match in adult cases (hazard ratio, 0.41 for 8/8 match). On the other hand, a higher incidence of relapse was noted in the 8/8 match in adults (hazard ratio, 1.53). The incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment decreased in the 3-allele or higher mismatch in adults. In subgroup analysis of graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in adult cases, a deteriorating effect on OS of HLA 5-allele or higher mismatch was more significant in cases with calcineurin inhibitor with methotrexate than with mycophenolate mofetil.

Objective: To assess the association of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with improvement in cardiac function, as well as clinical improvement in patients with chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiomyopathy was an uncontrolled, prospective, cohort study conducted between November 21, 2014, and June 21, 2018, at 12 tertiary centers with cardio-oncology programs in the United States. Thirty patients were implanted with CRT owing to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF</=35%), New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure symptoms, and wide QRS complex, with established chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy and were followed up for 6 months after CRT implantation. The date of final follow-up was February 6, 2019. Exposures: CRT implantation according to standard of care. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was change in LVEF from baseline to 6 months after initiating CRT. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and change in left ventricular end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume. Results: Among 30 patients who were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 64 [11] years; 26 women [87%]; 73% had a history of breast cancer; 20% had a history of lymphoma or leukemia), primary end point data were available for 26 patients and secondary end point data were available for 23 patients. Patients had nonischemic cardiomyopathy with left bundle branch block, median LVEF of 29%, and a mean QRS duration of 152 ms. Patients with CRT experienced a statistically significant improvement in mean LVEF at 6 months from 28% to 39% (difference, 10.6% [95% CI, 8.0%-13.3%]; P < .001). This was accompanied by a reduction in LV end-systolic volume from 122.7 to 89.0 mL (difference, 37.0 mL [95% CI, 28.2-45.8]) and reduction in LV end-diastolic volume from 171.0 to 143.2 mL (difference, 31.9 mL [95% CI, 22.1-41.6]) (both P < .001). Adverse events included a procedure-related pneumothorax (1 patient), a device pocket infection (1 patient), and heart failure requiring hospitalization during follow-up (1 patient). Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary study of patients with chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy, CRT was associated with improvement in LVEF after 6 months. The findings are limited by the small sample size, short follow-up, and absence of a control group.

Here, we focus on strategies to modify microbiota composition and function in patients with cancer. First, we evaluate the use of fecal microbiota transplant to restore microbial equilibrium following perturbation by antibiotics and chemotherapy, and as a treatment of complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), such as graft-versus-host disease and colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms. We then address the potential use of both probiotics and dietary prebiotic compounds in targeted modulation of the microbiota intended to improve outcomes in hematologic diseases. With each type of therapy, we highlight the role that abnormal, or dysbiotic, microbiota play in disease, treatment efficacy, and toxicity and evaluate their potential promise as emerging strategies for microbiota manipulation in patients with hematologic malignancies and in those undergoing HSCT.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Severyn, Christopher J', 'Brewster, Ryan', 'Andermann, Tessa M']","['Severyn CJ', 'Brewster R', 'Andermann TM']",,"[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford, CA."", 'School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA; and.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.']",['eng'],"['KL2 TR001083/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK098132/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001085/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Clinical Decision-Making', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Fecal Microbiota Transplantation', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/etiology/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Infections/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', '*Microbiota', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Probiotics/therapeutic use', 'Translational Research, Biomedical', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2019/11/13 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/11/13 06:00'],"['2019/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['422753 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000365 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Nov 12;3(21):3461-3472. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000365.,PMC6855120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robust molecular prognostic biomarkers need to be developed to improve clinical decision making for patients with MDS with thrombocytopenia. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) and preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) are promising immunogenic antigen candidates for immunotherapy, and their clinical effects on patients with MDS with thrombocytopenia are still not well understood. We performed a multicenter observational study of adult patients with MDS with thrombocytopenia from 7 different tertiary medical centers in China. We examined bone marrow samples collected at diagnosis for WT1 and PRAME transcript levels and then analyzed their prognostic effect for patients with MDS with thrombocytopenia. In total, we enrolled 1110 patients diagnosed with MDS with thrombocytopenia. Overexpression of WT1 and PRAME was associated with elevated blast percentage, worse cytogenetics, and higher Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) risk. Further, both WT1 and PRAME overexpression were independent poor prognostic factors for acute myeloid leukemia evolution, overall survival, and progression-free survival. Together, the 2 genes overexpression identified a population of patients with MDS with substantially worse survival. On the basis of WT1 and PRAME transcript levels, patients with MDS with IPSS-R low risk were classified into 2 significantly divergent prognostic risk groups: a low-favorable group and a low-adverse group. The low-adverse group had survival similar to that of patients in the intermediate-risk group.

Published studies have had insufficient numbers to: (1) compare the prognostic value of pre-HCT and post-HCT MRD; (2) determine clinical factors post-HCT associated with better outcomes in MRD+ patients; and (3) use MRD and other clinical factors to develop and validate a prognostic model for relapse in pediatric patients with ALL who undergo allogeneic HCT. To address these issues, we assembled an international database including sibling (n = 191), unrelated (n = 259), mismatched (n = 56), and cord blood (n = 110) grafts given after myeloablative conditioning. Although high and very high MRD pre-HCT were significant predictors in univariate analysis, with bivariate analysis using MRD pre-HCT and post-HCT, MRD pre-HCT at any level was less predictive than even low-level MRD post-HCT. Patients with MRD pre-HCT must become MRD low/negative at 1 to 2 months and negative within 3 to 6 months after HCT for successful therapy. Factors associated with improved outcome of patients with detectable MRD post-HCT included acute graft-versus-host disease. We derived a risk score with an MRD cohort from Europe, North America, and Australia using negative predictive characteristics (late disease status, non-total body irradiation regimen, and MRD [high, very high]) defining good, intermediate, and poor risk groups with 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse of 21%, 38%, and 47%, respectively. We validated the score in a second, more contemporaneous cohort and noted 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse of 13%, 26%, and 47% (P < .001) for the defined risk groups.",,"['Bader, Peter', 'Salzmann-Manrique, Emilia', 'Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Dalle, Jean-Hugues', 'Woolfrey, Ann E', 'Bar, Merav', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Shah, Nirali N', 'Gossai, Nathan', 'Shaw, Peter J', 'Chen, Allen R', 'Schultz, Kirk R', 'Kreyenberg, Hermann', 'Di Maio, Lucia', 'Cazzaniga, Gianni', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Lankester, Arjan', 'Peters, Christina', 'Klingebiel, Thomas E', 'Willasch, Andre M', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Pulsipher, Michael A']","['Bader P', 'Salzmann-Manrique E', 'Balduzzi A', 'Dalle JH', 'Woolfrey AE', 'Bar M', 'Verneris MR', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Shah NN', 'Gossai N', 'Shaw PJ', 'Chen AR', 'Schultz KR', 'Kreyenberg H', 'Di Maio L', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Eckert C', 'van der Velden VHJ', 'Sutton R', 'Lankester A', 'Peters C', 'Klingebiel TE', 'Willasch AM', 'Grupp SA', 'Pulsipher MA']",,"['Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Department for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Department for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Clinica Pediatrica, Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Immunology, Hopital Robert Debre and Paris-Diderot University, Paris, France.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Pathology, John Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', ""BMT Services, Sydney Children's Hospital Network, Westmead, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Department for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Clinica Pediatrica, Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Clinica Pediatrica, Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', ""Charite University Medical Center Berlin, Children's Hospital, Berlin, Germany."", 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""School of Women's and Children's Health, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Randwick, NSW, Australia."", ""Willem-Alexander Children's Hospital, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands."", ""St Anna Children's Hospital, Universitatsklinik fur Kinder und Jugendheilkunde, Medizinische Universitat Wien, Vienna, Austria."", 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Department for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Department for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', ""Pediatric Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA;

MCL is a mature B-cell lymphoma that characteristically expresses cyclin D1, which has been used as a diagnostic tumor marker. SOX11 has also recently emerged as a tumor marker for MCL, particularly in cyclin D1-negative MCLs and to distinguish between MCLs and other cyclin D1-positive lymphomas. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of SOX11 immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of MCL using a meta-analysis. A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane library through May 9, 2018. In total, 14 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve calculated from the summary receiver operator characteristic were 0.9, 0.95, and 0.934, respectively. Effect sizes of log positive likelihood ratios, log negative likelihood ratios, and log diagnostic odds ratios were 2.67, -2.12, and 5.27, respectively. Statistically significant substantial heterogeneity was observed for specificity (I2 = 95%), but not for sensitivity. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to explain the heterogeneity in specificity and showed that the proportions of Burkitt's lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and hairy cell leukemia were significant covariates among studies using rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Overall, this meta-analysis showed that SOX11 was a useful diagnostic marker for MCL, with the clone MRQ-58 mouse monoclonal antibody showing particularly robust performance.",,"['Lee, Woojoo', 'Shin, Eun', 'Kim, Bo-Hyung', 'Kim, Hyunchul']","['Lee W', 'Shin E', 'Kim BH', 'Kim H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9322-725X'],"['Department of Statistics, Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital, Hwaseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine and Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science and Technology, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital, Hwaseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191112,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (SOX11 protein, human)', '0 (SOXC Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Publication Bias', 'ROC Curve', 'Regression Analysis', 'SOXC Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",,,2019/11/13 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2019/11/13 06:00'],"['2019/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0225096 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-19834 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Nov 12;14(11):e0225096. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0225096. eCollection 2019.,PMC6850764,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Low testosterone in cancer survivors can be due to orchidectomy or effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We have undertaken a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial of testosterone replacement in young male cancer survivors with borderline low testosterone (7-12 nmol/l). METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a multicentre United Kingdom study conducted in secondary care hospital outpatients. Male survivors of testicular cancer, lymphoma, and leukaemia aged 25-50 years with morning total serum testosterone 7-12 nmol/l were recruited. A total of 136 men were randomised between July 2012 and February 2015 (42.6% aged 25-37 years, 57.4% 38-50 years, 88% testicular cancer, 10% lymphoma, matched for body mass index [BMI]). Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive testosterone (Tostran 2% gel) or placebo for 26 weeks. A dose titration was performed after 2 weeks. The coprimary end points were trunk fat mass and SF36 Physical Functioning score (SF36-PF) at 26 weeks by intention to treat. At 26 weeks, testosterone treatment compared with placebo was associated with decreased trunk fat mass (-0.9 kg, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.3, p = 0.0073), decreased whole-body fat mass (-1.8 kg, 95% CI -2.9 to -0.7, p = 0.0016), and increased lean body mass (1.5 kg, 95% CI 0.9-2.1, p < 0.001). Decrease in fat mass was greatest in those with a high truncal fat mass at baseline. There was no treatment effect on SF36-PF or any other QoL scores. Testosterone treatment was well tolerated. The limitations of our study were as follows: a relatively short duration of treatment, only three cancer groups included, and no hard end point data such as cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: In young male cancer survivors with low-normal morning total serum testosterone, replacement with testosterone is associated with an improvement in body composition.

The high specificity and precision of PPI measurements made it possible to reveal detailed mechanisms of intermolecular interactions. However, protein aggregation due to specific or nonspecific interactions is among the most challenging problems in PPI examination. Here, we propose a strategy of a parallel DNA circuit to probe PPI using single-molecule magnetic tweezers. In contrast to PPI examination using atomic force microscopy, microspheres as probes used in magnetic tweezers avoided the single-probe issue of a cantilever. Negatively charged DNA as a linker circumvented the severe aggregation in the PPI construct with a protein linker. The unnatural amino acid encoded in proteins of interest expanded the choices of biorthogonal conjugation. We demonstrated how to apply our strategy to probe the PPI between the PHD3-Bromo and the histone H3 methylated at K4, a critical epigenetic event in leukemia development. We found a rupture force of 12 pN for breaking the PPI, which is much higher than that required to peel DNA off from a nucleosome, 3 pN. We expect that our methods will make PPI measurements of mechanics and kinetics with great precision, facilitating PPI-related research, e.g., PPI-targeted drug discovery.",,"['Ma, Xiaofeng', 'Zhu, Manning', 'Liu, Jianyu', 'Li, Xu', 'Qu, Lihua', 'Liang, Lin', 'Huang, Wei', 'Wang, Junli', 'Li, Ning', 'Chen, Jun-Hu', 'Zhang, Wenke', 'Yu, Zhongbo']","['Ma X', 'Zhu M', 'Liu J', 'Li X', 'Qu L', 'Liang L', 'Huang W', 'Wang J', 'Li N', 'Chen JH', 'Zhang W', 'Yu Z']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4569-6035', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0634-554X']","['State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy , Nankai University , 38 Tongyan Rd , Tianjin 300353 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy , Nankai University , 38 Tongyan Rd , Tianjin 300353 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry , Jilin University , Changchun 130012 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy , Nankai University , 38 Tongyan Rd , Tianjin 300353 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy , Nankai University , 38 Tongyan Rd , Tianjin 300353 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy , Nankai University , 38 Tongyan Rd , Tianjin 300353 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy , Nankai University , 38 Tongyan Rd , Tianjin 300353 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy , Nankai University , 38 Tongyan Rd , Tianjin 300353 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy , Nankai University , 38 Tongyan Rd , Tianjin 300353 , China.', 'National Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, WHO Collaborating Center for Tropical Diseases, National Center for International Research on Tropical Diseases , Key Laboratory of Parasite and Vector Biology, Ministry of Health , Shanghai 200025 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry , Jilin University , Changchun 130012 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Pharmacy , Nankai University , 38 Tongyan Rd , Tianjin 300353 , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191115,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (histone H3 trimethyl Lys4)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.14.11.29 (EGLN3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.29 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Proline Dioxygenases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Proline Dioxygenases', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Magnetics/*methods', 'Methods', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Nanotechnology/*methods', 'Protein Binding']",,,2019/11/13 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2019/11/13 06:00'],"['2019/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00665 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2019 Dec 18;30(12):2998-3006. doi: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00665.

In this study, we designed highly hydrophobic cationic lipopolymers by grafting cholesterol (Chol) onto low-molecular weight (0.6, 1.2, and 2.0 kDa) polyethylenimines (PEIs) to enable specific siRNA therapy to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. The siRNA binding by PEI-Chol led to nano-sized (100-200 nm diameter) polyplexes with enhanced zeta-potential (+20 to +35 mV) and ability to protect the loaded siRNA completely in fresh serum. The siRNA delivery to CML (K562) cells was proportional to degree of substitution and, unexpectedly, inversely proportional to molecular size of the polymeric backbone. Chol grafting with as little as ~1.0 Chol/PEI on 0.6 and 1.2 kDa PEIs enabled silencing of the reporter Green Fluorescent Protein gene as well as the endogenous BCR-Abl oncogene in K562 cells. The PEI-Chol mediated delivery of siRNAs specific for BCR-Abl and KSP genes significantly arrested the growth the cells which was significantly reflected in colony formation potency of K562 cells. BCR-Able siRNA mediated therapeutic efficacy was also observed in significantly increased caspase activity and apoptosis of K562 cells. Thus, Chol-grafted low-molecular weight PEIs appear to be unique siRNA carriers to realize the molecular therapy in CML cells.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Remant, K C', 'Thapa, Bindu', 'Valencia-Serna, Juliana', 'Domun, Suraj S', 'Dimitroff, Cailean', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Uludag, Hasan']","['Remant KC', 'Thapa B', 'Valencia-Serna J', 'Domun SS', 'Dimitroff C', 'Jiang X', 'Uludag H']",,"['Department of Chemical & Material Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Chemical & Material Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Chemical & Material Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Chemical & Material Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191126,United States,J Biomed Mater Res A,Journal of biomedical materials research.

The progression of AML can be regulated by estrogenic signals. Our present data showed that an industrial endocrine-disrupting chemical, bisphenol A (BPA), can promote the proliferation of AML cells and decrease their sensitivity to daunorubicin and cytarabine treatment. Among the tested cytokines, BPA treatment can decrease the expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) while increasing the expression of IL-6. Overexpression of IL-4 or neutralization antibody of IL-6 (anti-IL-6) can attenuate BPA-induced proliferation of AML cells and reverse BPA-suppressed chemosensitivity. Furthermore, activation of nuclear factor kappa B is essential for BPA-induced upregulation of IL-6 in AML cells. As to IL-4, BPA can increase the expression of NFAT1 to inhibit its transcription. Collectively, our data showed that BPA can trigger the malignancy of AML cells via regulation of IL-4 and IL-6.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Zhang, Suwei', 'Li, Jiazhen', 'Fan, Jingru', 'Wu, Xianheng']","['Zhang S', 'Li J', 'Fan J', 'Wu X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8407-7520'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shantou Central Hospital, Shantou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shantou Central Hospital, Shantou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Emergency, Shantou Central Hospital, Shantou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Radiology, Shantou Central Hospital, Shantou, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191112,United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Benzhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Estrogens, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (IL4 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (NFATC2 protein, human)', '0 (Phenols)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'MLT3645I99 (bisphenol A)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Neutralizing/*immunology', 'Benzhydryl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Estrogens, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/immunology/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BPA', 'IL-4', 'IL-6', 'proliferation']",2019/11/13 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/11/13 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.22412 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2020 Jan;34(1):e22412. doi: 10.1002/jbt.22412.

In the current study, the authors evaluated the prevalence and risk factors of diabetes mellitus among clinically assessed adult survivors of childhood ALL METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective evaluation of data from survivors of ALL and community controls who were enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study between October 1, 2007, and June 30, 2016. Participants were adults with >/=10 years of survival of childhood ALL and community controls who completed clinical and laboratory evaluations. Data for the current analysis were abstracted from medical records. Exposures evaluated herein included chemotherapy and radiation exposures and medical history, including drug-induced diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Of 1360 eligible adults who were >/=10-year survivors of childhood ALL, a total of 1044 completed the evaluations; these individuals had a mean age of 33.97+/-9.14 years and 50.86% were male. The 368 controls, 45.65% of whom were male, had a mean age of 35.33+/-10.21 years. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was found in approximately 7.47% of survivors and 3.80% of controls (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.11-3.87). In adjusted models, among survivors, older age (OR, 1.05 for each additional year; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08), body mass index >/=30 kg/m(2) (OR, 7.40; 95% CI, 2.61-20.97), and drug-induced diabetes mellitus occurring during ALL therapy (OR, 4.67; 95% CI, 2.53-8.61) were found to be associated with T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: Adult survivors of childhood ALL are at an increased risk of T2DM. Adult survivors of childhood ALL who are of older age, with an overweight or obese body mass index, and/or who developed drug-induced diabetes mellitus during treatment should be closely monitored for T2DM during long-term follow-up.",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],"['Williams, Hannah E', 'Howell, Carrie R', 'Chemaitilly, Wassim', 'Wilson, Carmen L', 'Karol, Seth E', 'Nolan, Vikki G', 'Smeltzer, Matthew P', 'Green, Daniel M', 'Ehrhardt, Matthew J', 'Mulrooney, Daniel A', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Ness, Kirsten K']","['Williams HE', 'Howell CR', 'Chemaitilly W', 'Wilson CL', 'Karol SE', 'Nolan VG', 'Smeltzer MP', 'Green DM', 'Ehrhardt MJ', 'Mulrooney DA', 'Pui CH', 'Hudson MM', 'Robison LL', 'Ness KK']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2082-7211', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6554-6237', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7636-065X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8113-8180', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5156-5410', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2781-9983', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0303-5658', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2084-1507']","['Color Genomics Inc, Burlingame, California.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Endocrinology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA195547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191112,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*childhood', '*diabetes', '*survivor']",2019/11/13 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2019/11/13 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32596 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Feb 15;126(4):870-878. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32596.

METHODS: On the basis of clinical data from a randomized phase 3 trial, a time-dependent Markov model with 4 health states (complete remission, relapse or treatment failure, post-treatment failure, and death) was used to evaluate the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the ATO plus ATRA regimen compared with the ATRA plus chemotherapy (CT) regimen over a 30-year period. All costs were adjusted to 2018 levels based on the Chinese Consumer Price Index. Both costs and health outcomes were discounted by 3% annually. One-way sensitivity analysis and probability sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: Compared with the ATRA plus CT strategy, the ATO plus ATRA strategy was associated with 1.38 additional QALYs gained and $392.05 (estimated in 2018 US dollars) in incremental costs per patient over 30 years. Consequently, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $284.02 per QALY gained, which was far below the Chinese willingness-to-pay threshold of $29,306 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of these results. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the Chinese health care system, the ATO plus ATRA strategy is cost-effective for patients with newly diagnosed APL compared with the ATRA plus CT strategy.

However, long-term treatment with TKIs is associated with serious adverse events including both bleeding and thromboembolism. Experimental studies have shown that TKIs can cause platelet dysfunction. Herein, we present the first side-by-side investigation comparing the effects of currently used TKIs on platelet function and thrombin generation when used in clinically relevant concentrations. A flow cytometry multiparameter protocol was used to study a range of significant platelet activation events (fibrinogen receptor activation, alpha granule, and lysosomal exocytosis, procoagulant membrane exposure, and mitochondrial permeability changes). In addition, thrombin generation was measured in the presence of TKIs to assess the effects on global hemostasis. Results show that dasatinib generally inhibited platelet function, while bosutinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib showed less consistent effects. In addition to these general trends for each TKI, we observed a large degree of interindividual variability in the effects of the different TKIs. Interindividual variation was also observed when blood from CML patients was studied ex vivo with whole blood platelet aggregometry, free oscillation rheometry (FOR), and flow cytometry. Based on the donor responses in the side-by-side TKI study, a TKI sensitivity map was developed. We propose that such a sensitivity map could potentially become a valuable tool to help in decision-making regarding the choice of suitable TKIs for a CML patient with a history of bleeding or atherothrombotic disease.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

AIMS: To elucidate whether the myth of vampire victims follows the course of disease of acute leukaemia. METHOD: We studied three classical vampire novels published 1819-1897, focusing on 8 victims and their symptoms. The novels were chosen based on their iconic status in classic vampire literature, which defined the vampire genre and the symptoms of the victims for many years. The symptoms and course of disease following vampire attacks described in these novels were then compared with symptoms commonly seen in untreated acute leukaemia and other contemporary disorders. RESULTS: The earliest novel (1819) did not provide a sufficient description of any symptoms in detail; however, the later novels (1872 and 1897) both provided elaborate portrayals of symptoms and course of the disease. The patients studied were all factitious-explaining the variation in symptoms; however, they share common features. One case, a young woman named Lucy Westenra, described by Bram Stoker, 1897, mirrors a textbook example of an acute leukaemia patient-despite being described before the time of common acknowledgment of the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Victims in the gothic vampire novels from the nineteenth century could very likely be inspired by real-life acute leukaemia patients.",,"['Tranekaer, Stinne', 'Marcher, Claus Werenberg', 'Frederiksen, Henrik', 'Hansen, Dennis Lund']","['Tranekaer S', 'Marcher CW', 'Frederiksen H', 'Hansen DL']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5964-9718', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6595-2075', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8905-0220', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4478-1297']","['Department of Haematology, Odense University Hospital, J.B.

Nevertheless, the function and mechanism of DLEU1 in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remain elusive and ill-defined. The current study was designed to highlight the functional role and disclose the underlying molecular mechanism by which DLEU1 regulated GBM development. We found that DLEU1 was up-regulated in GBM and DLEU1 knockdown significantly inhibited GBM cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. As predicted by bioinformatics analysis and validated in mechanistic assays, SP1 could bind to the promoter region of DLEU1 to activate DLEU1 transcription. Additionally, miR-4429 was verified as a target gene of DLEU1 and negatively modulated by DLEU1. More importantly, miR-4429 overexpression repressed the mRNA and protein levels of SP1 via binding to the 3'UTR of SP1. Overexpression of SP1 or miR-4429 inhibitor could partly abolish the effect of DLEU1 knockdown on cell viability and apoptosis in GBM. Accordingly, our experimental data revealed that SP1-DLEU1-miR-4429 formed a feedback loop to promote GBM development, providing a new evidence for the role of DLEU1 in GBM.",['(c) 2019 The Author(s).'],"['Liu, Xiaolei', 'Chen, Ruwei', 'Liu, Lijun']","['Liu X', 'Chen R', 'Liu L']",,"[""Department of Neurosurgery, Xianyang Hospital of Yan'an University, Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province 712000, P.R.

It is a public health problem throughout the world. By way of treatment, due to the lack of specific anticancer therapies, common treatments of leukemia lead to severe side effects. Nonspecific anticancer drugs result in inhibition of normal cell growth and thereby their necrosis. Moreover, drug resistance is an additional problem, which stands in the way of leukemia treatment. Thus, finding new treatments for leukemia is essential. Melatonin, as a natural product, has been shown to be effective in a wide variety of diseases such as coronary heart disease, schizophrenia, chronic pain, and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, melatonin levels have been observed to be altered in different cancers, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer endometrial cancer, and hematopoetical cancers. Anticancer features of melatonin such as pro-oxidation, apoptosis induction, antiangiogenesis property and metastasis and invasion inhibition suggest that this natural compound can be used as a potential agent in novel therapeutic strategies for cancers. Also, it has been reported that melatonin has positive and protective effects on different physiological reactions and in normal bone marrow cells suggesting effectiveness in leukemia therapy. Thus, the aim of our paper was to depict and summarize the main molecular targets of melatonin on leukemia models.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Shafabakhsh, Rana', 'Mirzaei, Hamed', 'Asemi, Zatollah']","['Shafabakhsh R', 'Mirzaei H', 'Asemi Z']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9399-8281', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5265-4792']","['Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.', 'Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.', 'Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191111,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Melatonin/*therapeutic use', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*antiangiogenesis property', '*leukemia', '*melatonin']",2019/11/13 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2019/11/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29495 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2020 Apr;121(4):2730-2738. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29495.

DDX41 variants were detectable in six (5.5%) cases. Four patients exhibited three presumable germline DDX41 mutations: p.S21fs (n = 2), p.F235fs (n = 1), and p.R339H (n = 1). While p.S21fs was previously reported in myeloid neoplasm, the latter two variants have not been described. Two of these cases harbored concomitant probable germline/somatic DDX41 mutations (p.S21fs/p.R525H and p.R339H/p.K494T), while the other two patients carried only somatic mutations (p.R525H and p.F438L). The p.K494T and p.F438L variants have not been previously reported. In patients with DDX41 alterations, the diagnoses were MDS with excess blasts (4), secondary AML (1) and low-risk MDS (1). In conclusion, we identified DDX41 variants in Thai patients with myeloid malignancies in which these variants could be used to assess predisposition to MDS in Southeast Asia.",,"['Polprasert,

The study group included 71 children (aged from 1 to 14 years) with a first episode of CDI. Data were collected from 56 (78.87%) children with only one episode of CA-CDI and from 15 (21.13%) children with rCA-CDI were mutually compared. The following parameters were found to be statistically significantly more frequent in the children with rCA-CDI group (p < 0.05); leukemia as underlying disease, treatment with immunosuppressive and-or cytostatic drugs, and treatment with antibiotics. Similarly, previously visits to outpatient facilities, daycare hospitals and hospitals were also associated with rCDI. Analysis of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters, revealed a statistically significant association of the severity of the first episode of CDI (determined by an increase in body temperature, higher maximum WBC and higher CRP) with development of a rCDI. Ribotype (RT) 027 was more common in children with rCA-CDI (66.7%, p = 0.006). During the seven-year research period, we found a rate of rCA-CDI rate in children of 21.13%. Our study identified several parameters statistically significantly more frequently in children with rCA-CDI. The obtained results will serve as a basis for future larger studies, but new prospective, studies are necessary to build a prediction model of rCDI in children that can be used to guide the treatment to prevent rCDI.",,"['Predrag, Stojanovic', 'Kuijper, Ed J', 'Nikola, Stojanovic', 'Vendrik, Karuna E W', 'Niko, Radulovic']","['Predrag S', 'Kuijper EJ', 'Nikola S', 'Vendrik KEW', 'Niko R']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7209-6660'],"['Faculty of Medicine, University of Nis, Zorana Dindica 50, Nis, 18000, Serbia. pedjamicro@sezampro.rs.', 'National Reference Laboratory for Anaerobic Infections - Clostridium difficile, Center of Microbiology, Institute for Public Health Nis, Nis, 18000, Serbia. pedjamicro@sezampro.rs.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Center for Infectious Diseases, National Reference Laboratory Clostridium difficile, National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Leiden University Medical Center, PO, Box 9600, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Nis, Zorana Dindica 50, Nis, 18000, Serbia.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Center for Infectious Diseases, National Reference Laboratory Clostridium difficile, National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Leiden University Medical Center, PO, Box 9600, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Mathematics, University of Nis, Visegradska 33, Nis, 18000, Serbia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191112,Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,8804297,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Clostridioides difficile/classification/genetics', 'Clostridium Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Community-Acquired Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Ribotyping', 'Risk Factors', 'Serbia/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Children', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Community acquired diarrhea', 'Diarrhea', 'Recurrent CDI']",2019/11/13 06:00,2020/10/10 06:00,['2019/11/13 06:00'],"['2019/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10096-019-03751-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s10096-019-03751-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2020 Mar;39(3):509-516. doi: 10.1007/s10096-019-03751-4.

Its ligand, thromobospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a multifunctional protein, and CD47/TSP-1 interactions promote tumor progression in various malignancies. In this study, we investigated roles of TSP-1 and CD47 in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Flow cytometric analysis and immunohistochemistry showed that CTCL tumor cells and CTCL cell lines (Hut78, HH, and MyLa cells) overexpressed CD47 compared with normal CD4(+) T cells. Overexpression of CD47 was partially induced by high c-Myc expression in CTCL tumor cells. TSP-1 mRNA expression levels in CTCL lesional skin were higher than those in normal skin and correlated with increased risk of disease-related death. Moreover, TSP-1 was expressed on CTCL tumor cells by immunohistochemistry. Serum soluble TSP-1 levels in patients with Sezary syndrome were significantly elevated. TSP-1 promotes proliferation and survival of CTCL tumor cells, which is inhibited by anti-CD47 neutralizing antibody or CD47 knockdown. Stimulation with TSP-1 also induces cell migration and in vivo growth. These effects were mediated by phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT and expression of survivin. Collectively, our findings prompt a novel therapeutic approach to CTCL based on discovery that CD47/TSP-1 interactions play important roles in progression of CTCL.",,"['Kamijo, Hiroaki', 'Miyagaki, Tomomitsu', 'Takahashi-Shishido, Naomi', 'Nakajima, Rina', 'Oka, Tomonori', 'Suga, Hiraku', 'Sugaya, Makoto', 'Sato, Shinichi']","['Kamijo H', 'Miyagaki T', 'Takahashi-Shishido N', 'Nakajima R', 'Oka T', 'Suga H', 'Sugaya M', 'Sato S']",,"['Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. asahikari1979@gmail.com.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, International University of Health and Welfare, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, International University of Health and Welfare, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191111,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (CD47 protein, human)', '0 (Thrombospondin 1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'CD47 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/blood/*immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Sezary Syndrome/blood/*pathology', 'Thrombospondin 1/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2019/11/13 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2019/11/13 06:00'],"['2019/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0622-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0622-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Mar;34(3):845-856. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0622-6.

We investigated the impact of EASIX measured at first diagnosis on survival of patients with lower- and higher-risk MDS (no allogeneic transplantation) in two independent institutions: n = 192 (training cohort) and n = 333 (validation cohort). Serum markers of endothelial cell distress were measured and correlated to EASIX. While no effects of EASIX on survival were observed in higher-risk patients, EASIX was associated with shorter survival in patients with lower-risk MDS in both cohorts (univariate: Cohort I: hazard ratio (HR): 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-1.71; p-value < 0.001/Cohort II: HR 1.31 [1.17-1.48]; p-value < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis and prediction error analyses confirmed that EASIX remained a significant predictor of survival after adjustment for age, sex, cytogenetic abnormalities and bone marrow blasts in lower-risk patients. The model of the training cohort could be validated. Serum levels of Angiopioetin-2 correlated significantly with EASIX.

One of the major GOF activities of mutant p53 is to suppress 2 other p53 family proteins, p63 and p73. However, the molecular basis is not fully understood. Here, we examined whether mutant p53 antagonizes p63/p73-mediated tumor suppression in vivo by using mutant p53-R270H knockin and TAp63/p73-deficient mouse models. We found that knockin mutant p53-R270H shortened the life span of p73 (+/-) mice and subjected TAp63 (+/-) or p73 (+/-) mice to T lymphoblastic lymphomas (TLBLs). To unravel the underlying mechanism, we showed that mutant p53 formed a complex with Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) and antagonized p63/p73-mediated repression of HES1 and ECM1. As a result, HES1 and ECM1 were overexpressed in TAp63 (+/-) ;p53 (R270H/-) and p73 (+/-) ;p53 (R270H/-) TLBLs, suggesting that normal function of HES1 and ECM1 in T cell activation is hyperactivated, leading to lymphomagenesis.

Our experience in the community hospital setting can inform treating physicians of the causes for and need to treat thrombocytopenia. Here we describe our clinical experience from 2 community hospitals over a 22-month period, wherein a single hematologist was consulted for 97 cases of thrombocytopenia in 93 patients. METHODS: Referred patients underwent history, physical, review of old records and imaging, relevant laboratory testing, review of the peripheral smear, and a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy if clinically indicated. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients had a primary hematologic cause for their thrombocytopenia. Fifty-one had secondary causes for thrombocytopenia. Eleven patients had no discernible etiology for their thrombocytopenia. The most common hematologic diagnoses were immune thrombocytopenia purpura (n = 12), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (n = 6), in vitro platelet clumping (n = 4), quite remarkably acute progranulocytic leukemia (n = 4), and thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (n = 3). The latter 3 were immediately diagnosed by reviewing the peripheral smear, which led to appropriate therapy. The most common nonhematologic etiologies were liver disease (n = 21), bacterial sepsis (n = 12), and oral medication (n = 7). Although the thrombocytopenia was mostly nonacute, immediate hematologic interventions were needed for 21 patients. Four patients died, none from complications of thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients requires consideration of multiple etiologies and review of the peripheral smear. Liver disease is often overlooked as a cause for thrombocytopenia.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The cytogenetic changes associated with AML affect the response rate and survival and are one of the most important independent prognostic factors. AML with inv(3)(q21.3q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21.3;q26.2); GATA2, MECOM accounts for 1% to 2% of all forms of AML and has been associated with a younger age at diagnosis, a poor response to standard induction chemotherapy, and very poor long-term prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective cohort study comparing the outcomes with hypomethylating agent (HMA) plus lenalidomide to those with standard intensive induction therapies for newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory AML with inv(3). RESULTS: Of the 15 patients, 4 (26.7%) had received lenalidomide and HMA as primary therapy. The overall response rate (ORR) was 100% for the 4 patients who had received lenalidomide with HMA as first-line induction therapy. The ORR was 27.3% (3 of 11) for the patients who had received other induction regimens (P = .0256). The duration of response for first induction therapy was an average of 7.4 months after lenalidomide plus an HMA and a mean of 1.5 months after induction with other chemotherapy regimen (P = .057). The ORR for induction and reinduction therapy was also assessed, with an ORR of 21.4% (6 of 28) for alternative chemotherapy regimens and an ORR of 75% (6 of 8) for induction and reinduction with lenalidomide plus HMA (P = .0046). CONCLUSIONS: The high ORR and reasonable duration of response could allow for potentially curative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for these patients with high-risk AML.

METHODS: We identified 656 consecutive CML patients treated with nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib. RESULTS: The 15-year CV-mortality free survival was 93+/-2.8%. Age >/=65 years (p=0.005) and a positive history of CV disease (p=0.04) were significantly associated with a lower CV-mortality free survival. CV disease accounted for 16.5% and 5% of potential years of life lost (PYLL) in male and female patients, respectively. The standard mortality ratio (SMR) following ischemic heart disease (IHD) was 3.9 in males and 3.8 in female patients, meaning an excess of IHD deaths observed, in comparison with the population of control.

However, chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat these patients have adverse effects on their overall health profile including fertility. The primary aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed proteins in seminal plasma of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors compared to age-matched healthy controls, which can provide molecular basis of idiopathic infertility in such survivors. Differential proteome profiling was performed by 2D-differential in-gel electrophoresis, protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry and selective differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were validated by western blotting and ELISA method. Out of eight DEPs identified, five proteins (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, semenogelin 1, lactoferrin, prolactin-inducible protein, and human serum albumin) were upregulated and three (pepsinogen, prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase) were downregulated. Expression profiles of these proteins are suggestive of reduction in semen quality in ALL survivors and can further be explored to determine their fertility status.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal', 'Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.', 'Published by Elsevier B.V.

Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) and Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) are two key factors in patients resistance and deterioration. METHODS: In total, 58 MDS patients were divided into four groups. We analyzed the difference in HO-1 and EZH2 expression among the groups by real-time PCR. After treatment with Hemin or Znpp IX, flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis and assess the cell cycle distribution of tumor cells. Following injection of mice with very high-risk MDS cells, spleen and bone marrow samples were studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. MDS cells overexpressing EZH2 and HO-1 were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. The effect of HO-1 on the pRB-E2F pathway was analyzed by Western blotting. The effects of decitabine on P15INK4B and TP53 in MDS cells after inhibiting HO-1 were detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: Real-time PCR results showed that EZH2 and HO-1 expression levels were higher in MDS patients than in normal donors. The levels of HO-1 and EZH2 were simultaneously increased in the high-risk and very high-risk groups. Linear correlation analysis and laser scanning confocal microscopy results indicated that EZH2 was related to HO-1. MDS cells that highly expressed EZH2 and HO-1 infiltrated the tissues of experimental mice. IHC results indicated that these phenomena were related to the pRB-E2F pathway. High-throughput sequencing indicated that the progression of MDS to AML was related to EZH2. Using the E2F inhibitor HLM006474 and the EZH2 inhibitor JQEZ5, we showed that HO-1 could regulate EZH2 expression. HO-1 could stimulate the transcription and activation of EZH2 through the pRB-E2F pathway in MDS patients during chemotherapy, which reduced TP53 and P15INK4B expression. CONCLUSIONS: EZH2 was associated with HO-1 in high-risk and very high-risk MDS patients. HO-1 could influence MDS resistance and progression to AML.",,"['He, Zhengchang', 'Zhang, Siyu', 'Ma, Dan', 'Fang, Qin', 'Yang, Liping', 'Shen, Shaoxian', 'Chen, Ying', 'Ren, Lingli', 'Wang, Jishi']","['He Z', 'Zhang S', 'Ma D', 'Fang Q', 'Yang L', 'Shen S', 'Chen Y', 'Ren L', 'Wang J']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical Medicine Research Center of Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Intensive Care Unit, Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, Sichuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, Guizhou, People's Republic of China. 1014712228@qq.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191111,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/metabolism', '*Disease Progression', 'E2F Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Risk Factors', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*EZH2', '*HO-1', '*JQEZ5', '*Myelodysplastic syndrome', '*pRB-E2F']",2019/11/13 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/11/13 06:00'],"['2019/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-019-2115-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-019-2115-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2019 Nov 11;17(1):366. doi: 10.1186/s12967-019-2115-9.,PMC6849246,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Less is known about its usefulness in CALR-mutated cases. Additional mutations found by next-generation sequencing have also shown an impact on prognosis that may drive therapeutic choices, especially in myelofibrosis, but few studies focused on CALR-mutated patients. We performed a molecular evaluation combining next-generation sequencing with a myeloid panel and CALR allele burden measurement at diagnosis and during follow-up in a cohort of 45 patients with CALR-mutated essential thrombocythaemia. The bone marrow histology was also blindly reviewed in order to apply the WHO2016 classification. The most frequently mutated gene was TET2 (11/21 mutations). CALR type 1-like patients appear to have a more complex molecular landscape. We found an association between disease progression and CALR allele burden increase during follow-up, independently of additional mutations and WHO2016-reviewed diagnosis. Patients with disease progression at the time of follow-up showed a significant increase in CALR allele burden (+16.7%, P = 0.005) whereas patients without disease progression had a stable allele burden (+3.7%, P = 0.194).

Novel markers are available for the differential diagnosis of CLL, especially from MCL. However, these markers are still not incorporated into diagnostic algorithms. We investigated the role of CD43, CD81, CD200, and ROR1 in the differential diagnosis of CLL and their expression in non-CLL cases. METHODS: We investigated the role of CD43, CD81, CD20, and ROR1 in the differential diagnosis of CLL by incorporating them into the diagnostic panel after studying peripheral blood or bone marrow samples of 165 patients with 8-color flow cytometry. RESULTS: CD43 positivity was a sensitive marker but had a lower specificity for CLL. CD43 had high diagnostic value for CLL (sensitivity 100%, specificity 88.5%, AUC 98.0%). CD200 was a specific marker for CLL (sensitivity 98%, specificity 90%, AUC: 96%). CD81 expression was highest in the MCL cases, with a median expression rate of 68.5% (range: 54 - 82.5%). It was negative in all the CLL cases. For CLL, CD81 negativity had a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 82% and an AUC of 92%. ROR1 was positive in all CLL and MCL cases. CD79b, on the other hand, was a fairly sensitive and specific marker for MCL.

Protein misfolding and impaired degradation leads to the build-up of protein aggregates inside the cell, which may further cause cellular degeneration. Reducing levels of either the soluble misfolded form of the protein or its precipitated aggregate, even marginally, could significantly improve cellular health. Despite numerous pre-existing strategies to target these protein aggregates, there is considerable room to improve their specificity and efficiency. In this study, we demonstrated the enhanced intracellular degradation of both monomers and aggregates of mutant ataxin1 (Atxn1 82Q) by engineering an E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Specifically, we showed enhanced degradation of both soluble and aggregated Atxn1 82Q in mammalian cells by targeting this protein using PML fused to single chain variable fragments (scFvs) specific for monomers and aggregates of the target protein. The ability to solubilize Atxn1 82Q aggregates was due to the PML-mediated enhanced SUMOylation of the target protein. This ability to reduce the intracellular levels of both misfolded forms of Atxn1 82Q may not only be useful for treating SCA, but also applicable for the treatment of other PolyQ disorders.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Dhar, Neha', 'Arsiwala, Ammar', 'Murali, Shruthi', 'Kane, Ravi S']","['Dhar N', 'Arsiwala A', 'Murali S', 'Kane RS']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3084-4098'],"['School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],['RF1 AG059723/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20191128,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,"['0 (Ataxin-1)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Aggregates)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '26700-71-0 (polyglutamine)']",IM,"['*Ataxin-1/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', '*Peptides/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Aggregates', 'Protein Folding', '*Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'Sumoylation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PML', '*aggregate', '*degradation', '*monomer', '*spinocerebellar ataxia']",2019/11/12 06:00,2021/02/07 06:00,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.27220 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2020 Feb;117(2):362-371. doi: 10.1002/bit.27220.

Tumor suppressor proteins, such as p53, can be rendered inactive due to aberrant cellular localization disrupting their mechanism of action. The survival of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells, among other cancer cells, is assisted by the deregulation of nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling, at least in part through deregulation of the transport receptor XPO1 and the constitutive activation of PI3K-mediated signaling pathways. It is essential to understand the role of individual proteins in the context of their intracellular location to gain a deeper understanding of the role of such proteins in the pathobiology of the disease. Furthermore, identifying processes that underlie cell stimulation and the mechanism of action of specific pharmacological inhibitors, in the context of subcellular protein trafficking, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of action. The protocol described here enables the optimization and subsequent efficient generation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. These fractions can be used to determine changes in protein trafficking between the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions upon cell stimulation and drug treatment.

Despite of accomplishing some researches on D. innoxia mechanism, still our knowledge is very little about exact D. innoxia apoptotic mechanism on human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562 cells). This study purpose was to clarify the molecular mechanism of apoptosis, which was mediated by D. innoxia leaves aqueous extract in K562 cells. MTT assay and flow cytometry was applied in order to assess the viability and apoptosis induction of K562 cells and normal human lymphoid B cells in the D. innoxia presence. Finally, the expression of the apoptotic related genes (p53, BAX, BCL2, Caspases 3, 6, 7 and 9) were evaluated using quantitative Real-Time PCR. Western blot analysis was applied for assessing the protein expression. MTT results indicated that D. innoxia could inhibit the viability of K562 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In parallel, D. innoxia inhibitory effect on normal human lymphoid B cells was lower in comparison with its effect on K562 cells at the same concentrations and same incubation time. Apoptosis induction in K562 cells after D. innoxia exposure was determined by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was activated by D. innoxia in K562 cells throughout increasing the expression of P53, BAX/BCL2 ratio, caspase 9, 3, 6, 7. Western blot analysis demonstrated significant increase in cleaved PARP-1 and cleaved caspase 3 in treated K562 cells with high D. innoxia leaves aqueous extract concentration. D. innoxia leaves trigger apoptosis in K562 cells throughout intrinsic apoptotic pathway.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Through the comprehensive assessment of surface and intracellular antigens expressed by blasts, MFCI permits to distinguish myeloid or B/T lymphoid AL, or AL of ambiguous lineages. By means of MFCI, the blasts can be characterized in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and body fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid.Area covered: This review discusses how MFCI is currently applied in the diagnostic evaluation of AL; it also focuses on 'peculiar' issues such as the role of MFCI for the diagnosis of central nervous system leukemic involvement.Expert commentary: Despite the improved knowledge about the biology of AL, MFCI remains a fundamental tool to make a prompt and accurate diagnosis. MFCI also provides prognostic information for some antigens are associated with specific cytogenetic/genetic abnormalities and, recently, it became a powerful tool to evaluate the quality and depth of response (the so called 'measurable residual disease'). Its role as an efficient detector of residual disease paved the way to the investigation of tissues other than bone marrow and peripheral blood, demonstrating that even small amounts of AL appear to have a prognostic impact and may require personalized intervention.",,"['Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'De Bellis, Eleonora', 'Gurnari, Carmelo', 'Buzzati, Elisa', 'Savi, Arianna', 'Consalvo, Maria Antonietta Irno', 'Venditti, Adriano']","['Del Principe MI', 'De Bellis E', 'Gurnari C', 'Buzzati E', 'Savi A', 'Consalvo MAI', 'Venditti A']",,"['Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Cattedra di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Onco-Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Roma, Italia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191116,England,Expert Rev Mol Diagn,Expert review of molecular diagnostics,101120777,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods/standards', 'Leukemia/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*cerebrospinal fluid', '*diagnosis', '*flow cytometry', '*immunophenotype']",2019/11/12 06:00,2020/06/11 06:00,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737159.2019.1691918 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 2019 Dec;19(12):1089-1097. doi: 10.1080/14737159.2019.1691918.

The framework entails a systematic approach with the aim to quantify risk levels for substances that induce genomic damage contributing to human adverse health outcomes. Here, we evaluated the utility of the framework for assessing the risk for industrial chemicals, using the case of benzene. Benzene is a well-studied substance that is generally considered a genotoxic carcinogen and is known to cause leukemia. The case study limits its focus on occupational and general population health as it relates to benzene exposure. Using the framework as guidance, available data on benzene considered relevant for assessment of genetic damage were collected. Based on these data, we were able to conduct quantitative analyses for relevant data sets to estimate acceptable exposure levels and to characterize the risk of genetic damage. Key observations include the need for robust exposure assessments, the importance of information on toxicokinetic properties, and the benefits of cheminformatics. The framework points to the need for further improvement on understanding of the mechanism(s) of action involved, which would also provide support for the use of targeted tests rather than a prescribed set of assays. Overall, this case study demonstrates the utility of the next generation framework to quantitatively model human risk on the basis of genetic damage, thereby enabling a new, innovative risk assessment concept.

Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are altered cells in which accumulating genetic and/or epigenetic alterations occur, resulting in the transition between the normal, preleukemic, and leukemic status. These cells do not follow the normal differentiation program; they are arrested in a primitive state but with high proliferation potential, generating undifferentiated blast accumulation and a lack of a mature cell population. The identification of LSCs might guide stem cell biology research and provide key points of distinction between these cells and their normal counterparts. The identification and characterization of the main features of LSCs can be useful as tools for diagnosis and treatment. In this context, the aim of the present review was to connect immunophenotype data in the main types of leukemia to further guide technical improvements.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mastelaro de Rezende, Marina', 'Ferreira, Alice T', 'Paredes-Gamero, Edgar J']","['Mastelaro de Rezende M', 'Ferreira AT', 'Paredes-Gamero EJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8934-2108'],"['Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biofisica, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Division - Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Alimentos e Nutricao, Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191110,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*trends', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cytometry', '*immunophenotype', '*leukemia', '*leukemic stem cell', '*surface markers']",2019/11/12 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29394 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2020 Jun;235(6):4989-4998. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29394.

To this end, EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with MOG35-55 peptide. Spinal cords were collected at different times during the disease course and used for western blotting, RNA analysis, and immunohistochemistry. The results show that, as expression of i-20S and the activator PA28 rise in EAE, there is a concomitant decline in that of c-20S at the mRNA and protein level. These changes are observed in neurons and astrocytes but not in oligodendrocytes. The increased amounts of the i-20S-specific subunit beta5i and PA28alpha/beta in EAE correlate with the levels of interferon-gamma and its downstream effectors p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and interferon regulatory factor-1, but not with those of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells. This suggests that the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/interferon regulatory factor-1 pathway is solely responsible for the induction of these subunits. The decrease in the mRNA and protein levels corresponding to the c-20S-specific subunit beta5 may also be due to reduced expression of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like-1 (Nrf1 or Nfe2l1), specifically Nrf1alpha and Nrf1beta. Low Nfe2l1 mRNA expression is unlikely caused by reduced mammalian target of rapamycin signaling but could be the result of diminished pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox-1 transcription factor levels. Together, these findings suggest that a combination of subunit displacement and reduced Nrf1 expression may be responsible for c-20S impairment in EAE. The present work provides insights into the dynamics of proteasome expression in the CNS of EAE mice and is the first to explore Nrf1 signaling in an inflammatory demyelinating disorder.",['(c) 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry.'],"['Shanley, Kara L', 'Hu, Che-Lin', 'Bizzozero, Oscar A']","['Shanley KL', 'Hu CL', 'Bizzozero OA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2306-9137', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1925-652X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7597-3630']","['Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, University of New Mexico - Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, University of New Mexico - Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, University of New Mexico - Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.']",['eng'],['R21 NS082805/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20191202,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 1)', '0 (Nfe2L1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 1/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Spinal Cord/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Nrf1', '*PA28', '*experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis', '*immunoproteasome', '*inflammatory cytokines', '*proteasome']",2019/11/12 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jnc.14912 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 2020 Mar;152(5):585-601. doi: 10.1111/jnc.14912.

Methods: This Retrospective, multicenter exploratory-validation analysis of 9103 patients, (55.5% male, median age 50years; 1-75years range) with an allogeneic HSCT between 2010 and 2016 from a matched sibling (N=8641; 95%) or matched unrelated donor (N=462; 5%) for acute myeloid (N=6432; 71%) or acute lymphoblastic (N=2671; 29%) leukaemia in first complete remission, and reported by 240 centres in 30 countries to the benchmark database of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) searched for factors associated with use of transplant techniques (standard N=6375;70% or reduced intensity conditioning N=2728;30%, respectively bone marrow N=1945;21% or peripheral blood N=7158;79% as stem cell source), and their impact on outcome. Findings: Treatment groups differed significantly from baseline population (p<0.001), and within groups regarding patient-, disease-, donor-, and centre-related pre-transplantation risk factors (p<0.001); choice of technique did depend on pre-transplantation risk factors and centre (p<0.001). Probability of overall survival at 5years decreased systematically and significantly with increasing pre-transplantation risk score (score 2 vs 0/1 HR: 1.2, 95% c.i. [1.1-1..3], p=0.002; score 3 vs 0/1 HR: 1.5, 95% c.i. [1.3-1.7], p<0.001; score 4/5/6 vs 0/1 HR: 1.9, 95% c.i. [1.6-2.2], p<0.001) with no significant differences between treatment groups (likelihood ratio test on interaction: p=0.40). Overall survival was significantly associated with selection steps and completeness of information (p<0.001). Interpretation: Patients' pre-transplantation risk factors determine survival, independent of transplant techniques. Transplant techniques should be regarded as centre policy, not stratification factor in benchmarking. Selection criteria and completeness of data bias outcome. Outcomes may be improved more effectively through better identifying pre-transplantation factors as opposed to refinement of transplant techniques.

We stress the urgent need for a better comprehension of the critical role of RARG dysregulation in the leukemogenesis process, since optimum therapy strategies have not yet been established.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Conserva, Redavid, Anelli, Zagaria, Specchia and Albano.']","['Conserva, Maria Rosa', 'Redavid, Immacolata', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Conserva MR', 'Redavid I', 'Anelli L', 'Zagaria A', 'Specchia G', 'Albano F']",,"['Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), University of Bari, Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191024,Switzerland,Front Mol Biosci,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'gene fusions', 'protein fusions', 'retinoic acid receptor gamma']",2019/11/12 06:00,2019/11/12 06:01,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmolb.2019.00114 [doi]'],epublish,Front Mol Biosci. 2019 Oct 24;6:114. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2019.00114. eCollection 2019.,PMC6822255,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations are associated with a higher number of mutations per patient, we hypothesize that this group of patients could benefit from therapy with checkpoint inhibitors because of the higher frequency of neo-antigens that this group would present. This might also true for IMiD therapy, because of their activatory effect on T cells. Because, KRAS/NRAS/BRAF are members of the MAPK pathway, this subgroup of patients would also benefit from inhibitors of MAPK, either directly on the specific mutation or through downstream targeting of MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 to account for a possible compensatory collateral signaling that might activate as response to upstream inhibition.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Pasca, Tomuleasa, Teodorescu, Ghiaur, Dima, Moisoiu, Berce,', 'Stefan, Ciechanover and Einsele.']","['Pasca, Sergiu', 'Tomuleasa, Ciprian', 'Teodorescu, Patric', 'Ghiaur, Gabriel', 'Dima, Delia', 'Moisoiu, Vlad', 'Berce, Cristian', 'Stefan, Cristina', 'Ciechanover, Aaron', 'Einsele, Herman']","['Pasca S', 'Tomuleasa C', 'Teodorescu P', 'Ghiaur G', 'Dima D', 'Moisoiu V', 'Berce C', 'Stefan C', 'Ciechanover A', 'Einsele H']",,"['Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Leukemia, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'African Organisation for Research and Training in Cancer, Cape Town, South Africa.', 'The Rappaport Faculty of Medicine and Research Institute, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191024,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BRAF', 'KRAS', 'NRAS', 'multiple myeloma', 'therapeutics']",2019/11/12 06:00,2019/11/12 06:01,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01137 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Oct 24;9:1137. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01137. eCollection 2019.,PMC6821642,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MSCs also have a unique immunomodulatory capacity, which makes them able to affect, both in vitro and in vivo, the function of immune cells. These features, namely the facilitation of stem cell engraftment and the inhibition of lymphocyte responses, have both proven essential for successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), which remains the only curative option for several hematologic malignancies. For example, in steroid-refractory acute graft-vs. host disease developing after allo-SCT, MSCs have produced significant results and are now considered a treatment option. However, more recently, the other side of the MSC coin has been unveiled, because of their emerging role in creating a protective and immune-tolerant microenvironment able to support the survival of leukemic cells and affect the response to therapies. In this light, it has been proposed that the failure of current treatments to efficiently override the stroma-mediated protection of leukemic cells accounts for the high rate of relapse in acute myeloid leukemia, at least in part. In this review, we will focus on emerging microenvironment-driven mechanisms conferring a survival advantage to leukemic cells overt physiological HSCs. This body of evidence increasingly highlights the opportunity to consider tumor-microenvironment interactions when designing new therapeutic strategies.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Ciciarello, Corradi, Loscocco, Visani, Monaco, Cavo, Curti and', 'Isidori.']","['Ciciarello, Marilena', 'Corradi, Giulia', 'Loscocco, Federica', 'Visani, Giuseppe', 'Monaco, Federica', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Curti, Antonio', 'Isidori, Alessandro']","['Ciciarello M', 'Corradi G', 'Loscocco F', 'Visani G', 'Monaco F', 'Cavo M', 'Curti A', 'Isidori A']",,"['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. & A.

While the influences of DNMT3A mutation subtypes are still under debate. Purpose: Exploration of the clinical and molecular differences between AML patients carrying DNMT3A R882 mutations and DNMT3A frameshift mutations. Methods: Next generation of sequencing (NGS) and clinical data of 118 AML patients in our center were analyzed and compared. NGS, mRNA and miRNA profiling and clinical data from 12 patients in TCGA database were integrative analyzed. Results: Among all patients enrolled, 113 patients were positive for the variants of interest. Overall, a total of 295 variants were discovered, among which 24 DNMT3A mutations were detected, including 1 non-sense, 20 missense, 3 frameshift mutations. And 7 DNMT3A R882 mutations (3 R882H, 2 R882C, and 2 R882P) were found. Clinical analysis from our cohort and TCGA database indicated that patients carrying DNMT3A R882 mutation exhibited significantly higher levels of peripheral blood hemoglobin and non-significantly inferior prognosis compared with patients with DNMT3A frameshift mutations. Integrative analysis indicated that miR-10b, miR-143, and miR-30a were significantly decreased in the DNMT3A R882 group. High miR-143 expression is significantly associated with better prognosis in AML patients with DNMT3A mutations. Conclusion: Different molecular and clinical characteristics existed between patients with DNMT3A variant subtypes. The distinct microRNA expression pattern for DNMT3A R882 AML patients might not only act as markers to predict disease prognosis, but also could be further investigated to develop novel therapeutic targets for patients with DNMT3A mutations.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Yang, Shen, Zhang, Zhang, Cai, Lin, Long, Xing, Tang, Xiong,', 'Wang, Li, Zhou and Xiao.']","['Yang, Li', ""Shen, Ke'Feng"", ""Zhang, Mei'Lan"", 'Zhang, Wei', ""Cai, Hao'Dong"", ""Lin, Li'Man"", ""Long, Xiao'Lu"", ""Xing, Shu'Gang"", 'Tang, Yang', 'Xiong, Jie', ""Wang, Jia'Chen"", ""Li, Deng'Ju"", ""Zhou, Jian'Feng"", 'Xiao, Min']","['Yang L', 'Shen K', 'Zhang M', 'Zhang W', 'Cai H', 'Lin L', 'Long X', 'Xing S', 'Tang Y', 'Xiong J', 'Wang J', 'Li D', 'Zhou J', 'Xiao M']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191024,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNMT3A gene mutations', 'clinical', 'expression', 'leukemia', 'microRNA']",2019/11/12 06:00,2019/11/12 06:01,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01133 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Oct 24;9:1133. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01133. eCollection 2019.,PMC6821681,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic clonal evolution and development of resistant mutations represent crucial events that limit the benefit of subsequent therapies in these patients. CML is diagnosed in accelerated (AP) or blast phase (BP) in <5% of patients, and the availability of effective treatments for chronic phase (CP) has dramatically reduced progressions on therapy. Due to smaller number of patients, few randomized studies are available in this setting and evidences are limited. Nevertheless, three main scenarios may be drawn: (a) patients diagnosed in AP are at higher risk of failure as compared to CP patients, but if they achieve optimal responses with frontline TKI treatment their outcome may be similarly favorable; (b) patients diagnosed in BP may be treated with TKI alone or with TKI together with conventional chemotherapy regimens, and subsequent transplant decisions should rely on kinetics of response and individual transplant risk; (c) patients in CP progressing under TKI treatment represent the most challenging population and they should be treated with alternative TKI according to the mutational profile, optional chemotherapy in BP patients, and transplant should be considered in suitable cases after return to second CP. Due to lack of validated and reliable markers to predict blast crisis and the still unsatisfactory results of treatments in this setting, prevention of progression by careful selection of frontline treatment in CP and early treatment intensification in non-optimal responders remains the main goal. Personalized evaluation of response kinetics could help in identifying patients at risk for progression.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Bonifacio, Stagno, Scaffidi, Krampera and Di Raimondo.']","['Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Scaffidi, Luigi', 'Krampera, Mauro', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco']","['Bonifacio M', 'Stagno F', 'Scaffidi L', 'Krampera M', 'Di Raimondo F']",,"['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology With BMT, AOU Policlinico ""Vittorio Emanuele"", University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology With BMT, AOU Policlinico ""Vittorio Emanuele"", University of Catania, Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191025,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['accelerated phase', 'allogeneic stem cell transplant', 'blast phase', 'clonal evolution', 'molecular monitoring']",2019/11/12 06:00,2019/11/12 06:01,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01132 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Oct 25;9:1132. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01132. eCollection 2019.,PMC6823861,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometry (FC) revealed three distinct expression patterns, i.e., FXIII-A negative, FXIII-A dim, and FXIII-A bright subgroups. The FXIII-A negative subgroup was significantly associated with the ""B-other"" genetic category and had an unfavorable disease outcome. Methods: RNA was extracted from bone marrow lymphoblasts of 42 pediatric patients with BCP-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). FXIII-A expression was determined by multiparameter FC. Genetic diagnosis was based on conventional cytogenetic method and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Affymetrix GeneChip Human Primeview array was used to analyze global expression pattern of 28,869 well-annotated genes. Microarray data were analyzed by Genespring GX14.9.1 software. Gene Ontology analysis was performed using Cytoscape 3.4.0 software with ClueGO application. Selected differentially expressed genes were validated by RT-Q-PCR. Results: We demonstrated, for the first time, the general expression of F13A1 gene in pediatric BCP-ALL samples. The intensity of F13A1 expression corresponded to the FXIII-A protein expression subgroups which defined three characteristic and distinct gene expression signatures detected by Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. Relative gene expression intensity of ANGPTL2, EHMT1 FOXO1, HAP1, NUCKS1, NUP43, PIK3CG, RAPGEF5, SEMA6A, SPIN1, TRH, and WASF2 followed the pattern of change in the intensity of the expression of the F13A1 gene. Common enhancer elements of these genes revealed by in silico analysis suggest that common transcription factors may regulate the expression of these genes in a similar fashion. PLAC8 was downregulated in the FXIII-A bright subgroup. Gene expression signature of the FXIII-A negative subgroup showed an overlap with the signature of ""B-other"" samples. DFFA, GIGYF1, GIGYF2, and INTS3 were upregulated and CD3G was downregulated in the ""B-other"" subgroup. Validated genes proved biologically and clinically relevant. We described differential expression of genes not shown previously to be associated with pediatric BCP-ALL. Conclusions: Gene expression signature according to FXIII-A protein expression status defined three novel subgroups of pediatric BCP-ALL. Multiparameter FC appears to be an easy-to-use and affordable method to help in selecting FXIII-A negative patients who require a more elaborate and expensive molecular genetic investigation to design precision treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Gyurina, Karai, Ujfalusi, Hevessy, Barna, Jakso,', 'Palfi-Meszaros, Poliska, Scholtz, Kappelmayer, Zahuczky and Kiss.']","['Gyurina, Katalin', 'Karai, Bettina', 'Ujfalusi, Aniko', 'Hevessy, Zsuzsanna', 'Barna, Gabor', 'Jakso, Pal', 'Palfi-Meszaros, Gyongyi', 'Poliska, Szilard', 'Scholtz, Beata', 'Kappelmayer, Janos', 'Zahuczky, Gabor', 'Kiss, Csongor']","['Gyurina K', 'Karai B', 'Ujfalusi A', 'Hevessy Z', 'Barna G', 'Jakso P', 'Palfi-Meszaros G', 'Poliska S', 'Scholtz B', 'Kappelmayer J', 'Zahuczky G', 'Kiss C']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', '1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary.', 'UD GenoMed Medical Genomic Technologies Ltd., Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Genomic Medicine and Bioinformatic Core Facility, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Genomic Medicine and Bioinformatic Core Facility, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'UD GenoMed Medical Genomic Technologies Ltd., Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191025,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-other genotype', 'F13A1', 'FXIII-A', 'RT-Q-PCR', 'gene expression signature', 'oligonucleotide microarray', 'pediatric BCP-ALL']",2019/11/12 06:00,2019/11/12 06:01,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01063 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Oct 25;9:1063. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01063. eCollection 2019.,PMC6823876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Production of icariside D2 by plant extraction and chemical synthesis is inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. Microbial cell factory offers an attractive route for economical production of icariside D2 from renewable and sustainable bioresources. Results: We metabolically constructed the biosynthetic pathway of icariside D2 in engineered Escherichia coli. We screened the uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases (UGTs) and obtained an active RrUGT3 that regio-specifically glycosylated tyrosol at phenolic position to exclusively synthesize icariside D2. We put heterologous genes in E. coli cell for the de novo biosynthesis of icariside D2. By fine-tuning promoter and copy number as well as balancing gene expression pattern to decrease metabolic burden, the BMD10 monoculture was constructed. Parallelly, for balancing pathway strength, we established the BMT23-BMD12 coculture by distributing the icariside D2 biosynthetic genes to two E. coli strains BMT23 and BMD12, responsible for biosynthesis of tyrosol from preferential xylose and icariside D2 from glucose, respectively. Under the optimal conditions in fed-batch shake-flask fermentation, the BMD10 monoculture produced 3.80 g/L of icariside D2 using glucose as sole carbon source, and the BMT23-BMD12 coculture produced 2.92 g/L of icariside D2 using glucose-xylose mixture. Conclusions: We for the first time reported the engineered E. coli for the de novo efficient production of icariside D2 with gram titer. It would be potent and sustainable approach for microbial production of icariside D2 from renewable carbon sources. E. coli-E. coli coculture approach is not limited to glycoside production, but could also be applied to other bioproducts.",['(c) The Author(s) 2019.'],"['Liu, Xue', 'Li, Lingling', 'Liu, Jincong', 'Qiao, Jianjun', 'Zhao, Guang-Rong']","['Liu X', 'Li L', 'Liu J', 'Qiao J', 'Zhao GR']",,"['1Frontier Science Center for Synthetic Biology and Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering (Ministry of Education), School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Yaguan Road 135, Jinnan District, Tianjin, 300350 China.0000 0004 1761 2484grid.33763.32', '1Frontier Science Center for Synthetic Biology and Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering (Ministry of Education), School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Yaguan Road 135, Jinnan District, Tianjin, 300350 China.0000 0004 1761 2484grid.33763.32', '1Frontier Science Center for Synthetic Biology and Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering (Ministry of Education), School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Yaguan Road 135, Jinnan District, Tianjin, 300350 China.0000 0004 1761 2484grid.33763.32', '1Frontier Science Center for Synthetic Biology and Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering (Ministry of Education), School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Yaguan Road 135, Jinnan District, Tianjin, 300350 China.0000 0004 1761 2484grid.33763.32', '2SynBio Research Platform, Collaborative Innovation Centre of Chemical Science and Engineering (Tianjin), Tianjin University, Yaguan Road 135, Jinnan District, Tianjin, 300350 China.0000 0004 1761 2484grid.33763.32', '1Frontier Science Center for Synthetic Biology and Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering (Ministry of Education), School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Yaguan Road 135, Jinnan District, Tianjin, 300350 China.0000 0004 1761 2484grid.33763.32', '2SynBio Research Platform, Collaborative Innovation Centre of Chemical Science and Engineering (Tianjin), Tianjin University, Yaguan Road 135, Jinnan District, Tianjin, 300350 China.0000 0004 1761 2484grid.33763.32']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191106,England,Biotechnol Biofuels,Biotechnology for biofuels,101316935,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Coculture', 'Escherichia coli', 'Icariside D2', 'Metabolic engineering', 'Synthetic biology']",2019/11/12 06:00,2019/11/12 06:01,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13068-019-1601-x [doi]', '1601 [pii]']",epublish,Biotechnol Biofuels. 2019 Nov 6;12:261. doi: 10.1186/s13068-019-1601-x. eCollection 2019.,PMC6833136,,,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting dataset included median antibody binding capacities (ABCs) and percentage of positivity for all markers on all subsets and was developed into an interactive CD Maps web resource. Using the resource, we examined differentially expressed proteins between granulocyte, monocyte, and dendritic cell subsets, and profiled dynamic expression of markers during thymocyte differentiation, T-cell maturation, and between functionally distinct B-cell subset clusters. The CD Maps resource will serve as a benchmark of antibody reactivities ensuring improved reproducibility of flow cytometry-based research. Moreover, it will provide a full picture of the surfaceome of human immune cells and serves as a useful platform to increase our understanding of leukocyte biology, as well as to facilitate the identification of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets of immunological and hematological diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Kalina, Fiser, Perez-Andres, Kuzilkova, Cuenca, Bartol,', 'Blanco, Engel and van Zelm.']","['Kalina, Tomas', 'Fiser, Karel', 'Perez-Andres, Martin', 'Kuzilkova, Daniela', 'Cuenca, Marta', 'Bartol, Sophinus J W', 'Blanco, Elena', 'Engel, Pablo', 'van Zelm, Menno C']","['Kalina T', 'Fiser K', 'Perez-Andres M', 'Kuzilkova D', 'Cuenca M', 'Bartol SJW', 'Blanco E', 'Engel P', 'van Zelm MC']",,"['CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Medicine, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC, USAL-CSIC), Cytometry Service (NUCLEUS), Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Networking Centre Consortium of Oncology (CIBERONC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC, USAL-CSIC), Cytometry Service (NUCLEUS), Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Networking Centre Consortium of Oncology (CIBERONC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology and Pathology, Monash University and the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191023,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Internet', 'Leukocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphopoiesis', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell', '*CD marker', '*T-cell', '*expression profiling', '*flow cytometry', '*lymphocyte', '*monocyte', '*surfaceome']",2019/11/12 06:00,2020/10/07 06:00,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02434 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Oct 23;10:2434. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02434. eCollection 2019.,PMC6820661,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 infects CD4(+) T-cells via cell-to-cell transmission requiring reorganization of the cytoskeleton and expression of the viral transactivator and oncoprotein Tax. Viruses spread at the virological synapse (VS), a virus-induced specialized cell-cell contact, by polarized budding into synaptic clefts, and by cell surface transfer of viral biofilms (VBs). Since little is known about Tax's role in formation of the VB, we asked which component of the VB is regulated by Tax and important for HTLV-1 transmission. Collagens are not only structural proteins of the extracellular matrix and basal membrane but also represent an important component of the VB. Here, we report that among the collagens known to be present in VBs, COL4 is specifically upregulated in the presence of HTLV-1 infection. Further, we found that transient expression of Tax is sufficient to induce COL4A1 and COL4A2 transcripts in Jurkat and CCRF-CEM T-cells, while robust induction of COL4 protein requires continuous Tax expression as shown in Tax-transformed T-cell lines. Repression of Tax led to a significant reduction of COL4A1/A2 transcripts and COL4 protein. Mechanistically, luciferase-based promoter studies indicate that Tax activates the COL4A2 and, to a less extent, the COL4A1 promoter. Imaging showing partial co-localization of COL4 with the viral Gag protein in VBs at the VS and transfer of COL4 and Gag to target cells suggests a role of COL4 in VB formation. Strikingly, in chronically infected C91-PL cells, knockout of COL4A2 impaired Gag transfer between infected T-cells and acceptor T-cells, while release of virus-like particles was unaffected. Taken together, we identified COL4 (COL4A1, COL4A2) as a component of the VB and a novel cellular target of Tax with COL4A2 appearing to impact virus transmission. Thus, this study is the first to provide a link between Tax's activity and VB formation by hijacking COL4 protein functions.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Millen, Gross, Donhauser, Mann, Peloponese and Thoma-Kress.']","['Millen, Sebastian', 'Gross, Christine', 'Donhauser, Norbert', 'Mann, Melanie C', 'Peloponese, Jean-Marie Jr', 'Thoma-Kress, Andrea K']","['Millen S', 'Gross C', 'Donhauser N', 'Mann MC', 'Peloponese JM Jr', 'Thoma-Kress AK']",,"['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'IRIM-UMR 9004, Research Institute in Infectiology of Montpellier, CNRS, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191023,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['COL4A1', 'COL4A2', 'HTLV-1', 'Tax-1', 'collagen 4', 'collagen IV', 'viral biofilm', 'virus transmission']",2019/11/12 06:00,2019/11/12 06:01,['2019/11/12 06:00'],"['2019/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2019.02439 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2019 Oct 23;10:2439. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2019.02439. eCollection 2019.,PMC6819499,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They can, however, accompany intrathoracic malignancies and, most commonly, lymphomas. An association of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) with chylopericardium has rarely been reported. A 68-year-old woman with cll, previously treated with single-agent fludarabine in the community, developed pleuritic chest pain and a new pericardial effusion. Computed tomography (ct) imaging of her chest revealed a large pericardial effusion with progressive lymphadenopathy. Pericardiocentesis identified a chylous effusion, and complete evacuation was achieved by catheter drainage. The cll was not treated. An asymptomatic pericardial effusion subsequently recurred. Pericardiocentesis was not repeated. Lymph node biopsy and flow cytometry revealed no evidence of large-cell lymphoma transformation. The patient was treated with 6 cycles of chlorambucil and obinutuzumab. Imaging of her chest by ct between cycles 2 and 3 revealed a marked resolution of the intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, with complete disappearance of the pericardial effusion. Repeat imaging at 5 months and again at 3 years after completion of chemotherapy demonstrated no recurrence of either the lymphadenopathy or the pericardial effusion. The mechanism of production and the treatment of chylous effusions are poorly defined.

Study design: We describe the case of a nine-year-old boy treated for acute myeloid leukemia at 15 months of age, who presents several dental abnormalities resulting from anticancer treatment. Results: The patient was included and treated according to the ELAM 02 French protocol. Six years after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the intraoral and radiographic examination highlighted the agenesis of the second permanent molars and three of the four second premolars, microdontia of the first premolars, root stunting of the central incisors and first premolars, rootlessness of the first permanent molars, and enamel defects localized at the permanent incisors and canines. As a first step to reduce enamel defects, restorations with resin composite (Tetric EvoCeram(R) A2, Ivoclar Vivadent) were performed under a dental dam. Orthodontic treatment was contraindicated due to arrested tooth development, short roots, and a risk of resorption is considered too important. Conclusion: The young age at diagnosis (<5 years of age) and intensive chemotherapy (especially myeloablative conditioning with high doses of cyclophosphamide and Busulfan) could explain the severity of the dental abnormalities.

LukS-PV, one of the two components of Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL), is produced by Staphylococcus aureus. The present study showed that LukS-PV can induce apoptosis in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) lines (THP-1 and HL-60). However, the role of LukS-PV in NSCLC is unclear. In this study, we treated NSCLC cell lines A549 and H460 and a normal lung cell line, 16HBE, with LukS-PV and investigated the biological roles of LukS-PV in NSCLC. Cells were treated with varying concentrations of LukS-PV and cell viability was evaluated by CCK8 and EdU assay. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis and analyze the cell cycle, and the expression of apoptosis and cell cycle-associated proteins and genes were identified by western blotting analysis and qRT-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. We found that LukS-PV inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells but had little cytotoxicity in normal lung cells. LukS-PV induced NSCLC cell apoptosis and increased the BAX/BCL-2 ratio, triggering S-phase arrest in A549 and H460cells while increasing P21 expression and decreasing CDK2, cyclin D1, and cyclin A2 expression. We also observed increased P-p38 and P-ERK in NSCLC cells treated with LukS-PV. Treatment of NSCLC with LukS-PV combined with p38 and ERK inhibitors reversed the pro-apoptotic and pro-cell cycle arrest effects of LukS-PV. Overall, these findings indicate that LukS-PV has anti-tumor effects in NSCLC and may contribute to the development of anti-cancer agents.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we developed a small-molecule BRD4 and PLK1 degrader HBL-4 based on PROTAC technology, which leads to fast, efficient, and prolonged degradation of BRD4 and PLK1 in MV4-11cells tested in vitro and vivo, and potent anti-proliferation and BRD4 and PLK1 degradation ability in human acute leukemia MOLM-13 and KG1 cells. Meanwhile, HBL-4 more effectively suppresses c-Myc levels than inhibitor BI2536, resulting in more effective inducing apoptosis activity in MV4-11cells. At the same time, HBL-4 induced dramatically improved efficacy in the MV4-11 tumor xenograft model as compared with BI2536.

Specifically, we evaluated the adequacy of a single-factor measurement model for the QLQ-C30, and its known-groups validity and responsiveness to change over time. METHODS: We used confirmatory factor analysis to test the single-factor model of the QLQ-C30, using baseline QLQ-C30 data (N = 2134). The QLQ-C30 summary score was compared to the original QLQ-C30 scales using general (age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, comorbidity) and disease-specific (red blood cell transfusion dependency) groups. Repeated measurements allowed us to investigate responsiveness to change in a subgroup of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: The single-factor model of the QLQ-C30 exhibited adequate fit in patients with hematologic malignancies. Known-group comparisons generally supported the construct validity of the summary score when using more general grouping variables (sociodemographics, broad clinical parameters). Nevertheless, when groups were formed on the basis of disease-specific variables (eg, transfusion dependency), the summary score performed less well the some of the original, separate scales of the QLQ-C30. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide support for the validity of the single-factor model of the EORTC QLQ-C30 in patients with hematologic malignancies. Specifically, the results suggest that the summary score can be used as an endpoint in this population when symptom- or other health domain-specific hypotheses are not available.","['Copyright (c) 2019 ISPOR-The Professional Society for Health Economics and', 'Outcomes Research.

METHODS: Twenty-four survivors of ALL were assigned to usual care (control group, n = 12, 11.0 +/- 3.7 years) or to a home-exercise programme (intervention group, n = 12, 11.8 +/- 4.3 years). Peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak ml/kg/min), minute ventilation (VE L/min), output of carbon dioxide (VCO2 L/min), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), peak heart rate (beats/min), maximal load (W), VO2 at anaerobic threshold (VO2 at AT, ml/kg/min), pulse oxygen (PO2 ml/beat), heart rate at anaerobic threshold (beats/min), handgrip test (pounds), flexibility (cm), Timed Up & Go test TUG (s), and Timed Up and Down Stairs test (TUDS s) were measured at baseline and over 16 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: Adjusted mixed linear models revealed a significant group-time interaction + 6.7 (95% CI = 0.6-12.8 ml/kg/min; eta(2) partial = 0.046, P = 0.035) for VO2peak. Similarly, changes in mean values were observed after the home-exercise programme compared with baseline for VE (L/min) - 8.8 (3.0) (P = 0.035), VCO2 - 0.2 (0.08), (P = 0.041), maximal load (W) - 35.5 (12.8) (P = 0.024), TUDS (s) 0.8 (2.6) (P = 0.010), and TUG (s) 0.6 (0.1) (P = 0.001); however, the group-time interaction was not significant. CONCLUSION: The home-exercise programme resulted in changes in measures of VO2peak, VE, VCO2, and functional capacity during daily life activities (TUDS and TUG test).

To investigate outcomes and prognostic factors, we investigated 90 pediatric AML patients with KMT2A rearrangement after allogeneic HSCT. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed Japanese registration data for patients who had received allogeneic HSCT between 1988 and 2011. Median age was 3 years (range, 0-15 years), and no gender difference was evident. Median observation period was 119 months. RESULTS: The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate of KMT2A-rearranged AML was 52.1% (95% confidence interval (CI), 42.4-64%, n=90), and the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 46.7% (95%CI, 36.8-58.2%). The 3-year DFS of KMT2A-rearranged AML was not significantly poorer than that of other AML (P=0.09), and no significant difference was also seen in 3-year OS rate (P=0.21). Multivariate analysis showed disease status (complete remission) at HSCT was associated with better outcomes. A significant difference in treatment-related mortality (TRM) was apparent between HSCT from a HLA full-matched related donor and that from a haploidentical donor (P=0.001). DISCUSSION: HSCT is a curative option for pediatric AML with KMT2A rearrangement. Pretransplant status was the most significant prognostic indicator for relapse and survival. Enhancing supportive therapy to reduce TRM will further improve treatment outcomes of KMT2A-rearranged pediatric AML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therapy-related leukemia is mainly caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). In addition to the intrinsic mechanism, some extrinsic events occurring in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment are also possible mechanisms involved in genetic alteration. In the present study, we investigated the damage to BM stromal cells induced by a chemotherapy drug, daunorubicin (DNR) and further identified the DNA damage in hematopoietic cells caused by drug-treated stromal cells. It was found that treatment with DNR in mice caused a temporary reduction in cell number in each BM stromal cell subpopulation and the impairment of clonal growth potential in BM stromal cells. DNR treatment led to a tendency of senescence, generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, production of cytokines and chemokines, and dysfunction of mitochondrial in stromal cells. Transcriptome microarray data and gene ontology (GO) or gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that differentially expressed genes that were down-regulated in response to DNR treatment were significantly enriched in mitochondrion function, and negative regulators of reactive oxygen species. Surprisingly, it was found that DNR-treated stromal cells secreted high levels of H2O2 into the culture supernatant. Furthermore, coculture of hematopoietic cells with DNR-treated stromal cells led to the accumulation of DNA damage as determined by the levels of histone H2AX phosphorylation and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in hematopoietic cells. Overall, our results suggest that DNR-induced BM stromal cell damage can lead to genomic instability in hematopoietic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We also assessed the effects of busulfan on encephalic weight and cortical morphometry at 28 days of postnatal life. As a result, busulfan-induced pathological changes included: microcephaly, evaluated by the reduction of cranial axes, delay in reflex maturation and physical features, as well as a decrease in the morphometric parameters of somatosensory and motor cortex.

More than 60% of BLV-infected cattle remain subclinical and are thus referred to as aleukemic (AL) cattle. Approximately 30% of infected cattle show a relatively stable increase in the number of B lymphocytes; these cattle are termed persistent lymphocytosis (PL) cattle. A small percentage of infected cattle develop BLV-induced B cell lymphoma (EBL) and are called EBL cattle. Due to the increase in the number of BLV-infected cattle, the number of EBL cattle has featured a corresponding increase over recent years in Japan. Several diagnostic criteria for EBL (e.g., enlarged superficial lymph nodes, protrusion of the eye, increased peripheral blood lymphocyte, etc.) are used for on-farm diagnosis and antemortem tests at slaughterhouses. Since the slaughter of EBL cattle for human consumption is not allowed, on-farm detection of EBL cattle is important for reducing the economic loss incurred by farms. Therefore, establishing new diagnostic markers to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the antemortem detection of EBL cattle is a critical, unmet need. To simultaneously evaluate the utility of candidate markers, this study measured the values of each marker using the blood samples of 687 cattle with various clinical statuses of BLV infection (EBL, PL, AL and non-infected cattle). RESULTS: Sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) were highest for the serum thymidine kinase (TK) followed by the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozyme 2. The number of peripheral blood lymphocytes and proviral load in peripheral blood had the lowest Se and Sp. The values of all markers other than TK were influenced by the sex of the tested cattle. CONCLUSIONS: Although tLDH and its isozymes (LDHs) may be influenced by the sex of the tested cattle, the high accuracy of TK and LDH2 as well as accessibility and simplicity of the protocol used to measure these enzymes recommend the utility of TK and LDHs for EBL cattle detection. Using these markers for screening followed by the application of existing diagnostic criteria may improve the efficiency and accuracy of EBL cattle detection on farms, thereby contributing to the reduction of economic losses in farms.",,"['Konishi, Misako', 'Kobayashi, Sota', 'Tokunaga, Taeko', 'Chiba, Yuzumi', 'Tsutsui, Toshiyuki', 'Arai, Shozo', 'Kameyama, Ken-Ichiro', 'Yamamoto, Takehisa']","['Konishi M', 'Kobayashi S', 'Tokunaga T', 'Chiba Y', 'Tsutsui T', 'Arai S', 'Kameyama KI', 'Yamamoto T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8707-0639'],"['Epidemiology Unit, Division of Viral Disease and Epidemiology, National Institute of Animal Health, NARO 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0856, Japan.', 'Parasitic Disease Unit, Division of Bacterial and Parasitic Disease, National Institute of Animal Health, NARO 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0856, Japan.', 'Kumamoto Meat Inspection Office, 1341, Shichijomachisosaki, Kikuchi, Kumamoto, Kumamoto, 861-1344, Japan.', 'Iwate Prefecture Central Livestock Hygiene Service Center, 390-5 Sunagome, Takizawa, Iwate, 020-0605, Japan.', 'Director-General, National Institute of Animal Health, NARO 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0856, Japan.', 'Clinical Biochemistry Unit, Division of Pathology and Pathophysiology, National Institute of Animal Health, NARO 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0856, Japan.', 'National Institute of Animal Health, NARO, Exotic Diseases Research Station Josuihoncho, Kodaira, Tokyo, 187-0022, Japan.', 'Epidemiology Unit, Division of Viral Disease and Epidemiology, National Institute of Animal Health, NARO 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0856, Japan. mtbook@affrc.go.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191109,England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biomarkers', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*blood/*diagnosis/virology', 'Female', 'Isoenzymes/blood', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Leukocyte Count/veterinary', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Thymidine Kinase/blood']",['NOTNLM'],"['Biomarker', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic bovine leukosis', 'Lactate dehydrogenase', 'Thymidine kinase']",2019/11/11 06:00,2020/03/24 06:00,['2019/11/11 06:00'],"['2019/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12917-019-2158-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12917-019-2158-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2019 Nov 9;15(1):406. doi: 10.1186/s12917-019-2158-4.,PMC6842470,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with the number of CAR T cell-treated patients increasing, observations of tumor escape and resistance to CAR T cell therapy with disease relapse are demonstrating the current limitations of this therapeutic modality. Mechanisms hampering CAR T cell efficiency include limited T cell persistence, caused for example by T cell exhaustion and activation-induced cell death (AICD), as well as therapy-related toxicity. Furthermore, the physical properties, antigen heterogeneity and immunosuppressive capacities of solid tumors have prevented the success of CAR T cells in these entities.

These cases present a complex clinical challenge, with a high incidence in infants, high-risk clinical features and propensity for aggressive relapse. KMT2A rearrangements are highly pathogenic leukaemic drivers, reflected by the high incidence of KMT2Ar ALL in infants, who carry few leukaemia-associated cooperative mutations. However, transgenic murine models of KMT2Ar ALL typically exhibit long latency and mature or mixed phenotype, and fail to recapitulate the aggressive disease observed clinically. Next-generation sequencing has revealed that KMT2Ar ALL also occurs in adolescents and adults, and potentially cooperative genomic lesions such as PI3K-RAS pathway variants are present in KMT2Ar patients of all ages. This review addresses the aetiology of KMT2Ar ALL, with a focus on the cell of origin and mutational landscape, and how genomic profiling of KMT2Ar ALL patients in the era of next-generation sequencing demonstrates that KMT2Ar ALL is a complex heterogenous disease. Ultimately, understanding the underlying biology of KMT2Ar ALL will be important in improving long-term outcomes for these high-risk patients.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.

BL and B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL/LBL) differ as regards treatment and the distinction between these two entities is crucial. Patients demonstrating a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-positive precursor B cell phenotype with IGH-MYC rearrangement have been reported to be molecularly distinct from BL and closer to B-ALL/LBL. We investigated the molecular characteristics of two cases of a rare but distinct TdT-negative precursor B cell phenotype BL. Both patients showed FAB L3 morphology with IGH-MYC translocation, but had precursor B cell immunophenotypes including dim to moderate expression of CD45 and absence of BCL6, CD20, monoclonal kappa, and lambda light chain expression. To characterize the molecular features, we performed exome sequencing and analyzed the breakpoint junction of the IGH-MYC rearrangement. We detected KMT2D mutations in both cases, a rarely acquired chromatin modifying gene mutation in BL. The breakpoint analysis revealed that the IGH-MYC rearrangement occurred due to an aberrant VDJ recombination in one case. The treatment protocols differed, including high-grade lymphoma treatment and standard B-ALL treatment. Complete remission was achieved in the patient who received B-ALL treatment. The degree of resemblance of BL and B-ALL differed between two cases, but the molecular pathogenesis and manifesting features of both TdT-negative precursor B cell phenotype BL case were distinct from classic BL, which indicates the need for a better understanding of this uncommon entity that does not fit in current diagnostic and classification categories.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Yoon, Jung', 'Yun, Jae Won', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Ju, Hee Young', 'Koo, Hong Hoe', 'Kim, Sun-Hee', 'Kim, Hee-Jin']","['Yoon J', 'Yun JW', 'Jung CW', 'Ju HY', 'Koo HH', 'Kim SH', 'Kim HJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9296-5085'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191126,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",['NOTNLM'],"['* MYC', '*B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma', '*Burkitt lymphoma']",2019/11/11 06:00,2020/10/06 06:00,['2019/11/10 06:00'],"['2019/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22825 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2020 Apr;59(4):255-260. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22825.

There are no data on changes in myocardial mechanics from standard of care low-dose anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy in older patients with AML. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potential utility of strain imaging in detecting early changes in left ventricular function in this patient population after induction chemotherapy. METHODS: Thirty two patients enrolled in the ECOG-ACRIN E2906 study (cytarabine and daunorubicin vs clofarabine [Genzyme/Sanofi]) from 2011 to 2014 were evaluated retrospectively. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) imaging with Doppler and two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) using EchoInsight software (Epsilon imaging) were performed before and after induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: Eighteen patients received cytarabine and daunorubicin (7 + 3) and 14 received clofarabine. The clofarabine group was older than the 7 + 3 cohort (67.8 +/- 4.0 vs 63.7 +/- 3.8, P = .007). There were no other significant differences in cardiac risk factors between groups. The 7 + 3 group had a decrease in average peak systolic global longitudinal (-19.1 +/- 2.8 to -17.2 +/- 3.0, P = .01) and circumferential strain (-29.4 +/- 6.3 to -23.9 +/- 4.3, P = .011). These changes were not demonstrated in the clofarabine group and were not associated with a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). CONCLUSIONS: In older AML patients, standard cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy causes early changes in global longitudinal and circumferential strain not seen with clofarabine therapy. These findings demonstrate subclinical left ventricular dysfunction after exposure to low cumulative doses of anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy and may help us better identify those patients at risk for adverse long-term cardiovascular outcomes.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Cascino, Gregory J', 'Voss, Woo Bin', 'Canaani, Jonathan', 'Furiasse, Nicholas', 'Rademaker, Alfred', 'Ky, Bonnie', 'Luger, Selina', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Foran, James M', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Rigolin, Vera', 'Akhter, Nausheen']","['Cascino GJ', 'Voss WB', 'Canaani J', 'Furiasse N', 'Rademaker A', 'Ky B', 'Luger S', 'Altman JK', 'Foran JM', 'Litzow MR', 'Tallman MS', 'Rigolin V', 'Akhter N']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3642-2542'],"['Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Cardiology, North Shore Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Preventative Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematologic Oncology, Sloan Kettering Memorial Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['UG1 CA233290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA232760/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180791/National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of', 'Health/International', 'CA180790/National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of', 'Health/International', 'CA180794/National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of', 'Health/International', 'CA180820/National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of', 'Health/International', 'UG1 CA233320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001422/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20191108,United States,Echocardiography,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)",8511187,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Clofarabine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Echocardiography/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Ventricles/diagnostic imaging/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stroke Volume/drug effects/physiology', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*chemically induced/diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects/physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*anthracyclines', '*cardiotoxicity', '*left ventricular function', '*two-dimensional speckle-tracking strain']",2019/11/11 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2019/11/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/echo.14518 [doi]'],ppublish,Echocardiography. 2019 Nov;36(11):2033-2040. doi: 10.1111/echo.14518.

Driver mutations have emerged as valuable markers for defining risk groups and as candidates for targeted treatment approaches in MDS. It is also evident that the risk of transformation to sAML is increased by evasion of adaptive immune surveillance. This study was designed to explore the immune microenvironment, immunogenic tumor-intrinsic mechanisms (HLA and PD-L1 expression), and tumor genetic features (somatic mutations and altered karyotypes) in MDS patients and to determine their influence on the progression of the disease. We detected major alterations of the immune microenvironment in MDS patients, with a reduced count of CD4(+) T cells, a more frequent presence of markers related to T cell exhaustion, a more frequent presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and changes in the functional phenotype of NK cells. HLA Class I (HLA-I) expression was normally expressed in CD34(+) blasts and during myeloid differentiation. Only two out of thirty-six patients with homozygosity for HLA-C groups acquired complete copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity in the HLA region. PD-L1 expression on the leukemic clone was also increased in MDS patients. Finally, no interplay was observed between the anti-tumor immune microenvironment and mutational genomic features. In summary, extrinsic and intrinsic immunological factors might severely impair immune surveillance and contribute to clonal immune escape. Genomic alterations appear to make an independent contribution to the clonal evolution and progression of MDS.",,"['Montes, Paola', 'Bernal, Monica', 'Campo, Laura N', 'Gonzalez-Ramirez, Amanda Rocio', 'Jimenez, Pilar', 'Garrido, Pilar', 'Jurado, Manuel', 'Garrido, Federico', 'Ruiz-Cabello, Francisco', 'Hernandez, Francisca']","['Montes P', 'Bernal M', 'Campo LN', 'Gonzalez-Ramirez AR', 'Jimenez P', 'Garrido P', 'Jurado M', 'Garrido F', 'Ruiz-Cabello F', 'Hernandez F']",,"['Servicio de Analisis Clinicos e Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Avda.

Whereas initial treatment with AraC is usually successful, most AML patients tend to relapse, and AraC treatment-induced mutagenesis may contribute to the development of chemo-resistant leukemic clones.

Furthermore, we present high-resolution crystal structures of human Poleta with a template AraC residue positioned opposite correct (G) and incorrect (A) incoming deoxynucleotides. We show that Poleta can accommodate local perturbation caused by the AraC via specific hydrogen bonding and maintain a reaction-ready active site alignment for insertion of both correct and incorrect incoming nucleotides.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biochemical and molecular methodologies were used to evaluate whether tissue transglutaminase (TG2) confers steroid resistance in T-ALL. RESULTS: T-ALL cells were found to express elevated levels of TG2. Models of steroid-adapted subclones of T-ALL cell lines which were notably less sensitive to steroids than the parental cells. The steroid-adapted subclones showed increased TG2 expression and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity compared to T-ALL parental cells. Inhibition of TG2 suppressed steroid resistance and improved steroid cytotoxicity in steroid-adapted subclones of T-ALL in association with reduced NF-kappaB activity.

Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of oncogenic BCR-ABL protein expressed by chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, possesses off-targets including LCK expressed in T cells. We showed that imatinib-treated CML patients in complete molecular remission (CMR) exhibited selective depletion of effector T reg (eT reg) cells and significant increase in effector/memory CD8+ T cells while non-CMR patients did not. Imatinib at CML-therapeutic concentrations indeed induced apoptosis specifically in eT reg cells and expanded tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vitro in healthy individuals and melanoma patients, and suppressed colon tumor growth in vivo in mice. Mechanistically, because of FoxP3-dependent much lower expression of LCK and ZAP-70 in T reg cells compared with other T cells, imatinib inhibition of LCK further reduced their TCR signal intensity, rendering them selectively susceptible to signal-deprived apoptotis.

Results. Four individuals from two pedigrees harboured one novel or one previously described variant in the central domain of ETV6 (c.592C>T, p.Gln198* or c.641C>T, p.Pro241Leu, respectively). Neutropenia was an accompanying feature in one of these families that also harboured a variant in RUNX1 (c.1098_1103dup, p.Ile366_Gly367dup), while in the other, an autism-spectrum disorder was observed. In the third family, the index patient suffered from HD-ALL and life-threatening pulmonary mucor mycosis, and had a positive family history of 'immune' thrombocytopenia. Genetic analyses revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in the ETS domain of ETV6 (c.1136T>C, p.Leu379Pro) along with absence of heterozygosity of chromosome (10)(q21.2q21.3), yielding a biallelic leukaemia risk allele in ARID5B (rs7090445-C). The neutrophil function was normal in all individuals tested, and the platelet immune histochemistry of all three pedigrees showed delta-storage-pool defect-like features and cytoskeletal defects. Conclusions. Our clinical observations and results of high-resolution genetic analyses extend the spectrum of possible phenotypes cosegregating with ETV6 germline mutations. Further, we propose ARID5B as potential leukaemogenic cofactor in patients with ETV6-linked leukaemia predisposition and familial thrombocytopenia syndrome.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

By studying a large Japanese transplant registry, we compared transplant outcomes between patients heterozygous for HLA-C(Asn80)/C(Lys80) (HLA-C1/C2) and those homozygous for HLA-C1 (HLA-C1/C1) among patients who had undergone HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A high frequency of KIR2DL1 with strong HLA-C2 binding capacity and a low frequency of HLA-C2 and KIR haplotype B are characteristic of the Japanese population. In our previous report, HLA-C1/C1 patients with myeloid leukemia were less likely to relapse than HLA-C1/C2 patients. We newly assessed 2884 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received HLA-matched allogeneic HSCT and analyzed their leukemia relapses by using adjusted competing-risk methods. HLA-C1/C1 patients with ALL experienced significantly higher relapse rates than HLA-C1/C2 patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.55, P = .003), contrary to our results in patients with myeloid leukemia. We allocated patients with ALL to several subgroups and found a higher frequency of relapse (HR >1.8) in the HLA-C1/C1 group than in the HLA-C1/C2 group among patients with Ph-negative ALL, those who had no cytomegalovirus reactivation, those who received transplants from donors who were aged 41 years or older, and those who experienced acute graft-versus-host disease, especially if it required systemic treatment. One interpretation of our results is that KIR2DL1-positive NK cells disrupt T cells, antigen-presenting cells, or both from working efficiently in transplant immunity in HLA-C1/C1 patients with ALL. Another is that KIR2DS1-positive NK cells directly attack HLA-C2-positive ALL blasts in HLA-C1/C2 patients. Whether HLA-C2 can cause recurrence to decrease or increase in patients depending on the disease (ALL or myeloid leukemia) will be a very important finding. We hope that our results will provide clues to the real mechanisms behind relapse after transplantation in patients with different HLA profiles.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Preliminary clinical data indicates that checkpoint inhibition also represents a promising therapeutic strategy for certain lymphoid malignancies. However, PD-1/PD-L1 expression levels on neoplastic cells and in the tumor microenvironment vary among subtypes and their prognostic implications remain uncertain. MAIN BODY: Here, we review the clinicopathological significance of PD-1/PD-L1 expression in lymphomas. Increased infiltration of PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a favorable prognostic factor in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) but not in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Higher numbers of PD-1+ TILs were observed in follicular lymphoma (FL) than in other subtypes of B-cell lymphoma; however, its prognostic significance remains controversial. Infiltration of PD-L1+ immune cells showed a trend toward better overall survival in nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, more likely to be classified as activated macrophages and dendritic cells in microenvironment but its biological effect is not clarified. Peripheral PD-1+ T cells could be detected in blood samples from DLBCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and correlated with disease progression and poor prognosis. PD-1+ neoplastic T cells were more frequently observed in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, including Sezary syndrome and mycosis fungoides, which may be involved in the progression of epithelial-derived T lymphoma. Studies on PD-L1 expression in neoplastic cells mostly focused on DLBCL. PD-L1+ neoplastic cells were observed only in a small subset of DLBCL, mainly associated with activated B cell (ABC) subtypes and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity; however, its prognostic role remains controversial. In either T or B lymphoma, elevated serum or plasma levels of soluble PD-L1 represent adverse prognostic factors. Notably, in clinical trials of classical HL, the frequency of 9p24.1 chromosome alterations increases the abundance of PD-1 ligand expression, appearing to predict responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. The cytogenetic alterations affecting chromosome 9p24.1 including the CIITA rearrangement were also frequently observed in certain specific subtypes of large B-cell lymphomas. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical roles of PD-1/PD-L1 expression vary between subtypes of lymphoma. Future studies should delineate the prognostic and predictive roles of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recent findings suggest that DNMT3A mutant acts as a founder mutation and requires additional genetic events to induce full-blown AML. Here, we investigated the cooperation of mutant DNMT3A and NRAS in leukemogenesis by generating a double knock-in (DKI) mouse model harboring both Dnmt3a R878H and Nras G12D mutations. METHODS: DKI mice with both Dnmt3a R878H and Nras G12D mutations were generated by crossing Dnmt3a R878H knock-in (KI) mice and Nras G12D KI mice. Routine blood test, flow cytometry analysis and morphological analysis were performed to determine disease phenotype. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), RT-PCR and Western blot were carried out to reveal the molecular mechanism. RESULTS: The DKI mice developed a more aggressive AML with a significantly shortened lifespan and higher percentage of blast cells compared with KI mice expressing Dnmt3a or Nras mutation alone. RNA-seq analysis showed that Dnmt3a and Nras mutations collaboratively caused abnormal expression of a series of genes related to differentiation arrest and growth advantage. Myc transcription factor and its target genes related to proliferation and apoptosis were up-regulated, thus contributing to promote the process of leukemogenesis.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old female patient was admitted with a 3-month history of cough. She was initially diagnosed with bronchogenic carcinoma according to chest computed tomography (CT). However, after a biopsy was taken from the endobronchial lesion by bronchoscopy and further immunohistochemical analysis was performed, the diagnosis of MS was made. Because her bone marrow was normal and she had no history of haematologic diseases, we further considered the diagnosis of primary bronchial MS. The patient received chemotherapy with HAG regimens, and the original mass completely resolved, as confirmed by chest CT scan after 3 cycles of treatment. Meanwhile, no abnormalities were found on re-examination via bronchoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: MS should be considered in the differential diagnosis in the presence of a suspicious pulmonary mass. Immunohistochemical analysis is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

As human castrate-resistant PCa shares several characteristics with the canine disease, comparative evaluation of novel therapeutic agents is of considerable value for both species. Novel isoquinolinamine FX-9 exhibits antiproliferative activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines but has not been tested yet on any solid neoplasia type. In this study, FX-9's mediated effects were characterized on two human (PC-3, LNCaP) and two canine (CT1258, 0846) PCa cell lines, as well as benign solid tissue cells. FX-9 significantly inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis with concentrations in the low micromolar range. Mediated effects were highly comparable between the PCa cell lines of both species, but less pronounced on non-malignant chondrocytes and fibroblasts. Interestingly, FX-9 exposure also leads to the formation and survival of enlarged multinucleated cells through mitotic slippage. Based on the results, FX-9 acts as an anti-mitotic agent with reduced cytotoxic activity in benign cells.

Other mechanisms of Wnt activation in AML have been described such as Wnt antagonist inactivation through promoter methylation. Wnt signalling is necessary for the maintenance of leukaemic stem cells. Several molecules involved in or modulating Wnt signalling have a prognostic value in AML. These include: beta-catenin, LEF-1, phosphorylated-GSK3beta, PSMD2, PPARD, XPNPEP, sFRP2, RUNX1, AXIN2, PCDH17, CXXC5, LLGL1 and PTK7.

The adoptive transfer of a titrated number of T cells genetically modified with a gene suicide can improve immune reconstitution and represents an interesting strategy to enhance the success of haplo-HSCT. Natural killer (NK) cells are the first donor-derived lymphocyte population to reconstitute following transplantation, and play a pivotal role in mediating graft-versus-leukaemia (GvL). We recently described a CD56(low)CD16(low) NK cell subset that mediates both cytotoxic activity and cytokine production. Given the multifunctional properties of this subset, we studied its functional recovery in a cohort of children given alpha/betaT-cell-depleted haplo-HSCT followed by the infusion of a titrated number of iCasp-9-modified T cells (iCasp-9 HSCT). The data obtained indicate that multifunctional CD56(low)CD16(low) NK cell frequency is similar to that of healthy donors (HD) at all time points analysed, showing enrichment in the bone marrow (BM). Interestingly, with regard to functional acquisition, we identified two groups of patients, namely those whose NK cells did (responder) or did not (non responder) degranulate or produce cytokines. Moreover, in patients analysed for both functions, we observed that the acquisition of degranulation capacity was not associated with the ability to produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma Intriguingly, we found a higher BM and peripheral blood (PB) frequency of iCas9 donor T cells only in patients characterized by the ability of CD56(low)CD16(low) NK cells to degranulate. Collectively, these findings suggest that donor iCasp9-T lymphocytes do not have a significant influence on NK cell reconstitution, even if they may positively affect the acquisition of target-induced degranulation of CD56(low)CD16(low) NK cells in the T-cell-depleted haplo-HSC transplanted patients.",,"['Stabile, Helena', 'Nisti, Paolo', 'Fionda, Cinzia', 'Pagliara, Daria', 'Gaspari, Stefania', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Santoni, Angela', 'Gismondi, Angela']","['Stabile H', 'Nisti P', 'Fionda C', 'Pagliara D', 'Gaspari S', 'Locatelli F', 'Santoni A', 'Gismondi A']",,"['Department of Molecular Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, Laboratory affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, Laboratory affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, Laboratory affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, 00165 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, 00165 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, 00165 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sapienza, University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, Laboratory affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, Laboratory affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['code. 9962/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', ""code. 20174T7NXL_003/Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca""]",['Journal Article'],20191107,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow transplantation', 'NK cell subsets', 'haematological disease', 'iCasp-9 HSCT']",2019/11/11 06:00,2019/11/11 06:01,['2019/11/10 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/11 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm8111904 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm8111904 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2019 Nov 7;8(11). pii: jcm8111904. doi: 10.3390/jcm8111904.,PMC6912839,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies have indicated that C1/C20 double-modification of SAL is a useful strategy to generate diverse agents with promising biological activity profiles. Thus, herein we describe the synthesis of a new class of SAL analogues that combine key modifications at the C1 and C20 positions. The activity of the obtained SAL derivatives was evaluated using primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia, human breast adenocarcinoma and normal mammary epithelial cells. One single- [N,N-dipropyl amide of salinomycin (5 a)] and two novel double-modified analogues [N,N-dipropyl amide of C20-oxosalinomycin (5 b) and piperazine amide of C20-oxosalinomycin (13 b)] were found to be more potent toward the MDA-MB-231 cell line than SAL or its C20-oxo analogue 2. When select analogues were tested against the NCI-60 human tumor cell line panel, 4 a [N,N-diethyl amide of salinomycin] showed particular activity toward the ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3. Additionally, both SAL and 2 were found to be potent ex vivo against human ER/PR(+) , Her2(-) invasive mammary carcinoma, with 2 showing minimal toxicity toward normal epithelial cells. The present findings highlight the therapeutic potential of SAL derivatives for select targeting of different cancer types.","['(c) 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Workers occupationally exposed to BD in the workplace have an increased incidence of leukemia and lymphoma. BD undergoes cytochrome P450-mediated metabolic activation to 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EB), 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB) and 1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-epoxybutane (EBD), which form covalent adducts with DNA. We have previously reported a quantitative nanoLC/ESI+-HRMS3 method for urinary N7-(1-hydroxy-3-buten-2-yl) guanine (EB-GII) adducts as a mechanism-based biomarker of BD exposure. In the present study, the method was updated to include high throughput 96-well solid phase extraction (SPE) and employed to establish urinary EB-GII biomarker stability and association with smoking. Urinary EB-GII levels were measured bimonthly for 1 year in 19 smokers to determine whether single adduct measurement provides reliable levels of EB-GII in an individual smoker. In addition, association of EB-GII with smoking was studied in 17 individuals participating in a smoking cessation program. EB-GII levels decreased 34% upon smoking cessation, indicating that it is associated with smoking status, but may also originate from sources other than exposure to cigarette smoke.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Recommended optimal treatment of SIDM includes similar glucose lowering strategies as in type 2 diabetes. This typical management cannot cure the disease, it can only control blood glucose. Recently, bariatric surgery has emerged as an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, up to now, the usefulness of bariatric surgery in treatment of SIDM has not been evaluated. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old female oncologic patient with steroid induced diabetes was referred for surgical treatment to the Department of General and Transplant Surgery in November 2009. Six years earlier, she underwent successful oncologic treatment with cladribine and high doses of steroids due to hairy cell leukemia. Finally complete hematologic remission with normalization of morphology and reduction of spleen size has been obtained. Prior to steroid treatment, blood glucose and urine examinations were within normal range. The patient was non-obese and had no family history of diabetes. Nevertheless, the patient developed diabetes secondary to corticosteroid therapy, poorly controlled by oral hypoglycemic agent (acarbosum), successfully converted to insulin therapy. Upon admission to the Department of General and Transplant Surgery, the patient was treated with 58 units of insulin per day. The patient was scheduled for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Insulin was withdrawn immediately after the surgery and within six months after the surgery, plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c-5.5%) levels reached and remained within normal range. Currently, eight years after surgery, body weight and BMI are 80 kg and 27.68 kg/m2, respectively. Plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin are also normal. Importantly, from an oncological point of view, the patient has remained in continuous complete remission since October 2003. CONCLUSIONS: Our report is the first to our knowledge describing the effect of gastric bypass surgery on SIDM in a patient with prior hematologic malignancy.

However, the function and expression profile of most circRNAs in osteosarcoma remain unclear. METHODS: We examined the expression of circEPSTI1, a circRNA, in 50 paired adjacent normal tissues and osteosarcoma tissues by qRT-PCR. Then, we further explored the function of circEPSTI1 in osteosarcoma progression in vitro and in vivo. For example, cell proliferation and migration were examined. Some experiments were performed to explore the regulatory function of circEPSTI1 in miRNA and to investigate the potential role of circEPSTI1 in osteosarcoma. RESULTS: We found that circEPSTI1 was significantly upregulated in osteosarcoma. Inhibition of circEPSTI1 suppressed the osteosarcoma cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro. Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that circEPSTI1 and MCL1 (myeloid cell leukaemia 1) could bind to miR-892b and that MCL1 and circEPSTI1 were targets of miR-892b. CONCLUSION: Thus, the circEPSTI1-miR-892b-MCL1 axis affected osteosarcoma progression through the miRNA sponging mechanism. circEPSTI1 may serve as a target and biomarker for osteosarcoma treatment.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Tan, Xinyu', 'Tan, Duxun', 'Li, Haomiao', 'Lin, Ye', 'Wen, Zhishen', 'Zeng, Canjun']","['Tan X', 'Tan D', 'Li H', 'Lin Y', 'Wen Z', 'Zeng C']",,"['Department of Orthopedics, Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Academy of Orthopedics Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510630, China.', 'Emergency Department, Nanhai Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Academy of Orthopedics Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510630, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Academy of Orthopedics Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510630, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Academy of Orthopedics Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510630, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Academy of Orthopedics Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510630, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (EPSTI1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN892 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Circular)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Circular/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*MCL1', '*circEPSTI1', '*circular RNAs', '*competitive endogenous RNAs', '*miR-892b', '*osteosarcoma.']",2019/11/09 06:00,2020/10/22 06:00,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCDT-EPUB-102174 [pii]', '10.2174/1568009619666191107140948 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2020;20(4):288-294. doi: 10.2174/1568009619666191107140948.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterise the key T-cell populations involved in this phenomenon, we used flow cytometry and 11 phenotypic markers to study 74 CLL patients and 14 controls. T cells of CLL patients were more phenotypically complex than those of healthy controls with significant increases in the frequencies of CD4 and CD8 memory T cells expressing exhaustion-, activation- and senescence-associated markers. Multivariate analysis of 111 different T-cell subsets showed that high frequencies of four subsets (three CD8 and one CD4) were associated with shorter progression-free survival. The most significant association was with CD4(+) HLA-DR(+) PD-1(+) T cells, and patients could be stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the frequency of these T cells. The expansion of this CD4(+) subset could not be accounted for by age, cytomegalovirus infection or increases in Treg cells. Overall, these results highlight two relatively simple biomarkers, percentage CD8(+) and percentage CD4(+) PD-1(+) HLA-DR(+) T cells, which can be used to risk-stratify CLL patients, independent of other tumour-associated markers.

The lncRNA deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (DLEU1) has been reported to be dysregulated in cancer cells and thus associated with tumor development; however, the role of DLEU1 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. In the present study, DLEU1 was knocked down using small interfering RNA in the RCC cell lines KETR3 and 786O to determine the role of DLEU1. Cell Counting Kit8, colony formation, Transwell and flow cytometry assays were performed to assess the effects of DLEU1 on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis in KETR3 and 786O cells. The protein expression levels of factors associated with apoptosis and epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) were examined by western blot. The results demonstrated that silencing DLEU1 decreased the growth capacity, migration and invasion of KETR3 and 786O cells. Additionally, loss of DLEU1 was observed to stimulate the mitochondrial pathway of cell apoptosis via regulation of the expression of Bcl2/Bax, cleaved caspase3 and cleaved caspase9 in KETR3 and 786O cells. Furthermore, DLEU1 knockdown significantly inhibited the protein kinase B (Akt) pathway by downregulating the expression of phosphorylatedAkt, cyclin D1 and P70S6 kinase. In addition, depletion of DLEU1 was observed to impair the process of EMT in RCC cells via the upregulation of Ecadherin, and downregulation of Ncadherin and vimentin. Collectively, these results indicated a prooncogenic role of DLEU1 in the progression and development of RCC via modulation of the Akt pathway and EMT phenotype.",,"['Yue, Genquan', 'Chen, Caixia', 'Bai, Ligang', 'Wang, Guoqiang', 'Huang, Yong', 'Wang, Yunbin', 'Cui, Hongwei', 'Xiao, Yunfeng']","['Yue G', 'Chen C', 'Bai L', 'Wang G', 'Huang Y', 'Wang Y', 'Cui H', 'Xiao Y']",,"['Department of Urology, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia 010000, P.R.

In this study, a new human myeloid leukemia cell line YBT-5 was established. After more than 1-year cultivation from the bone marrow of a patient with acute monocytic leukemia, YBT cell line was established. Then a subclone, YBT-5, was isolated from YBT using single cell sorting. Morphological and cytogenetical characterizations of the YBT-5 cell line were determined by cytochemical staining, flow cytometry analysis, and karyotype analysis. Molecular features were identified by transcriptomic analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. To establish a tumor model, 5 x 10(6) YBT-5 cells were injected subcutaneously in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficiency (NOD/SCID) mice. DOT1L has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for KMT2A-related leukemia; therefore, to explore the potential application of this new cell line, its sensitivity to a specific DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ004777 was measured ex vivo. The growth of YBT-5 does not depend on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Cytochemical staining showed that alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase staining was positive and partially inhibited by sodium fluoride, while peroxidase staining was negative. Flow cytometry analysis of YBT-5 cells showed positive myeloid and monocytic markers. Karyotype analysis of YBT-5 showed 48,XY,+8,+8. The breakpoints between KMT2A exon 10 and exon 11 (KMT2A exon 10/11) and MLLT3 exon 5 and exon 6 (MLLT3 exon 5/6) were identified, which was different from all known breakpoint locations, and a novel fusion transcript KMT2A exon 10/MLLT3 exon 6 was formed. A tumor model was established successfully in NOD/SCID mice. EPZ004777 could inhibit the proliferation and induce the differentiation of YBT-5 cells. Therefore, a new acute monocytic leukemia cell line with clear biological and molecular features was established and may be used in the research and development of new agents targeting KMT2A-associated leukemia.","['(c)2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Wang, Zhenhua', 'Shi, Yongjin', 'Liu, Huihui', 'Liang, Zeyin', 'Zhu, Qiang', 'Wang, Lihong', 'Tang, Bo', 'Miao, Shengchao', 'Ma, Ning', 'Cen, Xinan', 'Ren, Hanyun', 'Dong, Yujun']","['Wang Z', 'Shi Y', 'Liu H', 'Liang Z', 'Zhu Q', 'Wang L', 'Tang B', 'Miao S', 'Ma N', 'Cen X', 'Ren H', 'Dong Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7935-6194'],"['Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['7143183/Beijing Natural Science Foundation'],['Journal Article'],20191111,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['DOT1L inhibitor', 'KMT2A-associated leukemia', 'acute monocytic leukemia', 'cell line']",2019/11/09 06:00,2020/01/14 06:00,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2686 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2019 Dec;37(5):617-625. doi: 10.1002/hon.2686.

Patients were stratified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups according to the modified ATL-prognostic index. The model simulated life expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted LE (QALE).

To reduce the toxicity of MEL without losing its antileukemic effect, we formulated a regimen comprising FLU (125 mg/m(2)), MEL (100 mg/m(2)), and a non-myeloablative busulfan dosage [4 mg/kg orally (oral) or 3.2 mg/kg intravenously (iv); FLU/MEL/BU].

However, these drugs produce excellent responses for many patients, and this is accompanied by survival that is close to normal. This has prompted studies of whether it is possible to stop treatment, thus achieving a treatment-free remission (TFR). RECENT FINDINGS: Most TFR studies have focussed on abrupt cessation in patients with long-standing deep remissions, but recent data suggest that more gradual treatment de-escalation may improve TFR success, and that it may be possible to extend TFR attempts to patients who are in stable major molecular response but not necessarily MR4.

However, patient responses, although generally positive, remain heterogenous. Careful drug selection, ensuring the optimal TKI, is chosen for each patient and involves a complex decision process which incorporates consideration of numerous factors. RECENT FINDINGS: For some patients, with disease characteristics that indicate adverse intrinsic disease biology, more potent BCR-ABL1 inhibition is often appropriate, whereas other patients with major co-morbidities will benefit from a less aggressive approach to avoid life-shortening toxicities. For the vast majority of patients, the long-term goal of therapy will be the achievement of a deep molecular response and subsequent treatment-free remission and this consideration will play a large part in the drug selection process.

Cortisone and the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Britain, 1950-1960.",54,10.1007/s40656-019-0269-7 [doi],"Cortisone, initially known as 'compound E' was the medical sensation of the late 1940s and early 1950s. As early as April 1949, only a week after Philip Hench and colleagues first described the potential of 'compound E' at a Mayo Clinic seminar, the New York Times reported the drug's promise as a 'modern miracle' in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Given its high profile, it is unsurprising that historians of medicine have been attracted to study the innovation of cortisone. It arrived at the end of a decade of 'therapeutic revolutions', kicked off by penicillin transforming the treatment of bacterial infections and ending with hopes of a revolution in the treatment of non-infectious, chronic inflammatory diseases. Despite these studies of cortisone's introduction, few historians have taken the story forward and considered how cortisone was adopted and adapted into clinical practice. This article tells the longer of how the drug and its derivatives were taken from research laboratories and integrated into clinical practice; what has in recent decades become known as translational medicine (TM). In exploring cortisone's first decade in Britain, we focus specifically on its role in the treatment of RA. Our approach is always to consider cortisone's use in the context of other treatments available to clinicians, and at local and national institutional settings. We do not discuss the many other therapeutic uses of cortisone, which ranged for topical applications for skin diseases to the management of cancers, especially childhood leukaemia, nor do we discuss its close analogue ACTH-AdenoCorticoTropic Hormone.

In this study, we found that miR328 significantly and strikingly decreased among other miRNA candidates during the induction of imatinib resistance. Overexpression of miR328 sensitized resistant cells to imatinib via post-transcriptionally decreasing ABCG2 expression, while miR328 knockdown conferred imatinib resistance in parental K562 cells. Moreover, miR328 was found selectively degraded in the lysosomes of K562R cells, as inhibition of lysosome with chloroquine restored miR328 expression and increased sensitivity to imatinib. Moreover, delivery of alkalized exosomes increased endogenous miR328 expression. Compared with the corresponding controls, the alkalized exosomes with or without miR328 sensitized the chronic leukemia cells to imatinib. Taken together, our study has revealed that lysosomal clearance of miR328 in imatinib-resistant cells at least partially contributes to the drug resistance, while delivery of alkalized exosomes would sensitize the chromic leukemia cells to imatinib.",,"['Dong, Yan', 'Lin, Yao', 'Gao, Xiaotong', 'Zhao, Yingxin', 'Wan, Zhuo', 'Wang, Haotian', 'Wei, Mengying', 'Chen, Xutao', 'Qin, Weiwei', 'Yang, Guodong', 'Liu, Li']","['Dong Y', 'Lin Y', 'Gao X', 'Zhao Y', 'Wan Z', 'Wang H', 'Wei M', 'Chen X', 'Qin W', 'Yang G', 'Liu L']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xinsi Road NO. 569th, Xi'an, 710038, China."", 'Department of Stomatology, the Second Affiliated hospital, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xinsi Road NO. 569th, Xi'an, 710038, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xinsi Road NO. 569th, Xi'an, 710038, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xinsi Road NO. 569th, Xi'an, 710038, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xinsi Road NO. 569th, Xi'an, 710038, China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Changlexi Road NO.169th, Xi'an, 710032, China."", ""Department of Implantation, School of Stomatology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xinsi Road NO. 569th, Xi'an, 710038, China."", ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Fourth Military Medical University, Changlexi Road NO.169th, Xi'an, 710032, China. yanggd@fmmu.edu.cn."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xinsi Road NO. 569th, Xi'an, 710038, China. liuli1@medmail.com.cn.""]",['eng'],"['31572344/National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)', '31771507/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81400110/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2018ZDXM-SF-063/Shaanxi Provincial Science and Technology Department (CN)']",['Journal Article'],20191107,Germany,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,8406612,"['0 (Alkalies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN328 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Alkalies/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Exosomes/*chemistry', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Exosome delivery', 'Imatinib resistance', 'Lysosomal degradation', 'miR328']",2019/11/09 06:00,2020/03/27 06:00,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2019/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00253-019-10127-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00253-019-10127-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2019 Dec;103(23-24):9569-9582. doi: 10.1007/s00253-019-10127-3.

Treatment is influenced by the presence or absence of specific high-risk genetic mutations like 17P/TP53 deletion, the presence of which translates into poor prognosis. Patients without 17P deletion, who are <70 years, without significant co-morbidities, are initially treated with a combination chemotherapy regimen used for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. On the other hand, patients with a 17P deletion, age >70 years, with multiple co-morbidities, receive ibrutinib or alemtuzumab as the initial therapy. Relapsed or refractory cases are managed with BCL-2 signaling inhibitors like venetoclax. We discuss the case of an 84-year-old male with B-PLL (positive TP53 mutation), resistant to ibrutinib therapy, with extremely high white blood cell (WBC) counts, thus creating a dilemma regarding the best treatment in the second-line setting.","['Copyright (c) 2019, Bindra et al.']","['Bindra, Bikramjit S', 'Kaur, Harpreet', 'Portillo, Shellsea', 'Emiloju, Oluwadunni', 'Garcia de de Jesus, Katherine']","['Bindra BS', 'Kaur H', 'Portillo S', 'Emiloju O', 'Garcia de de Jesus K']",,"['Internal Medicine, Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, IND.', 'Internal Medicine, Albert Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Catholic University of Honduras, San Pedro Sula, HND.', 'Internal Medicine, Albert Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, St. Barnabas Hospital Health System / Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20190911,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['b-cell prolymphocytic leukemia', 'prolymphocytic leukemias']",2019/11/09 06:00,2019/11/09 06:01,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.5629 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2019 Sep 11;11(9):e5629. doi: 10.7759/cureus.5629.,PMC6822919,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

He did not respond to antibiotics and corticosteroids. He presented to the emergency department with worsening symptoms, where blood work revealed severe anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and 61% blasts on peripheral smear. Bone marrow biopsy showed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). While the results of other studies were awaited, treatment was begun with 7+3 induction (cytarabine and daunorubicin). Karyotyping returned positive for the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (Philadelphia chromosome), near-tetraploidy, and 5q deletion. Follow-up bone marrow biopsy revealed residual disease (12% blasts). Re-induction was initiated with 5+2 cytarabine and daunorubicin with the addition of dasatinib. Subsequent bone marrow biopsies revealed minimal residual disease and BCR-ABL on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patient was placed on dasatinib maintenance and later switched to nilotinib. This case demonstrates the simultaneous presence of rare cytogenetic abnormalities in AML.

Here, we identified new target genes that are induced during the TPA-induced HL-60 cell differentiation by ChIP-seq and microarray data analysis. Using q-PCR and ChIP assay, we confirmed that the target genes including USP3, USP35, TCF4, and SGK1 are upregulated during TPA-mediated HL-60 cell differentiation. Levels of USP3, one of the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), increased by TPA treatment, resulting in the reduction of H2AK119ub levels. In addition, we revealed that depletion of USP3 inhibits TPA-mediated leukemia cell differentiation q-PCR and FACS analysis.

These novel drugs can be incorporated into any treatment component, including induction and consolidation, the relapse/refractory setting, bridging for transplant, salvage post-transplant, and as prophylactic long-term post-transplant maintenance.

Risk factors for HNSCCs are smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and the human papilloma virus. Conventional treatments are surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combined modality; however, no international standard mode of therapy exists. In contrast to the conventional model of clonal evolution in tumor development, there is a newly proposed theory based on the activity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) as the model for carcinogenesis. This ""CSC hypothesis"" may explain the high mortality rate, low response to treatments, and tendency to develop multiple tumors for HNSCC patients.

Because anthracyclines work in part by inhibiting topoisomerase-II (TOP2) on accessible DNA(3,4), we hypothesized that chromatin regulatory genes (CRGs) that mediate DNA accessibility might predict anthracycline response. We studied the role of CRGs in anthracycline sensitivity in breast cancer through integrative analysis of patient and cell line data. We identified a consensus set of 38 CRGs associated with anthracycline response across ten cell line datasets. By evaluating the interaction between expression and treatment in predicting survival in a metacohort of 1006 patients with early-stage breast cancer, we identified 54 CRGs whose expression levels dictate anthracycline benefit across the clinical subgroups; of these CRGs, 12 overlapped with those identified in vitro. CRGs that promote DNA accessibility, including Trithorax complex members, were associated with anthracycline sensitivity when highly expressed, whereas CRGs that reduce accessibility, such as Polycomb complex proteins, were associated with decreased anthracycline sensitivity. We show that KDM4B modulates TOP2 accessibility to chromatin, elucidating a mechanism of TOP2 inhibitor sensitivity. These findings indicate that CRGs mediate anthracycline benefit by altering DNA accessibility, with implications for the stratification of patients with breast cancer and treatment decision making.",,"['Seoane, Jose A', 'Kirkland, Jacob G', 'Caswell-Jin, Jennifer L', 'Crabtree, Gerald R', 'Curtis, Christina']","['Seoane JA', 'Kirkland JG', 'Caswell-Jin JL', 'Crabtree GR', 'Curtis C']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3856-9177', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5617-7065', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9685-7911', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0166-3802']","['Department of Medicine (Oncology), Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA, USA.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine (Oncology), Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA, USA. crabtree@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA, USA. crabtree@stanford.edu.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. crabtree@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Medicine (Oncology), Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA, USA. cncurtis@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA, USA. cncurtis@stanford.edu.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford CA, USA. cncurtis@stanford.edu.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA009151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL051971/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM104357/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'W81XWH-16-1-0084/U.S. Department of Defense (United States Department of', 'Defense)/International', 'R01 CA163915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 GM115428/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA217851/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA182514/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09151/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National Cancer', 'Institute (NCI)/International', 'U01CA217851/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Cancer Institute (NCI)/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20191107,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM4B protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (TOP2A protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/drug effects/*genetics', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/genetics', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/administration & dosage']",,,2019/11/09 06:00,2020/01/21 06:00,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2018/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41591-019-0638-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41591-019-0638-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2019 Nov;25(11):1721-1727. doi: 10.1038/s41591-019-0638-5.

At time of ibrutinib initiation, ten patients had active chronic GVHD that resolved under Ibrutinib, whilst a single patient developed limited de novo chronic GVHD on Ibrutinib. Fourteen patients discontinued ibrutinib, four because of toxicity and ten because of disease progression. Overall, 14 patients progressed (median PFS = 24 months) among them 10 died. Two-year OS and PFS probabilities were 72% (95% CI: 52-84) and 50% (95% CI: 32-66), respectively. Patients with late relapse after allo-HSCT (>/=24 months) had a better PFS after ibrutinib.

The cytoplasmic domain of LILRB4 contains three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs); the tyrosines at positions 360, 412, and 442 are phosphorylation sites. Here, we analyzed how the ITIMs of LILRB4 in AML cells mediate its function. Our in vitro and in vivo data show that Y412 and Y442, but not Y360, of LILRB4 are required for T-cell inhibition, and all three ITIMs are needed for leukemia cell infiltration.

In the present study, we found that docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), a metabolite of DHA produced in the human body, exerts the anti-allergic activity in vitro and in vivo. DHEA suppressed degranulation of rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. This occurred due to a decrease in Ca(2+) influx, which is critical for mast cell degranulation. DHEA also suppressed IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction in mice. In addition, DHEA was demonstrated to lessen an allergic symptom in a mouse model of pollinosis and to alter the production of IgE and cytokines secreted by splenocytes collected from the pollinosis mice. Taken together, this study indicates that DHEA is a promising anti-allergic agent as it inhibits mast cell degranulation and modulates other immune cells.",,"['Nishi, Kosuke', 'Kanayama, Yoshiki', 'Kim, In-Hae', 'Nakata, Akihiro', 'Nishiwaki, Hisashi', 'Sugahara, Takuya']","['Nishi K', 'Kanayama Y', 'Kim IH', 'Nakata A', 'Nishiwaki H', 'Sugahara T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4205-8465'],"['Department of Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime, 790-8566, Japan. nishi.kosuke.mx@ehime-u.ac.jp.', 'Food and Health Sciences Research Center, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime, 790-8566, Japan. nishi.kosuke.mx@ehime-u.ac.jp.', 'Research Unit for Skeletal Health and Diseases, Ehime University, Toon, Ehime, 791-0295, Japan. nishi.kosuke.mx@ehime-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime, 790-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime, 790-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime, 790-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime University, Toon, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime, 790-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime, 790-8566, Japan.', 'Food and Health Sciences Research Center, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime, 790-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191107,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (N-docosahexaenoylethanolamide)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Endocannabinoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hypersensitivity/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology']",,,2019/11/09 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-52317-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-52317-z [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Nov 7;9(1):16213. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-52317-z.,PMC6838076,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EZH1 knockdown impairs survival and proliferation of AML1-ETO-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo.

Loss of Lys43 methylation by point mutation or domain deletion impairs AML1-ETO-repressive activity.

We previously reported that, in proliferating human cells, p53 transiently moves to centrosomes at each mitosis. Such p53 mitotic centrosome localization (p53-MCL) occurs independently from DNA damage but requires ATM-mediated p53Ser15 phosphorylation (p53Ser15(P)) on discrete cytoplasmic p53 foci that, through MT dynamics, move to centrosomes during the mitotic spindle formation. Here, we show that inhibition of p53-MCL, obtained by p53 depletion or selective impairment of p53 centrosomal localization, induces centrosome fragmentation in human nontransformed cells. In contrast, tumor cells or mouse cells tolerate p53 depletion, as expected, and p53-MCL inhibition. Such tumor- and species-specific behavior of centrosomal p53 resembles that of the recently identified sensor of centrosome-loss, whose activation triggers the mitotic surveillance pathway in human nontransformed cells but not in tumor cells or mouse cells. The mitotic surveillance pathway prevents the growth of human cells with increased chance of making mitotic errors and accumulating numeral chromosome defects. Thus, we evaluated whether p53-MCL could work as a centrosome-loss sensor and contribute to the activation of the mitotic surveillance pathway. We provide evidence that centrosome-loss triggered by PLK4 inhibition makes p53 orphan of its mitotic dock and promotes accumulation of discrete p53Ser15(P) foci. These p53 foci are required for the recruitment of 53BP1, a key effector of the mitotic surveillance pathway. Consistently, cells from patients with constitutive impairment of p53-MCL, such as ATM- and PCNT-mutant carriers, accumulate numeral chromosome defects. These findings indicate that, in nontransformed human cells, centrosomal p53 contributes to safeguard genome integrity by working as sensor for the mitotic surveillance pathway.",,"['Contadini, Claudia', 'Monteonofrio, Laura', 'Virdia, Ilaria', 'Prodosmo, Andrea', 'Valente, Davide', 'Chessa, Luciana', 'Musio, Antonio', 'Fava, Luca L', 'Rinaldo, Cinzia', 'Di Rocco, Giuliana', 'Soddu, Silvia']","['Contadini C', 'Monteonofrio L', 'Virdia I', 'Prodosmo A', 'Valente D', 'Chessa L', 'Musio A', 'Fava LL', 'Rinaldo C', 'Di Rocco G', 'Soddu S']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7701-6543', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8526-0044']","['Unit of Cellular Networks and Molecular Therapeutic Targets, IRCCS-Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Unit of Cellular Networks and Molecular Therapeutic Targets, IRCCS-Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science, NIA/NIH Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.', 'Unit of Cellular Networks and Molecular Therapeutic Targets, IRCCS-Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Unit of Cellular Networks and Molecular Therapeutic Targets, IRCCS-Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'GMP Biopharmaceutical Facility, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', 'Unit of Cellular Networks and Molecular Therapeutic Targets, IRCCS-Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Genetics and Biomedical Research, National Research Council (CNR), Pisa, Italy.', 'Armenise-Harvard Laboratory of Cell Division, Department of Cellular, Computational and Integrative Biology - CIBIO, University of Trento, Povo, Italy.', 'Unit of Cellular Networks and Molecular Therapeutic Targets, IRCCS-Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Pathology, National Research Council (CNR), c/o Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Unit of Cellular Networks and Molecular Therapeutic Targets, IRCCS-Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Unit of Cellular Networks and Molecular Therapeutic Targets, IRCCS-Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy. silvia.soddu@ifo.gov.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191107,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (TP53BP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrosome/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Mitosis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor p53-Binding Protein 1/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2019/11/09 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-2076-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-2076-1 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Nov 7;10(11):850. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-2076-1.,PMC6838180,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FTY720 also exhibits promising anticancer efficacy in several preclinical models. While FTY720-induced cytotoxicity is not due to S1PR signaling, the mechanism remains unclear and is reported to occur through various cell death pathways. Here, we performed a systematic, mechanistic study of FTY720-induced cell death in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found that FTY720 induced cell death in a panel of genetically diverse AML cell lines that was accompanied by rapid phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. Importantly, FTY720-induced PS exposure was not due to any direct effects on plasma membrane integrity and was independent of canonical signaling by regulated cell death pathways known to activate lipid flip-flop, including caspase-dependent apoptosis/pyroptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and reactive oxygen species-mediated cell death. Notably, PS exposure required cellular vacuolization induced by defects in endocytic trafficking and was suppressed by the inhibition of PP2A and shedding of Annexin V-positive subcellular particles. Collectively, our studies reveal a non-canonical pathway underlying PS externalization and cell death in AML to provide mechanistic insight into the antitumor properties of FTY720.",,"['Young, Megan M', 'Bui, Van', 'Chen, Chong', 'Wang, Hong-Gang']","['Young MM', 'Bui V', 'Chen C', 'Wang HG']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0551-0571'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA. myoung3@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA. myoung3@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA. hwang3@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA. hwang3@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA222349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191107,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Receptors, Lysosphingolipid)', '0 (Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Receptor Modulators)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Necroptosis', 'Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Receptor Modulators/pharmacology']",,,2019/11/09 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2019/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-2080-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-2080-5 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Nov 7;10(11):847. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-2080-5.,PMC6838108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple nonselective CDK9 inhibitors have progressed clinically but were limited by a narrow therapeutic window. This work describes a novel, potent, and highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, AZD4573. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The antitumor activity of AZD4573 was determined across broad cancer cell line panels in vitro as well as cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models in vivo. Multiple approaches, including integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, loss-of-function pathway interrogation, and pharmacologic comparisons, were employed to further understand the major mechanism driving AZD4573 activity and to establish an exposure/effect relationship. RESULTS: AZD4573 is a highly selective and potent CDK9 inhibitor. It demonstrated rapid induction of apoptosis and subsequent cell death broadly across hematologic cancer models in vitro, and MCL-1 depletion in a dose- and time-dependent manner was identified as a major mechanism through which AZD4573 induces cell death in tumor cells. This pharmacodynamic (PD) response was also observed in vivo, which led to regressions in both subcutaneous tumor xenografts and disseminated models at tolerated doses both as monotherapy or in combination with venetoclax. This understanding of the mechanism, exposure, and antitumor activity of AZD4573 facilitated development of a robust pharmacokinetic/PD/efficacy model used to inform the clinical trial design. CONCLUSIONS: Selective targeting of CDK9 enables the indirect inhibition of MCL-1, providing a therapeutic option for MCL-1-dependent diseases. Accordingly, AZD4573 is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial for patients with hematologic malignancies (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03263637).See related commentary by Alcon et al., p. 761.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Cidado, Justin', 'Boiko, Scott', 'Proia, Theresa', 'Ferguson, Douglas', 'Criscione, Steven W', 'San Martin, Maryann', 'Pop-Damkov, Petar', 'Su, Nancy', 'Roamio Franklin, Valar Nila', 'Sekhar Reddy Chilamakuri, Chandra', ""D'Santos, Clive S"", 'Shao, Wenlin', 'Saeh, Jamal C', 'Koch, Raphael', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Zinda, Michael', 'Fawell, Stephen E', 'Drew, Lisa']","['Cidado J', 'Boiko S', 'Proia T', 'Ferguson D', 'Criscione SW', 'San Martin M', 'Pop-Damkov P', 'Su N', 'Roamio Franklin VN', 'Sekhar Reddy Chilamakuri C', ""D'Santos CS"", 'Shao W', 'Saeh JC', 'Koch R', 'Weinstock DM', 'Zinda M', 'Fawell SE', 'Drew L']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1748-4438', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8724-3907']","['Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'DMPK, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'DMPK, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Discovery Sciences, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'CRUK Cambridge Institute, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'CRUK Cambridge Institute, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'CRUK Cambridge Institute, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Projects, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Projects, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts. lisa.drew@astrazeneca.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20191107,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9', '*Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proteomics']",,,2019/11/09 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-1853 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-1853 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Feb 15;26(4):922-934. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-1853.

The current treatment paradigm, however, is largely based on 'one-size-fits-all' immune-chemotherapy. Unfortunately, this therapeutic strategy is inadequate for a significant number of patients. As such, there is an indisputable need for novel, preferably targeted, therapies based on a biologically driven classification and risk stratification. Sequencing studies identified mutations in the MYD88 gene as an important oncogenic driver in B-cell lymphomas. MYD88 mutations constitutively activate NF-kappaB and its associated signaling pathways, thereby promoting B-cell proliferation and survival. High frequencies of the hotspot MYD88(L265P) mutation are observed in extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, thereby demonstrating this mutation's potential as a disease marker. In addition, the presence of mutant MYD88 predicts survival outcome in B-NHL subtypes and it provides a therapeutic target. Early clinical trials targeting MYD88 have shown encouraging results in relapsed/refractory B-NHL. Patients with these disorders can benefit from analysis for the MYD88 hotspot mutation in liquid biopsies, as a minimally invasive method to demonstrate treatment response or resistance. Given these clear clinical implications and the crucial role of MYD88 in lymphomagenesis, we expect that analysis of this gene will increasingly be used in routine clinical practice, not only as a diagnostic classifier, but also as a prognostic and therapeutic biomarker directing precision medicine. This review focuses on the pivotal mechanistic role of mutated MYD88 and its clinical implications in B-NHL.",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['de Groen, Ruben A L', 'Schrader, Anne M R', 'Kersten, Marie Jose', 'Pals, Steven T', 'Vermaat, Joost S P']","['de Groen RAL', 'Schrader AMR', 'Kersten MJ', 'Pals ST', 'Vermaat JSP']",,"['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden.', 'Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam-LYMMCARE, Amsterdam.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam.', 'Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam.', 'Department of Pathology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden j.s.p.vermaat@lumc.nl.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191107,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis']",,,2019/11/09 06:00,2020/08/05 06:00,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2019/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.227272 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.227272 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Dec;104(12):2337-2348. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.227272.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to identify all cohort studies of patients with ALL that reported the prevalence of Ph-like ALL and to summarize their results together. The pooled prevalence and rate were calculated by the DerSimonian-Laird random-effect model with double arcsine transformation. RESULTS: Across the 15 included studies describing 11,040 ALL patients, the peak prevalence of the presence of Ph-like ALL among patients with ALL was between ages 11 and 40 years, where the pooled prevalence was 25.8% to 26.2%. The pooled 5-year overall survival rate of Ph-like ALL was 42.8% (95% confidence interval, 23.9-64.1; I(2) 93%). Comparative analysis with B-other ALL patients was conducted by the Mantel-Haenszel method; it found that Ph-like ALL patients had a significantly lower chance of being alive at 5 years (pooled odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.50; P < .00001, I(2) = 40%). The chance of Ph-like ALL patients surviving at 5 years was similar to Ph-positive ALL patients (pooled odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-2.02; P = .53, I(2) = 77%).

While etiology of immunodeficiency is unknown, the potential causes include hydroxyurea therapy, disease related immunomodulation, chronic inflammation, and relatively old age. The leukemia cells demonstrated profound trilineage dysplasia and harbored complex cytogenetic abnormalities with loss of chromosome 5q and 7q, which are often observed in therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Besides the potential causes listed above, we propose that myeloid leukemia in this setting may result from genomic changes due to excessive hematopoietic replication triggered by a hemolysis-induced cytokine storm.

Moreover, very promising results have been reported in other B-cell malignancies, including primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Although well-tolerated in the majority of patients, ibrutinib demonstrates in some cases troublesome toxicities, including invasive fungal infections (IFIs). In the present review, we summarize clinical manifestations of IFIs in patients treated with ibrutinib, generally characterized by an early onset, mild clinical manifestations, asymptomatic/low symptomatic pulmonary localization and high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement. IFI risk appears particularly increased in patients receiving ibrutinib associated with other immune modulator agents, especially with steroids or immune-chemotherapy. Moreover, the immunomodulatory effect of ibrutinib is described, pointing the attention on the involvement of specific molecules targeted by ibrutinib in innate and adaptive response to fungal infection. Overall, the findings indicate the ibrutinib may rapidly impair innate immune cell functions, while concomitantly restoring an effective protective potential of adaptive immune compartment. A correct awareness, especially when other predisposing factors are present, is warranted about the potential risk of IFIs in ibrutinib-treated patients.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, several strategies have focused on the use of inhibitors as chemotherapeutic tools to treat these types of leukemia, such as imatinib (for Bcr-Abl) or ibrutinib (for Btk). However, the efficacy of these drugs has been reduced due to resistance mechanisms, which have motivated the development of new and more effective compounds. In this study, we designed, synthesized and evaluated 2,6,9-trisubstituted purine derivatives as novel Bcr-Abl and Btk inhibitors. We identified 5c and 5d as potent inhibitors of both kinases (IC50 values of 40nM and 0.58/0.66muM for Abl and Btk, respectively). From docking and QSAR analyses, we concluded that fluorination of the arylpiperazine system is detrimental to the activity against two kinases, and we also validated our hypothesis that the substitution on the 6-phenylamino ring is important for the inhibition of both kinases. In addition, our studies indicated that most compounds could suppress the proliferation of leukemia and lymphoma cells (HL60, MV4-11, CEM, K562 and Ramos cells) at low micromolar concentrations in vitro. Finally, we preliminarily demonstrated that 5c inhibited the downstream signaling of both kinases in the respective cell models. Therefore, 5c or 5d possessed potency to be further optimized as anti-leukemia drugs by simultaneously inhibiting the Bcr-Abl and Btk kinases.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Female genital system is an uncommon location of MS, with the vulvar MS being even rarer that only eight cases have been reported in English-written literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old woman presented with chronic ulceration on her vulva for one and a half month. Microscopic examination of incisional biopsy revealed dermal infiltration of myeloid precursor cells, which were positive for MPO, lysozyme, CD43, CD68, CD38 and CD117. Bone marrow flowcytometric analysis showed myeloblast count of 74%, which expressed CD13, CD33, CD117 and HLA-DR. A diagnosis of AML (M2 type) was made and vulvar MS was the earliest symptom. The patient achieved complete remission after chemotherapy with no evidence of recurrence in a 27-month follow-up. We reviewed the literature and identified 54 cases of Chinese patients with gynecological MS between 1999 and 2018, and discovered that in Chinese population, MS most frequently involved uterine cervix followed by the ovary and vulva, and ovarian MS onset much earlier than other sites. Remarkably, vulvar MS exhibited a high rate of concurrent AML and secondary myeloid leukemia within a short time of its occurrence. Despite its limited distribution, MS should be tackled aggressively with chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if the appropriate donor is available. CONCLUSIONS: Female genital MS, especially vulvar MS, should be included in the differential diagnosis of gynecological neoplasm, which will facilitate its early diagnosis and prompt management.",,"['Zhang, Xilin', 'Huang, Peichen', 'Chen, Zhuo', 'Bi, Xinling', 'Wang, Ying', 'Wu, Jianhua']","['Zhang X', 'Huang P', 'Chen Z', 'Bi X', 'Wang Y', 'Wu J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2583-5357'],"['Department of Dermatology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, Shanghai Skin Disease Hospital, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.', ""Department of Dermatology, Shanghai Children's Medical Central, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", 'Department of Dermatology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Dermatology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China. wangying88_2@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Dermatology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China. wujh_chyy@163.com.']",['eng'],"['JJHXM-2018005/Shanghai Wu Mengchao Medical Science Foundation', '81602751/National Natural Science Foundation of China']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20191107,England,Diagn Pathol,Diagnostic pathology,101251558,,IM,"['Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Vulvar Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chemotherapy', 'Female genitalia', 'Myeloid sarcoma', 'Vulva']",2019/11/09 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2019/11/09 06:00'],"['2019/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13000-019-0892-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13000-019-0892-3 [pii]']",epublish,Diagn Pathol. 2019 Nov 7;14(1):126. doi: 10.1186/s13000-019-0892-3.,PMC6839179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FC showed significant cytotoxicity in K562 and KBM5 cells, more so than in U937 and UL-60 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Cleaved PARP and caspase 9/3 attenuated the expression of Bcl2 and induced G1 arrest in K562 and KBM5 cells. Also, FC effectively abrogated the expression of cell cycle related proteins, such as: Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, Cyclin B1 in K562, and KBM5 cells, but caspase 3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK rescued the cleavages of caspase 3 and PARP induced by FC in K562 cells. Of note, FC decreased histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2, and enhanced histone H3 acetylation K18 (Ac-H3K18) in K562 and KBM5 cells.

The classification of steady states is explicitly done in terms of the inflammatory stimuli. Several parameters are crucial in determining the attracting steady state(s). In particular, increasing inflammatory stimuli may transform a healthy state into a malignant state under certain circumstances.

OBJECTIVES: Herein, the impact of clinical variables on PCZ plasma concentrations (PPCs) attained with PCZ delayed-release tablet (DRT) was investigated and compared with a historical cohort treated with PCZ oral suspension (OS). PATIENTS/METHODS: Steady-state PCZ PPCs in 513 patients with haematologic malignancy treated with PCZ-DRT were assessed and impact of variables were analysed. Also, a comparison with matched historical cohort treated with PCZ-OS was made. RESULTS: The median PPC in the PCZ-DRT group was 1,308.9 ng/mL (range: 29.8-10 455.9). Use of proton pump inhibitor (1181 vs 1344 ng/mL, P = .0337) in the AML/myelodysplastic syndrome remission induction group, diarrhoea (867 vs 1543 ng/mL, P = .0325) and gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (870 vs 1713 ng/mL, P = .0178) in the HSCT group were associated with lower PPCs. There was lack of evidence that hepatotoxicity was related with PCZ-DRT. Higher prevalence of UGT1A4*3 allele (33.0%) was noted compared to allele frequency in Koreans in those with PPCs < 500 mg/mL. The median PPC in the PCZ-DRT group was significantly higher than that in the PCZ-OS group (1308.9 vs 713.0 ng/mL, P < .0001). Significantly less patients had PPCs < 700 ng/mL in the PCZ-DRT group compared to the PCZ-OS group (18.7% vs 48.0%, P < .0001).

The anti-HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity was evaluated using standard ELISA method, and the cytotoxic activity was performed using MTT and XTT assays. The primary bioassay results indicated that 2-amino-4-oxy-diarylquinolines possess moderate inhibitory properties against HIV-1 RT. Molecular docking results showed that 2-amino-4-oxy-diarylquinolines 8(A-D): interacted with the Lys101 and His235 residue though hydrogen bonding and interacted with Tyr318 residue though pi-pi stacking in HIV-1 RT. Furthermore, 8A: and 8D: were the most potent anti-HIV agents among the designed and synthesized compounds, and their inhibition rates were 34.0% and 39.7% at 1 microM concentration. Interestingly, 8A: was highly cytotoxicity against MOLT-3 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), with an IC50 of 4.63+/-0.62 microg/mL, which was similar with that in EFV and TMC278 (IC50 7.76+/-0.37 and 1.57+/-0.20 microg/ml, respectively).

AML with mutated NPM1 (AML-NPM1) represents a distinct entity in the revised 2017 World Health Organization classification, but relatively little work has examined the clinical significance of phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity within this group. A multi-institutional cohort of 239 AML-NPM1 cases included 3 phenotypic groups: cases with blasts showing monocytic differentiation (n = 93; monocytic AML-NPM1), cases lacking monocytic differentiation (n = 72; myeloid AML-NPM1), and cases where blasts were negative for both CD34 and HLA-DR (n = 74; double-negative [DN] AML-NPM1). Genotypic diversity typical of AML-NPM1 was seen, with comutations occurring most commonly in DNA methylation genes (81% of cases), FLT3 (48%; including internal tandem duplication and tyrosine kinase domain mutations), and RAS pathway genes (30%). However, the comutation pattern differed by blast phenotype. TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations were significantly more common in DN AML-NPM1 (96% of cases) than in myeloid (39%) or monocytic AML-NPM1 (48%; P < .0001). Conversely, DNMT3A mutations were significantly less common in DN AML-NPM1 (27%) than in myeloid (44%) or monocytic cases (54%; P = .002). Furthermore, the 3 phenotypic groups showed significant differences in outcome, with DN AML-NPM1 showing significantly longer relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) (64.7 and 66.5 months, respectively) than monocytic AML-NPM1 (RFS, 20.6 months; OS, 44.3 months) or myeloid AML-NPM1 (RFS, 8.4 months; OS, 20.2 months; P < .0001 and P = .01 for RFS and OS, respectively). Our findings highlight biologic differences within immunophenotypically defined subgroups of NPM1-mutated AML that may impart prognostic significance.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Mason, Emily F', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Aggarwal, Nidhi', 'Seegmiller, Adam C', 'Pozdnyakova, Olga']","['Mason EF', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Aggarwal N', 'Seegmiller AC', 'Pozdnyakova O']",,"['Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA; and.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/11/08 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['422695 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000328 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Nov 12;3(21):3322-3332. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000328.,PMC6855116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It remains plagued with extremely poor treatment outcomes (<40% cure rates), mostly due to primary chemotherapy refractory disease and/or early relapse. Recurrent and mutually exclusive chimeric fusion oncogenes have been detected in 60% to 70% of cases and include nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) gene rearrangements, most commonly NUP98-KDM5A. Human models of NUP98-KDM5A-driven AMKL capable of faithfully recapitulating the disease have been lacking, and patient samples are rare, further limiting biomarkers and drug discovery. To overcome these impediments, we overexpressed NUP98-KDM5A in human cord blood hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells using a lentiviral-based approach to create physiopathologically relevant disease models. The NUP98-KDM5A fusion oncogene was a potent inducer of maturation arrest, sustaining long-term proliferative and progenitor capacities of engineered cells in optimized culture conditions. Adoptive transfer of NUP98-KDM5A-transformed cells into immunodeficient mice led to multiple subtypes of leukemia, including AMKL, that phenocopy human disease phenotypically and molecularly. The integrative molecular characterization of synthetic and patient NUP98-KDM5A AMKL samples revealed SELP, MPIG6B, and NEO1 as distinctive and novel disease biomarkers. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses pointed to upregulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in the model AMKL. Both synthetic models and patient-derived xenografts of NUP98-rearranged AMKL showed in vitro therapeutic vulnerability to ruxolitinib, a clinically approved JAK2 inhibitor. Overall, synthetic human AMKL models contribute to defining functional dependencies of rare genotypes of high-fatality pediatric leukemia, which lack effective and rationally designed treatments.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Cardin, Sophie', 'Bilodeau, Melanie', 'Roussy, Mathieu', 'Aubert, Leo', 'Milan, Thomas', 'Jouan, Loubna', 'Rouette, Alexandre', 'Laramee, Louise', 'Gendron, Patrick', 'Duchaine, Jean', 'Decaluwe, Helene', 'Spinella, Jean-Francois', 'Mourad, Stephanie', 'Couture, Francoise', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Haddad, Elie', 'Landry, Josette-Renee', 'Ma, Jing', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Roux, Philippe P', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Gruber, Tanja A', 'Wilhelm, Brian T', 'Cellot, Sonia']","['Cardin S', 'Bilodeau M', 'Roussy M', 'Aubert L', 'Milan T', 'Jouan L', 'Rouette A', 'Laramee L', 'Gendron P', 'Duchaine J', 'Decaluwe H', 'Spinella JF', 'Mourad S', 'Couture F', 'Sinnett D', 'Haddad E', 'Landry JR', 'Ma J', 'Humphries RK', 'Roux PP', 'Hebert J', 'Gruber TA', 'Wilhelm BT', 'Cellot S']",,"['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences.', 'Faculty of Medicine.', 'Cell Signaling and Proteomics Research Unit, and.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Laboratory for High-Throughput Biology, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Integrated Centre for Pediatric Clinical Genomics, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Integrated Centre for Pediatric Clinical Genomics, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Bioinformatics Platform, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology, Infectiology and Immunology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Division, Charles-Bruneau Cancer Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Streamline Genomics, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Laboratory for High-Throughput Biology, Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, and.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada;

In Japan, imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib are now approved as first-line treatment of CML in chronic phase. Recent ""stop TKI"" trials have shown that TKIs can be safely discontinued in nearly one-half of patients with sustained deep molecular response (DMR). In this study, we analyzed the cost-effectiveness of a simulated 10 years of CML treatment including stop TKI in both the United States and Japan. We constructed Markov models to compare 4 strategies in which treatment was initiated with imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or any of these TKIs at the physician's discretion. Treatment was switched to another TKI in the case of intolerance or resistance to the initial TKI, and TKIs were discontinued if DMR persisted for 2 years. ""Imatinib first"" offered 7.34 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at the cost of $1 022 148 in the United States (US dollars) and yen32 526 785 in Japan (Japanese yen).

Cranberry (Vaccinium spp.) extracts have exhibited anticancer and chemopreventive properties that have been mostly attributed to A-type proanthocyanidin (A-PAC) compounds. A-PACs, isolated from a commercially available cranberry extract, were evaluated for their effects on leukemia cell lines, primary AML samples, and normal CD34+ cord blood specimens. Our results indicated potent and specific antileukemia activity in vitro. In addition, the antileukemia activity of A-PACs extended to malignant progenitor and stem cell populations, sparing their normal counterparts. The antileukemia effects of A-PACs were also observed in vivo using patient derived xenografts. Surprisingly, we found that the mechanism of cell death was driven by activation of NF-kappaB.

To determine the extent to which BCP-ALL RT programs mirror or deviate from specific stages of normal human B-cell differentiation, we transplanted immunodeficient mice with quiescent normal human CD34+ cord blood cells and obtained RT signatures of the regenerating B-lineage populations. We then compared these with RT signatures for leukemic cells from a large cohort of BCP-ALL patients with varied genetic subtypes and outcomes. The results identify BCP-ALL subtype-specific features that resemble specific stages of B-cell differentiation and features that seem to be associated with relapse.

We previously showed that the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin prevents the ability of stromal cells to diminish p53-mediated killing of cocultured ALL cells in vitro, possibly by blocking the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Here, we propose that PGE2 released by bone marrow stromal cells might be a target for improved treatment of pediatric ALL. We used a xenograft model of human primary ALL cells in nonobese diabetic-scid IL2rgammanull mice to show that indomethacin delivered in the drinking water delayed the progression of ALL in vivo. The progression was monitored by noninvasive in vivo imaging of the engrafted leukemic cells, as well as by analyses of CD19+CD10+ leukemic blasts present in spleen or bone marrow at the termination of the experiments. The indomethacin treatment increased the level of p53 in the leukemic cells, implying that COX inhibition might reduce progression of ALL by attenuating protective paracrine PGE2 signaling from bone marrow stroma to leukemic cells.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Richartz, Nina', 'Duthil, Eva', 'Ford, Anthony', 'Naderi, Elin Hallan', 'Bhagwat, Sampada', 'Gilljam, Karin M', 'Burman, Marta Maria', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Blomhoff, Heidi Kiil', 'Skah, Seham']","['Richartz N', 'Duthil E', 'Ford A', 'Naderi EH', 'Bhagwat S', 'Gilljam KM', 'Burman MM', 'Ruud E', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Skah S']",,"['Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Centre for Evolution & Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section of Head and Neck Oncology, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Division of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Division of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; and.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/blood', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Indomethacin/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2019/11/08 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['422643 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000473 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Nov 12;3(21):3181-3190. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000473.,PMC6855122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have shown that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT) is abundantly expressed in multiple human solid tumors. However, the expression and role of MIAT in AML has not been explored previously. In this study, we find that MIAT is overexpressed in AML patient specimens and AML cell lines. Importantly, upregulation of MIAT is closely related with poor clinical outcome. Further investigations reveal that knockdown of MIAT inhibits the colony formation and proliferation, meanwhile, accelerates the apoptosis of AML cells in vitro. Consistently, MIAT knockdown slows AML progression in immunodeficient mice. Mechanistically, we confirm that MIAT can function as a sponge to inhibit microRNA-495 (miR-495), a tumor suppressor, in AML cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that MIAT is involved in promoting the progression of AML, at least partly, through negative regulation of miR-495, and therefore provide a promising target for treatment of AML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

When treated uniformly with conventional chemotherapy and allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), it showed variable clinical outcome and prognosis. Members of the SOX [Sry-related high-mobility group (HMG) box] gene family are involved in diverse embryonic and oncogenic processes. The roles of SOX genes in AML are not entirely clear but emerging evidence, including that arising from studies in solid-cancers, showed that SOX genes can function as tumour suppressors or oncogenes and may be involved in key pathogenetic pathways in AML involving C/EBPalpha mutations, activation of beta-catenin/Wnt and Hedgehog pathways and aberrant TP53 signals. Recent data based on genomics and proteomics have identified key interactions between SOX genes and partnering proteins of pathogenetic significance. The observations illustrated the principles and feasibilities of developing lead molecules of potential therapeutic values.

In this study, to evaluate the virus-host interactions in the manifestation of the associated malignancy, four pooled RNA samples of each host (three RNAs in each sample) were applied to RNA-seq. Differential expression analyses were conducted separately between ATLL and EBL groups, in comparison with the healthy group, to identify functional Gene Ontology (GO) terms and hub genes, using DAVID database and MCODE plugin in Cytoscape software, respectively. A broad range of effective genes, involved in the ATLL and EBL, was up- and downregulated. In the virus side, in both malignancy, Tax was expressed very low, but the HTLV-1-HBZ and BVL-As2 transcripts were highly expressed. Some upregulated hub genes, IL2, TOP2A, MKI67, TP73, MYC, and downregulated FOS gene family (FOS, FOSB, and FOSL2), are similarly activated in both human and bovine hosts, in related cell cycle and growth factors. Taken together, it seems that in preventing the infections and cell transformations, Tax must be targeted as a viral factor, and shared peptide in virological and immunological synapses as host factors. Therefore, in the malignant stages, HBZ and As2 transcripts along with growth factors, particularly IL-2R-gamma and T-bet or TOP2A, and MKI67 should be targeted in both hosts. Additional studies at the protein level are necessary to elucidate the more useful targets for the therapy of these life-threatening diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously used CRISPR screening to identify a salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) requirement for the growth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines that overexpress the lineage TF myocyte enhancer factor (MEF2C). In this context, SIK3 maintains MEF2C function by directly phosphorylating histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), a repressive cofactor of MEF2C. In this study, we evaluated whether inhibition of SIK3 with the tool compound YKL-05-099 can suppress MEF2C function and attenuate disease progression in animal models of AML. Genetic targeting of SIK3 or MEF2C selectively suppressed the growth of transformed hematopoietic cells under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Similar phenotypes were obtained when cells were exposed to YKL-05-099, which caused cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in MEF2C-expressing AML cell lines. An epigenomic analysis revealed that YKL-05-099 rapidly suppressed MEF2C function by altering the phosphorylation state and nuclear localization of HDAC4. Using a gatekeeper allele of SIK3, we found that the antiproliferative effects of YKL-05-099 occurred through on-target inhibition of SIK3 kinase activity. Based on these findings, we treated 2 different mouse models of MLL-AF9 AML with YKL-05-099, which attenuated disease progression in vivo and extended animal survival at well-tolerated doses. These findings validate SIK3 as a therapeutic target in MEF2C-addicted AML and provide a rationale for developing druglike inhibitors of SIK3 for definitive preclinical investigation and for studies in human patients.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Tarumoto, Yusuke', 'Lin, Shan', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Milazzo, Joseph P', 'Xu, Yali', 'Lu, Bin', 'Yang, Zhaolin', 'Wei, Yiliang', 'Polyanskaya, Sofya', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Gray, Nathanael S', 'Stegmaier, Kimberly', 'Vakoc, Christopher R']","['Tarumoto Y', 'Lin S', 'Wang J', 'Milazzo JP', 'Xu Y', 'Lu B', 'Yang Z', 'Wei Y', 'Polyanskaya S', 'Wunderlich M', 'Gray NS', 'Stegmaier K', 'Vakoc CR']",,"['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.', 'Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.', 'Watson School of Biological Sciences, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; and.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.']",['eng'],"['R50 CA211404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA210030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA174793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA045508/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA013106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (YKL-05-099)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (SIK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (SIK3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*chemistry', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2019/11/08 06:00,2020/04/28 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62326-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019001576 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Jan 2;135(1):56-70. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019001576.,PMC6940199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the influence of heritable factors on CH, we performed deep targeted sequencing of blood DNA from 52 monozygotic (MZ) and 27 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (aged 70-99 years). Using this highly sensitive approach, we identified CH (variant allele frequency >/=0.5%) in 62% of individuals. We did not observe higher concordance for CH within MZ twin pairs as compared with that within DZ twin pairs, or to that expected by chance. However, we did identify 2 MZ pairs in which both twins harbored identical rare somatic mutations, suggesting a shared cell of origin. Finally, in 3 MZ twin pairs harboring mutations in the same driver genes, serial blood samples taken 4 to 5 years apart showed substantial twin-to-twin variability in clonal trajectories.

The therapeutic index of this emerging modality is attenuated by the occurrence of immunologic toxicity syndromes that occur upon CAR T-cell engraftment. Here, we report on the low incidence of severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in a subject treated with a CAR T-cell product composed of a defined ratio CD4:CD8 T-cell composition with a 4-1BB:zeta CAR targeting CD19 who also recieved early intervention treatment. We report that early intervention with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids may reduce the frequency at which subjects transition from mild CRS to severe CRS. Although early intervention doubled the numbers of subjects dosed with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids, there was no apparent detrimental effect on minimal residual disease-negative complete remission rates or subsequent persistence of functional CAR T cells compared with subjects who did not receive intervention. Moreover, early intervention therapy did not increase the proportion of subjects who experience neurotoxicity or place subjects at risk for infectious sequelae. These data support the contention that early intervention with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids in subjects with early signs of CRS is without negative impact on the antitumor potency of CD19 CAR T cells. This intervention serves to enhance the therapeutic index in relapsed/refractory patients and provides the rationale to apply CAR T-cell therapy more broadly in ALL therapy.

From March 2016 through January 2018, we conducted a pilot study in 89 patients who had refractory/relapsed B-cell malignancies, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential infusion of anti-CD19 and anti-CD22, a cocktail of 2 single-specific, third-generation chimeric antigen receptor-engineered (CAR19/22) T cells. Among the 51 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the minimal residual disease-negative response rate was 96.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86.3-99.5). With a median follow-up of 16.7 months (range, 1.3-33.3), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.6 months (95% CI, 6.5 to not reached [NR]), and the median overall survival (OS) was 31.0 months (95% CI, 10.6-NR). Among the 38 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the overall response rate was 72.2% (95% CI, 54.8-85.8), with a complete response rate of 50.0% (95% CI, 32.9-67.1). With a median follow-up of 14.4 months (range, 0.4-27.4), the median PFS was 9.9 months (95% CI, 3.3-NR), and the median OS was 18.0 months (95% CI, 6.1-NR). Antigen-loss relapse occurred in 1 patient during follow-up. High-grade cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity occurred in 22.4% and 1.12% patients, respectively. In all except 1, these effects were reversible. Our results indicated that sequential infusion of CAR19/22 T cell was safe and efficacious and may have reduced the rate of antigen-escape relapse in B-cell malignancies.

Relapse-specific somatic alterations were enriched in 12 genes (NR3C1, NR3C2, TP53, NT5C2, FPGS, CREBBP, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, WHSC1, PRPS1, and PRPS2) involved in drug response. Their prevalence was 17% in very early relapse (<9 months from diagnosis), 65% in early relapse (9-36 months), and 32% in late relapse (>36 months) groups. Convergent evolution, in which multiple subclones harbor mutations in the same drug resistance gene, was observed in 6 relapses and confirmed by single-cell sequencing in 1 case. Mathematical modeling and mutational signature analysis indicated that early relapse resistance acquisition was frequently a 2-step process in which a persistent clone survived initial therapy and later acquired bona fide resistance mutations during therapy. In contrast, very early relapses arose from preexisting resistant clone(s). Two novel relapse-specific mutational signatures, one of which was caused by thiopurine treatment based on in vitro drug exposure experiments, were identified in early and late relapses but were absent from 2540 pan-cancer diagnosis samples and 129 non-ALL relapses. The novel signatures were detected in 27% of relapsed ALLs and were responsible for 46% of acquired resistance mutations in NT5C2, PRPS1, NR3C1, and TP53. These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced drug resistance mutations facilitate a subset of pediatric ALL relapses.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Li, Benshang', 'Brady,

This manifests as a block in myeloid differentiation and an increase in malignant self-renewal. These common features of AML have led to widespread optimism that epigenetic therapies would dramatically change the natural history of this disease. Although preclinical studies with these drugs fueled this optimism, results from early clinical trials have offered a more sobering message. Here, we provide an overview of epigenetic therapies that are currently approved by therapeutic regulatory authorities across the world and those undergoing early-phase clinical trials. We also discuss the conceptual and molecular factors that may explain some of the disparity between the bench and bedside, as well as emerging avenues for combining the current generation of epigenetic therapies with other classes of agents and the development of novel epigenetic therapies. With further research and development of this exciting class of drugs, we may finally be able to dramatically improve outcomes for patients afflicted with this aggressive and often incurable malignancy.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Fennell, Katie A', 'Bell, Charles C', 'Dawson, Mark A']","['Fennell KA', 'Bell CC', 'Dawson MA']",,"['Cancer Research Division, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology and.', 'Cancer Research Division, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology and.', 'Cancer Research Division, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology and.', 'Centre for Cancer Research, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and.', 'Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism']",,,2019/11/08 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)73179-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019003262 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Nov 28;134(22):1891-1901. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019003262.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with B-cell lymphoma occasionally develop clonally related myeloid tumors with poor prognosis. Whether concurrent activation of both pathways is sufficient to induce B-cell transformation and whether the signaling initiates B-myeloid conversion in a pathological context are largely unknown. Here, we provide genetic evidence that concurrent activation of NF-kappaB and Notch signaling in committed B cells is sufficient to induce B-cell lymphomatous transformation and primes common progenitor cells to convert to myeloid lineage through dedifferentiation, not transdifferentiation. Intriguingly, the converted myeloid cells can further transform, albeit at low frequency, into myeloid leukemia. Mechanistically, coactivation of NF-kappaB and Notch signaling endows committed B cells with the ability to self renew. Downregulation of BACH2, a lymphoma and myeloid gene suppressor, but not upregulation of CEBPalpha and/or downregulation of B-cell transcription factors, is an early event in both B-cell transformation and myeloid conversion. Interestingly, a DNA hypomethylating drug not only effectively eliminated the converted myeloid leukemia cells, but also restored the expression of green fluorescent protein, which had been lost in converted myeloid leukemia cells. Collectively, our results suggest that targeting NF-kappaB and Notch signaling will not only improve lymphoma treatment, but also prevent the lymphoma-to-myeloid tumor conversion.

In turn, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase B (Itpkb) phosphorylates IP3 to negatively regulate and thereby tightly control Ca2+ fluxes that are essential for mature T-cell activation and differentiation and protection from cell death. Itpkb pathway inhibition increases intracellular Ca2+, induces apoptosis of activated T cells, and can control T-cell-mediated autoimmunity. In this study, we employed genetic and pharmacological approaches to inhibit Itpkb signaling as a means of controlling graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Murine-induced, Itpkb-deleted (Itpkb-/-) T cells attenuated acute GVHD in 2 models without eliminating A20-luciferase B-cell lymphoma graft-versus-leukemia (GVL). A highly potent, selective inhibitor, GNF362, ameliorated acute GVHD without impairing GVL against 2 acute myeloid leukemia lines (MLL-AF9-eGFP and C1498-luciferase). Compared with FK506, GNF362 more selectively deleted donor alloreactive vs nominal antigen-responsive T cells. Consistent with these data and as compared with FK506, GNF362 had favorable acute GVHD and GVL properties against MLL-AF9-eGFP cells. In chronic GVHD preclinical models that have a pathophysiology distinct from acute GVHD, Itpkb-/- donor T cells reduced active chronic GVHD in a multiorgan system model of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), driven by germinal center reactions and resulting in target organ fibrosis. GNF362 treatment reduced active chronic GVHD in both BO and scleroderma models. Thus, intact Itpkb signaling is essential to drive acute GVHD pathogenesis and sustain active chronic GVHD, pointing toward a novel clinical application to prevent acute or treat chronic GVHD.",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Thangavelu, Govindarajan', 'Du, Jing', 'Paz, Katelyn G', 'Loschi, Michael', 'Zaiken, Michael C', 'Flynn, Ryan', 'Taylor, Patricia A', 'Kirchmeier, Andrew Kemal', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Luznik, Leo', 'MacDonald, Kelli P', 'Hill, Geoffrey R', 'Maillard, Ivan', 'Munn, David H', 'Serody, Jonathan S', 'Murphy, William J', 'Miklos, David', 'Cutler, Corey S', 'Koreth, John', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Dahlberg, Carol', 'Miller, Andrew T', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Thangavelu G', 'Du J', 'Paz KG', 'Loschi M', 'Zaiken MC', 'Flynn R', 'Taylor PA', 'Kirchmeier AK', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Luznik L', 'MacDonald KP', 'Hill GR', 'Maillard I', 'Munn DH', 'Serody JS', 'Murphy WJ', 'Miklos D', 'Cutler CS', 'Koreth J', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Ritz J', 'Dahlberg C', 'Miller AT', 'Blazar BR']",,"['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Immunology, Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR) Berghofer Medical Research Institute and School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology, Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR) Berghofer Medical Research Institute and School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Department of Dermatology and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Laboratory of Cancer Immunology, University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', 'Stem Cell/Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematologic Malignancy, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA;

Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of bioenergetics crucial for glucose metabolism in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and its inhibition delays leukemogenesis, but whether the metabolic function of AMPK alters the AML epigenome remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that AMPK maintains the epigenome of MLL-rearranged AML by linking acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) homeostasis to Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain (BET) protein recruitment to chromatin.

Other mutations in JAK2 have been identified in MPNs, most notably exon 12 mutations in PV. Here, we describe a novel recurrent mutation characterized by a common 4-amino-acid deletion and variable 1-amino-acid insertion (Leu583-Ala586DelInsSer/Gln/Pro) within the JH2 domain of JAK2. All 4 affected patients had eosinophilia, and both patients with Leu583-Ala586DelInsSer fulfilled diagnostic criteria of both PV and chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL). Computational and functional studies revealed that Leu583-Ala586DelInsSer (herein referred to as JAK2ex13InDel) deregulates JAK2 through a mechanism similar to JAK2V617F, activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and transforms parental Ba/F3 cells to growth factor independence. In contrast to JAK2V617F, JAK2ex13InDel does not require an exogenous homodimeric type 1 cytokine receptor to transform Ba/F3 cells and is capable of activating beta common chain family cytokine receptor (interleukin-3 receptor [IL-3R], IL-5R, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor) signaling in the absence of ligand, with the maximum effect observed for IL-5R, consistent with the clinical phenotype of eosinophilia. Recognizing this new PV/CEL-overlap MPN has significant clinical implications, as both PV and CEL patients are at high risk for thrombosis, and concomitant cytoreduction of red cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils may be required for prevention of thromboembolic events. Targeted next-generation sequencing for genes recurrently mutated in myeloid malignancies in patients with unexplained eosinophilia may reveal additional cases of Leu583-Ala586DelInsSer/Gln/Pro, allowing for complete characterization of this unique MPN.",,"['Patel, Ami B', 'Franzini, Anca', 'Leroy, Emilie', 'Kim, Soo Jin', 'Pomicter, Anthony D', 'Genet, Lidvine', 'Xiao, Michael', 'Yan, Dongqing', 'Ahmann, Jonathan M', 'Agarwal, Archana M', 'Clair, Phillip', 'Addada, Juanah', 'Lambert, Jonathan', 'Salmon, Matthew', 'Gleich, Gerald J', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Constantinescu, Stefan N', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Prchal, Josef T', 'Deininger, Michael W']","['Patel AB', 'Franzini A', 'Leroy E', 'Kim SJ', 'Pomicter AD', 'Genet L', 'Xiao M', 'Yan D', 'Ahmann JM', 'Agarwal AM', 'Clair P', 'Addada J', 'Lambert J', 'Salmon M', 'Gleich GJ', 'Cross NCP', 'Constantinescu SN', ""O'Hare T"", 'Prchal JT', 'Deininger MW']",,"['Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Ludwig Cancer Research Brussels and de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Ludwig Cancer Research Brussels and de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Clinical Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Derby Hospital, Derby, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, University College London Hospitals, London, United Kingdom.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Dermatology and.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; and.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Ludwig Cancer Research Brussels and de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Veteran Administration Medical Center, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR026802/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'Pdgfra-Associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*INDEL Mutation', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics/metabolism/*pathology']",,,2019/11/08 06:00,2020/04/14 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)73119-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019001385 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Dec 26;134(26):2388-2398. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019001385.,PMC6933291,,,,,,['Blood. 2019 Dec 26;134(26):2335-2337.

We identified all currently recognized driver mutations and 7 novel mutations that cause constitutive TpoR activation, and a much larger number of second-site mutations that enhance S505N-driven activation.

We present two lesions observed in two clinics over more than 28 years, with their radiological, pathological and clinical characteristics. METHODS: Retrospective study preformed between 1989 and 2017 in 446 patients undergoing inguinal orchiectomy. Clinical data were obtained reviewing patient` s tables. All patients were evaluated with physical examination, medical history, serum tumor markers (alpha fetoprotein, beta human chorionic gonadotropin, LDH), and scrotal ultrasound in the perioperative period. RESULTS: In 396 cases (88,78%) the diagnosis was germ cell or non-germ cell tumor and the remainder 50 patients (11.2%) presented 15 different intrascrotal lesions. These lesions were rhabdomyosarcoma (1 patient), intrascrotal cavernous hemangioma (1 patient), dermoid cyst (2 cases), epidermoid cyst (4 patients), paratesticular mesothelioma (1 case), parietal testicular tunica vaginalis cyst (2 patients), spermatic granuloma (3 cases). The number of patients with tuberculosis orchitis was 6 and granulomatous orchitis 8. There were 8 patients with fibrous pseudotumor. 1 patient presented testicular plasmocytoma. Metastatic involvement secondary to lymphoma and leukemia appeared in 4 cases. Brucella epididymitis-orchitis 7 cases. 2 cases of adult pure yolk sac testicular tumors.

Nonetheless, the role of leukemic-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs)-related specificity on the sensitivity of MRD has not been clarified yet. In this respect, we accomplished this study. METHODS: LAIP-frequencies of bone marrow samples from healthy donors and patients after treatment were quantified and subdivided in ""categories of specificity"" named as: ""strong,"" ""good,"" and ""weak."" At the following, the diagnostic performance of MRD was investigated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratio (LR). RESULTS: ""Strong"" LAIPs were identified by CD7, CD2, CD4, and CD56 markers while ""weak"" LAIPs, independently of coexpressed markers, were mainly observed in CD33+ cells. MRD identified patients with significantly low DFS and OS but showed a low sensitivity in predicting relapse. Interestingly, majority of recurrences was noticed in patients with two LAIPs and lacking of ""strong"" LAIPs or only with one ""good"" LAIP. Thus, only patients showing one ""strong"" or two ""good"" LAIPs were considered suitable for MRD monitoring and selected to be further investigated. In this subset, positive MRD predicted a poor prognosis. Moreover, a higher sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV) and LR- were observed after comparison with the previous series.

Leukemia and lymphoma have been associated with HCV infection. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) has been reported to play a regulatory role in cancer, inflammation, and immune response to infection. The expression level of miR-155 in HCV viremic patients is controversial; although high miR-155 levels were demonstrated in HCV genotypes 1,2, and 3, low levels of miR-155 were detected in Egyptian patients with HCV genotype 4. Several studies have investigated the correlation between the levels of miRNA-155 and the replication of HCV, others have evaluated miRNA-155 as a prognostic biomarker in different types of cancer. No studies have investigated the impact of miRNA-155 knockdown on HCV pediatric patients associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We knocked-out the miR_155a in cultured polymorphonuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from 60 children with ALL; 30 were associated with HCV-4 infection and 30 were HCV negative. The miR_155a, HCV viral load, and cell proliferation werre assessed in treated and untreated cells using TaqMan assay quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found that miRNA-155 was significantly upregulated by seven folds in the HCV-4 associated ALL group; while being linked to high HCV viral load and leukemic burden, miR_155a knock-out can improve the disease outcome. We conclude that miR-155 is a critical miRNA that is considered a therapeutic target in pediatric HCV leukemic patients.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hassan, Safaa S', 'El-Khazragy, Nashwa', 'Elshimy, Amal A', 'Aboelhussein, Marwa M', 'Saleh, Shereen A', 'Fadel, Sayed', 'Atia, Hend A', 'Matbouly, Safa', 'Tamer, Natalie']","['Hassan SS', 'El-Khazragy N', 'Elshimy AA', 'Aboelhussein MM', 'Saleh SA', 'Fadel S', 'Atia HA', 'Matbouly S', 'Tamer N']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6646-4674'],"['Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology/Hematology and Biomedical Research Departments, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Biomedical Research Department, Global Research Labs, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University and New Giza University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain- Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain- Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, New Giza University, Giza, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Biotechnology, October University for Modern Sciences and Arts (MSA), Giza, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191107,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Egypt', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genotype', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis C/*metabolism/*virology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*virology', 'Prognosis', 'Viral Load']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HCV associated leukemia/lymphoma', '*in vitro knock-down', '*miR-155', '*pediatric', '*prognosis']",2019/11/08 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29512 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2020 Apr;121(4):2811-2817. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29512.

Additionally, these compounds are generally known to have a low tendency to interact with DNA which is not common with most of the conventional cytotoxic agents. Thus, this class of compounds is of particular interest for the discovery and development of patient-friendly anticancer agents. OBJECTIVE: The initial objective of this study was to synthesize and evaluate 2-substituted 4-arylidene- 5(4H)-oxazolones for their potential anticancer properties. METHODS: A simple, mild and non-hazardous synthetic methodology has been developed for the preparation of 2-substituted 4-arylidene-5(4H)-oxazolones. The methodology involved lemon juice mediated condensation of N-acyl glycine derivatives including hippuric acid with arylaldehydes in PEG-400 under ultrasound irradiation. All the synthesized compounds were screened via an MTT assay for their potential cytotoxic properties in vitro using the cancerous cell lines e.g. K562 (human chronic myeloid leukemia), Colo-205 (human colon carcinoma), and A549 (human lung carcinoma) and a non-cancerous HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cell line. RESULTS: Compounds 3a, 3c and 3i showed promising growth inhibition against A549 cell line but no significant effects on HEK293 cell line, indicating their selectivity towards cancer cells. Moreover, their IC50 values suggested that all these compounds were comparable to the reference drug doxorubicin indicating their potential against lung cancer. CONCLUSION: The 4-arylidene-5(4H)-oxazolone framework presented here could be a new template for the design and discovery of potential anticancer agents especially for lung cancer.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Prasad, Malavattu G', 'Lakshmi, Chapala V', 'Katari, Naresh K', 'Anand, Krishnan', 'Pal, Manojit', 'Jonnalagadda, Sreekantha B']","['Prasad MG', 'Lakshmi CV', 'Katari NK', 'Anand K', 'Pal M', 'Jonnalagadda SB']",,"['Department of Chemistry, School of Science, GITAM deemed to be University, Hyderabad 502 329, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, School of Science, GITAM deemed to be University, Hyderabad 502 329, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, School of Science, GITAM deemed to be University, Hyderabad 502 329, India.', 'School of Chemistry & Physics, College of Agriculture, Engineering & Science, Westville Campus, University of KwaZulu-Natal, P Bag X 54001, Durban 4000, South Africa.', 'Discipline of Medical Biochemistry and Chemical Pathology, School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.', ""Dr. Reddy's Institute of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad Campus, Hyderabad 500046, India."", 'School of Chemistry & Physics, College of Agriculture, Engineering & Science, Westville Campus, University of KwaZulu-Natal, P Bag X 54001, Durban 4000, South Africa.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen,Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,9810948,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '15646-46-5 (Oxazolone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biocatalysis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Citrus/*chemistry', 'Cytotoxins/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', '*Fruit and Vegetable Juices', 'HEK293 Cells', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxazolone/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",['NOTNLM'],"['*4-arylidene-5(4H)-oxazolone derivatives', '*Lemon juice', '*anticancer', '*drug doxorubicin', '*lung cancer', '*ultrasound.']",2019/11/08 06:00,2020/09/29 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCHTS-EPUB-101852 [pii]', '10.2174/1386207322666191024105150 [doi]']",ppublish,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen. 2019;22(9):625-634. doi: 10.2174/1386207322666191024105150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that the compound reduces affinity for PI3KA relative to the PI3K inhibitor, is slow to intercellularly oxidize, and is resistant to liver microsomes. We observed modest activity in untreated acute myeloid leukemia cells and 14-fold selectivity relative to non-cancerous cells. The cellular activity of the compound can be modulated by the addition of antioxidants or oxidants, indicating the compound activity is sensitive to cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) state. Co-treatment with cytosine arabinoside or doxorubicin was used to activate the compound inside cells. We observed strong synergistic activity specifically in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cancer cells with an increase in selective anticancer activity of up to 90-fold. Thus, these new self-cyclizing compounds can be used to increase the selectivity of anticancer agents.","['(c) 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Human BC specimens were collected from BC patients during operations. BC cell lines (T24, BIU87, and HT1376) and normal uroepithelial cell lines SV-HUV-1 were cultured. The abilities of cell proliferation and invasion were detected by Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and transwell assay, respectively. Additionally, the relevant mRNA and protein expressions were measured by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Furthermore, the luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the target gene of miR-15. Besides, Xenograft tumor formation assay was performed to confirm the effect of miR-15 on tumor growth. RESULTS: A low expression of miR-15 was detected by qRT-PCR, whereas the high expression of B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI1) was detected by immunocytochemical assay in BC tissues. Moreover, miR-15 expression and BMI1 expression were significantly associated with the overall survival of BC patients. MTT and transwell assay results stated that the up-regulation of miR-15 inhibited BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. BMI-1 was verified as a direct target of miR-15 in BC using Luciferase reporter assay. Besides, miR-15 regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related makers, protein kinase B (AKT), and the phosphorylation of AKT protein levels in BC using the Western blot assay. Xenograft tumor formation assay indicated that the over-expression of miR-15 inhibited the tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: We stated that miR-15 suppressed BC cell progression by targeting BMI1 through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway, which provided a potential target for BC treatment.",,"['Zhang, L', 'Wang, C-Z', 'Ma, M', 'Shao, G-F']","['Zhang L', 'Wang CZ', 'Ma M', 'Shao GF']",,"[""Department of Urology, The Second Hospital of Shandong University, Ji'nan, China. 19850205jian@163.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Antagomirs)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antagomirs/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2019/11/07 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201910_19276 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Oct;23(20):8813-8822. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201910_19276.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite these revolutionary findings, there remains marked disparity in patient outcomes. Why do some patients present de novo while others evolve to the more aggressive stages of CML? Why can select patients successfully discontinue therapy as part of a treatment-free remission attempt whereas others fail to meet specific molecular milestones? RECENT FINDINGS: BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations are only identified in approximately 50% of patients with poor responses and disease progression, suggesting the presence of alternative resistance mechanisms. Numerous institutions have identified the presence of additional genomic events in addition to BCR-ABL1 with the increasing availability of next-generation sequencing. We explore the potential pathways and events that may cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to answer these questions but also challenge the fundamental tenet that BCR-ABL1 is always the sole event initiating CML.",,"['Shanmuganathan, Naranie', 'Branford, Susan']","['Shanmuganathan N', 'Branford S']",,"['Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia. naranie.shanmuganathan@sa.gov.au.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia. naranie.shanmuganathan@sa.gov.au.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia. naranie.shanmuganathan@sa.gov.au.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital and SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia. naranie.shanmuganathan@sa.gov.au.', 'School of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia. naranie.shanmuganathan@sa.gov.au.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Disease progression', '*Mutations', '*Next-generation sequencing', '*Resistance']",2019/11/07 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-019-00549-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-019-00549-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2019 Dec;14(6):501-506. doi: 10.1007/s11899-019-00549-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If a somatic mutation in a gene associated with leukemia is detectable in hematopoietic tissue, especially if multiple mutations with a high (> 10%) variant allele frequency are present, the risk of progression to frank neoplasia is greater than if such mutations are not detected. These patients can be described with the term, ""clonal cytopenias of undetermined significance"" (CCUS). CCUS patients have a natural history similar to lower-risk MDS.

However, whether wogonoside could inhibit tumor growth of endometrial cancer has not been elucidated. In this study, we explored the function of wogonoside on tumor growth and the underlying mechanism on endometrial cancer. Firstly, we investigated the effect of wogonoside on endometrial cancer cells and found that wogonoside could significantly decrease cell proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, wogonoside could aggravate the extent of ER stress and upregulate the phosphorylation level of Mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1, leading to the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Taken together, in vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that wogonoside could be a potent inducer of ER stress and could be further developed into a promising therapy for endometrial cancer.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

However, emerging studies show that INPP4B also has tumour-promoting properties in cancers including acute myeloid leukemia, colon cancer, melanoma and breast cancer. Together these findings suggest that INPP4B may be a context dependent cancer gene. Whether INPP4B functions solely in a tumour suppressing or tumour promoting manner, or both in non-transformed cells is currently not clear. In this study, consequences of deficiency and overexpression of INPP4B on cellular transformation was investigated using a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) model of cellular transformation. We observed that neither deficiency nor overexpression of INPP4B was sufficient to induce neoplastic transformation, alone or in combination with H-Ras (V12) or E1A overexpression. However, Inpp4b-deficiency did cooperate with SV40 T-Large-mediated cellular transformation, a finding which was associated with increased phosphorylated-Akt levels. Transformation and phosphorylated-Akt levels were dampened upon overexpression of INPP4B in SV40 T-Large-MEF. Together, our findings support a model where INPP4B function suppresses transformation mediated by SV40 T-Large, but is inconsequential for Ras and E1A mediated transformation.",['Copyright: (c) 2019 Mangliardi et al.'],"['Mangialardi, Emily Marie', 'Chen, Keyue', 'Salmon, Brittany', 'Vacher, Jean', 'Salmena, Leonardo']","['Mangialardi EM', 'Chen K', 'Salmon B', 'Vacher J', 'Salmena L']",,"['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, Departement de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191029,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['E1A', 'Inpp4b', 'MEF', 'RAS', 'SV40-T-Large']",2019/11/07 06:00,2019/11/07 06:01,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27293 [doi]', '27293 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2019 Oct 29;10(59):6378-6390. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27293. eCollection 2019 Oct 29.,PMC6824866,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the efficacy of immunotherapy in solid tumors still needs improvements due to the immunosuppressive properties of tumor cells and the microenvironment. To overcome these limitations, we prepared a novel tumor-targeting delivery system based on the underlying mechanism of immune-targeted cell death that encapsulated granzyme B protein within a porous polymeric nanocapsule. Methods: A cell-penetrating peptide TAT was attached onto granzyme B (GrB) to enhance its transmembrane transport efficiency and potency to induce cell apoptosis. The endocytosis and internalization pathways of GrB-TAT (GrB-T) were analyzed in comparison with perforin by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the positively charged GrB-T was wrapped into nanoparticles by p-2-methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholine (PMPC)-modified HA (hyaluronic acid). The nanoparticles (called TCiGNPs) were characterized in terms of zeta potential and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The in vitro anti-tumor effects of GrB-T were examined by cell apoptosis assay and Western blotting analysis. The in vivo anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy of TCiGNPs was evaluated in a mouse tumor model. Results: The TAT peptide could play a role similar to perforin to mediate direct transmembrane transfer of GrB and improve GrB-induced cell apoptosis. The TCiGNPs were successfully synthesized and accumulated in the solid tumor through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. In the tumor microenvironment, TCiGNPs could be degraded by hyaluronidase and triggered the release of GrB-T. The TAT peptide enabled the translocation of GrB across the plasma membrane to induce tumor cell apoptosis in vivo. Conclusion: We successfully developed a granzyme B delivery system with a GrB-T core and a PMPC/HA shell that simulated CTL/NK cell-mediated cancer immunotherapy mechanism. The GrB delivery system holds great promise for cancer treatment analogous to the CTL/NK cell-induced immunotherapy.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Qian, Xiaomin', 'Shi, Zhendong', 'Qi, Hongzhao', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Huang, Kai', 'Han, Donglin', 'Zhou, Junhu', 'Liu, Chaoyong', 'Liu, Yang', 'Lu, Yunfeng', 'Yuan, Xubo', 'Zhao, Jin', 'Kang, Chunsheng']","['Qian X', 'Shi Z', 'Qi H', 'Zhao M', 'Huang K', 'Han D', 'Zhou J', 'Liu C', 'Liu Y', 'Lu Y', 'Yuan X', 'Zhao J', 'Kang C']",,"['Department of Medical Laboratory, School of Medical Technology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300203, China.', '3rd Department of Breast Cancer, China Tianjin Breast Cancer Prevention, Treatment and Research center, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin 300060, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Composite and Functional Materials, School of Materials Science & Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Laboratory of Neuro-Oncology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and Key Laboratory of Neurotrauma, Variation, and Regeneration, Ministry of Education and Tianjin Municipal Government, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Composite and Functional Materials, School of Materials Science & Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China.', 'Laboratory of Neuro-Oncology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and Key Laboratory of Neurotrauma, Variation, and Regeneration, Ministry of Education and Tianjin Municipal Government, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Composite and Functional Materials, School of Materials Science & Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Composite and Functional Materials, School of Materials Science & Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China.', 'Laboratory of Neuro-Oncology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and Key Laboratory of Neurotrauma, Variation, and Regeneration, Ministry of Education and Tianjin Municipal Government, Tianjin 300052, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191014,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,"['0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/administration & dosage', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Granzymes/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*drug effects', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy', 'Perforin/administration & dosage', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Granzyme B delivery', '*biomimetics', '*nanoparticles', '*tumor therapy']",2019/11/07 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.35900 [doi]', 'thnov09p7616 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2019 Oct 14;9(25):7616-7627. doi: 10.7150/thno.35900. eCollection 2019.,PMC6831455,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,

NKT-like cells (CD3(+)CD56(+)) combine characteristics of T and NK cells. The physiopathological role of these cells remains unknown although the literature refers their association with inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Since the information regarding the role of NKT-like cells in CML is rare, we aimed at the characterization of these cells in CML patients treated with TKIs. Peripheral blood NKT-like cells from 48 CML patients and 40 healthy donors were analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry. Functional tests consisting of co-culture with leukemic target cells (K562 cell line) were used to measure degranulation and cytokine production. Our results revealed that NKT-like cells are decreased in treated CML patients, although they present increased expression of activation markers (CD69 and HLA-DR), increased degranulation (CD107a) and impaired IFN-gamma production. Significantly alterations on the expression of tumor recognition (NCRs and NKp80), and immune regulation receptors (LAG-3, TIM-3, and CD137) by NKT-like cells were observed in CML patients. Second generation TKIs increased cell activation (CD69) and decreased expression of NKp44 and NKp80 by NKT-like cells from CML patients when compared to Imatinib. CML patients that achieved deep molecular response (MR4.5) presented downregulation of NKp44 and LAG-3.

However, the biggest challenge is the extraction of high-quality DNA from FFPE tissues, given that the integrity of DNA is critically affected by formalin fixation. Formaldehyde induces crosslinks in DNA that renders single or double-stranded DNA breaks. Such breaks cause extensive fragmentation that directly influences the quality of DNA purified and the number of templates available for PCR amplification. Thus, protocol for DNA purification from FFPE tissues must effectively extract highly fragmented DNA and reverse cross-linking caused by formalin fixation. DNA extraction methods available in the literature were selected and modified at different stages to optimize a protocol that extracts DNA of sufficient quality and fragment size to be detectable by PCR. Archived FFPE tissues belonged to patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and benign breast disease were used for the protocol optimization. The best optimized protocol was then used to amplify Exon 4 region of Proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus1 (Pim1) kinase gene to analyze any probable somatic mutations both in TNBCs and benign breast diseases. Of the 12 different protocols developed, best quality DNA in terms of fragment size and purity was obtained when Tween20 lysis buffer was used for both deparaffinization and overnight digestion along with high salt precipitation. Optimized protocol was then validated by extracting DNAs from 10 TNBCs and 5 benign breast disease specimens with consistent purity and fragment size. PCR amplification and subsequent Sanger's sequencing revealed the presence of mutations in the Exon 4 region of Pim1 kinase. Deparaffinization and overnight digestion in Tween20 lysis buffer along with high salt precipitation yielded the best quality PCR amplifiable DNA for mutational analysis.",['(c) Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities.'],"['Panchal, Nagesh Kishan', 'Bhale, Aishwarya', 'Chowdary, Radhika', 'Verma, Vinod Kumar', 'Beevi, Syed Sultan']","['Panchal NK', 'Bhale A', 'Chowdary R', 'Verma VK', 'Beevi SS']",,"['Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) Foundation and Research Centre, KIMS Hospitals, Hyderabad, India.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Biosciences and Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore, India.', 'Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) Foundation and Research Centre, KIMS Hospitals, Hyderabad, India.', 'Department of Genetics, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India; and.', 'Diagnostics Division, KIMS, Hyderabad, India.', 'Diagnostics Division, KIMS, Hyderabad, India.', 'Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) Foundation and Research Centre, KIMS Hospitals, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Biomol Tech,Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,100888641,"['1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Breast Diseases/*genetics', 'DNA/*isolation & purification', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Exons', 'Formaldehyde/*chemistry', 'Humans', '*Paraffin Embedding', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*genetics', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA extraction, lysis buffer, salt treatment', '*DNA fragmentation, deparaffinization']",2019/11/07 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.7171/jbt.20-3101-001 [doi]', 'JBT_2020-3101-001 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biomol Tech. 2020 Apr;31(1):1-6. doi: 10.7171/jbt.20-3101-001.,PMC6822607,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, patients can have a pronounced symptom burden. Herein, contributors to the symptomatic burden, as well as the thrombotic and transformative tendencies are reviewed. From a symptom perspective, some are explained by cytokine release, others by microvascular complications, whereas certain symptoms can herald disease evolution. Thrombosis has multifactorial contributors, including but not limited to gender, and inflammatory stress; investigators have recently hypothesized that microparticles and Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formations may add to thrombotic burden.

A Danish national population-based cohort study.,769-780,10.2147/CLEP.S210456 [doi],"Background: Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is widely centralized. Longer distances to a specialized treatment center may affect patients' access to curative-intended treatment. Especially during outpatient treatment, distance may also affect survival. Methods and patients: The authors conducted a national population-based cohort study including all AML patients diagnosed in Denmark between 2000 and 2014. We investigated effects of distance (<10 kilometers [km; reference], 10-25, 25-50, 50-100, >100) to the nearest specialized treatment facility on the probability of receiving intensive chemotherapy, HSCT, and achieving a complete remission (CR) using logistic regression analysis (odds ratios; ORs). For overall survival, we used Cox proportional hazards regression (hazard ratios [HRs]) and adjusted (a) for relevant baseline characteristics. Results: Of 2,992 patients (median age=68.5 years), 53% received intensive chemotherapy and 12% received low-dose chemotherapy outpatient regimens. The median distance to a specialized treatment center was 40 km (interquartile range=10-77 km). No impact of distance to specialized treatment centers was seen on the probability of receiving intensive chemotherapy (10-25 km, aOR=1.1 (CI=0.7-1.7), 25-50 km, aOR=1.1 (CI=0.7-1.7), 50-100 km, aOR=1.3 (CI=0.9-1.9), and >100 km, aOR=1.4 [CI=0.9-2.2]). Overall survival in patients regardless of therapy (<10 km, aOR=1.0 vs >100 km, aOR=1.0 [CI=0.9-1.2]), in intensive therapy patients, or in patients' choice of post-remission was not affected by distance to specialized treatment center. Distance to a transplant center also did not affect the probability of HSCT or survival post-HSCT. Conclusion: In Denmark, distance to a specialized treatment facility offering remission-induction chemotherapy and HSCT does not negatively affect access to curative-indented therapy, treatment-response, or survival in AML patients.",['(c) 2019 Tostesen et al.'],"['Tostesen, Michael', 'Norgaard, Mette', 'Norgaard, Jan Maxwell', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Marcher, Claus Werenberg', 'Overgaard, Ulrik Malthe', 'Severinsen, Marianne Tang', 'Schoellkopf, Claudia', 'Ostgard, Lene Sofie Granfeldt']","['Tostesen M', 'Norgaard M', 'Norgaard JM', 'Medeiros BC', 'Marcher CW', 'Overgaard UM', 'Severinsen MT', 'Schoellkopf C', 'Ostgard LSG']",,"['Department of Clinical Medicine, Holstebro Regional Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Herlev University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Holstebro Regional Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190828,New Zealand,Clin Epidemiol,Clinical epidemiology,101531700,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic transplantation', 'epidemiology', 'hematology', 'prognosis', 'socioeconomics']",2019/11/07 06:00,2019/11/07 06:01,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CLEP.S210456 [doi]', '210456 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epidemiol. 2019 Aug 28;11:769-780. doi: 10.2147/CLEP.S210456. eCollection 2019.,PMC6718163,,,,"['This study was supported by The Danish Cancer Society (COMPAS).

Although some per-butyrylated glucosides of podophyllotoxin and 4beta-triazolyl-podophyllotoxin glycosides show good anticancer activity, the per-acetylated/free of podophyllotoxin glucosides and their per-acetylated are not well studied. Methods: A few glucoside derivatives of PPT were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic activities against five human cancer cell lines, HL-60 (leukemia), SMMC-7721 (hepatoma), A-549 (lung cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), and SW480 (colon cancer), as well as the normal human pulmonary epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). In addition, we investigated the structure-activity relationship and the physicochemical property-anticancer activity relationship of these compounds. Results: Compound 6b shows the highest cytotoxic potency against all five cancer cell lines tested, with IC50 values ranging from 3.27+/-0.21 to 11.37+/-0.52 muM. We have also found that 6b displays higher selectivity than the etoposide except in the case of HL-60 cell line. The active compounds possess similar physicochemical properties: MSA > 900, %PSA < 20, ClogP > 2, MW > 700 Da, and RB > 10. Conclusion: We synthesized several glucoside derivatives of PPT and tested their cytotoxicity. Among them, compound 6b showed the highest cytotoxicity. Further studies including selectivity of active compounds have shown that the selectivity indexes of 6b are much greater than the etoposide except in the case of HL-60 cell line. The active compounds possessed similar physicochemical properties.

In allergic reactions, mast cells induce a hypersensitive immune response to a substance that is normally harmless. Ionizing radiation has different biological effects depending on the dose and dose rate. In this study, we investigated whether low-dose irradiation before (preventative effect) or after (therapeutic effect) an antigen-antibody reaction has an anti-allergic effect. To test this, we activated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells with anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl IgE (antibody) and 2,4-dinitrophenyl human serum albumin, which served as an antigen. To test for both the potential of a preventative effect and a therapeutic effect, we irradiated mast cells both before and after mast cell activation, and we measured mediator release and signaling pathway activity. Low-dose ionizing radiation suppressed mediator release from RBL-2H3 mast cells activated by the antigen-antibody reaction regardless of when the mast cells were irradiated. These results were due to the suppression of FcepsilonRI expression. Therefore, we suggest that low-dose ionizing radiation has a preventative and therapeutic effect in allergic reactions via the FcepsilonRI-mediated RBL-2H3 mast cell activation system.",,"['Joo, Hae Mi', 'Hong, Eun Hee', 'Cho, Seong-Jun', 'Nam, Seon Young', 'Kim, Ji Young']","['Joo HM', 'Hong EH', 'Cho SJ', 'Nam SY', 'Kim JY']",,"['Radiation Health Institute, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd, Seoul, 132-703, Republic of Korea.', 'Radiation Health Institute, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd, Seoul, 132-703, Republic of Korea.', 'Radiation Health Institute, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd, Seoul, 132-703, Republic of Korea.', 'Radiation Health Institute, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd, Seoul, 132-703, Republic of Korea.', 'Radiation Health Institute, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd, Seoul, 132-703, Republic of Korea. elizabeth@khnp.co.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191106,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/immunology/*radiotherapy', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology/*radiotherapy', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*radiation effects', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Rats']",,,2019/11/07 06:00,2020/10/31 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-52399-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-52399-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Nov 6;9(1):16079. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-52399-9.,PMC6834612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, pancytopenia and renal failure developed at the age of 68 years. Consequently, the patient was admitted owing to dyspnea. Because of no apparent signs of CLL progression, we concluded that pancytopenia was due to AIC (autoimmune granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia) and renal anemia. MIDD was diagnosed based on renal histology and detection of IgM and lambda chain immunoglobulin deposits on glomeruli and tubules, which were presumed to be derived from CLL cells. The patient was treated with ibrutinib in order to reduce monoclonal protein levels. AIC improved concurrently with IgM reduction 1 month later. Supportive care, involving transfusion and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, was not required approximately 3 months after initiating ibrutinib treatment.

These simple gammaretroviruses have been studied extensively in various facets of science for nearly half a century, yet we have surprisingly little quantitative information about some of the basic features of these viral particles. These include parameters such as the genome packaging efficiency and the number of particles required for a productive infection. The reason for this knowledge gap relies primarily on the technical challenge of accurately measuring intact viral particles from infected cell supernatants. Virus-infected cells are well known to release soluble viral proteins, defective viruses, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) harboring viral proteins that may mimic viruses, all of which can skew virus titer quantifications. Flow virometry, also known as nanoscale flow cytometry or simply small-particle flow cytometry, is an emerging analytical method enabling high-throughput single-virus phenotypic characterizations. By utilizing the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) and monodisperse light scattering characteristics as discerning parameters of intact virus particles, here, we analyzed the basic properties of Moloney MLV (M-MLV). We show that <24% of the total p30 capsid protein measured in infected cell supernatants is associated with intact viruses. We calculate that about one in five M-MLV particles contains a viral RNA genome pair and that individual intact particle infectivity is about 0.4%. These findings provide new insights into the characteristics of an extensively studied prototypical retrovirus while highlighting the benefits of flow virometry for the field of virology.IMPORTANCE Gammaretroviruses, or, more specifically, murine leukemia viruses (MLVs), have been a longstanding model for studying retroviruses. Although being extensively analyzed and dissected for decades, several facets of MLV biology are still poorly understood. One of the primary challenges has been enumerating total intact virus particles in a sample. While several analytical methods can precisely measure virus protein amounts, MLVs are known to induce the secretion of soluble and vesicle-associated viral proteins that can skew these measurements. With recent technological advances in flow cytometry, it is now possible to analyze viruses down to 90 nm in diameter with an approach called flow virometry. The technique has the added benefit of being able to discriminate viruses from extracellular vesicles and free viral proteins in order to confidently provide an intact viral particle count.

Intriguingly, a trial with the antifibrotic drug nintedanib in non-small cell lung cancer reported clinical benefits in adenocarcinoma (ADC) but not squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), even though the stroma is fibrotic in both histotypes. Likewise, we reported that nintedanib inhibited the tumor-promoting fibrotic phenotype of TAFs selectively in ADC. Here we show that tumor fibrosis is actually higher in ADC-TAFs than SCC-TAFs in vitro and patient samples. Mechanistically, the reduced fibrosis and nintedanib response of SCC-TAFs was associated with increased promoter methylation of the profibrotic TGFbeta transcription factor SMAD3 compared with ADC-TAFs, which elicited a compensatory increase in TGFbeta1/SMAD2 activation. Consistently, forcing global DNA demethylation of SCC-TAFs with 5-AZA rescued TGFbeta1/SMAD3 activation, whereas genetic downregulation of SMAD3 in ADC-TAFs and control fibroblasts increased TGFbeta1/SMAD2 activation, and reduced their fibrotic phenotype and antitumor responses to nintedanib in vitro and in vivo. Our results also support that smoking and/or the anatomic location of SCC in the proximal airways, which are more exposed to cigarette smoke particles, may prime SCC-TAFs to stronger SMAD3 epigenetic repression, because cigarette smoke condensate selectively increased SMAD3 promoter methylation. Our results unveil that the histotype-specific regulation of tumor fibrosis in lung cancer is mediated through differential SMAD3 promoter methylation in TAFs and provide new mechanistic insights on the selective poor response of SCC-TAFs to nintedanib. Moreover, our findings support that patients with ADC may be more responsive to antifibrotic drugs targeting their stromal TGFbeta1/SMAD3 activation. SIGNIFICANCE: This study implicates the selective epigenetic repression of SMAD3 in SCC-TAFs in the clinical failure of nintedanib in SCC and supports that patients with ADC may benefit from antifibrotic drugs targeting stromal TGFbeta1/SMAD3.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Ikemori, Rafael', 'Gabasa, Marta', 'Duch, Paula', 'Vizoso, Miguel', 'Bragado, Paloma',

There is evidence showing complement activation in other thrombotic microangiopathies. The aim of this study was to evaluate complement activation in different thrombotic microangiopathies and to monitor treatment response. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Complement activation was assessed by exposing endothelial cells to sera or activated-patient plasma-citrated plasma mixed with a control sera pool (1:1)-to analyze C5b-9 deposits by immunofluorescence. Patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (n=34) at different stages of the disease, HELLP syndrome (a pregnancy complication characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) or severe preeclampsia (n=10), and malignant hypertension (n=5) were included. RESULTS: Acute phase atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome-activated plasma induced an increased C5b-9 deposition on endothelial cells. Standard and lower doses of eculizumab inhibited C5b-9 deposition in all patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, except in two who showed partial remission and clinical relapse. Significant fibrin formation was observed together with C5b-9 deposition. Results obtained using activated-plasma samples were more marked and reproducible than those obtained with sera. C5b-9 deposition was also increased with samples from patients with HELLP (all cases) and preeclampsia (90%) at disease onset. This increase was sustained in those with HELLP after 40 days, and levels normalized in patients with both HELLP and preeclampsia after 6-9 months. Complement activation in those with malignant hypertension was at control levels. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methodology identifies complement overactivation in patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome at acute phase and in other diseases such as HELLP syndrome and preeclampsia. Moreover, it is sensitive enough to individually assess the efficiency of the C5 inhibition treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.'],"['Palomo, Marta', 'Blasco, Miquel', 'Molina, Patricia', 'Lozano, Miquel', 'Praga, Manuel', 'Torramade-Moix, Sergi', 'Martinez-Sanchez, Julia', 'Cid, Joan', 'Escolar, Gines', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Paules, Cristina', 'Crispi, Fatima', 'Quintana, Luis F', 'Poch, Esteban', 'Rodas, Lida', 'Goma, Emma', 'Morelle, Johann', 'Espinosa, Mario', 'Morales, Enrique', 'Avila, Ana', 'Cabello, Virginia', 'Ariceta, Gema', 'Chocron, Sara', 'Manrique, Joaquin', 'Barros, Xoana', 'Martin, Nadia', 'Huerta, Ana', 'Fraga-Rodriguez, Gloria M', 'Cao, Mercedes', 'Martin, Marisa', 'Romera, Ana Maria', 'Moreso, Francesc', 'Manonelles, Anna', 'Gratacos, Eduard', 'Pereira, Arturo', 'Campistol, Josep M', 'Diaz-Ricart, Maribel']","['Palomo M', 'Blasco M', 'Molina P', 'Lozano M', 'Praga M', 'Torramade-Moix S', 'Martinez-Sanchez J', 'Cid J', 'Escolar G', 'Carreras E', 'Paules C', 'Crispi F', 'Quintana LF', 'Poch E', 'Rodas L', 'Goma E', 'Morelle J', 'Espinosa M', 'Morales E', 'Avila A', 'Cabello V', 'Ariceta G', 'Chocron S', 'Manrique J', 'Barros X', 'Martin N', 'Huerta A', 'Fraga-Rodriguez GM', 'Cao M', 'Martin M', 'Romera AM', 'Moreso F', 'Manonelles A', 'Gratacos E', 'Pereira A', 'Campistol JM', 'Diaz-Ricart M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0789-7992', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6925-1989', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1763-1098', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7713-1629']","['Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute; mpalomo@carrerasresearch.org.', ""Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain.', 'Group of nephro-urological diseases and renal transplantation (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Apheresis Unit, Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Institut Clinic de Malalties Hematologiques i Oncologiques (ICMHO), IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre and Research Institute i+12, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.', ""Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute.', ""Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Apheresis Unit, Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, Institut Clinic de Malalties Hematologiques i Oncologiques (ICMHO), IDIBAPS, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Centre de Diagnostic Biomedic (CDB), Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute.', 'Barcelona Endothelium Team, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Fetal i+D Fetal Medicine Research Center, BCNatal -

This case demonstrates that even with subtle deviations from typical ITP findings one must promptly reevaluate the diagnosis. This case also highlights the importance of peripheral smear review by an expert in pediatric hematopathology. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 10 year-old Asian boy presented with 2 months of easy bruising. Review of systems was negative for any constitutional symptoms. On examination, he appeared well but had numerous large ecchymoses. He had no appreciable lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. The liver was palpable 1.5 cm below the costal margin. A complete blood count (CBC) showed: platelets = 17 x 109/L, hemoglobin = 128 g/L, white blood cell count = 5.43 x 109/L, and neutrophils = 1.63 x 109/L. A blood smear was reported as normal. Urate was 370 umol/L and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 803 U/L. The child was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. The following day, the blood smear was reviewed by a hematopathologist who identified blasts. A bone marrow aspiration (BMA) confirmed the diagnosis of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSION: In children presenting with suspected ITP, leukemia should always be considered. A BMA was historically performed on all patients with presumed ITP to rule out leukemia. In 2011, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) stopped recommending routine BMA in patients suspected of having ITP. ASH advises in cases with unusual findings on history, physical examination or CBC, it is reasonable to perform a BMA. Our patient had mild hepatomegaly, which may have qualified him for a BMA. He also had an elevated LDH and urate, which are not listed as criteria for BMA by ASH but were considered atypical for ITP by the clinical team. A literature search did not reveal any primary data assessing these markers. While corticosteroids are a first line treatment in ITP, they must be reserved for when clinicians are confident that the patient does not have leukemia. Steroid administration prior to diagnosing leukemia results in delayed diagnosis and may increase the risk of complications and decrease survival.",,"['Yan, Adam', 'Erdman, Laura', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Bernstein, Stacey']","['Yan A', 'Erdman L', 'Sung L', 'Bernstein S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8300-3095'],"['Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada. adam.yan@sickkids.ca.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. adam.yan@sickkids.ca.', 'Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20191106,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/blood/*diagnosis/*drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Bone marrow analysis', 'Immune thrombocytopenic purpura', 'Thrombocytopenia']",2019/11/07 06:00,2020/03/31 06:00,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-6302-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-6302-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Nov 6;19(1):1058. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-6302-0.,PMC6836470,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes in patients with active Mtb infection at our institution who had cancer or suspicion of cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively examined medical records of all patients with laboratory-confirmed active Mtb infection diagnosed between 2006 and 2014. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed active Mtb infection were identified during the study period, resulting in an average rate of 6 new cases per year. Thirty-two (62%) patients had underlying cancer, while 20 (38%) patients did not have cancer but were referred to the institution because of suspicion of underlying malignancy. Among patients with cancer, 18 (56%) had solid tumors; 8 (25%) had active hematologic malignancies; and 6 (19%) had undergone hematopoietic-cell transplantation (HCT). Patients with and without cancer were overall similar with the exception of median age (61 years in cancer patients compared to 53 years in noncancer patients). Pulmonary disease was identified in 32 (62%) patients, extrapulmonary disease in 10 (19%) patients, and disseminated disease in 10 (19%) patients. Chemotherapy was delayed in 53% of patients who were to receive such treatment. Eleven patients (all of whom had cancer) died; 3 of these deaths were attributable to Mtb infection. CONCLUSIONS: Although not common, tuberculosis remains an important infection in patients with cancer. Approximately one-third of patients were referred to our institution for suspicion of cancer but were ultimately diagnosed with active Mtb infection rather than malignancy.",,"['Kmeid, Joumana', 'Kulkarni, Prathit A', 'Batista, Marjorie V', 'El Chaer, Firas', 'Prayag, Amrita', 'Ariza-Heredia, Ella J', 'Mulanovich, Victor E', 'Chemaly, Roy F']","['Kmeid J', 'Kulkarni PA', 'Batista MV', 'El Chaer F', 'Prayag A', 'Ariza-Heredia EJ', 'Mulanovich VE', 'Chemaly RF']",,"['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Infectious Diseases Section, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Medical Care Line, Michael E.

Their common ligand is growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6). The GAS6/TAM signaling pathway regulates many important cell processes and plays an essential role in immunity, hemostasis, and erythropoiesis. In cancer, AXL overexpression and activation has been associated with cell proliferation, chemotherapy resistance, tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis; and has been correlated with a poor prognosis. In hematological malignancies, the expression and function of AXL is highly diverse, not only between the different tumor types but also in the surrounding tumor microenvironment. Most research and clinical evidence has been provided for AXL inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia. However, recent studies also revealed an important role of AXL in lymphoid leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. In this review, we summarize the basic functions of AXL in various cell types and the role of AXL in different hematological cancers, with a focus on AXL in the dormancy of multiple myeloma. In addition, we provide an update on the most promising AXL inhibitors currently in preclinical/clinical evaluation and discuss future perspectives in this emerging field.",,"['Yan, Siyang', 'Vandewalle, Niels', 'De Beule, Nathan', 'Faict, Sylvia', 'Maes, Ken', 'De Bruyne, Elke', 'Menu, Eline', 'Vanderkerken, Karin', 'De Veirman, Kim']","['Yan S', 'Vandewalle N', 'De Beule N', 'Faict S', 'Maes K', 'De Bruyne E', 'Menu E', 'Vanderkerken K', 'De Veirman K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0499-2946', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8906-2790', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4012-4617', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0805-6581', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1313-6121']","['Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1090 Brussel, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300060, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1090 Brussel, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1090 Brussel, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1090 Brussel, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1090 Brussel, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1090 Brussel, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1090 Brussel, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1090 Brussel, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 1090 Brussel, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191105,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AXL', 'hematological cancers', 'prognostic value', 'selective inhibitors']",2019/11/07 06:00,2019/11/07 06:01,['2019/11/08 06:00'],"['2019/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11111727 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11111727 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Nov 5;11(11). pii: cancers11111727. doi: 10.3390/cancers11111727.,PMC6896070,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The clinical data of 152 elderly adults(aged>/=60 years) and 49 young adults(aged 18-45 years) with AML between June 2013 and December 2018 in outpatient and hospitalized patients of Changzhou Second People's Hospital and Wuxi Second People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 51 gene mutations were detected using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and sanger sequencing. The general clinical characteristics, the occurrence of coexistence gene mutations, the correlation between coexistence gene mutations and some clinical parameters, and the initial induction remission rate between elderly and young adult AML patients with NPM1 mutations were analyzed and compared. Results: NPM1 mutations were detected in 46 of 152 elderly AML patients. Thirty eight patients (82.6%) with NPM1 mutations carried other gene mutations at the same time, among whom 8 patients (17.4%) carried NPM1 mutations alone, while 14(30.4%) carried 2, 16 (34.8%) carried 3, and 8 (17.4%) carried >/= 4 mutations. NPM1 mutations frequently co-occurred with FLT3-ITD15 cases (32.6%) , DNMT3A10 (21.7%) , TET26 (13.4%) and FLT3-TKD5 (10.9%) . Compared with young adults with NPM1 mutations, elderly patients had higher TP53, FLT3-TKD rates, lower incidence of DNMT3A, RAS mutation (all P<0.05) and lower coexistence rate of 4 gene mutations (P=0.002).The presence of >/= 4 mutations was found to be significantly associated with higher white blood level than those in patients with single, double and 3 mutations coexisted in elderly adults AML patients(all P<0.05). With the increase of the amount of mutations, the complete remission(CR) rate decreased gradually after the initial induction. Patients who carried 3 or more mutations showed a lower CR rate than those with single gene mutations (all P<0.05) . Patients who carried>4 genes also showed a significantly lower CR rate than those with double gene mutations (P=0.031). Patients with FLT3-ITD mutations exhibited higher white blood level and lower CR rate than that in nonmutant type group (all P<0.05). The CR rate of patients with DNMT3A mutation was also significantly lower than that with nonmutant type (P=0.033). However, patients with FLT3-TKD mutations showed a higher platelet level than that with nonmutant type (P=0.019).

Methods: The study analyzed 453 newly diagnosed AML(excluded acute promyelocytic leukemia, APL) patients from seven hospitals in Shanghai, from January 1st 2014 to December 31th 2017. RNA and DNA were extracted from pretreatment bone marrow mononuclear cells and targeted sequencing of AML genes were performed. The data of different groups was compared. Results: A total of 453 newly diagnosed AML patients were enrolled in the study, including 247 males and 206 females with a median age of 49.5 (range,11-85) years. A total of 540 mutations/fusion genes were detected in 289 patients, 29.1% (132/259) of whom with two or more mutations/fusion genes. In all patients, NPM1 was the most common mutation(12.8%), followed by ETO and TET2 mutation (11.92% and 11.04%, respectively) . And WT1 over-expression accounted for 10.6%. Patients over the age of 50 were with a higher frequency of mutations associated with epigenetic modification, 11.93% for ASXL1, 13.99% for DMNT3A, 6.58% for IDH1/IDH2, and 13.17% for TET2. The frequency of DMNT3A mutations was three times higher than that of patients under 50 years of age (P=0.017). In this study, a relatively low proportion of genetic mutations was observed in low-risk karyotype group. In the medium-risk karyotype group, the relatively high mutation frequencies were observed in NPM1, TET2, FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A, ASXL1, and CEBPA genes. In the poor-risk karyotype group, the mutation frequencies of ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A and PHF6 genes were more than 10%, especially ASXL1 and PHF6 mutation frequencies were significantly higher than other molecular risk stratification groups (P<0.05). Of the 254 patients (56%) with normal karyotype AML (NK-AML), 56 patients were detected to have gene mutations about epigenetic modification. The median OS of this group was worse than that of patients without related mutations, while the median LFS had no significant difference. In patients with NK-AML older than 50 years, the OS and LFS of patients with epigenetic modification related gene mutations was 12 months and 10 months, versus 18 months and 12 months of patients without mutations. Conclusions: The gene mutations frequencies in AML patients with different age and molecular risk stratification groups are different. Epigenetics gene mutation frequencies, such as DNMT3A, ASXL1, IDH1/IDH2 and TET2,are higher in patients older than 50 years. A shorter OS can be observed in older patients(>50 years) with epigenetics gene mutation.",,"['Zhao, C X', 'Wang, J M', 'Li, J M', 'Zou, S H', 'Chen, F Y', 'Liang, A B', 'Hou, J', 'Hu, X X', 'Zhang, Y X', 'Gu, S Y', 'Zhu, J Y', 'Li, P', 'Du, J', 'Yang, Y N', 'Qin, Y W', 'Wang, X R', 'Wang, C']","['Zhao CX', 'Wang JM', 'Li JM', 'Zou SH', 'Chen FY', 'Liang AB', 'Hou J', 'Hu XX', 'Zhang YX', 'Gu SY', 'Zhu JY', 'Li P', 'Du J', 'Yang YN', 'Qin YW', 'Wang XR', 'Wang C']",,"['Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Shanghai 200080, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department ofHematology, Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai200032, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Shanghai 200003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department ofHematology, Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai200032, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200127, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Shanghai 200003, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Glorious Med Technology limited liability company, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai 200080, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai 200080, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai 200080, China.']",['chi'],"['14411950700/Major Scientific Research Project of Shanghai Science and Technology', 'Commission']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'China', 'Female', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Gene', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Mutation', 'Next generation sequencing']",2019/11/07 06:00,2019/11/15 06:00,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0376-2491.2019.40.005 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Oct 29;99(40):3145-3151. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0376-2491.2019.40.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigation of potent molecular mechanisms involved in PC is still obscure owing to its drug resistance. The purpose of the present study is to disclose the underlying mechanism participating in PC progression and drug therapy, reversing the unpromising treatment outcome. In our research, microRNA-760 (miR-760) was first revealed to be lowly expressed in PC cells. And up-regulation of miR-760 could further suppress PC cell proliferation and boost cell apoptosis, as well as improve gemcitabine sensitivity of PC cells through gain-of-function assays. Besides, RNA-binding protein (RBP) MOV10 interacted with and stabilized Integrin beta1 (ITGB1). Furtherly, miR-760 was proved to target Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) mRNA to decrease MOV10 protein expression, thus promoting the destabilization of ITGB1. At last, rescue experiments validated that up-regulation of ITGB1 remedied the miR-760 overexpression-caused inhibition on biological activities and gemcitabine resistance of PC cells. To summarize, the current inspection demonstrated that miR-760 enhances sensitivity of PC cells to gemcitabine through modulating MOV10-stablized ITGB1, highlighting the role of miR-760/MOV10/ITGB1 pathway in the drug therapy for PC patients.",['(c) 2019 The Author(s).'],"['Yang, Dejun', 'Hu, Zunqi', 'Xu, Jiapeng', 'Tang, Yuan', 'Wang, Yu', 'Cai, Qingping', 'Zhu, Zhenxin']","['Yang D', 'Hu Z', 'Xu J', 'Tang Y', 'Wang Y', 'Cai Q', 'Zhu Z']",,"['Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200003, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200003, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200003, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200003, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200003, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200003, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200003, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (MIRN760 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'PC-3 Cells', 'Pancreas/diagnostic imaging', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'RNA Helicases/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ITGB1', '*gemcitabine', '*miR-760', '*pancreatic cancer (PC)']",2019/11/07 06:00,2020/09/26 06:00,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['220718 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20192358 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Rep. 2019 Nov 29;39(11). pii: 220718. doi: 10.1042/BSR20192358.,PMC6863763,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytogenetic marker of CML is the presence of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) in >95% of patients. The current case reports a 83-year old woman who was directed to the genetic laboratory for a cytogenetic and molecular-genetic analysis suspected to be Ph positive [(+)]. Karyotype analysis of a bone marrow sample revealed a hyperdiploid karyotype in a part of Ph (+) cells with additional chromosomes 8, 10 and 12. Restriction analysis for V617F JAK2 mutation was negative, while the quantitative RT-qPCR assay indicated BCR-ABL/ABL transcript at the level of 120% International Scale (IS). Generally cytogenetic complexities are important in the prognostic evaluation of CML. Besides the Ph chromosome, a variet of chromosomal aberrations may be associated with CML. A total of 5-10% of these cases show complex translocations involving another chromosome. The current case is Ph(+) demonstrating an additional hyperdiploid karyotype clone with three additional autosomes (8, 10 and 12).

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that cats frequently develop non-neoplastic lymphocytosis and that different neoplastic immunophenotypes have variable prognoses. We aimed to characterize the lymphocyte expansions in a large population of cats with lymphocytosis and to assess clinical presentation and outcome in a subset. ANIMALS: Three cohorts of cats older than 1 year with lymphocytosis (>6000/muL) were examined to define immunophenotypic categories (n = 146), evaluate outcome (n = 94), and determine prevalence of immunophenotypes (n = 350). METHODS: Retrospective study of cats with blood submitted for flow cytometry. Medical records (n = 94) were reviewed for clinical data, treatment, and survival information. RESULTS: Five major immunophenotypic categories were identified: B cell, heterogeneous (>/=2 lineages expanded), CD4+ T cell, CD4-CD8- (double negative [DN]) T cell, and CD5-low-expressing T cell. B-cell and heterogeneous phenotypes were more consistent with a non-neoplastic process, having polyclonal antigen receptor gene rearrangements, younger age at presentation, lower lymphocyte counts, and prolonged survival. The neoplastic phenotypes, CD4+ T cell, DN T cell, and CD5 low T cell, had different median survival times (752 days [n = 37], 271 days [n = 7], 27.5 days [n = 12], respectively). Among CD4+ T-cell cases, cats with abdominal lymphadenopathy, intestinal involvement, or both and females had shorter survival. Among 350 cats with lymphocytosis, CD4+ T-cell lymphocytosis was most common, followed by heterogeneous and B-cell phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Neoplastic CD4+ T-cell lymphocytosis is common in cats and has a prolonged clinical course compared to aberrant T-cell phenotypes. Cats with heterogeneous and B-cell lymphocyte expansions commonly have non-neoplastic disease.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

One of the critical issues of treatment with FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3-mutated AML is drug resistance. FLT3 ligand (FL) represents a mechanism of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, including quizartinib, midostaurin, and sorafenib, in AML cells harboring both wild-type and mutant FLT3 (FLT3 (wt)/FLT3 (mut)). Here, we investigated the effect of FL on the efficacy of gilteritinib, a FLT3 inhibitor, in AML-derived cells in vitro and in mice. In contrast to other FLT3 inhibitors, FL stimulation had little effect on growth inhibition or apoptosis induction by gilteritinib. The antitumor activity of gilteritinib was also comparable between xenograft mouse models injected with FL-expressing and mock MOLM-13 cells. In the FLT3 signaling analyses, gilteritinib inhibited FLT3(wt) and FLT3-ITD to a similar degree in HEK293 and Ba/F3 cells, and similarly suppressed FLT3 downstream signaling molecules (including ERK1/2 and STAT5) in both the presence and absence of FL in MOLM-13 cells. Co-crystal structure analysis showed that gilteritinib bound to the ATP-binding pocket of FLT3. These results suggest that gilteritinib has therapeutic potential in FLT3-mutated AML patients with FL overexpression.",['Copyright: (c) 2019 Kawase et al.'],"['Kawase, Tatsuya', 'Nakazawa, Taisuke', 'Eguchi, Tomohiro', 'Tsuzuki, Hirofumi', 'Ueno, Yoko', 'Amano, Yasushi', 'Suzuki, Tomoyuki', 'Mori, Masamichi', 'Yoshida, Taku']","['Kawase T', 'Nakazawa T', 'Eguchi T', 'Tsuzuki H', 'Ueno Y', 'Amano Y', 'Suzuki T', 'Mori M', 'Yoshida T']",,"['Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Drug Discovery Research, Astellas Pharma, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191022,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FL', 'FLT3', 'FLT3 inhibitor', 'antitumor activity', 'gilteritinib']",2019/11/07 06:00,2019/11/07 06:01,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27222 [doi]', '27222 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2019 Oct 22;10(58):6111-6123. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27222. eCollection 2019 Oct 22.,PMC6817455,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Until recently, therapeutic options for these patients included low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) or the hypomethylating agents (HMA) azacitidine and decitabine, which have historically provided only short-lived and modest benefits. The oral B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor, venetoclax, Venetoclax, an oral B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor, is now approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with LDAC or HMA in older AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication. In the pivotal clinical trials evaluating venetoclax either in combination with LDAC or with HMA, the rates of complete remission (CR) plus CR with incomplete hematological recovery were 54% and 67%, respectively and the median overall survival (OS) was 10.4 months and 17.5 months, respectively, comparing favorably with outcomes in clinical trials evaluating single-agent LDAC or HMA. The most common adverse events with venetoclax combinations are gastrointestinal symptoms, which are primarily low grade and easily manageable, and myelosuppression, which may require delays between cycles, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration, or decreased duration of venetoclax administration per cycle. A bone marrow assessment after the first cycle of treatment is critical to determine dosing and timing of subsequent cycles, as most patients will achieve their best response after one cycle. Appropriate prophylactic measures can reduce the risk of venetoclax-induced tumor lysis syndrome. In this review, we present clinical data from the pivotal trials evaluating venetoclax-based combinations in older patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, and provide practical recommendations for the prevention and management of adverse events associated with venetoclax.","['(c) The Author(s), 2019.']","['Richard-Carpentier, Guillaume', 'DiNardo, Courtney D']","['Richard-Carpentier G', 'DiNardo CD']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9003-0390'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Box 428, Houston TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191023,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'older patients', 'treatment', 'venetoclax']",2019/11/07 06:00,2019/11/07 06:01,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620719882822 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620719882822 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2019 Oct 23;10:2040620719882822. doi: 10.1177/2040620719882822. eCollection 2019.,PMC6811760,,,,"['Conflict of interest statement: GR-C has no relevant conflict of interest to', 'disclose.

In this study, we presented a case of AML who received cytarabine and doxorubicin as a chemotherapy regimen and voriconazole as a prophylactic anti-fungal.

The emphasis of this report is the awareness of clinicians and pharmacotherapists about these interactions.","['(c)Copyright 2019 by the Ataturk University School of Medicine - Available online', 'at www.eurasianjmed.com.']","['Tavakoli-Ardakani, Maria', 'Haghighi, Shirin', 'Shokouhi, Shervin', 'Abtahi-Naeini, Bahareh', 'Meidani, Mohsen', 'Hassanpour, Rezvan', 'Saffaei, Ali']","['Tavakoli-Ardakani M', 'Haghighi S', 'Shokouhi S', 'Abtahi-Naeini B', 'Meidani M', 'Hassanpour R', 'Saffaei A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9230-2318', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7599-7237', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9611-2466', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1081-9477', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9599-6055', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0165-4439', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9563-924X']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ayatollah Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases & Tropical Medicine, Loghman Hakim Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Skin diseases and Leishmaniasis Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Eurasian J Med,The Eurasian journal of medicine,101557701,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytarabine', 'doxorubicin', 'erythrodysesthesia syndrome', 'palmoplantar', 'voriconazole']",2019/11/07 06:00,2019/11/07 06:01,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5152/eurasianjmed.2019.18459 [doi]', 'eajm-51-3-313 [pii]']",ppublish,Eurasian J Med. 2019 Oct;51(3):313-315. doi: 10.5152/eurasianjmed.2019.18459.,PMC6812918,,,,['Conflict of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The capability of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with antiangiogenic peptides to hinder the formation of new blood vessels has been demonstrated in a chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Methods: Exosomes of K562 CML cell line were isolated and their angiogenic effect assessed in a CAM model. AuNPs functionalized with antiangiogenic peptides were used to block the angiogenic effect of CML-derived exosomes, assessed by evaluation of expression levels of key modulators involved in angiogenic pathways - VEGFA, VEGFR1 (also known as FLT1) and IL8. Results: Exosomes isolated from K562 cells promoted the doubling of newly formed vessels associated with the increase of VEGFR1 expression. This is a concentration and time-dependent effect. The AuNPs functionalized with antiangiogenic peptides were capable to block the angiogenic effect by modulating VEGFR1 associated pathway. Conclusion: Exosomes derived from blast cells are capable to trigger (neo)-angiogenesis, a key factor for the progression and spreading of cancer, in particular in CML. AuNPs functionalized with specific antiangiogenic peptides are capable to block the effect of the exosomes produced by malignant cells via modulation of the intrinsic VEGFR pathway.

Patients and methods: In our institution, 67 CML patients were treated with dasatinib. it was given as first line treatment in 26 (39%) and subsequent treatment in 41 (61%) CML patients. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood and cutaneous biopsy was done on all CML patients with dermatological lesions appearing during dasatinib treatment. Results: Among 67 CML patients, 4 (5.9%) showed skin lesions during dasatinib treatment. The cutaneous manifestations were not generalized but mainly located on the back, abdomen, thorax or leg regions. The patients did not show peripheral lymphocytosis at the time when skin lesions appeared. Overall, histological analysis showed that the skin lesions were characterized by a mild perivascular small CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrate with minimal epidermotropism. Conclusion: The unusual T cytotoxic cutaneous infiltrate demonstrated in our CML cases could be the expression of a dasatinib-promoted lymphocyte expansion. However, the heterogeneity of the dermatologic manifestations reported in our CML patients could also be related to unknown factors specific to each CML patient. Our work highlights the finding that skin lesions may be associated with dasatinib treatment and that they should not be confused with viral or bacterial infections but rather interpreted as the clinical expression of lymphocytosis promoted by this TKI.",['(c) 2019 Tarantini et al.'],"['Tarantini, Francesco', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Ingravallo, Giuseppe', 'Attolico, Immacolata', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Russo Rossi, Antonella', 'Lospalluti, Lucia', 'Bufano, Tamara', 'Zanframundo, Giovanni', 'Maiorano, Eugenio', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Tarantini F', 'Anelli L', 'Ingravallo G', 'Attolico I', 'Zagaria A', 'Russo Rossi A', 'Lospalluti L', 'Bufano T', 'Zanframundo G', 'Maiorano E', 'Specchia G', 'Albano F']",,"['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Clinical Oncology, Dermatology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Clinical Oncology, Dermatology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Clinical Oncology, Dermatology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190826,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD8+ lymphocytes', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'inhibitor tyrosine kinase', 'skin lesions']",2019/11/07 06:00,2019/11/07 06:01,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S217872 [doi]', '217872 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Aug 26;11:7991-7996. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S217872. eCollection 2019.,PMC6717053,,,,"['Professor Eugenio Maiorano reports personal fees from Roche, personal fees from', 'Genomic Health and personal fees from Genactis, during the conduct of the study.', 'The authors report no other conflicts of interest in this work.']",,,,,,,,,,,

With the results, we then derived a curve to determine the PPV based on the prevalence of the disorders included in the differential diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 43 publications screened, 27 were included in the systematic review (5,764 patients). The median CD200 positivity rate in all studies and the percentage of CD200-positive (pooled) patients was 100% and 95% (3,061/3,208) in CLL, 4 and 8% (86/1112) in MCL and 56 and 62% (425/689) in other LPD.

In CSF3R gene, the activation mutation including T618I is frequently reported in aCML but is rarely accompanied by truncation mutations. Herein, we report a unique aCML patient with two CSF3R mutations (T618I and Y779*) in the same DNA strand. METHODS: High-coverage next-generation sequencing for 40 genes related with myeloid leukemia was performed. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm CSF3R mutations. To confirm whether two CSF3R mutations are in cis or not, TA cloning was used. Clinical information and bone marrow pathology were reviewed by two hematopathologists. RESULTS: In the patient diagnosed with aCML in bone marrow study, two CSF3R mutations, (T618I and Y779*) a SETBP1 mutation (G870S) and an U2AF1 mutation (Q157P), were identified by high-coverage next-generation sequencing. The two CSF3R mutations were confirmed to be located in the same DNA strand by TA cloning, indicating that the two mutations are harbored in one malignant clone. The SETBP1 mutation is known to be related with poor prognosis in aCML. Likewise, the patient was refractory to hydroxyurea and showed disease progression. Additionally, we discussed the potential therapeutic targets by reviewing the molecular profile of the patient. CONCLUSION: We believe that the accurate diagnosis and maximum therapeutic chance could be achieved by profiling the mutations and their characteristics.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) negatively regulates C/EBPalpha protein levels in myeloid leukemia cells. The overexpression of CDK2 inhibited C/EBPalpha both in a heterologous HEK293T and U937 myeloid leukemia cells. On the contrary, CDK2 depletion enhanced endogenous C/EBPalpha protein levels. CDK2 mitigated C/EBPalpha levels by promoting its ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. We further showed that although CDK2 interacted with C/EBPalpha, direct interaction of CDK2 with C/EBPalpha is not involved in C/EBPalpha downregulation. CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha on its widely reported phosphorylatable amino acid residues is apparently not required for C/EBPalpha degradation by CDK2. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that CDK2-driven C/EBPalpha inhibition mitigates its transactivation potential and cellular functions such as ability to promote myeloid differentiation and growth arrest.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Thacker, Gatha', 'Mishra, Mukul', 'Sharma, Akshay', 'Singh, Anil Kumar', 'Sanyal, Sabyasachi', 'Trivedi, Arun Kumar']","['Thacker G', 'Mishra M', 'Sharma A', 'Singh AK', 'Sanyal S', 'Trivedi AK']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6316-0947'],"['Division of Cancer Biology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, India.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, India.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, India.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, India.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-CDRI, Lucknow, UP, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191106,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*C/EBPalpha', '*CDK2', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*myeloid differentiation', '*ubiquitination']",2019/11/07 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29516 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2020 Apr;121(4):2839-2850. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29516.

Recent studies identified a recurrent mutational hotspot, R222G, in DHX15 in approximately 6% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients that carry the fusion protein RUNX1-RUNX1T1 produced by t (8;21) (q22;q22). Studies using yeast mutants showed that substitution of G for the residue equivalent to R222 leads to loss of its helicase function, suggesting that it is a loss-of-function mutation. To elucidate the role of DHX15 during development, we established the first vertebrate knockout model with CRISPR/Cas9 in zebrafish. Our data showed that dhx15 expression is enriched in the brain, eyes, pectoral fin primordia, liver and intestinal bulb during embryonic development. Dhx15 deficiency leads to pleiotropic morphological phenotypes in homozygous mutant embryos starting at 3 days post fertilization (dpf) that result in lethality by 7 dpf, revealing an essential role during embryonic development. RNA-seq analysis suggested important roles of Dhx15 in chromatin and nucleosome assembly and regulation of the Mdm2-p53 pathway. Interestingly, exons corresponding to the alternate transcriptional start sites for tp53 and mdm2 were preferentially expressed in the mutant embryos, leading to significant upregulation of their alternate isoforms, Delta113p53 (orthologous to Delta133p53 isoform in human) and mdm2-P2 (isoform using distal promoter P2), respectively. We speculate that these alterations in the Mdm2-p53 pathway contribute to the development of AML in patients with t(8;21) and somatically mutated DHX15.",['Published by Oxford University Press 2019.'],"['McElderry, John', 'Carrington, Blake', 'Bishop, Kevin', 'Kim, Erika', 'Pei, Wuhong', 'Chen, Zelin', 'Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa, Ramanagouda', 'Prakash, Anupam', 'Burgess, Shawn M', 'Liu, P Paul', 'Sood, Raman']","['McElderry J', 'Carrington B', 'Bishop K', 'Kim E', 'Pei W', 'Chen Z', 'Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa R', 'Prakash A', 'Burgess SM', 'Liu PP', 'Sood R']",,"['Zebrafish Core, Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Zebrafish Core, Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Zebrafish Core, Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Developmental Genomics Section, Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Developmental Genomics Section, Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Cancer Genomics Unit, Cancer Genetics and Comparative Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Zebrafish Core, Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Developmental Genomics Section, Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Zebrafish Core, Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, Translational and Functional Genomics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DHX15 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Helicases/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Splice Sites', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Splicing Factors/genetics', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2019/11/07 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['5613689 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddz261 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2019 Dec 15;28(24):4173-4185. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddz261.,PMC7202622,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed treatment outcomes and prognostic factors for 32 adult patients with R/R Ph-negative BCP-ALL who received blinatumomab at first salvage. Patients who achieved CR proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). At the time of blinatumomab treatment, 11 patients (34.3%) were primary refractory, 10 (31.4%) had relapsed with first CR duration (CRD1) >/=12 months, and 11 (34.3%) had relapsed with CRD1 <12 months. After the first blinatumomab cycle, 22 (68.8%) achieved CR. At the end of the second cycle, 20 of the 22 patients remained in persistent CR, and 1 patient achieved new CR. The overall minimal residual disease negativity rate was 75% among evaluable patients with persistent CR. Patients with CRD1 <12 months were associated with poorer response to blinatumomab. Twenty (62.5%) of 32 patients underwent allo-HCT in blinatumomab-induced CR. After a median follow-up of 15.2 months, the 1-year OS rates for all patients and patients receiving allo-HCT in CR were 55.5% (median OS, 18.2 months) and 70.7%, respectively. Patients with CRD1 <12 months, extramedullary disease (EMD), and high peripheral blood blasts were associated with poorer OS.

However, subjective and ad hoc manual gating analysis does not adequately handle the increasing volume and heterogeneity of cytometry data for optimal diagnosis. Prior work has shown that machine learning can be applied to classify cytometry samples effectively. However, many of the machine learning classification results are either difficult to interpret without using characteristics of cell populations to make the classification, or suboptimal due to the use of inaccurate cell population characteristics derived from gating boundaries. To date, little has been done to optimize both the gating boundaries and the diagnostic accuracy simultaneously. In this work, we describe a fully discriminative machine learning approach that can simultaneously learn feature representations (e.g., combinations of coordinates of gating boundaries) and classifier parameters for optimizing clinical diagnosis from cytometry measurements. The approach starts from an initial gating position and then refines the position of the gating boundaries by gradient descent until a set of globally-optimized gates across different samples are achieved. The learning procedure is constrained by regularization terms encoding domain knowledge that encourage the algorithm to seek interpretable results. We evaluate the proposed approach using both simulated and real data, producing classification results on par with those generated via human expertise, in terms of both the positions of the gating boundaries and the diagnostic accuracy.

Recent studies have reported that microRNAs (miRNAs) are stably detectable in the blood/plasma and can be used as biomarkers for various types of cancer including AML. The aim of this study was to analyze miR-223 level in serum as a potential indicator for AML diagnosis and prognosis prediction. METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the levels of miR-223 in the serum samples from 131 patients and 70 healthy individuals. RESULTS: The results revealed that serum miR-223 was underexpressed in AML patients, particularly those in intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetic risk groups. Further analysis revealed that serum miR-223 could yield a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.849 with 83.2% sensitivity and 81.4% specificity. Moreover, a significant increase in serum miR-223 level was observed in AML subjects after their treatment. Reduced serum miR-223 level was highly associated with aggressive clinical variables and shorter survival of patients. Furthermore, miR-223 expression was identified to be an independent prognostic predictor of worse overall survival. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, miR-223 may be a reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for AML.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Although FOXO3 had been demonstrated to be involved leukemia, the role of FOXO3 polymorphisms was still not clear. In the present study, we explored the association of FOXO3 SNPs with ALL risk in Chinese children. We genotyped four polymorphisms (rs17069665 A>G, rs4945816 T>C, rs4946936 C>T, and rs9400241 A>C) of FOXO3 in 425 ALL cases and 1339 health controls. The associations were estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Further analyses were performed to explore associations of rs17069665 and rs9400241 with ALL susceptibility in terms of age, gender, immunophenotype, minimal residual disease (MRD), and other clinical characteristics. We found rs17069665 related to the increased ALL risk (OR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.02-3.04), rs9400241 related to decreased ALL risk (OR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.64-0.99). The effects of rs17069665 on ALL risk were more predominant in males and children < 10 years, and patients with lower rates of platelet or neutrophil. As for rs9400241, the effects were more predominant in children < 10 years, and in patients with pre B ALL, positive MRD, anemia, or hepatomegaly. In conclusion, FOXO3 gene polymorphisms influence the risk of ALL in children and might be a potential biomarker for ALL susceptibility.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Yang, Xu', 'Wu, Xuedong', 'Fang, Na', 'Liu, Xiaoping', 'Liu, Xiaodan', 'Yang, Lihua', 'Huang, Ke', 'Luo, Ailing', 'Cai, Mansi', 'Wu, Fan', 'Jiang, Hua', 'Xu, Ling']","['Yang X', 'Wu X', 'Fang N', 'Liu X', 'Liu X', 'Yang L', 'Huang K', 'Luo A', 'Cai M', 'Wu F', 'Jiang H', 'Xu L']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1326-9861'],"[""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Bioengineering Institute (Guangzhou Sugarcane Industry Research Institute), Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Division of Birth Cohort Study, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", 'Pediatric Center of Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University (Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital), Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191106,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)']",IM,"['Asians/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3/*genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*FOXO3', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*childhood', '*polymorphism', '*single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)', '*susceptibility']",2019/11/07 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29436 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2020 Feb;121(2):2019-2026. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29436.

Calystegia hederacea Wall. is a perennial herbaceous vine that is widespread throughout India and East Asia. All parts of this plant are used for the treatment of menoxenia, gonorrhea, etc. Alkaline hydrolysis of the crude resin glycoside fraction of the whole plants of C. hederacea yielded four new glycosidic acids, calyhedic acids A, B, C, and D, along with two known glycosidic acids, calysolic acids A and C, and three known organic acids, 2S-methylbutyric, tiglic, and 2R,3R-nilic acids. Their structures were characterized on the basis of spectroscopic data and chemical evidence. Calyhedic acids A, B, and D were penta-, hexa-, and hepta-glycosides of 12S-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, respectively, and cayhedic acid C was an isomer of calyhedic acid D, in which the 12S-hydroxyhexadecanoyl residue of calyhedic acid D was replaced by a 11S-hydroxyhexadecanoyl residue. Additionally, cytotoxic activity toward HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells of the crude resin glycoside fraction, the glycosidic acid fraction, calyhedic acid A, and calysolic acid A from C. hederacea was evaluated. Furthermore, to clarify the structure-activity relationship of resin glycosides, the activities of six genuine resin glycosides with calysolic acid A or calysolic acid C as the glycosidic acid, which were isolated from C. soldanella, were examined. Among them, the crude resin glycoside fraction and five genuine resin glycosides with macrolactone structures demonstrated clear cytotoxic activities, while the glycosidic acid fraction, calyhedric acid A, calysolic acid A, and a genuine non-macrolactone-type resin glycoside were either inactive or exhibited weaker activity than the tested macrolactone-type resin glycosides.",,"['Ono, Masateru', 'Ichihara, Yoshino', 'Saito, Nao', 'Yamada, Minami', 'Yuuki, Kana', 'Nawata, Masami', 'Tsutsumi, Shuhei', 'Yasuda, Shin', 'Tsuchihashi, Ryota', 'Okawa, Masafumi', 'Kinjo, Junei', 'Miyashita, Hiroyuki', 'Yoshimitsu, Hitoshi', 'Nohara, Toshihiro']","['Ono M', 'Ichihara Y', 'Saito N', 'Yamada M', 'Yuuki K', 'Nawata M', 'Tsutsumi S', 'Yasuda S', 'Tsuchihashi R', 'Okawa M', 'Kinjo J', 'Miyashita H', 'Yoshimitsu H', 'Nohara T']",,"['School of Agriculture, Tokai University, 9-1-1 Toroku, Higashi-ku, Kumamoto, 862-8652, Japan. mono@agri.u-tokai.ac.jp.', 'School of Agriculture, Tokai University, 9-1-1 Toroku, Higashi-ku, Kumamoto, 862-8652, Japan.', 'School of Agriculture, Tokai University, 9-1-1 Toroku, Higashi-ku, Kumamoto, 862-8652, Japan.', 'School of Agriculture, Tokai University, 9-1-1 Toroku, Higashi-ku, Kumamoto, 862-8652, Japan.', 'School of Agriculture, Tokai University, 9-1-1 Toroku, Higashi-ku, Kumamoto, 862-8652, Japan.', 'School of Agriculture, Tokai University, 9-1-1 Toroku, Higashi-ku, Kumamoto, 862-8652, Japan.', 'School of Agriculture, Tokai University, 9-1-1 Toroku, Higashi-ku, Kumamoto, 862-8652, Japan.', 'School of Agriculture, Tokai University, 9-1-1 Toroku, Higashi-ku, Kumamoto, 862-8652, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sojo University, 4-22-2 Ikeda, Nishi-ku, Kumamoto, 860-0082, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sojo University, 4-22-2 Ikeda, Nishi-ku, Kumamoto, 860-0082, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sojo University, 4-22-2 Ikeda, Nishi-ku, Kumamoto, 860-0082, Japan.']",['eng'],['JP16K08306/JPS KAKENHI'],['Journal Article'],20191105,Japan,J Nat Med,Journal of natural medicines,101518405,"['0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (PENTA)', '0 (Resins, Plant)']",IM,"['Calystegia/*chemistry', 'Glycosides/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Resins, Plant/*chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",['NOTNLM'],"['Calyhedic acid', 'Calystegia hederacea', 'Convolvulaceae', 'Cytotoxic activity', 'Glycosidic acid', 'Resin glycoside']",2019/11/07 06:00,2020/03/24 06:00,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11418-019-01366-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s11418-019-01366-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Nat Med. 2020 Jan;74(1):200-211. doi: 10.1007/s11418-019-01366-9.

Diagnostic workup for AML includes cytogenetic analysis and mutational screening covering frequently mutated genes in AML. The genetic analysis is required for risk stratification and treatment decisions. Very recently, three novel drugs have been approved for patients who can be intensively treated: a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (midostaurin) for patients with FLT3 mutations, a liposomal formulation of chemotherapy (CPX) for patients with features of secondary AML, and a CD33 antibody-drug conjugate (gemtuzumab-ozogamicin) for AML with CD33 expression. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains an important treatment strategy for patients with intermediate- or high-risk AML and for patients with relapsed AML. For elderly patients who cannot undergo intensive treatment, demethylating agents are the treatment of choice. The aim is to prolong life expectancy with acceptable quality of life. In recent clinical trials, novel drugs have shown promising results in this patient population. Some of these drugs have already been approved in the US. Among these drugs are the Bcl2 inhibitor venetoclax, which is already approved in Germany for chronic lymphatic leukemia, as well as IDH1/IDH2 inhibitors (the latter for patients with IDH1/IDH2 mutated AML).

Germline mutations in the ATM gene cause Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), characterized by cerebellar ataxia and cancer predisposition. Whether ATM deficiency impacts on tumor initiation or also on the maintenance of the malignant state is unclear. Here, we show that Atm reactivation in initially Atm-deficient B- and T cell lymphomas induces tumor regression. We further find a reduced T cell abundance in B cell lymphomas from Atm-defective mice and A-T patients. Using T cell-specific Atm-knockout models, as well as allogeneic transplantation experiments, we pinpoint impaired immune surveillance as a contributor to cancer predisposition and development. Moreover, we demonstrate that Atm-deficient T cells display impaired proliferation capacity upon stimulation, due to replication stress.

The viral oncoprotein Tax triggers this constitutive activation by interacting with the ubiquitin-rich IKK complex. We previously demonstrated that Optineurin and TAX1BP1, two members of the ubiquitin-binding, Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM-1/p62)-like selective autophagy receptor family, are involved in Tax-mediated NF-kappaB signaling. Here, using a proximity-dependent biotinylation approach (BioID), we identify p62 as a new candidate partner of Tax and confirm the interaction in infected T cells. We then demonstrate that p62 knock-out in MEF cells as well as p62 knock-down in HEK293T cells significantly reduces Tax-mediated NF-kappaB activity. We further show that although p62 knock-down does not alter NF-kappaB activation in Jurkat T cells nor in infected T cells, p62 does potentiate Tax-mediated NF-kappaB activity upon over-expression in Jurkat T cells. We next show that p62 associates with the Tax/IKK signalosome in cells, and identify the 170-206 domain of p62 as sufficient for the direct, ubiquitin-independent interaction with Tax. However, we observe that this domain is dispensable for modulating Tax activity in cells, and functional analysis of p62 mutants indicates that p62 could potentiate Tax activity in cells by facilitating the association of ubiquitin chains with the Tax/IKK signalosome. Altogether, our results identify p62 as a new ubiquitin-dependent modulator of Tax activity on NF-kappaB, further highlighting the importance of ubiquitin in the signaling activity of the viral Tax oncoprotein.",,"['Schwob, Aurelien', 'Teruel, Elodie', 'Dubuisson, Louise', 'Lormieres, Florence', 'Verlhac, Pauline', 'Abudu, Yakubu Princely', 'Gauthier, Janelle', 'Naoumenko, Marie', 'Cloarec-Ung, Fanny-Mei', 'Faure, Mathias', 'Johansen, Terje', 'Dutartre, Helene', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Journo, Chloe']","['Schwob A', 'Teruel E', 'Dubuisson L', 'Lormieres F', 'Verlhac P', 'Abudu YP', 'Gauthier J', 'Naoumenko M', 'Cloarec-Ung FM', 'Faure M', 'Johansen T', 'Dutartre H', 'Mahieux R', 'Journo C']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1059-4645', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8798-270X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2682-4302', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0973-0777']","['International Center for Research in Infectiology, Retroviral Oncogenesis Laboratory, INSERM U1111 -

In higher organisms, one Notch-responsive gene that is activated in many different cell types encodes the Notch-regulated ankyrin repeat protein (NRARP), which acts as a negative feedback regulator of Notch responses. Here, we showed that NRARP inhibited the growth of Notch-dependent T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines and bound directly to the core Notch transcriptional activation complex (NTC), requiring both the transcription factor RBPJ and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), but not Mastermind-like proteins or DNA. The crystal structure of an NRARP-NICD1-RBPJ-DNA complex, determined to 3.75 A resolution, revealed that the assembly of NRARP-NICD1-RBPJ complexes relied on simultaneous engagement of RBPJ and NICD1, with the three ankyrin repeats of NRARP extending the Notch1 ankyrin repeat stack. Mutations at the NRARP-NICD1 interface disrupted entry of the proteins into NTCs and abrogated feedback inhibition in Notch signaling assays in cultured cells. Forced expression of NRARP reduced the abundance of NICD in cells, suggesting that NRARP may promote the degradation of NICD. These studies establish the structural basis for NTC engagement by NRARP and provide insights into a critical negative feedback mechanism that regulates Notch signaling.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

In cervical cancer, p53 is inactivated by degradation through the complex with human papilloma virus (HPV) oncoprotein E6 and E6-associated protein (E6AP), an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. In endometrial cancer, overexpression of p53 in immunohistochemistry is a significant prognostic factor. A discrepancy between p53 overexpression and TP53 mutations is observed in endometrioid endometrial cancer, indicating that the accumulation of p53 protein can be explained by not only gene mutations but also dysregulation of the factors such as ERbeta and MDM2. Furthermore, the double-positive expression of immunoreactive estrogen receptor (ER) beta and p53 proteins is closely associated with the incidence of metastasis and/or recurrence. High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) arises from secretary cells in the fallopian tube. The secretary cell outgrowth (SCOUT) with TP53 mutations progresses to HGSC via the p53 signature, serous intraepithelial lesion (STIL), and serous intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), indicating that TP53 mutation is associated with carcinogenesis of HGSC. Clinical application targeting p53 has been approved for some malignant tumors. Gene therapy by the adenovirus-mediated p53 gene transfer system is performed for head and neck cancer. A clinical phase III trial using MDM2/X inhibitors, idasanutlin (RG7388) combined with cytarabine, is being performed involving relapse/refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients. The use of adenoviruses as live vectors which encode wild-type p53 has given promising results in cervical cancer patients.",,"['Nakamura, Mitsuhiro', 'Obata, Takeshi', 'Daikoku, Takiko', 'Fujiwara, Hiroshi']","['Nakamura M', 'Obata T', 'Daikoku T', 'Fujiwara H']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa 920-8641, Japan. mitsu222@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa 920-8641, Japan. t-oba.0919@hotmail.co.jp.', 'Institute for Experimental Animals, Kanazawa University Advanced Science Research Center, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-8641, Japan. tdaikoku@kiea.m.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa 920-8641, Japan. fuji@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191104,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinoma/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Uterine Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['HPV', 'STIC', 'TP53 mutation', 'cervical cancer', 'endometrial cancer', 'gene therapy', 'ovarian cancer', 'p53 overexpression', 'p53 signature']",2019/11/07 06:00,2020/04/01 06:00,['2019/11/07 06:00'],"['2019/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20215482 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20215482 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Nov 4;20(21). pii: ijms20215482. doi: 10.3390/ijms20215482.,PMC6862296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cisplatin (CisPt) is a very common chemotherapeutic agent to treat cancer by reestablishing apoptotic mechanisms of cell death. However, certain patients acquire resistance to CisPt as well as suffer nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, nausea and vomiting. The synthesis of new Pt(II) compounds represents an alternative to CisPt to avoid resistance and undesirable side effects. Pd(II) could be a Pt(II) surrogate given the similarity of coordination chemistry between them, thus widening the spectra of available anticancer drugs. Herein, we have synthesized and characterized two Pt(II) or Pd(II) complexes with TdTn (2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)imino-N-(2-thiazolin-2-yl)thiazolidine), a thiazoline derivative ligand, with formula [PtCl2(TdTn)] and [PdCl2(TdTn)]. The potential anticancer ability was evaluated in human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 and human histiocytic lymphoma U-937 cell lines. To that aim, U-937 and HT-29 cells were treated with TdTn, [PtCl2(TdTn)] and [PdCl2(TdTn)] for 24h. The microscopy monitoring indicated that TdTn, [PtCl2(TdTn)] and [PdCl2(TdTn)] arrested the cell proliferation of U-937 and HT-29 cells with respect to control, in agreement with MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) analysis. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the ligand by its own showed antiproliferative effects in both cell lines. [PtCl2(TdTn)] and [PdCl2(TdTn)] caused caspase-3 activation in U-937 cells, simultaneously with caspase-9 activation due to complexes; however, in HT-29 caspase-3 activation occurred simultaneously with caspase-8 activation induced by the ligand TdTn. Only metal complexes were able to induce ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) generation in U-937 cells, but not TdTn. In HT-29 cells neither the metal complexes, nor the ligand induced ROS generation.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In the sea urchin embryo model, 1-benzimidazolyl-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridinones 11 caused inhibition of hatching and spiculogenesis at sub-micromolar concentrations. These compounds also selectively and potently inhibited growth of the MOLT-4 leukemia cell line. Subsequent structure-activity relationship studies determined the benzimidazolyl fragment as an essential pharmacophore for both effects. We applied numerous techniques for target identification. A preliminary QSAR target identification search did not result in tangible leads. Attempts to prepare a relevant photoaffinity probe that retained potency in both assays were not successful. Compounds 11 were further characterized for their activity in a wild-type versus Notch-mutant leukemia cell lines, and in in vitro panels of kinases and matrix metalloproteinases.

Objective: To compare the efficacy of caspofungin vs fluconazole prophylaxis against proven or probable invasive fungal disease and invasive aspergillosis during neutropenia following acute myeloid leukemia chemotherapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, randomized, open-label, clinical trial enrolled patients aged 3 months to 30 years with newly diagnosed de novo, relapsed, or secondary acute myeloid leukemia being treated at 115 US and Canadian institutions (April 2011-November 2016; last follow-up June 30, 2018). Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned during the first chemotherapy cycle to prophylaxis with caspofungin (n = 257) or fluconazole (n = 260). Prophylaxis was administered during the neutropenic period following each chemotherapy cycle. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was proven or probable invasive fungal disease as adjudicated by blinded central review. Secondary outcomes were invasive aspergillosis, empirical antifungal therapy, and overall survival. Results: The second interim efficacy analysis and an unplanned futility analysis based on 394 patients appeared to have suggested futility, so the study was closed to accrual. Among the 517 participants who were randomized (median age, 9 years [range, 0-26 years]; 44% female), 508 (98%) completed the trial. The 23 proven or probable invasive fungal disease events (6 caspofungin vs 17 fluconazole) included 14 molds, 7 yeasts, and 2 fungi not further categorized. The 5-month cumulative incidence of proven or probable invasive fungal disease was 3.1% (95% CI, 1.3%-7.0%) in the caspofungin group vs 7.2% (95% CI, 4.4%-11.8%) in the fluconazole group (overall P = .03 by log-rank test) and for cumulative incidence of proven or probable invasive aspergillosis was 0.5% (95% CI, 0.1%-3.5%) with caspofungin vs 3.1% (95% CI, 1.4%-6.9%) with fluconazole (overall P = .046 by log-rank test). No statistically significant differences in empirical antifungal therapy (71.9% caspofungin vs 69.5% fluconazole, overall P = .78 by log-rank test) or 2-year overall survival (68.8% caspofungin vs 70.8% fluconazole, overall P = .66 by log-rank test) were observed. The most common toxicities were hypokalemia (22 caspofungin vs 13 fluconazole), respiratory failure (6 caspofungin vs 9 fluconazole), and elevated alanine transaminase (4 caspofungin vs 8 fluconazole). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children, adolescents, and young adults with acute myeloid leukemia, prophylaxis with caspofungin compared with fluconazole resulted in significantly lower incidence of invasive fungal disease. The findings suggest that caspofungin may be considered for prophylaxis against invasive fungal disease, although study interpretation is limited by early termination due to an unplanned interim analysis that appeared to have suggested futility.

The reasons are multifactorial, including a late presentation with higher disease burden, malnourishment, and limited support services. These factors may aggravate the toxic effects of upfront multiagent chemotherapy in terms of severe neutropenic sepsis and tumor lysis. Therefore, instead of upfront chemotherapy, we offered prednisolone prophase for 1 week with the objective of balancing the antileukemic versus the toxic effect of treatment. The data of 538 patients who received induction with this approach (cohort B) are compared for induction mortality with previous records of 438 patients (cohort A) treated with upfront chemotherapy. In the presence of similar clinical characteristics including age, sex, risk group, and phenotype in both cohorts, a significant difference was found in overall induction mortality of 9% in cohort B versus 14% in cohort A (P<0.05). This difference was also significant in the high-risk and T-cell phenotype, which strengthens our hypothesis that patients with higher burden of disease may experience more fatal toxic effects with upfront intensive chemotherapy.

Our study aimed to determine the most important prognostic variables among an aggregate of clinical, genetic, and treatment response-based factors in pediatric RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (+) AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the characteristics and outcome of 40 patients who were diagnosed with and treated for RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (+) AML from April 2008 to December 2016 at our institution. RESULTS: A<-2.2 log fusion transcript decrement after remission induction, myeloid sarcoma type extramedullary involvement (EMI) at diagnosis, higher initial white blood cell count, and presence of KIT mutation predicted lower event-free survival. Both lower fusion transcript decrement after remission induction and the presence of EMI at diagnosis proved to be significant adverse factors in the multivariate study. The 5-year event-free survival was 70.0+/-7.2% (28/40); 8 of the 12 relapsed patients survive disease-free, resulting in 5-year overall survival of 89.5+/-5.0% (36/40).

Although sharing many somatic mutations with MDS and MPN, the purpose of this review is to put recent biological findings of CMML in the context of evolutionary theory, highlighting it as a distinct evolutionary trajectory occurring in the context of clonal hematopoiesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), with a mutational spectrum and prevalence correlated with age, has been defined. Enriched in DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 mutations, clonal evolution can progress into various evolutionary trajectories including CMML. Impact of founder mutations (primarily TET2) on increased hematopoietic stem cell fitness has been well characterized. Epistatic interactions between mutations and epigenetic events have been explored, both in CMML and its pediatric counterpart juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, including CMML transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Together, these findings have contributed significantly toward CMML evolutionary dynamics. SUMMARY: Despite relatively few 'driver' mutations in CMML, evolutionary development of chronic leukemia remains incompletely understood. Recent studies have shed light on the importance of studying epigenetic consequences of mutations and epistasis between key mutations to better understand clonal architecture and evolutionary dynamics.",,"['Carr, Ryan M', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M']","['Carr RM', 'Patnaik MM']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Epistasis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2019/11/07 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2019/11/06 06:00'],"['2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000553 [doi]', '00062752-202001000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2020 Jan;27(1):2-10. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000553.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: New targeted therapies for hematological malignancy include chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T cells), Bi-specific T-cell Engager (BiTE) blinatumomab, and the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) of calicheamicin inotuzumab ozogamicin for acute lymphoblasic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma; the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3Kdelta) inhibitor idelalisib for lymphoma and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors, such as midostaurin, sorafenib and gilteritinib for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax for a range of hematological malignancies including lymphoma and leukemia. This review summarizes recommendations for IFD prophylaxis using these therapies and evidence for managing concomitant azole administration. SUMMARY: Whilst some evidence exists to guide IFD prophylaxis using new targeted therapies for hematological malignancies, there is an overall lack of descriptive, robust studies specifically describing IFD risk and management. With the emergence of novel agents, clinical judgment must be used to assess the risk of developing an IFD.

Using diagnostic samples from patients enrolled in the frontline Children's Oncology Group (COG) T-ALL clinical trial AALL1231, we demonstrated that one-third of primary T-ALLs were resistant to GCs when cells were cultured in the presence of IL-7, a cytokine that is critical for normal T cell function and that plays a well-established role in leukemogenesis. We demonstrated that in these T-ALLs and in distinct populations of normal developing thymocytes, GCs paradoxically induced their own resistance by promoting upregulation of IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) expression. In the presence of IL-7, this augmented downstream signal transduction, resulting in increased STAT5 transcriptional output and upregulation of the prosurvival protein BCL-2.

In this study, whole genome sequencing was used to characterize the carbapenem resistance mechanism of three C. freundii clinical isolates recovered from fecal samples of patients with acute leukemia (AL) from Spain. Materials and methods: Twelve fecal samples, collected between 2013 and 2015 from 9 patients with AL, were screened for the presence of CP strains by selecting them on MacConkey agar supplemented with ertapenem (0.5 mg/L). Bacteria were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and were phenotypically characterized. Whole genome sequencing of C. freundii isolates was performed using the MinION and MiSeq Illumina sequencers. Bioinformatic analysis was performed in order to identify the molecular support of carbapenem resistance and to study the genetic environment of carbapenem resistance encoding genes. Results: Three carbapenem-resistant C. freundii strains (imipenem MIC>/=32 mg/L) corresponding to three different AL patients were isolated. Positive modified Carba NP test results suggested carbapenemase production. The genomes of each C. freundii tested were assembled into a single chromosomal contig and plasmids contig. In all the strains, the carbapenem resistance was due to the coproduction of OXA-48 and VIM-1 enzymes encoded by genes located on chromosome and on an IncHI2 plasmid, respectively. According to the MLST and the SNPs analysis, all strains belonged to the same clone ST169. Conclusion: We report in our study, the intestinal carrying of C. freundii clone ST169 coproducing OXA-48 and VIM-1 identified in leukemic patients.",['(c) The Author(s). 2019.'],"['Lalaoui, Rym', 'Djukovic, Ana', 'Bakour, Sofiane', 'Hadjadj, Linda', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Salavert, Miguel', 'Lopez-Hontangas, Jose Luis', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Ubeda, Carles', 'Rolain, Jean-Marc']","['Lalaoui R', 'Djukovic A', 'Bakour S', 'Hadjadj L', 'Sanz J', 'Salavert M', 'Lopez-Hontangas JL', 'Sanz MA', 'Ubeda C', 'Rolain JM']",,"['Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, Marseille, France.', 'MEPHI, IHU Mediterranee-Infection, 19-21 Boulevard Jean Moulin, 13385 Marseille Cedex 05, France.', 'Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica - FISABIO, Valencia, Spain.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, Marseille, France.', 'MEPHI, IHU Mediterranee-Infection, 19-21 Boulevard Jean Moulin, 13385 Marseille Cedex 05, France.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, Marseille, France.', 'MEPHI, IHU Mediterranee-Infection, 19-21 Boulevard Jean Moulin, 13385 Marseille Cedex 05, France.', '4Department of Medicine, Hospital Universitari I Politecnic La Fe, University of Valencia, and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Instituto Carlos III, Valencia, Spain.', '5Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', '5Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', '4Department of Medicine, Hospital Universitari I Politecnic La Fe, University of Valencia, and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer, Instituto Carlos III, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro Superior de Investigacion en Salud Publica - FISABIO, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centers of Biomedical Research Network (CIBER) in Epidemiology and Public Health, Madrid, Spain.', 'Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, Marseille, France.', 'MEPHI, IHU Mediterranee-Infection, 19-21 Boulevard Jean Moulin, 13385 Marseille Cedex 05, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191029,England,Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,101585411,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (carbapenemase)']",IM,"['Bacterial Proteins/*genetics', 'Citrobacter freundii/*classification/drug effects/*genetics', 'Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*epidemiology/*etiology', '*Genome, Bacterial', '*Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'beta-Lactamases/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Carbapenemase', '*Citrobacter freundii', '*OXA-48', '*VIM-1', '*Whole genome sequencing']",2019/11/07 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2019/11/06 06:00'],"['2019/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13756-019-0630-3 [doi]', '630 [pii]']",epublish,Antimicrob Resist Infect Control. 2019 Oct 29;8:167. doi: 10.1186/s13756-019-0630-3. eCollection 2019.,PMC6820958,,,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to assess the expression of these cytokines in de novo AML and investigate their role as biomarkers. Subjects and methods: Seventy newly diagnosed patients with primary AML and 30 matched healthy volunteers were recruited. AML diagnosis was confirmed with flowcytometric and immunophenotypic analyses, while ELISA was used to assess serum levels of IL27 and IL35 in patients and controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to estimate IL27 and IL35 optimum cutoff values for predicting AML. Results: Serum levels of both cytokines were significantly higher in AML patients than controls (P<0.001), with no effect of gender or French-American-British subtypes. Significant correlations of IL27 and IL35 with poor prognostic factors and with each other were detected in patients only. IL27 optimum cutoff for predicting AML was >43, AUC (0.926) with a sensitivity 74% and specificity 96.6% (P<0.001), while for IL35>27.8, AUC (0.972) with 88% and 98% sensitivity and specificity, respectively (P<0.001). Conclusion: Conclusively, this study proved that IL27and IL35 could identify AML patients from healthy subjects, and their overexpression denotes poor prognosis. Based on the simplicity and wide availability of their detection technique we recommend the inclusion of IL27 and IL35 in the diagnostic/prognostic workup of AML; however, further longitudinal research is needed to prove their exact prognostic value.",['(c) 2019 Ahmed et al.'],"['Ahmed, Heba A', 'Maklad, Ahmed M', 'Khaled, Safaa Aa', 'Elyamany, Ashraf']","['Ahmed HA', 'Maklad AM', 'Khaled SA', 'Elyamany A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3693-0563', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2239-7219', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3106-9847']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Sohag University, Sohag, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology and Nuclear Medicine, Sohag University Hospitals, Sohag, Egypt.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, KSA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit, Faculty of Medicine/Unit of Bone Marrow Transplantation, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, King Saud Medical City, Riyadh, KSA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191001,New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['IL27', 'IL35', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'flowcytometry', 'regulatory T cells']",2019/11/07 06:00,2019/11/07 06:01,['2019/11/06 06:00'],"['2019/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S221301 [doi]', '221301 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2019 Oct 1;10:341-349. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S221301. eCollection 2019.,PMC6783395,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: MTS assay was used to detect the proliferation of CML cells. The proteins expression were detected by Western blot assay. The effects of BEZ235 on autophagy in CML cells were verified through transmission electron microscopy and evaluated by laser confocal microscopy. Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis. A xenograft model was established to observe the therapeutic effect of BEZ235 in vivo. Results: BEZ235 could inhibit the proliferation of CML cells; CQ and 3-MA could increase the proliferation inhibition and Z-VAD-FMK can reduce the proliferation inhibition of BEZ235 on CML cells (P<0.05). Results of TEM showed that the autophagosomes of CML cells treated with BEZ235 increased (P<0.05). The results by confocal microscopy showed that the autophagic activity of K562 cells increased with BEZ235 treatment. When BEZ235 combined with CQ, BEZ235-induced autophagic flow was blocked. FCM results showed that BEZ235 could induces apoptosis in CML cells. Z-VAD-FMK could decrease the apoptosis of CML cells induced by BEZ235. CQ increased the apoptosis of CML cells induced by BEZ235 (P<0.05). Western blot showed that BEZ235 inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and S6K. BEZ235 alone could upregulate the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and LC3II. When combined with Z-VAD-FMK, the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was lower than that of BEZ235 alone. When combined with CQ, the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and LC3II were higher than those of BEZ235 alone (P<0.05). BEZ235 could inhibit the growth of xenografts of CML cell line. Conclusion: BEZ235 can inhibit the proliferation of CML cells, induce apoptosis, and enhance autophagy activity. It induces protective autophagy. The combination of CQ can enhance the apoptosis and proliferation inhibition of CML cells induced by BEZ235.",['(c) 2019 Xin et al.'],"['Xin, Pengliang', 'Xu, Wenqian', 'Zhu, Xiongpeng', 'Li, Chuntuan', 'Zheng, Yan', 'Zheng, Tingjin', 'Cheng, Wenzhao', 'Peng, Qunyi']","['Xin P', 'Xu W', 'Zhu X', 'Li C', 'Zheng Y', 'Zheng T', 'Cheng W', 'Peng Q']",,"[""Department of Haematology, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Haematology, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Haematology, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Haematology, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Haematology, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Central Laboratory, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Stem Cell Translational Research Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Haematology, Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190822,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BEZ235', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'proliferation']",2019/11/07 06:00,2019/11/07 06:01,['2019/11/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S204472 [doi]', '204472 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Aug 22;11:7933-7951. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S204472. eCollection 2019.,PMC6709803,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

By performing gene chip analysis, we predicted that Hh signaling might regulate multiple downstream pathways in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods: In this study, the potential role of the Hh pathway in refractory AML, and the impact of Hh expression on clinical prognosis were examined. We also investigated the role of the Hh inhibitor NVP-LDE225 in reversing drug resistance of refractory primary AML cells in vitro and the roles of multiple drug-resistant HL60/Adriamycin-resistant cells in vitro and in vivo (in a xenograft mouse model). Finally, we explored the underlying mechanisms. Results: Hh pathway was highly active in chemotherapy-resistant AML cells; by contrast, activation was less pronounced in chemosensitive cells and non-refractory primary cells. Strong activation of this pathway was associated with higher recurrence rates and poorer relapse-free and overall survival. NVP-LDE225 inhibited MRP1 protein expression, increased intracellular accumulation of Adriamycin, and reversed chemotherapeutic resistance. These effects were likely mediated through inhibition of the IGF-1R/Akt/MRP1 pathway. In the AML xenograft mouse model, NVP-LDE225 plus Adriamycin resulted in marked tumor regression. Conclusion: These findings suggest that targeting the Hh pathway might be a therapeutic avenue for overcoming MDR resistance and preventing refractory AML.",['(c) 2019 Huang et al.'],"['Huang, Kaikai', 'Sun, Zhiqiang', 'Ding, Bingjie', 'Jiang, Xuejie', 'Wang, Zhixiang', 'Zhu, Yufeng', 'Meng, Fanyi']","['Huang K', 'Sun Z', 'Ding B', 'Jiang X', 'Wang Z', 'Zhu Y', 'Meng F']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20190911,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hedgehog pathway', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance']",2019/11/07 06:00,2019/11/07 06:01,['2019/11/06 06:00'],"['2019/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S216628 [doi]', '216628 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Sep 11;12:7477-7488. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S216628. eCollection 2019.,PMC6752208,,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,

However, these resources may not adequately reveal pharmaceutical-author interactions and their potential conflicts of interest (CoIs). This investigation: (1) evaluates the correspondence of two well-utilized CoI databases: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments (CMSOP) and ProPublica's Dollars for Docs (PDD) and (2) quantifies CoIs among authors of a publicly available point of care clinical support website which is used to inform evidence-based medicine decisions. Two data sources were used: the hundred most common drugs and the top fifty causes of death. These topics were entered into a freely available database. The authors (N = 139) were then input into CMSOP and PDD and compensation and number of payments were determined for 2013-2015. The subset of highly compensated authors that also reported ""Nothing to disclose"" were further examined. There was a high degree of similarity between CMSOP and PDD for compensation (R(2) >/= 0.998) and payment number (R(2) >/= 0.992). The amount received was 1.4% higher in CMSOP ($4,059,194) than in PDD ($4,002,891). The articles where the authors had received the greatest compensation were in neurology (Parkinson's Disease = $1,810,032), oncology (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia = $616,727), and endocrinology (Type I Diabetes = $377,388). Two authors reporting ""Nothing to disclose"" received appreciable and potentially relevant compensation. CMSOP and PDD produced almost identical results. CoIs were common among authors but self-reporting may be an inadequate reporting mechanism. Recommendations are offered for improving the CoI transparency of pharmaceutical-author interactions in point-of-care electronic resources.",,"['Chopra, Ambica C', 'Tilberry, Stephanie S', 'Sternat, Kaitlyn E', 'Chung, Daniel Y', 'Nichols, Stephanie D', 'Piper, Brian J']","['Chopra AC', 'Tilberry SS', 'Sternat KE', 'Chung DY', 'Nichols SD', 'Piper BJ']",,"['Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, USA.', 'Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, USA.', 'Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, USA.', 'Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, USA.', 'University of New England, Portland, USA.', 'Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, USA. bpiper@som.geisinger.edu.', 'Center for Pharmacy Innovation and Outcomes, Forty Fort, USA. bpiper@som.geisinger.edu.']",['eng'],['T32 ES007060/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20191104,England,Sci Eng Ethics,Science and engineering ethics,9516228,,IM,"['Aged', '*Conflict of Interest', 'Databases, Factual', '*Disclosure', 'Humans', 'Medicare', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bioethics', '*Transparency']",2019/11/07 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2019/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11948-019-00153-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s11948-019-00153-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Sci Eng Ethics. 2020 Apr;26(2):921-930. doi: 10.1007/s11948-019-00153-9.

It causes significant economic losses associated with losses due to slaughter and eradication of infected animal from infected area and other indirect economic losses such as restriction on importation of animals and semen from infected area. The main objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of BLV antibodies in cattle, buffaloes, and camels in Egypt using ELISA test. Serum samples were collected from 350 cattle, 100 buffaloes, and 100 camels during 2018. The seropositivity for BLV-specific antibody was 20.8%, 9%, and 0% in cattle, buffaloes, and camels, respectively. The result revealed significant association (p < 0.05) between age and seroprevalence of BLV infection in cattle > 4 years (24%) compared with those < 4 years (13%). We found no significant association between pregnancy and herd size and seroprevalence of BLV infection in this study (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the age, pregnancy state, and herd size had significant effect on seroprevalence of BLV infection in buffaloes. This study contributes that BLV is detected in cattle and buffaloes in Egypt and confirms that the camels has resistance against BLV infection.

To date, no studies have been found focusing on ED in elderly patients with APL. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 409 consecutive patients with APL (139 patients >/= 50 years old, 270 patients < 50 years old). All patients received arsenic trioxide alone as induction therapy. The baseline clinical characteristics and ED occurrence and predictors between elderly and young patients with APL were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical features of elderly patients at admission were not significantly different from those of young ones. The ED rate of elderly patients was significantly greater than that of young patients (23.74% vs 11.85%, P = 0.0018). Hemorrhage is the main cause of ED in elderly patients, followed by infection and differentiation syndrome. From the 15th to 30th days of treatment, elderly patients had a higher mortality rate than that of young patients (7.83% vs 2.06%, P = 0.009). Male, white blood cell (WBC) count > 10 x 10(9)/L, fibrinogen < 1.0 g/L and low albumin levels were independent risk factors for ED in elderly patients, while ED was only correlated with WBC count, fibrinogen and creatinine levels in young patients. CONCLUSION: The results of this study may help design more rational treatment plans for elderly patients with APL based on early mortality risk to reduce the ED rate.",,"['Jin, Bo', 'Zhang, Yingmei', 'Hou, Wenyi', 'Cao, Fenglin', 'Lu, Ming', 'Yang, Huiyuan', 'Tian, Xuanyu', 'Wang, Yuan', 'Hou, Jinxiao', 'Fu, Jinyue', 'Li, Haitao', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Jin B', 'Zhang Y', 'Hou W', 'Cao F', 'Lu M', 'Yang H', 'Tian X', 'Wang Y', 'Hou J', 'Fu J', 'Li H', 'Zhou J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4316-9845'],"[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital of Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, 150030, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, No. 23, Youzheng Street, Nangang District, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China. jinzhou1111@126.com."", ""Department of Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, People's Republic of China. jinzhou1111@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['81270589/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'H2017032/Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20191104,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'Early death', 'Elderly patient']",2019/11/07 06:00,2020/02/19 06:00,['2019/11/06 06:00'],"['2019/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-019-03076-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-019-03076-x [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2020 Feb;146(2):485-492. doi: 10.1007/s00432-019-03076-x.

We expected it could ""actively"" bind tumor cells and kill them, reducing non-specific toxicity to normal cells. METHODS: BOR-SA prodrug was synthesized by reacting an ortho-dihydroxy group in SA with a boronic acid group in BOR. Two kinds of leukemia cells (RAW264.7 and HL60 cells), one solid sarcoma cell model (S180 cells) and their corresponding normal cells (monocytes (MO), neutrophil (NE) and fibroblast (L929)) were selected for the in vitro cell experiments (cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, cell cycle and apoptosis experiments). The S180 tumor-bearing Kunming mice model was established for anti-tumor pharmacodynamic experiments. RESULTS: In vitro cell assay results showed that uptake of BOR-SA by HL60 and S180 cells were increased compared with the control group. BOR-SA induced a lower IC50, higher ratio of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of tumor cells. In vivo anti-S180 tumor pharmacodynamics experiments showed that mice in the BOR-SA group had higher tumor inhibition rate, higher body weight and lower immune organ toxicity compared with the control group.

This gene encodes for a DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha, which is involved in epigenetic regulation, especially during embryonic development. Somatic variants in DNMT3A have been widely studied in different types of tumors, including acute myeloid leukemia, hematopoietic, and lymphoid cancers. Germline gain-of-function variants in this gene have been recently implicated in microcephalic dwarfism. Common clinical features of patients with TBRS include tall stature, macrocephaly, intellectual disability (ID), and a distinctive facial appearance. Differential diagnosis of TBRS comprises Sotos, Weaver, and Malan Syndromes. The majority of these disorders present other clinical features with a high clinical overlap, making necessary a molecular confirmation of the clinical diagnosis. We here describe seven new patients with variants in DNMT3A, four of them with neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and psychotic behavior. In addition, one of the patients has developed a brain tumor in adulthood. This patient has also cerebral atrophy, aggressive behavior, ID, and abnormal facial features. Clinical evaluation of this group of patients should include a complete neuropsychiatric assessment together with psychological support in order to detect and manage abnormal behaviors such as aggressiveness, impulsivity, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. TBRS should be suspected in patients with overgrowth, ID, tall stature, and macrocephaly, who also have some neuropsychiatric disorders without any genetic defects in the commonest overgrowth disorders.

Isolated del(5q) in acute myeloid leukemia is rare and acute myeloid leukemia cases with isolated del(5q) are not well characterized. Del(5q) has been shown to be a poor prognostic marker in acute myeloid leukemia based on multivariable analysis in large cohort studies, which contained mostly cases with del(5q) in the context of multiple chromosomal abnormalities. To further characterize acute myeloid leukemia with isolated del(5q), clinicopathologic characterization including mutation analysis was performed. During a 10-year period, we identified 12 cases of acute myeloid leukemia with isolated del(5q), 7 cases of acute myeloid leukemia with del(5q) plus one additional chromosome abnormality not involving chromosome 7, as well as two control groups composed of 124 cases of acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype including del(5q), and 40 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated del(5q). At diagnosis, cases of acute myeloid leukemia with isolated del(5q) had higher platelet counts (p = 0.044), hemoglobin (p = 0.011), and mean corpuscular volume (p = 0.017) compared with cases of acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype including del(5q). Acute myeloid leukemia with isolated del(5q) was less likely therapy-related (p = 0.037), more likely to have IDH1/IDH2 mutations (p = 0.009), and less likely to have TP53 mutations (p = 0.005) when compared to acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype including del(5q). Acute myeloid leukemia with isolated del(5q) also showed longer overall survival than acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype cases including del(5q) (p = 0.004). In summary, acute myeloid leukemia with isolated del(5q) appeared to show some distinct clinicopathologic and genomic features as compared to cases of acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype including del(5q).",,"['Rea, Bryan', 'Aggarwal, Nidhi', 'Yatsenko, Svetlana A', 'Bailey, Nathanael', 'Liu, Yen-Chun']","['Rea B', 'Aggarwal N', 'Yatsenko SA', 'Bailey N', 'Liu YC']",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

However, PTCY alone is insufficient and requires additional immunosuppressants such as calcineurin inhibitors. In the current study, we evaluated effects of a novel GVHD prophylaxis with PTCY in combination with short-term KRP203, a selective agonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 that regulates egress of lymphocytes from the secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) in mice. Short-term oral administration of KRP203 alone induced apoptosis of donor T cells in the SLOs and ameliorated GVHD. Administration of KRP203 significantly preserved graft-versus-leukemia effects compared to cyclosporin.

Although complete remission is observed in a large proportion of patients, relapse occurs in almost all the cases. The chemotherapeutic action of AraC derives from its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis by the replicative polymerases (Pols); the replicative Pols can insert AraCTP at the 3' terminus of the nascent DNA strand, but they are blocked at extending synthesis from AraC. By extending synthesis from the 3'-terminal AraC and by replicating through AraC that becomes incorporated into DNA, translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA Pols could reduce the effectiveness of AraC in chemotherapy. Here we identify the TLS Pols required for replicating through the AraC templating residue and determine their error-proneness. We provide evidence that TLS makes a consequential contribution to the replication of AraC-damaged DNA; that TLS through AraC is conducted by three different pathways dependent upon Poleta, Poliota, and Polnu, respectively; and that TLS by all these Pols incurs considerable mutagenesis. The prominent role of TLS in promoting proficient and mutagenic replication through AraC suggests that TLS inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia patients would increase the effectiveness of AraC chemotherapy; and by reducing mutation formation, TLS inhibition may dampen the emergence of drug-resistant tumors and thereby the high incidence of relapse in AraC-treated patients.",['(c) 2019 Yoon et al.'],"['Yoon, Jung-Hoon', 'Roy Choudhury, Jayati', 'Prakash, Louise', 'Prakash, Satya']","['Yoon JH', 'Roy Choudhury J', 'Prakash L', 'Prakash S']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, Texas 77555.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, Texas 77555.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, Texas 77555.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, Texas 77555 saprakas@utmb.edu.']",['eng'],['R01 CA200575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20191104,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects/genetics', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AraC', '*AraC mutagenesis', '*DNA polymerase', '*DNA repair', '*DNA replication', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*cytarabine', '*mutagenesis', '*mutagenesis mechanism', '*translesion synthesis']",2019/11/07 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2019/11/06 06:00'],"['2019/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)30820-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA119.011381 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2019 Dec 13;294(50):19048-19054. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.011381.

Our data identified environmental changes surrounding residue histidine 266 of POT1 that were dependent on telomere ssDNA substrate length. We further determined that the chronic lymphocytic leukemia-associated H266L substitution significantly reduced POT1-TPP1 binding to short ssDNA substrates; however, it only moderately impaired the heterodimer binding to long ssDNA substrates containing multiple protein binding sites. Additionally, we identified a telomerase inhibitory role when several native POT1-TPP1 proteins coat physiologically relevant lengths of telomere ssDNA.

In this study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to investigate the nature of unintegrated HIV-1 DNAs and discovered that core histones, the histone variant H3.3, and H1 linker histones are all deposited onto extrachromosomal HIV-1 DNA. We performed a time-course analysis and determined that the loading of core and linker histones occurred early after virus application. H3.3 and H1 linker histones were also found to be loaded onto unintegrated DNAs of the Moloney murine leukemia virus. The unintegrated retroviral DNAs are potently silenced, and we provide evidence that the suppression of extrachromosomal HIV-1 DNA is histone-related.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in a number of biological process including inflammation response. However, whether lncRNAs participate in TGEV-induced inflammation in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPECs) is largely unknown. RESULTS: In this study, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was used to analyze the profiles of lncRNAs in Mock and TGEV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cell-jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2) cell line. A total of 106 lncRNAs were differentially expressed. Many differentially expressed lncRNAs act as elements to competitively attach microRNAs (miRNAs) which target to messenger RNA (mRNAs) to mediate expression of genes that related to toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) pathways. Functional analysis of the binding proteins and the up/down-stream genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs revealed that lncRNAs were principally related to inflammatory response. Meanwhile, we found that the differentially expressed lncRNA TCONS_00058367 might lead to a reduction of phosphorylation of transcription factor p65 (p-p65) in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells by negatively regulating its antisense gene promyelocytic leukemia (PML).

This pilot study quantified the association between a 60-gene aspirin response signature (ARS) gene expression with preterm birth and preeclampsia risk among women with lupus taking aspirin. METHODS: The analysis included 48 RNA samples from 23 pregnancies in the Duke Autoimmunity Pregnancy Registry. RNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed for ARS genes. The primary outcome was poor pregnancy outcome (preeclampsia or preterm birth). Gene expression was modeled as a response to presence or absence of a poor pregnancy outcome using linear regression models, stratified by trimester. RESULTS: Of the 23 pregnancies, nine delivered preterm and four had preeclampsia. Expression of PBX1 and MMD was higher in the second trimester among patients who experienced a poor pregnancy outcome compared to those who did not. However, in a global test of all ARS genes, we identified no association between expression of ARS genes and poor pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study identified two candidate genes that are reflective of the platelet function response to aspirin.

An intimate balance between self-renewal, differentiation, and quiescence is required to maintain hematopoiesis and disruption of this balance can result in malignant transformation. FBXO9, the substrate recognition component from the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase family, is downregulated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to healthy bone marrow, and this downregulation is particularly evident in patients with inv(16) AML. To study FBXO9 in malignant hematopoiesis, we generated a conditional knockout mouse model using a novel CRISPR/Cas9 strategy. Deletion of Fbxo9 in the murine hematopoietic system showed no adverse effects on stem and progenitor cell function but in AML lead to markedly accelerated and aggressive leukemia development in mice with inv(16). Not only did Fbxo9 play a role in leukemia initiation but it also functioned to maintain AML activity and promote disease progression. Quantitative mass spectrometry from primary tumors reveals tumors lacking Fbxo9 highly express proteins associated with metastasis and invasion as well as components of the ubiquitin proteasome system. We confirmed that the loss of FBXO9 leads to increased proteasome activity and tumors cells were more sensitive to in vitro proteasome inhibition with bortezomib, suggesting that FBXO9 expression may predict patients' response to bortezomib.",,"['Hynes-Smith, R Willow', 'Swenson, Samantha A', 'Vahle, Heather', 'Wittorf, Karli J', 'Caplan, Mika', 'Amador, Catalina', 'Hyde, R Katherine', 'Buckley, Shannon M']","['Hynes-Smith RW', 'Swenson SA', 'Vahle H', 'Wittorf KJ', 'Caplan M', 'Amador C', 'Hyde RK', 'Buckley SM']",,"['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.

Avian immunosuppressive diseases refer to those avian diseases caused by pathogens that target and damage the immune organs or cells of the host, increasing susceptibility to other microbial infections and the risk of failure in subsequent vaccination against other diseases. As such, once a disease with an immunosuppressive feature occurs in flocks, it would be difficult for the stakeholders to have an optimal economic income. Infectious bursal disease (IBD), avian leukemia (AL), Marek's disease (MD), chicken infectious anemia (CIA), reticuloendotheliosis (RE) and avian reovirus infection are on the top list of commonly-seen avian diseases with a feature of immunosuppression, posing an unmeasurable threat to the poultry industry across the globe. Understanding the pathogenesis of avian immunosuppressive disease is the basis for disease prevention and control. miRNAs have been shown to be involved in host response to pathogenic infections in chickens, including regulation of immunity, tumorigenesis, cell proliferation and viral replication.

However, several lines of evidence suggest that dasatinib can induce bleeding which may be due to impaired collagen-induced platelet adhesion, aggregation, and secretion. Sarcoma family kinases (SFK) play central role in the GPVI-induced signaling pathway. We aimed to investigate whether and how dasatinib can modulate SFK-mediated platelet procoagulant activity in a purified system and in dasatinib/nilotinib treated CML patients. In platelet rich plasmas of healthy volunteers, dasatinib dose-dependently reduced convulxin-induced phosphatidylserine exposure and attenuated thrombin formation. Similarly to these changes, integrin activation and clot retraction were also significantly inhibited by 100 nM dasatinib. Platelets isolated from dasatinib treated patients showed a significantly lower phosphatidylserine expression upon convulxin activation compared to premedication levels.

Methods: From 2007 to 2010, 145 esophageal cancer patients and 169 cardiaccancer patientsfrom the outpatient department of the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical Universitywereselected in a case group, and 195 non-tumor patients were selected in a control group during the same period. A questionnaire survey was used to collect information of research subjects. Pathological tissues were collected to extract genomic DNA and detect the genotype of bcl-2 gene -938. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between the bcl-2 gene locus 938 CC genotype and the EC and GCA. The interaction between age, gender, smoking, drinking, upper gastrointestinal family history and the bcl-2 gene locus 938 CC genotype was analyzed by likelihood ratio test. Results: The age of the esophageal and cardiac cancer groups was (56.3+/-8.3) and (57.1+/-8.4) years old, and that of the control group was (54.7+/-7.1) years old. The proportion of the bcl-2 gene locus 938 CC genotype in the esophageal group [48.3% (70/145)] and the cardiac cancer group [48.5% (82/169)] was higher than that in the control group [33.8% (66/195)] (both P values<0.05).Compared with the AA genotype, the risk of esophageal cancer and cardiac cancerin people with the CC genotype was 2.386 (1.20-4.76) and 2.564 (1.27-5.18) respectively. In the population with CC genotype, compared with the positive family history, drinking, and male, the negative family history, non-drinking, and female had a higher risk of esophageal cancer; compared with the non-smoking, negative family history, non-drinking and male, the smoking, positive family history, drinking, and female had a higher risk of cardiac cancer (all the P interaction values were <0.05).

RESULTS: A total of 18 patients were included, 12 male and 6 female. The average age at diagnosis was 8.7 years (range 4 months-17 years), with 56% overall mortality and 44% survival after 60 months. The most common cause of immunosuppression was acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The only factor found affecting mortality was a time between diagnosis and surgery greater than 7 days. CONCLUSION: PIFR is an aggressive entity with high mortality. An appropriate diagnosis with an opportune surgical debridement followed by systemic antifungal therapy is essential to improve survival.

Promethazine, an antihistaminic phenothiazine derivative, has been used to prevent chemotherapy-induced emesis, although there is no report about its antitumor potential. Thus, we evaluated the promethazine cytotoxicity against several leukemia cells and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Promethazine exhibited potent and selective cytotoxicity against all leukemia cell types in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. Philadelphia positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562cells were the most sensitive cell line. The cytotoxicity of promethazine in these cells was triggered by the activation of AMPK and inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The subsequent downstream effects were NOXA increase, MCL-1 decrease, and Beclin-1 activation, resulting in autophagy-associated apoptosis. These data highlight targeting autophagy may represent an interesting strategy in CML therapy, and also the antitumor potential of promethazine by acting in AMPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.

We investigated underlying chromosomal and molecular alterations to assess potential molecular markers of prognosis and outcome in this rare pediatric disease. We conducted a retrospective review of clinicopathologic and cytogenetic data from 33 pediatric patients with MS (ages 1 month-18 years) at our institution over a 32 year period (1984-2016). Tissue-based cancer microarray and targeted next-generation sequencing analysis were performed on six cases. The median age at diagnosis was 2.8 years with a male-to-female ratio of 2.6:1. MS is commonly presented with concomitant marrow involvement (n = 12, 36.4%) or as a recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 14, 42.4%). The skin (n = 18, 54.5%) and soft tissue (n = 9, 27.3%) were the most common sites of involvement. Twenty-one of 25 samples (84.0%) harbored chromosomal aberrations; KMT2A alterations (n = 10, 40.0%) or complex cytogenetics (n = 7, 28.0%) were most frequent. Mutations in RAS, tyrosine kinase, cell signaling, and chromatin remodeling genes were detected. When compared to pediatric patients with AML without extramedullary involvement (EMI), inferior overall survival (OS) was observed (18.8 months vs. 89.3 months, p = .008). Pediatric patients with MS with non-favorable cytogenetics [abnormalities other than t(8;21), inv(16)/t(16;16), or t(15;17)] had a significantly lower OS compared to patients with AML with non-favorable cytogenetics and no extramedullary involvement (8.0 months vs. 28.1 months, p < .001). Pediatric MS is a rare disease with diverse clinical presentations. Non-favorable cytogenetics may be a poor prognostic marker for pediatric patients with MS and molecular diagnostics can assist with risk stratification and identify potentially actionable targets.",,"['Zhou, Ting', 'Bloomquist, M Suzanne', 'Ferguson, Lizmery Suarez', 'Reuther, Jacquelyn', 'Marcogliese, Andrea N', 'Elghetany, M Tarek', 'Roy, Angshumoy', 'Rao, Pulivarthi H', 'Lopez-Terrada, Dolores H', 'Redell, Michele S', 'Punia, Jyotinder N', 'Curry, Choladda V', 'Fisher, Kevin E']","['Zhou T', 'Bloomquist MS', 'Ferguson LS', 'Reuther J', 'Marcogliese AN', 'Elghetany MT', 'Roy A', 'Rao PH', 'Lopez-Terrada DH', 'Redell MS', 'Punia JN', 'Curry CV', 'Fisher KE']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8950-9123', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1458-9675', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7248-8576', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6584-420X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2515-3703', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4783-6991', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6179-0937']","['Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191104,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Sarcoma, Myeloid']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cytogenetics', 'molecular', 'myeloid sarcoma', 'pediatric', 'risk stratification']",2019/11/05 06:00,2020/09/18 06:00,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2019.1683107 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Feb;37(1):76-89. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2019.1683107.

Although developed in the 1950s, thiopurines remained relevant in the anti-tumour necrosis factor biologic era, finding widespread use as a co-immunomodulator. Step changes in the management of patients treated with thiopurines have reduced the incidence of severe, sometimes life-threatening toxicity. Testing for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency directs a safe initial dose for therapy. The introduction of red cell thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) monitoring provides a basis for dose adjustment and the identification of patients with high levels of red cell methylmercaptopurine (MMP) and an increase in the MMP:TGN ratio. These patients are at risk for hepatotoxicity and where TGN levels are sub-therapeutic, non-response to therapy. Switching thiopurine hypermethylators to low-dose thiopurine and allopurinol combination therapy resolves hepatoxicity and increases sub-therapeutic TGN levels to regain clinical response. NUDT15 variants are a common cause of severe myelotoxicity in Asian populations where the frequency of TPMT deficiency is low. There is increasing evidence that testing for NUDT15 and TPMT deficiency in all populations prior to the start of thiopurine therapy is clinically useful and should be the first step in personalising thiopurine therapy.",,"['Marinaki, Anthony M', 'Arenas-Hernandez, Monica']","['Marinaki AM', 'Arenas-Hernandez M']",,"[""Purine Research Laboratory, Viapath, St Thomas' Hospital, London, UK."", ""Purine Research Laboratory, Viapath, St Thomas' Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191112,England,Xenobiotica,Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,1306665,"['0 (Purines)', '6V404DV25O (6-methylthiopurine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)', 'Thiopurine S methyltranferase deficiency']",IM,"['Azathioprine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*genetics', 'Erythrocytes', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/*genetics', 'Purines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['NUDT15', 'TPMT', 'Thiopurine', 'azathioprine', 'mercaptopurine', 'thioguanine nucleotide', 'thiopurine methyltransferase']",2019/11/05 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00498254.2019.1688424 [doi]'],ppublish,Xenobiotica. 2020 Jan;50(1):101-109. doi: 10.1080/00498254.2019.1688424.

METHODS: Chemical fingerprints of 10 batches SHLI samples were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and further investigated by similarity analysis. Combined with optical microscopy, both anaphylactoid experiments and confirmatory assay were displayed in Rat basophil leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) to obtain the histamine release inducing by SHLI. The content of histamine was tested by Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay method. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) method and HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn technology were conducted to analyze constituents in SHLI involving anaphylactoid reaction. RESULTS: The results of spectrum and effect relationships showed that the eight constituents were positively correlated with anaphylactoid reaction.

We also show that SHP099 normalizes the gene expression program associated with increased cell proliferation and self-renewal in leukemic cells by downregulating the Myc signature.

The study objective was to prospectively collect a cohort of well-phenotyped patients receiving vincristine in order to accurately classify and grade their neurotoxicity. All children in British Columbia with leukemia or lymphoma requiring vincristine between 2013 and 2016 were approached for consent. Those recruited were assessed by occupational and physiotherapists at baseline, mid and endpoint of their treatment. Assessments included the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency - 2nd ed. (BOT-2), strength, ""Timed up and go"" test and vibration sensibility. Seventy-two patients consented (age: 2.0-18.7 years). The majority were below average for age on one or more BOT-2 domains at midpoint (N = 32/45, 71%), which decreased by the endpoint (N = 19/41, 46%, p = .049). Six patients showed severe VIPN throughout treatment (N = 6/53, 11%), defined as a BOT-2 score well below average. Muscle strength for wrist extension/flexion, anterior tibialis and peronei decreased significantly between baseline (Median = 5) and midpoint (Median = 4), with no significant change noted by endpoint. Most patients had normal vibration sensibility in lower (N = 30/60, 50%) and upper limbs (N = 26/38, 68%). In conclusion, with no differences between time points. VIPN is highly prevalent among patients with pediatric cancer, causing significant morbidity and functional deficits.

However, the optimal time-point (TP) of MRD assessment and its impact on outcome remains unclear. We analyzed 215 patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia negative B-cell ALL who received intensive chemotherapy, and had available MRD assessment by multicolor flow cytometry at two separate TPs. The median time to first TP (1TP) and second TP (2TP) were 24 and 110 days, respectively. At 1TP, 148 patients (68%) were MRD negative and 67 (32%) were positive. Of the 148 patients with negative MRD at 1TP, 147 (99%) maintained it through 2TP. Patients who were MRD negative at both TPs, early MRD responders, had the 3-year event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) rates of 65% and 76%, respectively. Patients with improved MRD status from positive to negative, late MRD responders, had lower 3-year EFS and OS rates, 42% and 58%, respectively (P = .001). Multivariate analysis showed that KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement and MRD positivity at 1TP were the only factors correlated with worse OS.

Many of these findings, however, have not yet translated into new prognostic markers or rationales for treatments. We now know that AML is a highly heterogeneous disease characterized by a very low mutational burden. Interestingly, the few mutations identified mainly reside in epigenetic regulators, which shape and define leukemic cell identity. In the light of these discoveries and given the increasing number of drugs targeting epigenetic regulators in clinical development and testing, great interest is emerging for the use of small molecules targeting leukemia epigenome. Together with their effects on leukemia cell-intrinsic properties, such as proliferation and survival, epigenetic drugs may affect the way leukemic cells communicate with the surrounding components of the tumor and immune microenvironment. Here, we review current knowledge on alterations in the AML epigenetic landscape and discuss the promises of epigenetic therapies for AML treatment. Finally, we summarize emerging molecular studies elucidating how epigenetic rewiring in cancer cells may as well exert immune-modulatory functions, boost the immune system, and potentially contribute to better patient outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Gambacorta, Gnani, Vago and Di Micco.']","['Gambacorta, Valentina', 'Gnani, Daniela', 'Vago, Luca', 'Di Micco, Raffaella']","['Gambacorta V', 'Gnani D', 'Vago L', 'Di Micco R']",,"['Unit of Senescence in Stem Cell Aging, Differentiation and Cancer, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunogenetics, Leukemia Genomics and Immunobiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Milano-Bicocca University, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Senescence in Stem Cell Aging, Differentiation and Cancer, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Immunogenetics, Leukemia Genomics and Immunobiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Senescence in Stem Cell Aging, Differentiation and Cancer, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191011,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chromatin', 'epigenetics', 'immune activation', 'therapy']",2019/11/05 06:00,2019/11/05 06:01,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2019.00207 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2019 Oct 11;7:207. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2019.00207. eCollection 2019.,PMC6797914,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, MFC-MRD has the potential to refine the current strategies of pedAML risk stratification, traditionally based on the cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations at diagnosis. Consequently, it may guide the modulation of therapy intensity and clinical decision making. However, the use of non-standardized protocols, including different staining panels, analysis, and gating strategies, may hamper a broad implementation of MFC-MRD monitoring in clinical routine. Besides, the thresholds of MRD positivity still need to be validated in large, prospective and multi-center clinical studies, as well as optimal time points of MRD assessment during therapy, to better discriminate patients with different prognosis. In the present review, we summarize the most relevant findings on MFC-MRD testing in pedAML. We examine the clinical significance of MFC-MRD and the recent advances in its standardization, including innovative approaches with an automated analysis of MFC-MRD data. We also touch upon other technologies for MRD assessment in AML, such as quantitative genomic breakpoint PCR, current challenges and future strategies to enable full incorporation of MFC-MRD into clinical practice.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Buldini, Maurer-Granofszky, Varotto and Dworzak.']","['Buldini, Barbara', 'Maurer-Granofszky, Margarita', 'Varotto, Elena', 'Dworzak, Michael N']","['Buldini B', 'Maurer-Granofszky M', 'Varotto E', 'Dworzak MN']",,"[""Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Woman's and Child's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", ""Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Woman's and Child's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191011,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'childhood', 'minimal residual disease', 'multiparametric flow cytometry', 'risk stratification']",2019/11/05 06:00,2019/11/05 06:01,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2019.00412 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2019 Oct 11;7:412. doi: 10.3389/fped.2019.00412. eCollection 2019.,PMC6798174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hereby, we focus on lesions that preferentially or exclusively occur in pediatric patients and molecular markers of aggressive disease with often poor outcome including fusion oncogenes that involve epigenetic regulators like KMT2A, NUP98, or CBFA2T3, respectively. Functional studies were able to demonstrate cooperation with signaling mutations leading to constitutive activation of FLT3 or the RAS signal transduction pathways. We discuss the issues faced to faithfully model pediatric acute leukemia in mice. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that the disease phenotype is dependent on the appropriate expression and activity of the driver fusion oncogenes during a particular window of opportunity during fetal development. We also highlight biochemical studies that deciphered some molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation by KMT2A, NUP98, and CBFA2T3 fusions, which, in some instances, allowed the development of small molecules with potent anti-leukemic activities in preclinical models (e.g., inhibitors of the KMT2A-MENIN interaction). Finally, we discuss other potential therapeutic strategies that not only target driver fusion-controlled signals but also interfere with the transformed cell state either by exploiting the primed apoptosis or vulnerable metabolic states or by increasing tumor cell recognition and elimination by the immune system.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Mercher and Schwaller.'],"['Mercher, Thomas', 'Schwaller, Juerg']","['Mercher T', 'Schwaller J']",,"['INSERM U1170, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Gustave Roussy Institute, Universite Paris Diderot, Universite Paris-Sud, Villejuif, France.', ""Department of Biomedicine, University Children's Hospital Beider Basel (UKBB), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191015,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['UKBB', 'fusion oncogene', 'genomic landscape', 'mouse models', 'pediatric AML', 'therapeutic targeting']",2019/11/05 06:00,2019/11/05 06:01,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2019.00401 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2019 Oct 15;7:401. doi: 10.3389/fped.2019.00401. eCollection 2019.,PMC6803505,,,['Front Pediatr. 2019 Nov 13;7:466.

Here, genome-wide screening was carried out for identifying miRNA molecules capable of predicting treatment outcome in AML patients based on the TCGA dataset. We identified miR-340 as a prognostic factor for selecting treatment between chemotherapy and allogeneic transplantation (allo-HSCT). In multivariable analyses, low miR-340 expression independently predicted reduced OS (HR = 2.07, P = 0.004) and EFS (HR = 1.909, P = 0.01) independent of other well-known prognostic factors. Meanwhile, allo-HSCT overcome deleterious outcomes related to low miR-340. Cases administered allo-HSCT showed markedly improved OS (HR = 0.316, P < 0.0001) and EFS (HR = 0.391, P = 0.002) in comparison with those receiving chemotherapy in the low miR-340 group. Gene expression assessment revealed that elevated miR-340 amounts were negatively correlated with HOXA/HOXB cluster levels, as well as the amounts of the HOX cofactor MEIS1. Strikingly, in silico analysis pointing to HOXA10, HOXB2, and MEIS1 as miR-340 targets. The miR-340 expression may help identify cases requiring strategies for selecting the optimal therapeutic option between chemotherapy and allo-HCST. AML cases showing low miR-340 levels should be strongly considered for early allo-HSCT treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Niu, Zhang, Wang, Shao, Feng, Shen, Liu, Zhao, Zhu, Xu, Yao', 'and Xu.']","['Niu, Mingshan', 'Zhang, Ninghan', 'Wang, Rong', 'Shao, Tingting', 'Feng, Yuan', 'Shen, Yangling', 'Liu, Xuejiao', 'Zhao, Kai', 'Zhu, Shengyun', 'Xu, Linyan', 'Yao, Yao', 'Xu, Kailin']","['Niu M', 'Zhang N', 'Wang R', 'Shao T', 'Feng Y', 'Shen Y', 'Liu X', 'Zhao K', 'Zhu S', 'Xu L', 'Yao Y', 'Xu K']",,"['Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Nervous System Diseases, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191011,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allo-HCST', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical outcome', 'miR-340']",2019/11/05 06:00,2019/11/05 06:01,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01058 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Oct 11;9:1058. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01058. eCollection 2019.,PMC6798954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML are characterized by the presence of 20% blasts or more in the bone marrow, or defining cytogenetic abnormalities. Laboratory diagnoses of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) depend on morphological changes based on dysplasia in peripheral blood and bone marrow, including peripheral blood smears, bone marrow aspirate smears, and bone marrow biopsies. As leukemic cells are not functional, the patient develops anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, leading to fatigue, recurrent infections, and hemorrhage. The genetic background and associated mutations in AML blasts determine the clinical course of the disease. Over the last decade, non-coding RNAs transcripts that do not codify for proteins but play a role in regulation of functions have been shown to have multiple applications in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic approach of various types of cancers, including myeloid malignancies. After a comprehensive review of current literature, we found reports of multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can differentiate between AML types and how their exogenous modulation can dramatically change the behavior of AML cells. These lncRNAs include: H19, LINC00877, RP11-84C10, CRINDE, RP11848P1.3, ZNF667-AS1, AC111000.4-202, SFMBT2, LINC02082-201, MEG3, AC009495.2, PVT1, HOTTIP, SNHG5, and CCAT1. In addition, by performing an analysis on available AML data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found 10 lncRNAs with significantly differential expression between patients in favorable, intermediate/normal, or poor cytogenetic risk categories. These are: DANCR, PRDM16-DT, SNHG6, OIP5-AS1, SNHG16, JPX, FTX, KCNQ1OT1, TP73-AS1, and GAS5. The identification of a molecular signature based on lncRNAs has the potential for have deep clinical significance, as it could potentially help better define the evolution from low-grade MDS to high-grade MDS to AML, changing the course of therapy. This would allow clinicians to provide a more personalized, patient-tailored therapeutic approach, moving from transfusion-based therapy, as is the case for low-grade MDS, to the introduction of azacytidine-based chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which is the current treatment for high-grade MDS.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Zimta, Tomuleasa, Sahnoune, Calin and Berindan-Neagoe.']","['Zimta, Alina-Andreea', 'Tomuleasa, Ciprian', 'Sahnoune, Iman', 'Calin, George A', 'Berindan-Neagoe, Ioana']","['Zimta AA', 'Tomuleasa C', 'Sahnoune I', 'Calin GA', 'Berindan-Neagoe I']",,"['MedFuture - Research Center for Advanced Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Center for RNA Interference and Non-Coding RNAs, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'MedFuture - Research Center for Advanced Medicine, Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Functional Genomics and Experimental Pathology, Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191018,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['clinical impact', 'diagnostic tool', 'myeloid malignancies', 'non-coding RNAs', 'prognostic tools']",2019/11/05 06:00,2019/11/05 06:01,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01048 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Oct 18;9:1048. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01048. eCollection 2019.,PMC6813191,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptor tyrosine kinases KIT and TrkA functions in AML and NB, respectively, are well-characterized. Though expression of these receptors is found in both tumors, little is known about KIT function in NB and TrkA in AML. By combining gene enrichment analysis with multidimensional scaling we showed that pediatric AMLs with t(8;21) or inv16 and high KIT expression levels stand out from other AML subtypes as they share prominent transcriptomic features exclusively with KIT-overexpressing NBs. We showed that AML cell lines had a predominant expression of an alternative TrkAIII isoform, which reportedly has oncogenic features, while NB cell lines had dominating TrkAI-II isoforms. NB cells, on the other hand, had an abnormal ratio of KIT isoforms as opposed to AML cells. Both SCF and NGF exerted protective action against doxorubicin and cytarabine for t(8;21) AML and NB cells. We identified several gene sets both unique and common for pediatric AML and NB, and this expression is associated with KIT or TrkA levels. NMU, DUSP4, RET, SUSD5, NOS1, and GABRA5 genes are differentially expressed in NBs with high KIT expression and are associated with poor survival in NB. We identified HOXA10, BAG3, and MARCKS genes that are connected with TrkA expression and are marker genes of poor outcome in AML. We also report that SLC18A2, PLXNC1, and MRPL33 gene expression is associated with TrkA or KIT expression levels in both AML and NB, and these genes have a prognostic value for both cancers. Thus, we have provided a comprehensive characterization of TrkA and KIT expression along with the oncogenic signatures of these genes across two pediatric tumors.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Lebedev, Vagapova, Popenko, Leonova, Spirin and Prassolov.']","['Lebedev, Timofey D', 'Vagapova, Elmira R', 'Popenko, Vladimir I', 'Leonova, Olga G', 'Spirin, Pavel V', 'Prassolov, Vladimir S']","['Lebedev TD', 'Vagapova ER', 'Popenko VI', 'Leonova OG', 'Spirin PV', 'Prassolov VS']",,"['Department of Cancer Cell Biology, Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, RAS, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Cancer Cell Biology, Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, RAS, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Cancer Cell Biology, Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, RAS, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Cancer Cell Biology, Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, RAS, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Cancer Cell Biology, Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, RAS, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Cancer Cell Biology, Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, RAS, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191018,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['KIT', 'NGF (nerve growth factor)', 'SCF (stem cell factor)', 'TrkA (tropomyosin receptor kinase)', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'alternative splicing', 'neuroblastoma', 'oncogenic signature']",2019/11/05 06:00,2019/11/05 06:01,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01046 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Oct 18;9:1046. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01046. eCollection 2019.,PMC6813278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its widespread use is hampered by graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), which has high morbidity and mortality in both acute and chronic subtypes. Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) occurs most frequently in skin and often is characterized by pathogenic fibrosis. Mast cells (MCs) are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of other fibrotic diseases. In a murine model of cGVHD after allo-HSCT, C57BL/6J recipients of allogeneic LP/J donor cells develop sclerodermatous dermal cGVHD which is significantly decreased in mast cell-deficient B6.Cg-Kit(W-sh/)HNihrJaeBsmGlliJ recipients. The presence of MCs is associated with fibrosis, chemokine production, and recruitment of GVHD effector cells to the skin. Chemokine production by MCs is blocked by drugs used to treat cGVHD. The importance of MCs in skin cGVHD is mirrored by increased MCs in the skin of patients with dermal cGVHD. We show for the first time a role for MCs in skin cGVHD that may be targetable for preventive and therapeutic intervention in this disease.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Strattan, Palaniyandi, Kumari, Du, Hakim, Huang, Kesler,', 'Jennings, Sturgill and Hildebrandt.']","['Strattan, Ethan', 'Palaniyandi, Senthilnathan', 'Kumari, Reena', 'Du, Jing', 'Hakim, Natalya', 'Huang, Timothy', 'Kesler, Melissa V', 'Jennings, C Darrell', 'Sturgill, Jamie L', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard C']","['Strattan E', 'Palaniyandi S', 'Kumari R', 'Du J', 'Hakim N', 'Huang T', 'Kesler MV', 'Jennings CD', 'Sturgill JL', 'Hildebrandt GC']",,"['Division of Hematology and Blood & Marrow Transplant, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood & Marrow Transplant, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood & Marrow Transplant, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood & Marrow Transplant, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood & Marrow Transplant, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States.']",['eng'],"['P20 GM103527/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG028383/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA177558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 GM127211/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191018,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",['NOTNLM'],"['*GVHD', '*fibrosis', '*immunity', '*mast cells', '*skin', '*transplant']",2019/11/05 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02470 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Oct 18;10:2470. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02470. eCollection 2019.,PMC6813249,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we demonstrate that the mithralog EC-7072 displays high ex vivo cytotoxic activity against leukemia cells from CLL patients independently from high-risk prognostic markers and IGHV mutational status. EC-7072 was significantly less toxic against T cells and NK cells and did not alter the production of the immune effector molecules IFN-gamma and perforin. EC-7072 directly triggered caspase-3-dependent CLL cell apoptosis, which was not abrogated by microenvironment-derived factors that sustain leukemia cell survival. RNA-sequencing analyses revealed a dramatic EC-7072-driven reprograming of the transcriptome of CLL cells, including a wide downregulation of multiple components and targets of the BCR signaling pathway. Accordingly, we found decreased levels of phosphorylated signaling nodes downstream of the BCR. Crosslinking-mediated BCR activation antagonized CLL cell death triggered by EC-7072, increased the phosphorylation levels of the abovementioned signaling nodes and upregulated BCL2 expression, suggesting that the mithralog disrupts CLL cell viability by targeting the BCR signaling axis at multiple levels. EC-7072 exerted similar or higher antileukemic activity than that of several available CLL therapies and displayed additive or synergistic interaction with these drugs in killing CLL cells. Overall, our findings provide rationale for future investigation to test whether EC-7072 may be a potential therapeutic option for patients with CLL and other B-cell malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Lorenzo-Herrero, Sordo-Bahamonde, Bretones, Payer,', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Gonzalez-Garcia, Perez-Escuredo, Villa-Alvarez, Nunez, Moris,', 'Gonzalez and Lopez-Soto.']","['Lorenzo-Herrero, Seila', 'Sordo-Bahamonde, Christian', 'Bretones, Gabriel', 'Payer, Angel R', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Ana P', 'Gonzalez-Garcia, Esther', 'Perez-Escuredo, Jhudit', 'Villa-Alvarez, Monica', 'Nunez, Luz-Elena', 'Moris, Francisco', 'Gonzalez, Segundo', 'Lopez-Soto, Alejandro']","['Lorenzo-Herrero S', 'Sordo-Bahamonde C', 'Bretones G', 'Payer AR', 'Gonzalez-Rodriguez AP', 'Gonzalez-Garcia E', 'Perez-Escuredo J', 'Villa-Alvarez M', 'Nunez LE', 'Moris F', 'Gonzalez S', 'Lopez-Soto A']",,"['Departamento de Biologia Funcional, Inmunologia, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia Funcional, Inmunologia, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'EntreChem S.L., Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de Cabuenes, Gijon, Spain.', 'EntreChem S.L., Oviedo, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia Funcional, Inmunologia, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'EntreChem S.L., Oviedo, Spain.', 'EntreChem S.L., Oviedo, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia Funcional, Inmunologia, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Departamento de Biologia Funcional, Inmunologia, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto Universitario de Oncologia del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191018,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (mithramycin SK)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'NIJ123W41V (Plicamycin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Plicamycin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR', '*CLL', '*EC-7072', '*apoptosis', '*mithralog']",2019/11/05 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02455 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Oct 18;10:2455. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02455. eCollection 2019.,PMC6813538,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At this time, it became clear that natural killer (NK) cells interact with HLA class I molecules which inhibit them. Inhibitory receptors were postulated, and Alessandro Moretta was the first to generate monoclonal anti-human NK cell antibodies that bound to such molecules, which he characterized in detail (Killer Immunoglobulin-like receptors-KIR). Natural killer cells from healthy donors preferentially kill targets with absent HLA class I molecules (""missing self"" concept), whereas we observed that the NK cells from the TAP-deficient patients were hypo-responsive and did not lyse the HLA class I-negative leukemia cell line K562. Moreover, they were not very active in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays. To address the question if such NK cells would express KIR or not, my thesis supervisor requested the anti-KIR antibodies from Alessandro Moretta, who was kind enough to provide us generously with aliquots. It turned out that the NK cells from the TAP-deficient individuals expressed most of these inhibitory receptors normally. We then had the privilege to receive almost every new antibody generated in the Moretta lab and to complete the phenotypic studies of the NK cells from our patients.

HCMV promotes an adaptive development of NK cells bearing the CD94/NKG2C receptor with a characteristic phenotypic and functional profile. NK cells are proposed to play an immunoregulatory role in MS, and expansion of the NKG2C(+) subset was recently associated with reduced disability progression. To further explore this issue, additional adaptive NK cell markers, i.e., downregulation of FcepsilonRIgamma chain (FcRgamma) and PLZF transcription factor, as well as antibody-dependent NK cell activation were assessed in controls and MS patients considering HCMV serology and clinical features. In line with previous reports, increased proportions of NKG2C(+), FcRgamma(-), and PLZF(-) CD56(dim) NK cells were found in HCMV(+) cases. However, PLZF(-) NK cells were detected uncoupled from other adaptive markers within the CD56(bright) subset from HCMV(+) cases and among CD56(dim) NK cells from HCMV(-) MS patients, suggesting an additional effect of HCMV-independent factors in PLZF downregulation. Interferon-beta therapy was associated with lower proportions of FcRgamma(-) CD56(dim) NK cells in HCMV(+) and increased PLZF(-) CD56(bright) NK cells in HCMV(-) patients, pointing out to an influence of the cytokine on the expression of adaptive NK cell-associated markers. In addition, proportions of NKG2C(+) and FcRgamma(-) NK cells differed in progressive MS patients as compared to controls and other clinical forms. Remarkably, an adaptive NK cell phenotype did not directly correlate with enhanced antibody-triggered degranulation and TNFalpha production in MS in contrast to controls. Altogether, our results provide novel insights into the putative influence of HCMV and adaptive NK cells in MS.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Moreira, Alari-Pahissa, Munteis, Vera, Zabalza, Llop,', 'Villarrubia, Costa-Garcia, Alvarez-Lafuente, Villar, Lopez-Botet and', 'Martinez-Rodriguez.']","['Moreira, Antia', 'Alari-Pahissa, Elisenda', 'Munteis, Elvira', 'Vera, Andrea', 'Zabalza, Ana', 'Llop, Mireia', 'Villarrubia, Noelia', 'Costa-Garcia, Marcel', 'Alvarez-Lafuente, Roberto', 'Villar, Luisa Maria', 'Lopez-Botet, Miguel', 'Martinez-Rodriguez, Jose E']","['Moreira A', 'Alari-Pahissa E', 'Munteis E', 'Vera A', 'Zabalza A', 'Llop M', 'Villarrubia N', 'Costa-Garcia M', 'Alvarez-Lafuente R', 'Villar LM', 'Lopez-Botet M', 'Martinez-Rodriguez JE']",,"['Neurology Department, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Neurology Department, Althaia, Xarxa Assistencial i Universitaria de Manresa, Manresa, Spain.', 'Departament de Medicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Neurology Department, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Neurology Department, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Neurology Department, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Neurology Department, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'University Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Neurology Service, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria del Hospital Clinico de San Carlos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'University Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Neurology Department, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191015,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (FCER1G, human)', '0 (KLRC2 protein, human)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*immunology/pathology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/immunology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Fc/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*FcepsilonRIgamma', '*NKG2C', '*PLZF', '*cytomegalovirus', '*multiple sclerosis', '*natural killer cells']",2019/11/05 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02403 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Oct 15;10:2403. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02403. eCollection 2019.,PMC6803486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice, two main types of MCs have been described: connective tissue MCs (CTMCs) and mucosal MCs (MMCs). However, little is known about the biological functions of MMCs, which is due to the lack of suitable models to investigate MMCs in vivo. Here, we aimed to generate a mouse model selectively deficient in MMCs. It has been previously described that Cre expressed under the control of the baboon alpha-chymase promotor is predominantly localized in MMCs. Therefore, we mated alpha-chymase-Cre transgenic mice with mice bearing a floxed allele of the myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1). Mcl-1 encodes for an intracellular antiapoptotic factor in MCs; hence, a selective reduction in MMCs was expected. Our results show that this new mouse model contains markedly reduced numbers of MMCs in mucosal tissues, whereas numbers of CTMCs are normal. Thus, Chm-Cre; Mcl-1(fl/fl) mice are a useful tool for the investigation of the pathophysiological functions of MMCs in vivo.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Luo, Meyer, Jiao, Scheffel, Zimmermann, Metz, Zenclussen,', 'Maurer and Siebenhaar.']","['Luo, Ying', 'Meyer, Nicole', 'Jiao, Qingqing', 'Scheffel, Jorg', 'Zimmermann, Carolin', 'Metz, Martin', 'Zenclussen, Ana', 'Maurer, Marcus', 'Siebenhaar, Frank']","['Luo Y', 'Meyer N', 'Jiao Q', 'Scheffel J', 'Zimmermann C', 'Metz M', 'Zenclussen A', 'Maurer M', 'Siebenhaar F']",,"['Dermatological Allrgology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt - Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Experimental Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical Faculty, Otto-Von-Guericke-University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Dermatological Allrgology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt - Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Dermatological Allrgology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt - Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Dermatological Allrgology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt - Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Dermatological Allrgology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt - Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Experimental Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical Faculty, Otto-Von-Guericke-University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Dermatological Allrgology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt - Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Dermatological Allrgology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt - Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191015,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chymases/*deficiency/immunology', 'Integrases/genetics/immunology', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Models, Immunological', 'Mucous Membrane/immunology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cre', '*Mcl-1', '*chymase', '*connective tissue', '*mast cells', '*mouse model', '*mucosa']",2019/11/05 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02399 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Oct 15;10:2399. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02399. eCollection 2019.,PMC6803453,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the physiological inflammatory response resolves in time, severe acute inflammation usually sustains immune tolerance and leads to high mortality, yet the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Here, using the leukemia-derived THP-1 human monocytes, healthy and septic human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), we report that endotoxin dose-dependent switch of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis pathways sustain immune tolerant status. Low dose endotoxin triggered nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-dependent NAD salvage activity to adapt pro-inflammation. In contrast, high dose endotoxin drove a shift of NAD synthesis pathway from early NAMPT-dependent NAD salvage to late indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1)-dependent NAD de novo biosynthesis, leading to persistent immune suppression. This is resulted from the IDO1-dependent expansion of nuclear NAD pool and nuclear NAD-dependent prolongation of sirtuin1 (SIRT1)-directed epigenetics of immune tolerance. Inhibition of IDO1 activity predominantly decreased nuclear NAD level, which promoted sequential dissociations of immunosuppressive SIRT1 and RelB from the promoter of pro-inflammatory TNF-alpha gene and broke endotoxin tolerance. Thus, NAMPT-NAD-SIRT1 axis adapts pro-inflammation, but IDO1-NAD-SIRT1-RelB axis sustains endotoxin tolerance during acute inflammatory response. Remarkably, in contrast to the prevention of sepsis death of animal model by IDO1 inhibition before sepsis initiation, we demonstrated that the combination therapy of IDO1 inhibition by 1-methyl-D-tryptophan (1-MT) and tryptophan supplementation rather than 1-MT administration alone after sepsis onset rescued sepsis animals, highlighting the translational significance of tryptophan restoration in IDO1 targeting therapy of severe inflammatory diseases like sepsis.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Zhang, Tao, Ling, Li, Zhu, Xu, Wang, Zhang, McCall and Liu.']","['Zhang, Jingpu', 'Tao, Jie', 'Ling, Yun', 'Li, Feng', 'Zhu, Xuewei', 'Xu, Li', 'Wang, Mei', 'Zhang, Shuye', 'McCall, Charles E', 'Liu, Tie Fu']","['Zhang J', 'Tao J', 'Ling Y', 'Li F', 'Zhu X', 'Xu L', 'Wang M', 'Zhang S', 'McCall CE', 'Liu TF']",,"['Scientific Research Center, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Scientific Research Center, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Infection Diseases, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Critical Medicine, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Molecular Medicine Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Scientific Research Center, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Critical Medicine, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Scientific Research Center, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Molecular Medicine Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.', 'Scientific Research Center, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Molecular Medicine Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL132035/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI065791/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191011,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (IDO1 protein, human)', '0 (IDO1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Relb protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirt1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Endotoxins/toxicity', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NAD/*immunology', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/immunology', 'Sepsis/chemically induced/drug therapy/immunology', 'Sirtuin 1/*immunology', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transcription Factor RelB/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*3-dioxygenase', '*NAD biosynthesis pathways', '*SIRT1-RelB axis', '*immune tolerance', '*indoleamine 2', '*inflammation']",2019/11/05 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02358 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Oct 11;10:2358. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02358. eCollection 2019.,PMC6797595,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to T cells, NK cells elicit rapid anti-tumor responses based on signals from activating and inhibitory cell surface receptors. They also lyse target cells via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, a critical mode of action of several therapeutic antibodies used to treat cancer. A body of evidence shows that NK cells can exhibit potent anti-tumor activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, disease-associated mechanisms often restrain the proper functions of endogenous NK cells, leading to inadequate tumor control and risk for disease progression. Although allogeneic NK cells can prevent leukemia relapse in certain settings of stem cell transplantation, not all patients are eligible for this type of therapy. Moreover, remissions induced by adoptively infused NK cells are only transient and require subsequent therapy to maintain durable responses. Hence, new strategies are needed to trigger full and durable anti-leukemia responses by NK cells in patients with myeloid malignancies. To achieve this, we need to better understand the interplay between the malignant cells, their microenvironment, and the NK cells. This review focuses on mechanisms that are involved in suppressing NK cells in patients with myeloid leukemia and MDS, and means to restore their full anti-tumor potential. It also discusses novel molecular targets and approaches, such as bi- and tri-specific antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors, to redirect and/or unleash the NK cells against the leukemic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Carlsten and Jaras.'],"['Carlsten, Mattias', 'Jaras, Marcus']","['Carlsten M', 'Jaras M']",,"['Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191011,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)']",IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Surveillance', '*Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/transplantation', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/therapy', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NK cell dysfunction', '*NK cells', '*cancer immunotherapy', '*drug development', '*myeloid malignancy']",2019/11/05 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.02357 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Oct 11;10:2357. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02357. eCollection 2019.,PMC6797594,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The microbial composition of the human gut microbiota is modulated by diet and other lifestyle habits and it has been reported that microbial diversity is altered in obese people. Obesity is a worldwide health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life. Currently, the widespread treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. Interestingly, gut microbiota has been shown to be a relevant factor in effective weight loss after bariatric surgery. Since that the human gut microbiota of normal subjects differs between geographic regions, it is possible that rearrangements of the gut microbiota in dysbiosis context are also region-specific. To better understand how gut microbiota contribute to obesity, this study compared the composition of the human gut microbiota of obese and lean people from six different regions and showed that the microbiota compositions in the context of obesity were specific to each studied geographic location. Furthermore, we analyzed the functional patterns using shotgun DNA metagenomic sequencing and compared the results with other obesity-related metagenomic studies, we observed that microbial contribution to functional pathways were country-specific. Nevertheless, our study showed that although microbial composition of obese patients was country-specific, the overall metabolic functions appeared to be the same between countries, indicating that different microbiota components contribute to similar metabolic outcomes to yield functional redundancy. Furthermore, we studied the microbiota functional changes of obese patients after bariatric surgery, by shotgun metagenomics sequencing and observed that changes in functional pathways were specific to the type of obesity treatment. In all, our study provides new insights into the differences and similarities of obese gut microbiota in relation to geographic location and obesity treatments.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Medina, Li, Thomson, Artacho, Perez-Brocal and Moya.']","['Medina, Daniel A', 'Li, Tianlu', 'Thomson, Pamela', 'Artacho, Alejandro', 'Perez-Brocal, Vicente', 'Moya, Andres']","['Medina DA', 'Li T', 'Thomson P', 'Artacho A', 'Perez-Brocal V', 'Moya A']",,"['Laboratorio de Biotecnologia Aplicada, Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria, Universidad San Sebastian, Puerto Montt, Chile.', 'Chromatin and Disease Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Programme (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Epigenetics and Immune Disease Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departamento de Ingenieria Quimica y Bioprocesos, Escuela de Ingenieria, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Genomics and Health Area, Fundacion para el Fomento de la Investigacion Sanitaria y Biomedica de la Comunidad Valenciana (FISABIO)-Salud Publica, Valencia, Spain.', 'Genomics and Health Area, Fundacion para el Fomento de la Investigacion Sanitaria y Biomedica de la Comunidad Valenciana (FISABIO)-Salud Publica, Valencia, Spain.', 'Genomics and Health Area, Fundacion para el Fomento de la Investigacion Sanitaria y Biomedica de la Comunidad Valenciana (FISABIO)-Salud Publica, Valencia, Spain.', 'Integrative Systems Biology Institute, University of Valencia, CSIC, Valencia, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Centre Network for Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBEResp), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191017,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['bariatric surgery', 'functional convergence', 'functional redundancy', 'human gut microbiota', 'metagenomic', 'obesity']",2019/11/05 06:00,2019/11/05 06:01,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2018/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2019.02346 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2019 Oct 17;10:2346. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2019.02346. eCollection 2019.,PMC6812679,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose-intensified chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation failed to improve the prognosis of patients with ATL; however, we first revealed that allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) might improve their prognosis. We showed that reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation using peripheral blood was feasible for elderly patients. Further, the prognosis of patients in remission, who receive cord blood transplantation, has been recently improved and is equivalent to that of patients who receive transplants from other stem cell sources. As for the timing of HCT, the patients who underwent transplantation early showed better outcomes than those who underwent transplantation late. Based on the analysis of patients with aggressive ATL, including those who received transplants, we identified five prognostic factors for poor outcomes: acute-type ATL, poor performance status, high soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels, hypercalcemia, and high C-reactive protein level. Next, we developed a new prognostic index: the modified ATL-PI. The overall survival (OS) rates were significantly higher in patients who underwent allo-HCT than those who did not in the intermediate and high-risk groups stratified using the modified ATL-PI. Two new anti-cancer agents, mogamulizumab and lenalidomide, were recently approved for ATL patients in Japan. They are expected to induce longer survival in ATL patients when administered along with transplantation. However, a retrospective analysis that the risk of severe, acute, and corticosteroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease was higher in patients who received mogamulizumab before allo-HCT, and that mogamulizumab might increase the transplant-related mortality (TRM) rates and decrease the OS rates compared to those of patients who did not receive mogamulizumab. However, our recent study showed that administration of mogamulizumab before allo-HCT tended to improve the survival of patients with ATL. In conclusion, allo-HCT procedures for patients with aggressive ATL have considerably progressed and have helped improve the prognosis of these patients; however, many concerns still remain to be resolved. Further development of allo-HCT by using new molecular targeting agents is required for the improvement of cure rates in patients with ATL.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Utsunomiya.'],"['Utsunomiya, Atae']",['Utsunomiya A'],,"['Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191001,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HTLV-1', 'HTLV-1 proviral load', 'allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'graft-versus-ATL effect', 'immunotherapy', 'mogamulizumab', 'molecular targeting agent']",2019/11/05 06:00,2019/11/05 06:01,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2019.02235 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2019 Oct 1;10:2235. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2019.02235. eCollection 2019.,PMC6797831,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An area of growing interest is the reported ability of TKIs to induce immunomodulatory effects with anti-tumor and anti-viral activity, which appears to be mediated by directly or indirectly acting on immune cells. In selected cases of patients with CML, TKI treatment may be interrupted and a non-drug remission may be observed. In these patients, an immune mechanism of increased anti-tumor cytotoxic activity induced by chronic administration of TKIs has been suggested. TKIs increase some populations of natural killer (NK), NK-LGL, and T-LGLs cells especially in dasatinib treated CML patients infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV). In addition, dasatinib increases responses against CMV and is able to inhibit HIV replication in vitro. Recent studies suggest that subclinical reactivation of CMV could drive expansion of specific subsets of NK- and T-cells with both anti-tumoral and anti-viral function. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms implicated in the expansion of this increased anti-tumor and anti-viral cytotoxic activity induced by TKIs could be a new therapeutic approach to take into account against cancer and viral infections such as HIV-1 infection. The present review will briefly summarize the immunomodulatory effects of TKIs on T cells, NKs, and B cells.

The crucial roles of non-coding RNAs, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), have been widely reported in Rb progression. In the present study, we found the expression of lncRNA T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (TCL6) was significantly downregulated in Rb tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of lncRNA TCL6 promoted cell proliferation while reduced cell apoptosis in Rb cells. Moreover, lncRNA TCL6 serves as a sponge for miR-21, a previously-reported oncogenic miRNA in Rb, by direct targeting to negatively regulated miR-21 expression, therefore modulating Rb proliferation through miR-21. TCL6 overexpression inhibited Rb cell proliferation while miR-21 overexpression exerted an opposing effect; the effect of TCL6 overexpression was partially attenuated by miR-21 overexpression. PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was involved in lncRNA TCL6/miR-21 axis modulating Rb cell proliferation.

""Regimen 2"" was also more effective in the prevention of chronic GVHD; the CI at 1 year after HSCT was 7% (95% CI: 2-19) vs 31% (95% CI: 19-51), P = .005. The CI of relapse at 3 years adjusted for the GVHD-prophylaxis regimen groups 31% (95% CI: 19-51) for the ""Regimen 1"" vs 21% (95% CI: 11-37) for the ""Regimen 2"", P = .3. The retrospective observation suggests that the use of the rATG, rituximab, and bortezomib was associated with significantly lower rate of GVHD without the loss of anti-leukemic activity.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Shekhovtsova, Zhanna', 'Shelikhova, Larisa', 'Balashov, Dmitry', 'Zakharova, Viktoria', 'Ilushina, Maria', 'Voronin, Kirill', 'Kurnikova, Elena', 'Muzalevskii, Yakov', 'Kazachenok, Alexey', 'Pershin, Dmitry', 'Novichkova, Galina', 'Maschan, Alexey', 'Maschan, Michael']","['Shekhovtsova Z', 'Shelikhova L', 'Balashov D', 'Zakharova V', 'Ilushina M', 'Voronin K', 'Kurnikova E', 'Muzalevskii Y', 'Kazachenok A', 'Pershin D', 'Novichkova G', 'Maschan A', 'Maschan M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9912-6572'],"['Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Clinical Trials Unit, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Molecular Biology Laboratory, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Clinical Trials Unit, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Transfusion Medicine Service, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Transfusion Medicine Service, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Transfusion Medicine Service, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Transplantation Immunology and Immunotherapy Laboratory, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Administration, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dmitriy Rogachev National Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20191103,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'D7RD81HE4W (thymoglobulin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*TCRalphabeta depletion', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*acute myeloblastic leukemia', '*allogeneic HSCT', '*anti-thymocyte globulin', '*bortezomib', '*pediatric']",2019/11/05 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2018/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13594 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2020 Feb;24(1):e13594. doi: 10.1111/petr.13594.

Mutations of splice factors SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2 and U2AF1 occur in >50% of MDS. To assess the impact of spliceosome mutations on splicing and to identify common pathways/genes affected by distinct mutations, we performed RNA-sequencing of MDS bone marrow samples harboring spliceosome mutations (including hotspot alterations of SF3B1, SRSF2 and U2AF1; small deletions of SRSF2 and truncating mutations of ZRSR2), and devoid of other common co-occurring mutations. We uncover the landscape of splicing alterations in each splice factor mutant MDS and demonstrate that small deletions in SRSF2 cause highest number of splicing alterations compared with other spliceosome mutations. Although the mis-spliced events observed in different splice factor mutations were largely non-overlapping, a subset of genes, including EZH2, were aberrantly spliced in multiple mutant groups. We also verified aberrant splicing of key genes USP9X, USP24 (deubiquitinating enzymes), LUC7L2 (splice factor) and EED (PRC2 component) in MDS harboring small deletions of SRSF2. Pathway analysis revealed that mis-spliced genes in different mutant groups were enriched in RNA splicing and transport as well as several signaling cascades, suggesting converging biological consequences downstream of distinct spliceosome mutations. Our study reveals splicing signatures of each splice factor mutation and identifies shared and distinct sets of mis-spliced genes and affected biological processes in different spliceosome mutant MDS.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Madan, Vikas', 'Li, Jia', 'Zhou, Siqin', 'Teoh, Weoi Woon', 'Han, Lin', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Yang, Henry', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Madan V', 'Li J', 'Zhou S', 'Teoh WW', 'Han L', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Malcovati L', 'Cazzola M', 'Ogawa S', 'Haferlach T', 'Yang H', 'Koeffler HP']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7876-624X'],"['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo & University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo & University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California.', 'National University Cancer Institute, National University Hospital Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['20125/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro/International', '21267/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro/International', 'Leukemia and Lymphoma Society/International', 'MOE2014-T3-1-006/Ministry of Education - Singapore/International', 'NMRC/CG/012/2013/National Medical Research Council/International', 'NMRC/STaR/0021/2014/National Medical Research Council/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191118,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['0 (RNA Splicing Factors)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*RNA Splicing', '*RNA Splicing Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2019/11/05 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/11/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25673 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Feb;95(2):133-143. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25673.

Nasal high-flow therapy is increasingly being used as an alternative to them. Nasal high-flow therapy rarely causes pulmonary barotrauma probably because airway pressures are lower when compared with invasive mechanical ventilation. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is triggered by an alloimmune response in the bronchioles and causes obstruction of the bronchioles. However, the threshold of additional positive pressure has not been determined in a patient with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. CASE REPORT A 14-year-old female patient with acute myeloid leukemia at high risk of recurrence received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an unrelated bone marrow donor. After engraftment, she developed acute graft-versus-host disease, followed by chronic graft-versus-host disease. Ten months post-transplantation, she developed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. She continued to receive nasal supplemental oxygen therapy for persistent dyspnea due to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. At month +25, hypercapnia was noted. Therefore, we carefully initiated nasal high-flow therapy for dyspnea and adjusted the oxygen dose to maintain 90% SpO2 to avoid life-threatening apnea. The flow rate was as low as 14 to 20 L/min to avoid the risk of barotrauma and the deterioration of air trapping. Unfortunately, she died of respiratory failure at month +31 post-transplantation. A lung autopsy revealed pulmonary barotrauma.

This analysis characterized the population pharmacokinetics of intravenous blinatumomab in pediatric and adult patients. METHODS: A total of 2417 serum concentrations of blinatumomab from 674 patients, including adult (n = 628) and pediatric patients (n = 46), from eight clinical studies were analyzed. The impact of covariates on pharmacokinetic parameters were explored, and significant covariates were further evaluated using a simulation approach. RESULTS: Blinatumomab pharmacokinetics were described by a one-compartment linear model with first-order elimination, a clearance (CL) of 2.22 L/h, and a central volume of 5.98 L. A statistically significant effect of body surface area (BSA) on CL was observed. The smallest BSA of 0.37 m(2) in the pediatric population was associated with a 63% reduction in blinatumomab systemic CL, relative to an adult patient with the median BSA (1.88 m(2)), supporting the use of BSA-based dosing in patients of lower bodyweight. The BSA effect was minimal, with a </= 25% change in CL over the range of BSA in adults, supporting no need for BSA-based dosing. CONCLUSIONS: Blinatumomab pharmacokinetics were adequately described by a one-compartment linear model with first-order elimination. No covariates other than BSA on CL were identified as significant. BSA-based dosing should be considered for lightweight patients to minimize inter-subject variability in blinatumomab exposure.",,"['Clements, John David', 'Zhu, Min', 'Kuchimanchi, Mita', 'Terminello, Bianca', 'Doshi, Sameer']","['Clements JD', 'Zhu M', 'Kuchimanchi M', 'Terminello B', 'Doshi S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3843-8097'],"['Clinical Pharmacology, Modeling & Simulation, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Modeling & Simulation, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Modeling & Simulation, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Biogen, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Modeling & Simulation, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Modeling & Simulation, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA. sdoshi@amgen.com.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Body Surface Area', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy', 'Patient Simulation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Secondary Prevention', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/11/05 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2019/11/04 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40262-019-00823-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s40262-019-00823-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2020 Apr;59(4):463-474. doi: 10.1007/s40262-019-00823-8.,PMC7109194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on the lipophilicity of the active substance, it can be encapsulated within the core or amongst the lipid bilayer. Compared to liposomes, transferosomes are able to reach intact deeper regions of the skin after topical administration delivering higher concentrations of active substances making them a successful drug delivery carrier for transdermal applications. Most transferosomes contain phosphatidylcholine (C18) as it is the most abundant lipid component of the cell membrane, and hence, it is highly tolerated for the skin, decreasing the risk of undesirable effects, such as hypersensitive reactions. The most common edge activators are surfactants such as sodium deoxycholate, Tween(R) 80 and Span(R) 80. Their chain length is optimal for intercalation within the C18 phospholipid bilayer. A wide variety of drugs has been successfully encapsulated within transferosomes such as phytocompounds like sinomenine or apigenin for rheumatoid arthritis and leukaemia respectively, small hydrophobic drugs but also macromolecules like insulin. The main factors to develop optimal transferosomal formulations (with high drug loading and nanometric size) are the optimal ratio between the main components as well as the critical process parameters for their manufacture. Application of quality by design (QbD), specifically design of experiments (DoE), is crucial to understand the interplay among all these factors not only during the preparation at lab scale but also in the scale-up process. Clinical trials of a licensed topical ketoprofen transferosomal gel have shown promising results in the alleviation of symptons in orthreothritis with non-severe skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

We show that VTN leaks from the bloodstream into the injury site and neighboring subventricular zone (SVZ) following ischemic stroke (middle cerebral artery occlusion, MCAO) in adult mice. MCAO is known to increase neurogenesis after stroke. VTN inhibits this response in females, but not in males, as shown by ~70% more stroke-induced SVZ neurogenesis in female VTN-/- mice at 14 d. In female VTN-/- mice, stroke-induced expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 24h was reduced in the SVZ. The closely related leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or pro-neurogenic ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) were not affected. The female-specific effect of VTN on IL-6 expression was not due to sex hormones, as shown by ovariectomy and castration. IL-6 injection next to the SVZ reversed the MCAO-induced increase in neurogenesis seen in VTN-/- mice. Our in vitro and vivo data suggest that plasma VTN activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the SVZ following MCAO, which reduces IL-6 expression in astrocytes but increases it in other cells such as microglia/macrophages. Inducible conditional astrocytic FAK deletion increased MCAO-induced IL-6 expression in females at 24h and blocked MCAO-induced neurogenesis at 14d, confirming a key detrimental role of IL-6. Collectively, these data suggest that leakage of VTN into the SVZ reduces the neurogenic response to stroke in female mice by promoting IL-6 expression. Reducing VTN or VTN signaling may be an approach to promote neurogenesis for neuroprotection and cell replacement after stroke in females.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study compared time to next treatment (TTNT), health care resource utilization (HRU), and total direct costs among patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) initiating front-line ibrutinib single agent (Ibr) or CIT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Optum Clinformatics Extended DataMart De-Identified Databases were used to identify adults with >/= 2 claims with a CLL diagnosis initiating front-line Ibr or CIT from February 12, 2014 to June 30, 2017. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to control for potential differences in baseline characteristics between the Ibr and CIT cohorts. Two periods were considered: entire front-line therapy (until initiation of second-line therapy) and first 6 months of front-line therapy. Comparisons with a subgroup of CIT patients initiating bendamustine/rituximab (BR) were also conducted. RESULTS: TTNT was significantly longer for Ibr (N = 322) relative to CIT (N = 839; hazard ratio, 0.54; P = .0163; Kaplan-Meier rates [24 months]: Ibr = 88.6%, CIT = 75.9%) and the subset of CIT patients treated with BR (N = 455; hazard ratio, 0.54; P = .0208; Kaplan-Meier rates [24 months]: Ibr = 89.0%, BR = 79.0%). During the entire front-line therapy, Ibr patients had significantly fewer monthly days with outpatient visits (rate ratio = 0.75; P = .0200). Ibrutinib's higher pharmacy costs (mean monthly cost difference [MMCD] = $6,849; P < .0001) were offset by lower medical costs (MMCD = -$10,615; P < .0001), yielding net savings (MMCD = -$3,766; P < .0001) versus CIT. Ibr was associated with net savings (MMCD = -$5,569; P < .0001) versus BR. Cost savings and reductions in HRU were more pronounced during the first 6 months of front-line therapy. CONCLUSION: During front-line CLL treatment, Ibr was associated with longer TTNT, fewer monthly days with outpatient visits, and net monthly total cost reduction versus CIT and BR.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

Given the increasing volume of patients and longer wait time, outpatient ASCT for MM is the standard of care at the Vancouver General Hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with MM, POEMS syndrome, and amyloidosis undergoing ASCT were included in this analysis. We analyzed patient characteristics, the number of patients requiring admission, duration of admission, 30-day and 100-day mortality, and overall survival. RESULTS: Between January 2007 and June 2016, 724 patients underwent 752 ASCTs. Of these, 702 were first ASCTs, 44 were second, and 6 were third. The median age was 60 years (interquartile range [IQR], 54-65 years). Reasons for ASCTs were MM (96.9%) amyloidosis (2.4%), and POEMS syndrome (0.7%). There were 431 (59.5%) males in this group. The median time from diagnosis to transplant was 5 months. Conditioning was melphalan 200 mg/m(2) for 89.6% of the patients. Admission to the inpatient ward was required by 245 (32.6%) patients within the first 30 days. The median time to admission was 9 days post-transplant (IQR, 5-13 days). The median duration of admission was 6 days (IQR, 3-9 days). The day 100 all-cause mortality rate was 0.9%, and transplant-related mortality was 0.4%. CONCLUSION: Outpatient ASCT is a safe and feasible treatment strategy with low transplant-related mortality.

Recent studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are contained in leukemia-derived exosomes and are involved in modulating the BM microenvironment. In this study, we found that K562 cell-derived exosomes transfer miR-711 to BM-MSCs and suppress the adhesive function of BM-MSCs. Using qRT-PCR, we also confirmed a significantly higher level of miR-711 in exosomes derived from K562cells than in exosomes derived from parental cells. The BM-MSCs co-cultured with exosomes derived from K562cells showed a lower adhesion rate than did controls. We further demonstrated that exosomal transfer of miR-711 induced decreased adhesive abilities by inhibiting expression of adhesion molecule CD44 in BM-MSCs.

Promyelocytic leukemia proteins (PMLs) are IFN-up-regulated proteins, and one of their critical functions is working as antiviral proteins. Recently, promyelocytic leukemia isoform II (PML-II) has been depicted as an isoform responsible for the antiviral function. Methods: Rotavirus prevalence determination was achieved by PCR and Rapid Adeno/Rota Virus test, while the relative expression assay was carried out by real-time PCR technique. Blood and stool samples were collected from 34 children under five years admitted to the hospital with acute gastroenteritis showing signs of dehydration. RNA samples were extracted from blood specimens and converted to cDNA to be used in gene expression analysis of PML, PML-II, and IFN-gamma in rotavirus positive or negative samples. Results: Rapid Adeno/Rota Virus Antigen Combo Test and PCR assay could detect the virus in stool samples in 45% and 17.6% of cases, respectively. PML in positive samples decreased to 104fold less than the level in negative ones. The same trend was noticed in the level of IFN-gamma and PML-II expression as their expression reduced to 104 or 13fold in rotavirus-infected samples compared to the control, respectively. Conclusion: Altogether, our data showed that the gene expression of PML, PML-II, and type II IFN considerably diminished in rotavirus-infected samples compared to the negative control.",,"['Mohammed, Ahmed Jasim', 'Atwan, Zeenah Weheed', 'Abdul-Kareem, Aida']","['Mohammed AJ', 'Atwan ZW', 'Abdul-Kareem A']",,"['Department of Biology, College of Science, University of Basra, Basra, Iraq', 'Department of Biology, College of Science, University of Basra, Basra, Iraq', 'Department of Biology, College of Science, University of Basra, Basra, Iraq']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191030,Iran,Iran Biomed J,Iranian biomedical journal,9814853,"['0 (IFNG protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,"['Child, Preschool', 'Gastroenteritis/*pathology/virology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rotavirus/growth & development', 'Rotavirus Infections/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Gene expression', '*IFN-gamma', '*PML', '*PML-II', '*Rotavirus']",2019/11/05 06:00,2020/06/06 06:00,['2019/11/04 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran Biomed J. 2020 Mar;24(2):128-135.

Here, we aimed at characterizing the initial events in the molecular pathogenesis of T-PLL and particularly, at determining the point in T-cell differentiation when the hallmark oncogenic events, that is, inv(14)(q11q32)/t(14;14)(q11;q32) and t(X;14)(q28;q11) occur. To this end, we mined whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data of 17 and 11 T-PLL cases, respectively. Mapping of the 14q32.1 locus breakpoints identified only TCL1A, which was moreover significantly overexpressed in T-PLL as compared to benign CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, as the only common oncogenic target of aberrations. In cases with t(14;14), the breakpoints mapped telomeric and in cases with inv(14) centromeric or in the 3'-untranslated region of TCL1A. Regarding the T-cell receptor alpha (TRA) locus-TCL1A breakpoint junctions, all 17 breakpoints involved recombination signal sequences and 15 junctions contained nontemplated (N-) nucleotides. All T-PLL cases studied carried in-frame TRA rearrangements on the intact allele, which skewed significantly toward usage of distal/central TRAV/TRAJ gene segments as compared to the illegitimate TRA rearrangements. Our findings suggest that the oncogenic TRA-TCL1A/MTCP1 rearrangements in T-PLL occur during opening of the TRA locus, that is, during the progression from CD4+ immature single positive to early double positive thymocyte stage, just before physiologic TCL1A expression is silenced. The cell carrying such an oncogenic event continues maturation and rearranges the second TRA allele to achieve a functional T-cell receptor. Thereafter, it switches off RAG and DNTT expression in line with the mature T-cell phenotype at presentation of T-PLL.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Patil, Paurnima', 'Cieslak, Agata',

METHODS: Children aged 1-14 years with newly diagnosed ALL receiving MTX over 3 g/m(2) were enrolled. Serum NGAL concentrations, serum creatinine (Scr) and MTX concentrations were measured. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used for evaluating variables' ability of early diagnosis of AKI. RESULTS: A total of 196 courses of 62 patients were assessed, and 22 courses (11.2%) developed AKI. Twenty-four hours serum NGAL concentrations, 24 h Scr ratio, 48 h Scr ratio, CMTX24 h, CMTX48 h, CMTX72 h were significantly higher in patients with AKI. The combination of 24 h Scr ratio and 24 h serum NGAL had higher value for detecting HDMTX induced AKI compared with the 24 h Scr ratio. And the combination had similar value for detecting HDMTX induced AKI compared with the 48 h Scr ratio. After 48 h, CMTX48 h had a satisfying accuracy in predicting AKI. The proportion of post-HDMTX sepsis in patients with AKI was significantly higher than that in patients without AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Serum NGAL levels could be used as a marker in identifying the direct kidney tubular damage induced by HDMTX. The combination of 24 h Scr ratio and 24 h serum NGAL had higher value for early diagnosis of HDMTX associated AKI compared with the 24 h Scr ratio.",,"['Li, Hui', 'Xu, Qiong', 'Wang, Yang', 'Chen, Kailan', 'Li, Jianxin']","['Li H', 'Xu Q', 'Wang Y', 'Chen K', 'Li J']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2889-3165'],"[""Department of Hematology, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, 100 Xianggang Road, Jiangan District, Wuhan, 430016, Hubei, China. polarisyxt@hotmail.com."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, 100 Xianggang Road, Jiangan District, Wuhan, 430016, Hubei, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191101,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (LCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/blood/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lipocalin-2/*blood', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute kidney injury', '*High-dose methotrexate', '*Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin']",2019/11/05 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/11/03 06:00'],"['2019/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-019-03980-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-019-03980-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2020 Jan;85(1):95-103. doi: 10.1007/s00280-019-03980-6.

Systemic antibacterial prophylaxis is one approach that can be used to reduce the risk of these infections. Our purpose was to develop a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for systemic antibacterial prophylaxis administration in pediatric patients with cancer and those undergoing HSCT. METHODS: An international and multidisciplinary panel was convened with representation from pediatric hematology/oncology and HSCT, pediatric infectious diseases (including antibiotic stewardship), nursing, pharmacy, a patient advocate, and a CPG methodologist. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to generate recommendations based on the results of a systematic review of the literature. RESULTS: The systematic review identified 114 eligible randomized trials of antibiotic prophylaxis. The panel made a weak recommendation for systemic antibacterial prophylaxis for children receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Weak recommendations against the routine use of systemic antibacterial prophylaxis were made for children undergoing induction chemotherapy for ALL, autologous HSCT and allogeneic HSCT. A strong recommendation against its routine use was made for children whose therapy is not expected to result in prolonged severe neutropenia. If used, prophylaxis with levofloxacin was recommended during severe neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: We present a CPG for systemic antibacterial prophylaxis administration in pediatric cancer and HSCT patients. Future research should evaluate the long-term effectiveness and adverse effects of prophylaxis.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Here we show that exposure to proinflammatory cytokines reveals a marked plasticity of the beta-cell regulatory landscape. We expand the repertoire of human islet regulatory elements by mapping stimulus-responsive enhancers linked to changes in the beta-cell transcriptome, proteome and three-dimensional chromatin structure. Our data indicate that the beta-cell response to cytokines is mediated by the induction of new regulatory regions as well as the activation of primed regulatory elements prebound by islet-specific transcription factors. We find that T1D-associated loci are enriched with newly mapped cis-regulatory regions and identify T1D-associated variants disrupting cytokine-responsive enhancer activity in human beta cells.

LSD1 is a histone modifier that eliminates SE activity. However, whether SE suppression by LSD1 is associated with leukemogenesis remains unknown. In erythro-megakaryocyte lineage leukemia cells, activation of the SE of GFI1 (GFI1-SE) is related to induction of myeloid differentiation by LSD1 inhibitors NCD38 and NCD25 and to their antileukemia effect. Although functional TF-motifs were concentrated in an evolutionally conserved area, NCD38 barely induced additional TF recruitment. Instead, the transcription cofactors including LSD1, CoREST, HDAC1, and HDAC2 were evicted from GFI1-SE. Deletion of GFI1-SE impaired induction of myeloid differentiation by NCD38 and NCD25 in erythroleukemia cells. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the GFI1-SE deletion impaired NCD38-induced programs related to granulocyte differentiation and the CEBPA network, but restored NCD38-suppressed programs related to erythroid development, GATA1 targets, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) clusters including FAB subtype M6 and AML with myelodysplastic syndrome-related chromosomal abnormalities. Ontologies of genes whose expression changes by NCD38 were canceled due to the GFI1-SE deletion showed enrichment in AML and neutropenia signatures.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chemorefractory relapses result from the complex interplay between altered genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional states in leukemic cells. Here, we develop an experimental model system using in vitro lineage tracing coupled with exome, transcriptome and in vivo functional readouts to assess the AML population dynamics and associated molecular determinants underpinning chemoresistance development. We find that combining standard chemotherapeutic regimens with low doses of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi, hypomethylating drugs) prevents chemoresistant relapses. Mechanistically, DNMTi suppresses the outgrowth of a pre-determined set of chemoresistant AML clones with stemness properties, instead favoring the expansion of rarer and unfit chemosensitive clones. Importantly, we confirm the capacity of DNMTi combination to suppress stemness-dependent chemoresistance development in xenotransplantation models and primary AML patient samples.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients (aged 1-<18 years) with CML resistant to or intolerant of imatinib and/or dasatinib (n = 11) or Ph(+) ALL relapsed on or refractory to standard therapy (n = 4) enrolled in this phase I study. Nilotinib (230 mg/m(2) twice daily; equivalent to the adult 400-mg twice-daily dose) was administered orally in 12 or 24 cycles of 28 days. The primary objective was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib in pediatric patients. RESULTS: The area under the concentration-time curve at steady state was slightly lower in pediatric patients versus adults (14,751.4 vs. 17,102.9 ng/h/mL); the geometric mean ratio (GMR; pediatric:adult) was 0.86 [90% confidence interval (CI), 0.70-1.06]. Body surface area-adjusted systemic clearance was slightly higher in pediatric versus adult patients (GMR, 1.30; 90% CI, 1.04-1.62). Nilotinib was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events were headache, vomiting, increased blood bilirubin, and rash. Three patients with CML achieved major molecular response, and three with Ph(+) ALL achieved complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib 230 mg/m(2) twice daily in pediatric patients provided a pharmacokinetics and safety profile comparable with the adult reference dose; clinical activity was demonstrated in both CML and Ph(+) ALL.

ESD is regarded as the standard treatment for early-stage ESCCs. However, radical surgery is recommended when lymph node metastasis risk exists. More efforts are needed to find the markers for early prediction and clarify the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of lymph node metastasis. Recently, aberrant regulation of gene expression by histone methylation modifiers has emerged as an important mechanism for cancer metastasis. Herein, we demonstrated that mixed-lineage leukemia 2 (MLL2) positively regulates gene expression programs associated with ESCC cell migration. MLL2 interacts with RelA in the nucleus to enhance transcription of stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) and to facilitate cancer metastasis. Meanwhile, MLL2 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in the migration of ESCC cells. Clinically, high level of MLL2 was significantly associated with early-stage ESCC lymph node metastasis. In summary, these findings discovered a previously unidentified molecular pathway underlying the coordinated regulation of metastasis-related STC-1 expression by MLL2 and RelA and highlighted the critical role of MLL2 in ESCC.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Optimal use of immunophenotyping for these purposes requires detailed knowledge about the phenotypic patterns of normal hematopoietic cells. In the past few decades, flow cytometry has benefited from technological developments allowing simultaneous analysis of multiple antigen stainings with >/=3-35 distinct fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for increasingly higher numbers of cells. These advances have contributed to expand our knowledge about the phenotypic differentiation profiles of normal hematopoietic cells, from uncommitted CD34(+) precursors in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB), to the several hundreds of populations of circulating myeloid and (B and T) lymphoid cells identified so far. Detailed dissection of the normal phenotypic profiles of hematopoietic cells has settled the basis for identification of aberrant phenotypes on leukemia and lymphoma cells. Thus, it has contributed to: i) more sensitive identification of leukemia/lymphoma cells (especially when represented at low frequencies in a sample), and ii) more accurate classification of hematological malignancies. In this manuscript, we review the major phenotypic features of hematopoietic cells, from the more immature BM CD34(+) precursors committed to the myeloid and lymphoid lineages toward mature hematopoietic cells circulating in PB (e.g. neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, erythroid cells, and B- and T-cells) and those homing to other tissues (e.g. plasma cells, mast cells).",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Complex biologics, such as bispecific antibodies or multi-domain molecules can induce anti-drug antibodies (ADA) with specificity to different domains. Domain specific ADAs may differently affect drug efficacy and safety, and thus, characterization of ADA domain specificity has become a regulatory expectation for multi-domain biologics. Unlike well-established methods for screening, confirmation, titer and neutralizing ADA detection, characterization of ADA domain specificity is an emerging field. The conventional approach for determination of ADA domain specificity is a competitive inhibition with domain-containing molecules. When developing a conventional domain specificity assay for moxetumomab pasudotox, a recombinant anti-CD22 immunotoxin, comprised of two functional domains (CD22-binding fragment and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38), we encountered a bioanalytical challenge. The method was able to detect immunodominant anti-PE38 (ADA-PE) but generated false negative results for low abundant CD22-binding domain ADA (ADA-BD) in a polyclonal sample. Troubleshooting experiments using control samples with varying levels of each ADA subtype demonstrated that a major factor for successful ADA identification was the ratio of the ADA signals contributed by each ADA subtype. To overcome this unique bioanalytical challenge, we developed a novel approach, which ensures detection of a domain-specific ADA subtype regardless of its relative level in a polyclonal ADA sample by evaluating signal inhibition by a respective domain-containing molecule at the condition when signals from all other ADAs are fully blocked. The method has been used for characterization of ADA domain specificity in moxetumomab pasudotox clinical trials, including study 1053, the pivotal Phase III study in hairy cell leukemia patients. It allowed for successful detection of ADA-BD in the presence of immunodominant ADA-PE, enabling accurate determination of domain specificity for moxetumomab pasudotox. The results demonstrated that the method was superior than the conventional approach. The method could be applied broadly to other biologics with two or more domains when there is a need to detect a minor ADA subtype in polyclonal samples.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the KIR gene and KIRL content in individuals, making it difficult to estimate the full clinical impact of NK cell reconstitution following HCT. Here we present a novel adaptive mathematical model designed to quantify these interactions to better assess the influence of NK cell-mediated alloreactivity on transplant outcomes. Ninety-eight HLA- matched unrelated donor (URD) HCT recipients were studied retrospectively. The KIR-KIRL interactions were quantified using a system of matrix equations. Unit values were ascribed to each KIR-KIRL interaction, and the directionality of interactions was denoted by either a positive (activating) or negative (inhibition) symbol; these interactions were then summed. The absolute values of both the missing KIRL and inhibitory KIR-KIRL interactions were significantly associated with overall survival and relapse. These score components were initially used to develop a weighted score (w-KIR score) and subsequently a simplified, nonweighted KIR-KIRL interaction score (IM-KIR score). Increased w-KIR score and IM-KIR score were predictive of all-cause mortality and relapse (w-KIR score: hazard ratio [HR], .37 [P = .001] and .44 [P = .044], respectively; IM-KIR score: HR, .5 [P = .049] and .44 [P = .002], respectively). IM-KIR score was also associated with NK cell reconstitution post-HCT. KIR-KIRL interactions as reflected by the w-KIR and IM-KIR scores influence both relapse risk and survival in recipients of HLA-matched URD HCT with hematologic malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we identified that 3'-hydroxy-4',5,6,7-tetramethoxyflavone (TMF) binds to the nuclear export factors Exportin-1 and -2 (XPO1 and XPO2) as TMF-binding proteins and demonstrated that nobiletin competes with TMF for XPO1 binding, suggesting that nobiletin also binds to XPO1. Treatment of KHYG-1cells with leptomycin B, a specific XPO1 inhibitor, increased the expression of GrB and IFN-gamma but did not potentiate lysis of specific target cells, suggesting that the cargo of XPO1 contributes to the expression of cytolytic genes but that this alone is insufficient to enhance cytolysis. Consistent with this, nobiletin and related PMFs induced the nuclear retention of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor that promotes GrB and IFN-gamma expression. PMFs also induced the nuclear retention of the tumor suppressor protein p53, a known XPO1 cargo protein, resulting in KHYG-1cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these results suggest that PMFs modulate KHYG-1 function, at least in part, by inhibiting XPO1.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to describe characteristics and outcomes of Thai ALL patients, and to determine the differences between adolescent and young adult (AYA) and adult ALL. ALL patients aged > 15 years were prospectively enrolled from 2015 to 2017. AYA patients were defined as age </= 39 years. Out of the 188 enrolled ALL patients, 9 were excluded due to changes in diagnosis or incomplete data. From the remaining 179 patients, 103 (57.5%) were AYA and 76 (42.5%) were adult. AYA ALL patients were predominantly male, had higher T-cell phenotype, higher white blood cells and hemoglobin, with lower frequency of Philadelphia chromosome or BCR-ABL1 mutation. All patients received treatment by adult hematologist, however 40.8% of AYA ALL patients were treated with pediatric adapted protocol. The effects of stem cell transplantation (SCT) and age were determined by stratified patients as: AYA - no SCT 91 (51.1%), AYA - SCT 12 (6.7%), adult - no SCT 64 (36.0%) and adult - SCT 11 (6.2%). The 2-year overall survival were: 53.9%, 60.6%, 39.2% and 70.1%, respectively. The 2-year event-free survival were: 45.0%, 54.0%, 21.0% and 49.9%, respectively. This is a large multicenter ALL cohort study conducted in Thailand. Patients who underwent SCT showed significantly improved OS and EFS, confirming the benefit of graft-versus-leukemia effect in ALL.

During the past decade, it became clear that heterozygous germline mutations in the GATA2 gene cause bone marrow failure and primary immunodeficiency syndrome, conditions that lead to a predisposition toward myeloid neoplasms, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Somatic mutations of the GATA2 gene are also involved in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. Cases with GATA2 gene mutations are divided into two groups, resulting in either a quantitative deficiency or a qualitative defect in the GATA2 protein depending on the mutation position and type. In the former case, GATA2 mRNA expression from the mutant allele is markedly reduced or completely abrogated, and reduced GATA2 protein expression is involved in the pathogenesis. In the latter case, almost equal amounts of structurally abnormal and wildtype GATA2 proteins are predicted to be present and contribute to the pathogenesis. The development of mouse models of these human GATA2-related diseases has been undertaken, which naturally develop myeloid neoplasms.",['(c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.'],"['Shimizu, Ritsuko', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki']","['Shimizu R', 'Yamamoto M']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6672-7606'],"['Department of Molecular Hematology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191101,England,IUBMB Life,IUBMB life,100888706,['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*GATA2', '*disease model mice', '*familial MDS/AML', '*quantitative or qualitative change']",2019/11/02 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2019/11/02 06:00'],"['2019/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/iub.2188 [doi]'],ppublish,IUBMB Life. 2020 Jan;72(1):142-150. doi: 10.1002/iub.2188.

Although Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) interactions are important for T lymphocytes to mediate cytotoxicity, there are only few reports examining the involvement of the Fas-FasL pathway in vitiligo using in vivo mouse models. In addition, there have been no reports concerning Fas-mediated apoptosis in human melanocytes in vitro. In this study, we found that the Fas-mediated pathway is involved in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-dependent vitiligo in a mouse model and FasL-induced apoptosis of human melanocytes. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma, the expression levels of which have been reported to be elevated in lesional skin of patients with vitiligo, synergistically upregulated Fas expression on human melanocytes but inhibited the Fas-mediated apoptosis. Treatment with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma synergistically upregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, c-IAP2, c-FLIP and MCL1. A siRNA knock-down study showed that c-FLIP and MCL1, but not c-IAP2, were involved in inducing synergistic inhibitory effects on Fas-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that FasL and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) synergistically induced apoptosis on human melanocytes. In conclusion, our results suggest that the Fas-FasL pathway is involved in CTL-dependent vitiligo and the elevated expression levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in lesional skin may act synergistically on melanocytes to suppress Fas-mediated apoptosis.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Using a UK-based register of haematological malignancies and a matched general population-based cohort, joint replacements from linked hospital inpatient records were examined. Cases diagnosed 2009-2015 who were aged 50 years or more were included; 8,013 mature B-cell neoplasms comprising myeloma (n = 1,763), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, n = 1,676), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, n = 1,594), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL, n = 957), follicular lymphoma (FL, n = 725) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL, n = 255), together with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS, n = 2,138) and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL, n = 632). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated relative to 10 age- and sex-matched controls using conditional logistic regression. Having had a joint replacement before diagnosis was associated with myeloma (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p = 0.008) and MGUS (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5, p < 0.001). Excluding replacements in the year before diagnosis, the MGUS risk remained, elevated where two or more joints were replaced (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-2.0, p = 0.001), with hip (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5, p = 0.06) or knee replacements (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8, p < 0.001).

NPM protein is primarily located in the nucleus, but the recurrent NPMc+ mutation, which creates a nuclear export signal, is characterized by cytoplasmic localization and leukemogenic properties. Similarly, the NPM-MLF1 translocation product favors the partial cytoplasmic retention of NPM. Regardless of their common cellular distribution, NPM-MLF1 malignancies engender different effects on hematopoiesis compared to NPMc+ counterparts, highlighting possible aberrant nuclear function(s) of NPM in NPMc+ and NPM-MLF1 AML. We performed a proteomic analysis and found that NPM and NPM-MLF1 interact with various nuclear proteins including subunits of the chromatin remodeling complexes ISWI, NuRD and P/BAF. Accordingly, NPM and NPM-MLF1 are recruited to transcriptionally active or repressed genes along with NuRD subunits.

D-dimer levels were measured in radiation oncology patients, who were diagnosed with prostate, breast or lung cancer, or leukemia, as well as in healthy subjects serving as controls. Blood samples from radiotherapy patients were taken at three different time points: pre-, on- and post-radiotherapy. For the patients, considered together, differences between the D-dimer levels at these three time points compared to controls were statistically significant. Compared to the pre-radiotherapy measurements, radiation exposure was associated with a significant increase in the D-dimer levels at the on- and post-radiotherapy time points. At the post-radiotherapy time point, D-dimer levels in the patients were not significantly reduced compared to the on-radiotherapy levels, indicating that the risk for developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may be increased in some radiation oncology patients. Of particular concern are the post-radiotherapy results observed for the D-dimer levels in the leukemia patients, in which the average fold increase in the D-dimer levels was 5.43 (compared to the pre-radiotherapy levels). These results suggest that leukemia patients might benefit from frequent assessment of their D-dimer levels after their total-body irradiation-conditioning regimen to detect early signs of DIC development.

While drug discovery targeting the UPS focuses on irreversibly binding epoxyketones and slowly-reversibly binding boronates, optimization of novel covalent-reversibly binding warheads remains largely unattended. We previously reported alpha-ketoamides to be a promising reversible lead motif, yet the cytotoxic activity required further optimization. This work focuses on the lead optimization of phenoxy-substituted alpha-ketoamides combining the structure-activity relationships from the primed and the non-primed site of the proteasome beta5 subunit. Our optimization strategy is accompanied by molecular modeling, suggesting occupation of P1' by a 3-phenoxy group to increase beta5 inhibition and cytotoxic activity in leukemia cell lines. Key compounds were further profiled for time-dependent inhibition of cellular substrate conversion. Furthermore, the alpha-ketoamide lead structure 27 does not affect escape response behavior in Danio rerio embryos, in contrast to bortezomib, which suggests increased target specificity.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota can interfere with chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant drugs, used in the treatment of these diseases, reducing or facilitating drug efficacy. In particular, the effect of intestinal microflora through translocation, immunomodulation, metabolism, enzymatic degradation, and reduction of bacterial diversity seems to be one of the reasons of interindividual variability in the therapeutic response. Although the extent of the role of intestinal microflora in chemotherapy and immunosuppression remains still unresolved, current evidence on bacterial compositional shifts will be taken in consideration together with clinical response to drugs for a better and personalized therapy.

A better understanding of CNS symptoms and their complications improves the potential to prevent and treat them. METHODS: Patient files from 649 children treated with Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology ALL92 and ALL2000 protocols in Finland were reviewed retrospectively for any acute CNS symptom. Detailed data on symptoms, examinations and treatment of the underlying CNS complications were collected from the medical records. Disease-related and outcome data were retrieved from the Nordic leukaemia registry. RESULTS: Altogether, 13% (86) of patients with ALL had acute CNS symptoms. Most symptoms (64%) occurred during the first 2 months of therapy. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome was the most frequent complication (4.5%). Cerebrovascular events were diagnosed in 10 cases (1.6%), while methotrexate-related stroke-like syndrome (SLS) was observed in only one patient (0.2%). CNS symptoms due to systemic or unclear conditions, especially sepsis, were important for differential diagnosis. CNS leukaemia was associated with CNS symptoms (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.03; P = .003), and epilepsy was a common sequel of CNS complications (19%). CONCLUSIONS: Acute CNS symptoms are common during ALL therapy, occurring mainly during the first 2 months of treatment. Patients with CNS leukaemia at diagnosis are at a higher risk for CNS toxicity. Despite intensive CNS-directed methotrexate treatment, SLS was diagnosed extremely rarely in our series.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Banerjee, Joanna', 'Niinimaki, Riitta', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi', 'Hed Myrberg, Ida', 'Arola, Mikko', 'Riikonen, Pekka', 'Lonnqvist, Tuula', 'Palomaki, Maarit', 'Ranta, Susanna', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Taskinen, Mervi']","['Banerjee J', 'Niinimaki R', 'Lahteenmaki P', 'Hed Myrberg I', 'Arola M', 'Riikonen P', 'Lonnqvist T', 'Palomaki M', 'Ranta S', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Taskinen M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0190-5664', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8297-2238', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7854-0371', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2767-5828', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9907-4725']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Helsinki University Hospital and Helsinki University, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Children and Adolescents, Oulu University Hospital and PEDEGO Research Unit, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Turku University Hospital and Turku University, Turku, Finland.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Division of Child Neurology, Helsinki University Hospital and Helsinki University, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Radiology, Helsinki Medical Imaging Center, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Helsinki University Hospital and Helsinki University, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191101,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*children', '*neurotoxicity', '*outcome', '*posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome', '*sinovenous thrombosis', '*stroke-like syndrome']",2019/11/02 06:00,2020/04/23 06:00,['2019/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27999 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Feb;67(2):e27999. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27999.

However, the relatively large size of these chimeric molecules often results in challenging physico-chemical properties (e. g., low aqueous solubility) and poor pharmacokinetics which may complicate their in vivo applications. We recently discovered an exquisitely potent chimeric BET degrader (GNE-987) which exhibited picomolar cell potencies but also demonstrated low in vivo exposures. In an effort to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of this molecule, we discovered the first degrader-antibody conjugate by attaching GNE-987 to an anti-CLL1 antibody via a novel linker. A single IV dose of the conjugate afforded sustained in vivo exposures that resulted in antigen-specific tumor regressions. Enhancement of a chimeric protein degrader with poor in vivo properties through antibody conjugation thereby expands the utility of directed protein degradation as both a biological tool and a therapeutic possibility.","['(c) 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The persistence of NPM1 mutations following chemotherapy is associated with a greater risk of relapse as well as a lower rate of survival, making NPM1 measurable residual disease (MRD) an informative clinical target. METHODS: Herein, we have developed a straightforward unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based amplicon next-generation sequencing method for the detection of NPM1-mutated MRD that addresses some of the limitations present in other assays. RESULTS: The NPM1 assay allowed for accurate counting of individual mutant and wild-type molecules down to 0.01% variant allelic frequency. In silico contamination experiments highlighted the ability of this UMI methodology to maximize specificity through dramatic reductions in sequencing/demultiplexing bleed-through error. CONCLUSION: Performance and clinical utility of the NPM1 MRD assay are established via both validation experiments and analyses of live performance over 1.5 years of routine clinical service.",,"['Ritterhouse, Lauren L', 'Parilla, Megan', 'Zhen, Chao Jie', 'Wurst, Michelle N', 'Puranik, Rutika', 'Henderson, Candace M', 'Joudeh, Neda Z', 'Hartley, Madeline J', 'Haridas, Rishikesh', 'Wanjari, Pankhuri', 'Furtado, Larissa V', 'Kadri, Sabah', 'Segal, Jeremy P']","['Ritterhouse LL', 'Parilla M', 'Zhen CJ', 'Wurst MN', 'Puranik R', 'Henderson CM', 'Joudeh NZ', 'Hartley MJ', 'Haridas R', 'Wanjari P', 'Furtado LV', 'Kadri S', 'Segal JP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7655-630X'],"['Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA. lritterhouse@partners.org.', 'Center for Integrated Diagnostics, Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. lritterhouse@partners.org.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Limit of Detection', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/blood/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Recurrence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,,2019/11/02 06:00,2020/05/13 06:00,['2019/11/02 06:00'],"['2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40291-019-00436-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s40291-019-00436-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2019 Dec;23(6):791-802. doi: 10.1007/s40291-019-00436-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A prospective study was developed in 50 children (1-15 years old) with ALL diagnosis attended at Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Service from Hospital Central ""Dr. Ignacio Morones Prieto"" and under treatment with high doses of MTX administered in 24-h continuous intravenous infusion. Plasma concentrations of MTX were determined in blood samples collected at 24, 36, 42 or 48 h post-infusion, by means of the CMIA immunoassay. The development of the population pharmacokinetic model was performed using the NONMEM((R)) software evaluating the covariates that influence in clearance (CL), intercompartmental clearance (Q), central (Vc) and peripheral (Vp) volume of distribution of MTX. RESULTS: A two-compartment open model was selected to describe concentration-time data and body surface area (BSA) was the covariate that influences on MTX total CL. The population pharmacokinetic model obtained was: CL (L/h) = 6.5 x BSA(0.62), Vc (L) = 0.36 x Weight, Q (L/h) = 0.41 and Vp (L) = 3.2. Internal validation was performed by bootstrap and visual predictive check. Predictive performance of final model was evaluated by external validation in a different group of patients. Initial MTX dosing regimens were established by stochastic simulation with final population pharmacokinetic model. CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of MTX dosing criteria in children with ALL should be adjusted based on the BSA of each patient to optimize oncological therapy and reduce the development of adverse effects.

The positive results of in vitro cytotoxicity screening on human cancer cell lines (HeLa, HOS, A2780, A2780R, G361 and MCF7 with IC50 at low micromolar levels) published previously, motivated us to perform extended preclinical in vitro experiments to reveal the mechanisms associated with the induction of cancer cell death. In addition, the in vivo antitumor activity was evaluated using the mouse lymphocytic leukaemia L1210 model. The obtained results revealed that complex 1 exceeds the antitumor effect of cisplatin (as for the extension of life-span of mice) and shows far less adverse effects as compared to reference drug cisplatin. The in vitro and ex vivo studies of cellular effects and molecular mechanisms of cell death induction showed that the mechanism of action of complex 1 is essentially different from that of cisplatin.

Methods: All orbital/ocular leukaemic specimens from 1980 to 2009 were collected from the Danish Register of Pathology. In six cases, medical records and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks were available. Three cases from the Department of Pathology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, were also included. Immunophenotypes and MYB oncoprotein expression were ascertained by immunohistochemistry. Genomic imbalances were analysed with comparative genomic hybridisation arrays and oncogene rearrangements with fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Results: Four patients had B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL) and five had acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Two patients with BCP-ALL and one with AML had primary orbital manifestations of leukaemia. Common symptoms were proptosis, displacement of the eye, and reduced eye mobility in patients with orbital leukaemias and pain, and reduced visual acuity in patients with ocular leukaemias. All patients with primary orbital lesions were alive up to 18 years after diagnosis. All but one patient with secondary ophthalmic manifestations died of relapse/disseminated disease. ETV6 and RUNX1 were rearranged in BCP-ALL, and RUNX1 and KMT2A in AML. Genomic profiling revealed quiet genomes (0-7 aberrations/case). The MYB oncoprotein was overexpressed in the majority of cases. Conclusions: Leukaemias with and without ophthalmic manifestations have similar immunophenotypes, translocations/gene fusions and copy number alterations. Awareness of the clinical spectrum of leukaemic lesions of the eye or ocular region is important to quickly establish the correct diagnosis and commence prompt treatment.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

HQP1351, an orally bioavailable multikinase BCR-ABL inhibitor, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of T315I mutant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but the potential application in imatinib-resistant GISTs carrying secondary KIT mutations has not been explored. Methods: The binding activities of HQP1351 with native or mutant KIT were first analyzed. Imatinib-sensitive GIST T1 and imatinib-resistant GIST 430 cells were employed to test the in vitro antiproliferative activity. Colony formation assay, cell migration assay and cell invasion assay were performed to evaluate the clonogenic, migration and invasion ability respectively. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis were used to detect cell apoptosis, cell cycle and signaling pathway. In vivo antitumor activity was evaluated in mouse xenograft models derived from GIST cell lines. Results: HQP1351 potently inhibited both wild-type and mutant KIT kinases. In both imatinib-resistant and sensitive GIST cell lines, HQP1351 exhibited more potent or equivalent antiproliferative activity compared with ponatinib, a third generation BCR-ABL and KIT inhibitor. HQP1351 led to more profound inhibition of cell colony formation, cell migration and invasion, cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis than ponatinib. Furthermore, HQP1351 also inhibited p-KIT, p-AKT, p-ERK1/2, and p-STAT3 to a higher extent than ponatinib. Finally, in xenograft tumor models derived from imatinib-resistant GIST cancer cell lines, HQP1351 exhibited antitumor activity superior to ponatinib. Conclusions: Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that the therapeutic application of HQP1351 in imatinib-resistant GIST patients deserves further investigation in clinical trials.",['(c) The Author(s) 2019.'],"['Liu, Xuechao', 'Wang, Guangfeng', 'Yan, Xianglei', 'Qiu, Haibo', 'Min, Ping', 'Wu, Miaoyi', 'Tang, Chunyang', 'Zhang, Fei', 'Tang, Qiuqiong', 'Zhu, Saijie', 'Qiu, Miaozhen', 'Zhuang, Wei', 'Fang, Douglas D', 'Zhou, Zhiwei', 'Yang, Dajun', 'Zhai, Yifan']","['Liu X', 'Wang G', 'Yan X', 'Qiu H', 'Min P', 'Wu M', 'Tang C', 'Zhang F', 'Tang Q', 'Zhu S', 'Qiu M', 'Zhuang W', 'Fang DD', 'Zhou Z', 'Yang D', 'Zhai Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1338-1220'],"[""1Department of Gastric Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, 510060 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6191grid.488530.2"", ""6Department of General Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, 16# Jiangsu Road, Qingdao, Shandong People's Republic of China.grid.412521.1"", ""Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou Industrial Park, Suzhou, 215100 People's Republic of China."", ""3Department of Experimental Research, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, 510060 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6191grid.488530.2"", ""1Department of Gastric Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, 510060 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6191grid.488530.2"", ""Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou Industrial Park, Suzhou, 215100 People's Republic of China."", ""Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou Industrial Park, Suzhou, 215100 People's Republic of China."", ""Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou Industrial Park, Suzhou, 215100 People's Republic of China."", ""Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou Industrial Park, Suzhou, 215100 People's Republic of China."", ""Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou Industrial Park, Suzhou, 215100 People's Republic of China."", ""Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou Industrial Park, Suzhou, 215100 People's Republic of China."", ""4Department of Medical Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, 510060 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6191grid.488530.2"", ""3Department of Experimental Research, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, 510060 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6191grid.488530.2"", ""Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou Industrial Park, Suzhou, 215100 People's Republic of China."", ""1Department of Gastric Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, 510060 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6191grid.488530.2"", ""Ascentage Pharma (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., 218 Xinghu Street, Suzhou Industrial Park, Suzhou, 215100 People's Republic of China."", ""3Department of Experimental Research, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, 510060 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1803 6191grid.488530.2"", ""HealthQuest Pharma Inc., Room 314, Building F, 3 Lanyue Road, Science City, Huangpu, Guangzhou, 510663 People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191026,England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Drug resistance', 'Gastrointestinal stromal tumor', 'Imatinib', 'Kit tyrosine kinase']",2019/11/02 06:00,2019/11/02 06:01,['2019/11/02 06:00'],"['2019/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13578-019-0351-6 [doi]', '351 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2019 Oct 26;9:88. doi: 10.1186/s13578-019-0351-6. eCollection 2019.,PMC6815454,,,,"['Competing interestsDajun Yang, Douglas D.

However, the frequencies of specific mutations are significantly different between them, which implies they might determine specific disease phenotype. For instance, there are overrepresentations of mutations in RNA splicing factors or epigenetic regulators in MDS. We provide an overview of recent advances in our understanding of the biology of MDS and related disorders. Our focus is how mutations of in splicing factors or epigenetic regulators identified in MDS patients demonstrate phenotypes in knockin/knockout mouse models. For instance, mutant Srsf2 mice could alter Srsf2's normal sequence-specific RNA binding activity. It exhibited changing in the recognition of specific exonic splicing enhancer motifs to drive recurrent missplicing of Ezh2, which reduces Ezh2 expression by promoting nonsense-mediated decay. Consistent with this, SRSF2 mutations are mutually exclusive with EZH2 loss-of-function mutations in MDS patients. We also review how gene editing technology identified unique associations between pathogenic mechanisms and targeted therapy using lenalidomide, including: (i) how haploinsufficiency of the genes located in the commonly deleted region in del(5q) MDS patients promotes MDS; (ii) how lenalidomide causes selective elimination of del(5q) MDS cells; and (iii) why del(5q) MDS patients become resistant to lenalidomide. Thus, this review describes our current understanding of the mechanistic and biological effects of mutations in spliceosome and epigenetic regulators by comparing wild-type normal to mutant function as well as a brief overview of the recent progresses in MDS biology.",,"['Nagata, Yasunobu', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Nagata Y', 'Maciejewski JP']",,"['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA. ysnagata-tky@umin.ac.jp.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA. maciejj@ccf.org.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL128425/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL118281/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL135795/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL123904/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL132071/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20191031,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['Alleles', '*Biomarkers', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Splicing']",,,2019/11/02 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/11/02 06:00'],"['2019/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0617-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0617-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Dec;33(12):2779-2794. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0617-3.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using an antibody interaction array, we measured the ability of EGFL7 to bind directly approximately 400 proteins expressed by primary AML blasts. Primary patient samples were stimulated in vitro with recombinant EGFL7 (rEGFL7) or anti-EGFL7 blocking antibody to assess alterations in downstream signaling and the ability to effect blast differentiation and survival. We treated three independent AML models with anti-EGFL7 or IgG1 control to determine whether anti-EGFL7 could prolong survival in vivo. RESULTS: We found EGFL7 significantly binds several signaling proteins important for normal and malignant hematopoiesis including NOTCH. Stimulation of AML blasts with rEGFL7 reduced NOTCH intracellular domain and NOTCH target gene expression while treatment with an anti-EGFL7 blocking antibody resulted in reactivation of NOTCH signaling, increased differentiation, and apoptosis. Competitive ligand-binding assays showed rEGFL7 inhibits DELTA-like (DLL) 4-mediated NOTCH activation while anti-EGFL7 combined with DLL4 significantly increased NOTCH activation and induced apoptosis. Using three different AML mouse models, we demonstrated that in vivo treatment with anti-EGFL7 alone results in increased survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that EGFL7 contributes to NOTCH silencing in AML by antagonizing canonical NOTCH ligand binding. Reactivation of NOTCH signaling in vivo using anti-EGFL7 results in prolonged survival of leukemic mice, supporting the use of EGFL7 as a novel therapeutic target in AML.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Bill, Marius', 'Pathmanathan, Aparna', 'Karunasiri, Malith', 'Shen, Changxian', 'Burke, Matthew H', 'Ranganathan, Parvathi', 'Papaioannou, Dimitrios', 'Zitzer, Nina C', 'Snyder, Katiri', 'LaRocco, Allison', 'Walker, Allison E', 'Brannan, Zachary J', 'Nalin, Ansel P', 'Freud, Aharon G', 'Dikov, Mikhail M', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Dorrance, Adrienne M']","['Bill M', 'Pathmanathan A', 'Karunasiri M', 'Shen C', 'Burke MH', 'Ranganathan P', 'Papaioannou D', 'Zitzer NC', 'Snyder K', 'LaRocco A', 'Walker AE', 'Brannan ZJ', 'Nalin AP', 'Freud AG', 'Dikov MM', 'Zhang X', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Garzon R', 'Dorrance AM']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9098-635X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5673-0203', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6086-1521', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5465-7591']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Center for Biostatistics, Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio. adrienne.dorrance@osumc.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['L30 CA199447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191031,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGF Family of Proteins)', '0 (EGFL7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '435M4HCP2M (parsatuzumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'EGF Family of Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Notch/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2019/11/02 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2019/11/02 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-2479 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-2479 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Feb 1;26(3):669-678. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-2479.

Several reports suggested that chemotherapy can be administered safely during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. However, the use of 5-azacytidine presents limitation due to lack of data. CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-years-old woman in the 26th week of gestation diagnosed with FLT3/ITD-mutated AML, complete remission was induced by Daunorubicin and Cytarabine, and subsequently with 5-azacytidine (75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days) with no fetal hematological or toxicity issues. Fetal ultrasound showed no aberrant morphology. Fetal size below the 5th percentile with normal umbilical artery dopplers, normal middle cerebral artery dopplers and ductus venosus doppler. Three weeks post 5-azacytidine, the team determined the most appropriate time for delivery after balancing the risks of prematurity and prevention of disease relapse since patient in hematological remission. The patient underwent elective lower segment caesarian section and had a baby girl delivered at 35 weeks of gestation weighing 1670 g without apparent anomalies. CONCLUSION: Treatment using 5-azacytadine during last trimester of pregnancy resulted in no major fetal and maternal complications. These findings concluded that 5-azacytadine during the third trimester of pregnancy seems to be safe however, potential risks of this agent should be considered.",,"['Alrajhi, Abdullah M', 'Alhazzani, Sarah A', 'Alajaji, Nouf M', 'Alnajjar, Fouad H', 'Alshehry, Nawal F', 'Tailor, Imran K']","['Alrajhi AM', 'Alhazzani SA', 'Alajaji NM', 'Alnajjar FH', 'Alshehry NF', 'Tailor IK']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9522-9446'],"['Department of Pharmacy, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. amalrajhi@kfmc.med.sa.', 'Department of Pharmacy, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Maternal Fetal Medicine Department, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pharmacy, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20191031,England,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,100967799,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Cesarean Section', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Live Birth', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Myeloid leukemia', 'Cytarabine', 'Daunorubicin', 'Leukemia""', 'pregnancy', 'third trimester', '""5-azacyitidne']",2019/11/02 06:00,2020/04/04 06:00,['2019/11/02 06:00'],"['2019/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12884-019-2522-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12884-019-2522-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2019 Oct 31;19(1):394. doi: 10.1186/s12884-019-2522-1.,PMC6822434,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to quantify EBV-miR-BHRF1-1 and p53 expression in cultured CLL. RESULTS: p53 aberration was associated with the higher expression level of EBV-miR-BHRF1-1 (p < 0.001) which was also an independent prognostic marker for overall survival (p=0.028; hazard ratio, 5.335; 95% confidence interval, 1.193 to 23.846) in 97 newly-diagnosed CLL patients after adjusted with International Prognostic Index for patients with CLL. We identified EBV-miR-BHRF1-1 as a viral miRNA regulator of p53. EBV-miR-BHRF1-1 repressed luciferase reporter activity by specific interaction with the seed region within the p53 3'- untranslated region. Discordance of p53 messenger RNA and protein expression was associated with high EBV-miR-BHRF1-1 levels in CLL patients and cell lines. EBV-miR-BHRF1- 1 inhibition upregulated p53 protein expression, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation in cell lines. EBV-miR-BHRF1-1 mimics downregulated p53 protein expression, decreased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and induced cell proliferation in cell lines. CONCLUSION: This study supported the role of EBV-miR-BHRF1-1 in p53 regulation in vitro. Our results support the potential of EBV-miR-BHRF1-1 as a therapeutic target in EBV-associated CLL with p53 gene aberration.",,"['Xu, Dan-Min', 'Kong, Yi-Lin', 'Wang, Li', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan', 'Wu,

Our previous data showed that Rituximab (Rtx) and high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) can be an effective and safe treatment option for relapsed high-risk CLL patients. Materials and Methods: We explored the efficacy and safety of a higher Rtx dose in combination with a shorter (3-day) schedule of HDMP in relapsed elderly or unfit CLL patients. Results: Twenty-five patients were included in the phase-two, single-arm trial. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 11 months (range 10-12). Median OS was 68 (range 47-89) months. Adverse events (AE) were mainly grade I-II degrees (77%) and no deaths occurred during the treatment period. Conclusions: 3-day HDMP and Rtx was associated with clinically meaningful improvement in most patients. The median PFS in 3-day and 5-day HDMP studies was similar and the toxicity of the 3-day HDMP schedule proved to be lower. The HDMP and Rtx combination can still be applied in some relapsed high-risk and elderly or unfit CLL patients if new targeted therapies are contraindicated or unavailable.

However, propagation of SSCs is required due to a limited number of SSCs in cryopreserved testicular tissue. This propagation must be done under xeno-free conditions for clinical application. SSCs were propagated from infant testicular tissue (7 mg and 10 mg) from two boys under xeno-free conditions using human platelet lysate and nutrient source. We verified SSC-like cell clusters (SSCLCs) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immune-reaction assay using the SSC markers undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1 (UTF1), ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCHL1), GDNF receptor alpha-1 (GFRalpha-1) Falpha and promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger protein (PLZF). The functionality of the propagated SSCs was investigated by pre-labelling using green fluorescent Cell Linker PKH67 and xeno-transplantation of the SSCLCs into busulfan-treated, therefore sterile, immunodeficient mice. SSC-like cell clusters (SSCLCs) appeared after 2 weeks in primary passage. The SSCLCs were SSC-like as the UTF1, UCHL1, GFRalpha1 and PLZF were all positive. After 2.5 months' culture period, a total of 13 million cells from one sample were harvested for xenotransplantation. Labelled human propagated SSCs were identified and verified in mouse seminiferous tubules at 3-6 weeks, confirming that the transplanted cells contain SSCLCs.

Is There a Role for CAR-T Cell Therapy?,,E1341 [pii] 10.3390/cells8111341 [doi],"The MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) gene, located on chromosome 11q23, is involved in chromosomal translocations in a subtype of acute leukemia, which represents approximately 10% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 2.8% of acute myeloid leukemia cases. These translocations form fusions with various genes, of which more than 80 partner genes for MLL have been identified. The most recurrent fusion partner in MLL rearrangements (MLL-r) is AF4, mapping at chromosome 4q21, accounting for approximately 36% of MLL-r leukemia and particularly prevalent in MLL-r acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases (57%). MLL-r leukemia is associated with a sudden onset, aggressive progression, and notoriously poor prognosis in comparison to non-MLL-r leukemias. Despite modern chemotherapeutic interventions and the use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations, infants, children, and adults with MLL-r leukemia generally have poor prognosis and response to these treatments. Based on the frequency of patients who relapse, do not achieve complete remission, or have brief event-free survival, there is a clear clinical need for a new effective therapy. In this review, we outline the current therapy options for MLL-r patients and the potential application of CAR-T therapy.",,"['Britten, Oliver', 'Ragusa, Denise', 'Tosi, Sabrina', 'Kamel, Yasser Mostafa']","['Britten O', 'Ragusa D', 'Tosi S', 'Kamel YM']",,"['Division of Biosciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, UK. 1630786@brunel.ac.uk.', 'Division of Biosciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, UK. denise.ragusa2@brunel.ac.uk.', 'Division of Biosciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, UK. sabrina.tosi@brunel.ac.uk.', 'ASYS Pharmaceutical Consultants-APC Inc. 2, Bedford, Nova Scotia B4A 4L2, Canada. yasser@asyspc.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191029,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR-T cell therapy', '*KMT2A', '*MLL', '*MLL-AF4', '*acute leukemia', '*chromosome translocation', '*mixed-lineage leukemia']",2019/11/02 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2019/11/02 06:00'],"['2019/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['cells8111341 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8111341 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2019 Oct 29;8(11). pii: cells8111341. doi: 10.3390/cells8111341.,PMC6912830,,,,"[""Y.M.K.'s affiliation does not involve any conflict of interest, financial"", 'relationship, nor involvement in any company developing compounds related to the', 'topic of the review.

While testing/removal and vaccination led to a decreased prevalence of FeLV, recently, this decrease has reportedly stagnated in some countries. This study aimed to prospectively determine the prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats taken to veterinary facilities in 32 European countries. FeLV viral RNA was semiquantitatively detected in saliva, using RT-qPCR as a measure of viraemia. Risk and protective factors were assessed using an online questionnaire to report geographic, demographic, husbandry, FeLV vaccination, and clinical data. The overall prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats visiting a veterinary facility, of which 10.4% were shelter and rescue cats, was 2.3% (141/6005; 95% CI: 2.0%-2.8%) with the highest prevalences in Portugal, Hungary, and Italy/Malta (5.7%-8.8%). Using multivariate analysis, seven risk factors (Southern Europe, male intact, 1-6 years of age, indoor and outdoor or outdoor-only living, living in a group of >/=5 cats, illness), and three protective factors (Northern Europe, Western Europe, pedigree cats) were identified. Using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, the origin of cats in Europe, pedigree, and access to outdoors were important predictors of FeLV status. FeLV-infected sick cats shed more viral RNA than FeLV-infected healthy cats, and they suffered more frequently from anaemia, anorexia, and gingivitis/stomatitis than uninfected sick cats. Most cats had never been FeLV-vaccinated; vaccination rates were indirectly associated with the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. In conclusion, we identified countries where FeLV was undetectable, demonstrating that the infection can be eradicated and highlighting those regions where awareness and prevention should be increased.",,"['Studer, Nadine', 'Lutz, Hans', 'Saegerman, Claude', 'Gonczi, Eniko', 'Meli, Marina L', 'Boo, Gianluca', 'Hartmann, Katrin', 'Hosie, Margaret J', 'Moestl, Karin', 'Tasker, Severine', 'Belak, Sandor', 'Lloret, Albert', 'Boucraut-Baralon, Corine', 'Egberink, Herman F', 'Pennisi, Maria-Grazia', 'Truyen, Uwe', 'Frymus, Tadeusz', 'Thiry, Etienne', 'Marsilio, Fulvio', 'Addie, Diane', 'Hochleithner, Manfred', 'Tkalec, Filip', 'Vizi, Zsuzsanna', 'Brunetti, Anna', 'Georgiev, Boyko', 'Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F', 'Tschuor, Flurin', 'Mooney, Carmel T', 'Eliasson, Catarina', 'Orro, Janne', 'Johansen, Helle', 'Juuti, Kirsi', 'Krampl, Igor', 'Kovalenko, Kaspars', 'Sengaut, Jakov', 'Sobral, Cristina', 'Borska, Petra', 'Kovarikova, Simona', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina']","['Studer N', 'Lutz H', 'Saegerman C', 'Gonczi E', 'Meli ML', 'Boo G', 'Hartmann K', 'Hosie MJ', 'Moestl K', 'Tasker S', 'Belak S', 'Lloret A', 'Boucraut-Baralon C', 'Egberink HF', 'Pennisi MG', 'Truyen U', 'Frymus T', 'Thiry E', 'Marsilio F', 'Addie D', 'Hochleithner M', 'Tkalec F', 'Vizi Z', 'Brunetti A', 'Georgiev B', 'Ludwig-Begall LF', 'Tschuor F', 'Mooney CT', 'Eliasson C', 'Orro J', 'Johansen H', 'Juuti K', 'Krampl I', 'Kovalenko K', 'Sengaut J', 'Sobral C', 'Borska P', 'Kovarikova S', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9087-7436', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3609-2416', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4313-5023', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9160-1455', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9750-4296']","['Clinical Laboratory, Department of Clinical Diagnostics and Services, and Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland. studer.nadine@bluewin.ch.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department of Clinical Diagnostics and Services, and Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.

Thus, we performed a single-center retrospective study of 119 adult patients with suspected HLH. NK cell function was determined using both flowcytometry-based NK-cytotoxicity test (NK-cytotoxicity) and NK cell activity test for interferon-gamma (NKA-IFNgamma). NK cell phenotype and serum cytokine levels were also tested. Fifty (42.0%) HLH patients showed significantly reduced NK cell function compared to 69 non-HLH patients by both NK-cytotoxicity and NKA-IFNgamma (p < 0.001 and p = 0.020, respectively). Agreement between NK-cytotoxicity and NKA-IFNgamma was 88.0% in HLH patients and 58.0% in non-HLH patients. NK-cytotoxicity and NKA-IFNgamma assays predicted HLH with sensitivities of 96.0% and 92.0%, respectively. The combination of NKA-IFNgamma and ferritin (>10,000 microg/L) was helpful for ruling out HLH, with a specificity of 94.2%.

While only PIM447 and AZD1208 have entered the clinical stages. To elucidate the interaction mechanisms of three Pim kinases with PIM447 and AZD1208, six Pim/ligand systems were studied by homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculation. The residues of the top group (Leu44, Val52, Ala65, Lys67, and Leu120 in Pim1) dominated the pan-Pim inhibitors binding to Pim kinases. The residues of the bottom group (Gln127, Asp128, and Leu174 in Pim1) were crucial for Pims/PIM447 systems, while the contributions of these residues were decreased sharply for Pims/AZD1208 systems. It is likely that the more potent pan-Pim inhibitors should be bound strongly to the top and bottom groups. The residues of the left, right and loop groups were located in the loop regions of the binding pocket, however, the flexibility of these regions triggered the protein interacting with diverse pan-Pim inhibitors efficiently. We hope this work can provide valuable information for the design of novel pan-Pim inhibitors in the future.",,"['Chen, Qingqing', 'Wang, Yan', 'Shi, Shanshan', 'Li, Kaihang', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Gao, Jian']","['Chen Q', 'Wang Y', 'Shi S', 'Li K', 'Zhang L', 'Gao J']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6723-0490'],"['Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. cq1561552131@163.com.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. wy08080148@163.com.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. s767403579@163.com.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. a18192367391@163.com.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. zhamgling1999@163.com.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China. gaojian@xzhmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['21708033/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'YY-046/Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province', '2019(Year)/Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China']",['Journal Article'],20191030,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (AZD1208)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiazolidines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Biphenyl Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiazolidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Virus Attachment']",['NOTNLM'],"['AZD1208', 'MM/GBSA calculation', 'PIM447', 'Pim kinase', 'molecular dynamics simulation']",2019/11/02 06:00,2020/03/24 06:00,['2019/11/02 06:00'],"['2019/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20215410 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20215410 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Oct 30;20(21). pii: ijms20215410. doi: 10.3390/ijms20215410.,PMC6862308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinicopathologic features of 11 cases are reported. METHODS: We collected clinical features, morphology, immunophenotype, and bone marrow (BM) involvement of myeloid sarcoma cases with CBFB-MYH11 fusion. RESULTS: Eleven of 29 total myeloid sarcoma cases were CBFB-MYH11 positive and all 11 involved abdominal sites. The blastic infiltrate was associated with eosinophils in four of 11 cases and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) nodules in four of six cases. CD34, CD117, and myeloperoxidase were expressed in eight of nine, 10 of 10, and 10 of 10 cases, respectively. Ten of 10 cases showed no BM involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our current series, combined with a literature review, identifies a compelling series of 31 (94%) of 33 cases of myeloid sarcoma with CBFB-MYH11 fusion showing a marked predilection for abdominal sites. In addition, the lack of obvious associated eosinophils, presence of pDC nodules, and lack of concurrent BM involvement suggest that ""myeloid sarcoma with CBFB-MYH11 fusion"" may represent a unique phenomenon.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

However, the role of the PML protein and PML NBs in specific mechanisms of DNA repair has not been fully characterized. Here, we have directly examined the role of PML in homologous recombination (HR) using I-SceI extrachromosomal and chromosome-based homology-directed repair (HDR) assays, and in HDR by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. We determined that PML loss can inhibit HR in an extrachromosomal HDR assay but had less of an effect on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated chromosomal HDR. Overexpression of PML also inhibited both CRISPR HDR and I-SceI-induced HDR using a chromosomal reporter, and in an isoform-specific manner. However, the impact of PML overexpression on the chromosomal HDR reporter was dependent on the intranuclear chromosomal positioning of the reporter. Specifically, HDR at the TAP1 gene locus, which is associated with PML NBs, was reduced compared with a locus not associated with a PML NB; yet, HDR could be reduced at the non-PML NB-associated locus by PML overexpression. Thus, both loss and overexpression of PML isoforms can inhibit HDR, and proximity of a chromosomal break to a PML NB can impact HDR efficiency.",,"['Attwood, Kathleen M', 'Salsman, Jayme', 'Chung, Dudley', 'Mathavarajah, Sabateeshan', 'Van Iderstine, Carter', 'Dellaire, Graham']","['Attwood KM', 'Salsman J', 'Chung D', 'Mathavarajah S', 'Van Iderstine C', 'Dellaire G']",,"['Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191031,Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', '*Homologous Recombination', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*chemistry', 'Protein Isoforms', '*Recombinational DNA Repair']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR/Cas9', '*PML', '*PML nuclear bodies', '*corps nucleaires PML', '*homologous recombination', '*homology-directed repair', '*recombinaison homologue', '*reparation dirigee par homologie']",2019/11/02 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2019/11/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1139/bcb-2019-0115 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 2020 Jun;98(3):314-326. doi: 10.1139/bcb-2019-0115.

Although no definitive association between HPgV infection and disease has been identified, previous studies have suggested an association of HPgV viremia with risk of lymphomas. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, including 1 cohort study and 14 case-control studies, assessing the association of HPgV viremia with adult lymphomas. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model, overall and by geographic region and lymphoma subtype. RESULTS: The overall OR for lymphoma was 2.85 (95% CI, 1.98-4.11), with statistically significantly elevated ORs observed in 8 of 15 studies. There was a small amount of heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 28.9%; Q = 18.27, P = .16), and the funnel plot provided no evidence for publication bias. The strongest association with lymphoma risk was observed for studies from Southern Europe (OR, 5.68 [95% CI, 1.98-16.3]), whereas weaker ORs (with 95% CIs) were observed for studies from North America (2.24 [1.76-2.85]), Northern Europe (2.90 [.45-18.7), and the Middle East (2.51 [.87-7.27]), but all of similar magnitude. Participants with HPgV viremia had statistically significantly increased risks (OR [95% CI]) for developing diffuse large B-cell (3.29 [1.63-6.62]), follicular (3.01 [1.95-4.63]), marginal zone (1.90 [1.13-3.18]), and T-cell (2.11 [1.17-3.89]) lymphomas, while the risk for Hodgkin lymphoma (3.53 [.48-25.9]) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1.45 [.45-4.66]) were increased but did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports a positive association of HPgV viremia with lymphoma risk, overall and for the major lymphoma subtypes.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

A group of HOXA genes, including HOXA7, HOXA9, and HOXA11, has been established as an independent predictor for AML prognosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between miR-181a and HOXA7, HOXA9, and HOXA11 and explore their roles in predicting prognosis in AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples of 46 untreated AML patients and 9 healthy donors were collected. Mononuclear cells were purified using density-gradient centrifugation in Ficoll, and quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect miR-181a and HOXA gene expression level. RESULTS: HOXA7, HOXA9, and HOXA11 were negatively correlated with miR-181a, and their expression levels varied among AML subtypes, karyotypes, and risk status. Higher miR-181a and lower HOXA gene expressions were significantly associated with lower risk status and better response to chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: In our study, we found miR-181a expression was negatively correlated with three HOXA genes and they were associated with AML risk status and prognosis in granulocytic AML.

We use a resource combining statewide genealogy and cancer reporting to provide unbiased risks. METHODS: Using a combined genealogy of 2.3 million Utah individuals and the Utah Cancer Registry (UCR), relative risks (RRs) for cancers of other sites were estimated in 143 Ewing sarcoma patients using a Cox proportional hazards model with matched controls; however, risks in relatives were estimated using internal cohort-specific cancer rates in first-, second-, and third-degree relatives. RESULTS: Cancers of three sites (breast, brain, complex genotype/karyotype sarcoma) were observed in excess in Ewing sarcoma patients. No Ewing sarcoma patients were identified among first-, second-, or third-degree relatives of Ewing sarcoma patients. Significantly increased risk for brain, lung/bronchus, female genital, and prostate cancer was observed in first-degree relatives. Significantly increased risks were observed in second-degree relatives for breast cancer, nonmelanoma eye cancer, malignant peripheral nerve sheath cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and translocation sarcomas. Significantly increased risks for stomach cancer, prostate cancer, and acute lymphocytic leukemia were observed in third-degree relatives.

Consequently, the demand for and development of label-free methodologies to classify cells is strong and its impact on precision medicine is relevant. Towards this end, high-throughput techniques for cell mechanical phenotyping have been proposed to get a multidimensional biophysical characterization of single cells. With this motivation, our goal here is to investigate the extent to which an unsupervised machine learning methodology, which is applied exclusively on morpho-rheological markers obtained by real-time deformability and fluorescence cytometry (RT-FDC), can address the difficult task of providing label-free discrimination of reticulocytes from mature red blood cells. We focused on this problem, since the characterization of reticulocytes (their percentage and cellular features) in the blood is vital in multiple human disease conditions, especially bone-marrow disorders such as anemia and leukemia. Our approach reports promising label-free results in the classification of reticulocytes from mature red blood cells, and it represents a step forward in the development of high-throughput morpho-rheological-based methodologies for the computational categorization of single cells.

The most common toxicity of CD19+ chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells is cytokine release syndrome, which is related to increased levels of IL-6. This study will evaluate the correlation of IL-6 levels with hyponatremia in patients receiving CD19+ CAR T-cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective analysis of adult patients who received CD19+ CAR T-cells for the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RESULTS: Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium (Na) </= 135 mEq/L, occurred in 31 (61%) patients. A change in Na > 7 mEq occurred in 32 (63%) patients, and the median lowest Na was 133 mEq/L (interquartile range (IQR): 131 - 136)). There was an inverse linear relationship between IL-6 levels and lowest Na (p = 0.001). Overall, per 10-fold increase in IL-6, Na decreased by an average of 2.68 mEq/L. CONCLUSION: Hyponatremia is common in patients who received CD19+ CAR T-cells. There is an inverse linear relationship between IL-6 levels and nadir Na (p = 0.001). Further studies will be needed to confirm a causative relationship between IL-6 levels and hyponatremia following CD19+ CAR T-cell infusion.",,"['Dixon, Brianne N', 'Daley, Ryan J', 'Buie, Larry W', 'Hsu, Meier', 'Park, Jae H', 'Brentjens, Renier J', 'Purdon, Terence J', 'Latcha, Sheron']","['Dixon BN', 'Daley RJ', 'Buie LW', 'Hsu M', 'Park JH', 'Brentjens RJ', 'Purdon TJ', 'Latcha S']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Nephrol,Clinical nephrology,0364441,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyponatremia/*blood/*etiology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*adverse effects', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sodium/*blood', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/11/02 06:00,2020/02/29 06:00,['2019/11/01 06:00'],"['2019/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['185975 [pii]', '10.5414/CN109872 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Nephrol. 2020 Jan;93(1):42-46. doi: 10.5414/CN109872.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, 18e was a potent JAK2 inhibitor with 37-fold and 56-fold selectivity over JAK1 and JAK3, respectively, and possessed an excellent selectivity profile over the other 100 representative kinases. In a series of cytokine-stimulated cell-based assays, 18e exhibited a higher JAK2 selectivity over other JAK isoforms. The oral administration of 60 mg/kg of 18e could significantly inhibit tumor growth, with a tumor growth inhibition rate of 93 and 85% in MV4-11 and SET-2 xenograft models, respectively. Additionally, 18e showed an excellent bioavailability (F = 58%), a suitable half-life time (T1/2 = 4.1 h), a satisfactory metabolic stability, and a weak CYP3A4 inhibitory activity, suggesting that 18e might be a potential drug candidate for JAK2-driven myeloproliferative neoplasms and FLT3-internal tandem duplication-driven acute myelogenous leukemia.",,"['Yang, Tao', 'Hu, Mengshi', 'Qi, Wenyan', 'Yang, Zhuang', 'Tang, Minghai', 'He, Jun', 'Chen, Yong', 'Bai, Peng', 'Yuan, Xue', 'Zhang, Chufeng', 'Liu, Kongjun', 'Lu, Yulin', 'Xiang, Mingli', 'Chen, Lijuan']","['Yang T', 'Hu M', 'Qi W', 'Yang Z', 'Tang M', 'He J', 'Chen Y', 'Bai P', 'Yuan X', 'Zhang C', 'Liu K', 'Lu Y', 'Xiang M', 'Chen L']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8076-163X'],"['State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics , West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191108,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Biological Availability', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism']",,,2019/11/02 06:00,2020/07/15 06:00,['2019/11/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01348 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2019 Nov 27;62(22):10305-10320. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01348.

Recent evidence has suggested that P/R fusion protein degradation by arsenic occurs through two steps, namely, rapid solubility change/shift of the P/R fusion protein following arsenic treatment (i.e., transfer of P/R protein from the soluble fraction to the insoluble pellet fraction), and subsequent degradation of these insoluble proteins. However, there is little information regarding the reversibility of arsenic induced P/R fusion protein solubility change as well as protein degradation in the insoluble fraction after removing arsenic. In this study, we used APL cell line NB4 or P/R and PML over-expressed 293T cells as well as HeLa cells to reveal the solubility change of P/R and PML by arsenic exposure, and further determined the fate of these insoluble proteins after the removal of arsenic. Here, for the first time, we found that arsenic induced P/R or PML protein solubility change is an irreversible process. Once arsenic induces a P/R or PML protein solubility change, these insoluble proteins could be degraded by the proteasomal pathway even without continuous arsenic treatment. However, PML and P/R proteins can be newly synthesized after the removal of arsenic, suggesting that great caution should be taken in the clinical therapy of APL patients before ending arsenic treatment.",,"['Maimaitiyiming, Yasen', 'Shao, Yi Ming', 'Chen, Wei Zhong', 'Jiang, Yu', 'Bu, Na', 'Ma, Li Ya', 'Wang, Qian Qian', 'Lu, Xiao Yang', 'Naranmandura, Hua']","['Maimaitiyiming Y', 'Shao YM', 'Chen WZ', 'Jiang Y', 'Bu N', 'Ma LY', 'Wang QQ', 'Lu XY', 'Naranmandura H']",,"['Department of Hematology of First Affiliated Hospital, and Department of Pharmacology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310058, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Solubility/drug effects']",,,2019/11/02 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/11/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c9mt00220k [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2019 Dec 11;11(12):2089-2096. doi: 10.1039/c9mt00220k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to identify prognostic factors for CN-AML risk stratification. In this study, using the TCGA CN-AML dataset, we found that the scavenger receptor stabilin-1 (STAB1) is a prognostic factor for poor outcomes and validated it in three other independent CN-AML datasets. The high STAB1 expression (STAB1(high)) group had shorter event-free survival compared with the low STAB1 expression (STAB1(low)) group in both the TCGA dataset (n = 79; p = 0.0478) and GEO: GSE6891 dataset (n = 187; p = 0.0354). Differential expression analysis between the STAB1(high) and STAB1(low) groups revealed that upregulated genes in the STAB1(high) group were enriched in pathways related to cell adhesion and migration and immune responses. We confirmed that STAB1 suppression inhibits cell growth in KG1a and NB4 leukemia cells. Expression correlation analyses between STAB1 and cancer drug targets suggested that patients in the STAB1(low) group are more sensitive to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, and we confirmed it in cell lines.

Several studies have identified various prognostic biomarkers in CLL. In this study, we investigated the potential value of an internal fragment of the tRNAs bearing the Glycine anticodon CCC (i-tRF-GlyCCC), which is a small non-coding RNA, as a prognostic and screening biomarker in CLL. For this purpose, blood samples were collected from 90 CLL patients and 43 non-leukemic blood donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated, total RNA was extracted and in-vitro polyadenylated, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using an oligo-dT-adaptor primer. A real-time quantitative PCR assay was developed and applied for the quantification of i-tRF-GlyCCC in our samples. The biostatistical analysis revealed that i-tRF-GlyCCC levels are significantly lower in PBMCs of CLL patients, compared to PBMCs of non-leukemic controls, and that i-tRF-GlyCCC could be considered as a screening biomarker. Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) analysis revealed reduced OS for CLL patients with positive i-tRF-GlyCCC expression (P=0.001). Multivariate Cox regression confirmed its independent unfavorable prognostic power with regard to OS. In conclusion, i-tRF-GlyCCC may constitute a promising molecular biomarker in CLL, for screening and prognostic purposes.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, reformation of PML-NBs in APL by arsenic is considered as one of the important step for APL treatment. Leptomycin B (LMB), a nuclear export inhibitor, is commonly used to inhibit the proteins exporting from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the present study, we found that LMB could induce the reformation of PML-NBs in leukemia NB4 cells as well as in APL blast cells from the patients, implying that nuclear shuttle proteins might be involved in the reformation of PML-NBs. Herein, we further found that LMB totally lost the ability to induce PML-NBs reformation when the endogenous PML gene was knocked out, indicating that endogenous PML protein is probably involved in the reformation of PML-NBs. More interestingly, among all PML isoforms (i.e., seven isoforms), reformation of PML-NBs was only observed when co-transfection of PML-RARalpha with PML-I after LMB treatment. Similarly, deletion of nuclear export signal (NES) of PML-I could also reform PML-NBs, suggesting that the protein level of endogenous PML-I in nucleus is important for the reformation of PML-NBs that interfered by PML-RARalpha fusion protein. Additionally, LMB has synergistic effect with iAs(III) on enhancing PML-RARalpha fusion protein degradation, and it might provide new insight into APL treatment at clinical level in the near future.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Its core protein is cleaved at a region close to the N-terminal end of CSbeta domain by several members of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) family, i.e., ADAMTS-1, 4, 5, 9, 15, and 20. Here, using a CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated knock-in mice (V1R), which express an ADAMTS cleavage-resistant versican. Some V1R homozygote mice, termed R/R, exhibit syndactyly and organ hemorrhage. In wound healing experiments, R/R wound shows accumulation of versican and activated TGFbeta-signaling in the early stage, leading to faster healing than wild type wound. Immunostaining for Ki67, CD31, smooth muscle alpha-actin, periostin demonstrates higher levels of overall cell proliferation and an increased number of endothelial cells and myofibroblasts. Immunostaining for CD11b and qRT-PCR for macrophage markers revealed increased levels of inflammatory cell infiltration, especially those of M1 macrophages. Cultured R/R dermal fibroblasts revealed increased deposition of versican, type I and III collagens, and hyaluronan, and upregulation of Smad2/3 signaling.

METHODS: This study enrolled 249 Chinese AML patients. The exons 14 and 15 of FLT3 gene were amplified by genomic polymerase chain reaction. GeneScan and single nucleotide sequencing were also performed. Participants were grouped into high- and low-ratio FLT3-ITD MR (FLT3-ITD MR(high) and FLT3-ITD MR(low)) applying the median of FLT3-ITD MR as the cut-off ratio, and patients without FLT3-ITD were grouped as FLT3-wild type (wt). Duration of complete remission (CR), relapsed remission and overall survival (OS) were examined. RESULTS: FLT3-ITD was detected in 58 patients. The medians of FLT3-ITD MR were 0.31 and 0.29 for all AML and non-M3 patients, respectively. For all patients, FLT3-ITD MR(high) group had the lowest CR rate among these 3 groups (p<0.001). The FLT3-wt group, FLT3-ITD MR(low) and FLT3-ITD MR(high) group had the median OS of 36.00months (range: 2.00-92.00months), 12.00months (range: 1.00-78.00months) and 14.00months (range: 0.00-79.00months), respectively. Subjects in FLT3-ITD MR(high) group had 2.675 times (95% CI: 1.726-4.146; p<0.001) and 1.879 times (95% CI: 1.061-3.328; p=0.031) higher death risk than those in FLT3-wt group and FLT3-ITD MR(low) group, respectively. For non-M3 patients, the median OS was 35.00months (range: 2.00-92.00months), 9.5months (range: 1.00-74.00months) and 10.00months (range: 1.00-38.00months) in the FLT3-wt group, FLT3-ITD MR(low) group and FLT3-ITD MR(high) group, respectively. Non-M3 patients in FLT3-ITD MR(high) group had 3.301 times (95% CI: 1.423-7.661; p=0.005) higher death risk than those in FLT3-wt group. CONCLUSION: The present study found that FLT3-ITD MR is closely related to CR and OS in AML patients. Furthermore, FLT3-ITD MR may serve as an independent prognostic factor for OS in non-M3 AML patients. Classifying risk grades based on FLT3-ITD MR is crucial for individualized treatment and prognostic evaluation.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to explore if routine blood parameters help to anticipate outcomes following IA. METHODS: Post hoc secondary analysis of two multicenter randomized trials was performed. The Global Comparative Aspergillosis Study (GCA, n = 123) and the Combination Antifungal Study (CAS, n = 251) constituted the discovery and validation cohorts respectively. The outcome measures were response to treatment and survival to 12 weeks. Interval platelet, galactomannan index (GMI) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels prior and during antifungal treatment were analysed using logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. RESULTS: The 12-week survival was 70.7% and 63.7% for the GCA and CAS cohorts respectively. In the GCA cohort, every 10 x 10(9)/L platelet count increase at week 2 and 4 improved 12-week survival odds by 6-18% (odds ratio (OR) 1.06-1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.33). Survival odds also improved 13% with every 10 mg/dL CRP drop at week 1 and 2 (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.97). In the CAS cohort, week 2 platelet count was also associated with 12-week survival with 10% improved odds for every 10 x 10(9)/L platelet increase (OR, 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.15). A GMI drop of 0.1 unit was additionally found to increase the odds of treatment response by 3% at the baseline of week 0 (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95-0.99). Week 2 platelet and CRP levels performed better than GMI on ROC analyses for survival (area under ROC curve 0.76, 0.87 and 0.67 respectively). A baseline platelet count higher than 30 x 10(9)/L clearly identified patients with >75% survival probability. CONCLUSIONS: Higher serial platelets were associated with overall survival while GMI trends were linked to IA treatment response. Routine and simple laboratory indices may aid follow-up of response in IA patients.","['Copyright (c) 2019 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious', 'Diseases.

In this registry study, we analyzed clinical outcomes of 390 adult patients with CML who underwent transplantation between 2007 and 2014 and received maintenance TKI following HCT (n=89) compared with no TKI maintenance (n=301), as reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. All patients received TKI therapy before HCT. The majority of patients had a disease status of first chronic phase at HCT (n=240; 62%). The study was conducted as a landmark analysis, excluding patients who died, relapsed, had chronic graft-versus-host disease, or were censored before day +100 following HCT. Of the 89 patients who received TKI maintenance, 77 (87%) received a single TKI and the other 12 (13%) received multiple sequential TKIs. The most common TKIs used for maintenance were dasatinib (n=50), imatinib (n=27), and nilotinib (n=27). As measured from day +100, the adjusted estimates for 5-year relapse (maintenance, 35% versus no maintenance, 26%; P=.11), leukemia-free survival (maintenance, 42% versus no maintenance, 44%; P=.65), or overall survival (maintenance, 61% versus no maintenance, 57%; P=.61) did not differ significantly between patients receiving TKI maintenance or no maintenance. These results remained unchanged in multivariate analysis and were not modified by disease status before transplantation. In conclusion, our data from this day +100 landmark analysis do not demonstrate a significant impact of maintenance TKI therapy on clinical outcomes. The optimal approach to TKI administration in the post-transplantation setting in patients with CML remains undetermined.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The proof of target engagement and an on-target mechanism validation are critical for evaluating drug development potential. To evaluate target engagement of BH3 mimetics in cells, we measured binding potency of ABT-199, A-1210477 and ABT-737 to Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins by using a dose-response cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), similar affinity rank-order and selectivity were obtained in comparison with in vitro binding assays. A proof of direct target engagement for S1 and AT-101 was obtained through CETSA assay. By using a previously established mathematical model, we simulated individual death response of various cancer cell lines to ABT-199, S1 or AT-101 in comparison with experimental data. A positive correlation between model predictions and experimental data for ABT-199 and S1 showed that dual Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 target engagement underlies their anticancer efficacy.

Although survival rates approach up to 90% in children, investigation of leukaemic infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) is essential due to the presence of ongoing fatal complications. Recent in vitro studies mostly employed models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), as endothelial cells of the microvasculature represent the largest surface between the blood stream and the brain parenchyma. However, crossing the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) within the choroid plexus (CP) has been shown to be a general capability of leukaemic blasts. Hence, in vitro models of the BCSFB to study leukaemic transmigration may be of major importance to understand the development of CNS leukaemia. This review will summarise available in vitro models of the BCSFB employed to study the cellular interactions with leukaemic blasts during cancer cell transmigration into the brain compartment across primary or immortal/immortalised BCSFB cells.

The absolute quantification with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) could reduce the inherent variability of qPCR. We established a duplex ddPCR assay using the Europe against Cancer (EAC) primer/probe system for breakpoint cluster region protein-tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 (BCR-ABL1) and ABL1 and compared the results with qPCR. cDNA samples (n = 230) from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia were analyzed using both procedures. A second, commercially developed ddPCR assay for BCR-ABL1 was also evaluated. ABL1 and BCR-ABL1 transcript levels were similar with all assays, but the proportion of deep molecular responses was lower with ddPCR than with qPCR. The EAC ddPCR assay had a false-positive rate of 4% using a cutoff of three BCR-ABL1 copies per duplicate, compared with 2% without cutoff for the commercial ddPCR. The detection rate for molecular response 4.5 was 100, and a shift toward more minimal residual disease was seen in patient samples. In conclusion, using the EAC protocol for BCR-ABL1 quantification with ddPCR is feasible and shows low intra-assay and interassay variation but requires a cutoff that reduces sensitivity. The commercial ddPCR assay is highly sensitive and specific for BCR-ABL1. The use of either ddPCR assay resulted in a shift to lower molecular response classes compared with qPCR aligned to international scale.","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

Treg accumulation in the leukemic hematopoietic microenvironment (LHME) has adverse impacts on patient outcomes. The mechanism and effective methods of disrupting Treg accumulation in the LHME have not been well established. Here, we studied the distribution and characteristics of Tregs in the LHME, investigated the effects of Treg ablation on leukemia progression, explored the mechanisms leading to Treg accumulation, and studied whether blocking Treg migration to the LHME delayed leukemia progression in MLL-AF9-induced mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models using wildtype (WT) and Foxp3(DTR/GFP) mice. Increased accumulation of more activated Tregs was detected in the LHME. Inducible Treg ablation prolonged the survival of AML mice by promoting the antileukemic effects of CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, both local expansion and migration accounted for Treg accumulation in the LHME. Moreover, blocking the CCL3-CCR1/CCR5 and CXCL12-CXCR4 axes inhibited Treg accumulation in the LHME and delayed leukemia progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a multisite companion study (CALGB 361006) to CALGB 11001, a phase 2 trial of adults >/=60years old with newly diagnosed FLT3- mutated AML, testing the efficacy of adding sorafenib to intensive chemotherapy. On 361006, a GA was administered prior to induction and prior to post-remission therapy. The GA is divided into items requiring administration by a health care professional (HCP) and patient self-administered questionnaires. Feasibility outcomes were recruitment rate, time to GA completion, difficulty with GA administration, percent of patients requiring assistance, and satisfaction. Change in GA measures pre- and post-induction were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test and McNemar's tests. RESULTS: The recruitment rate was 80% (N=43, median age 68years). Median completion time of the GA was 30min; (10 and 21min for HCP and patients, respectively). HCP reported no difficulty completing assessments (100%). Most patients completed questionnaires without assistance (77%), and were satisfied with the length (89%). Self-reported physical function, mental health, social activity and nutritional parameters worsened after induction.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in BOS after allo-HSCT. METHODS: This multicenter prospective cohort study enrolled 81 allo-HSCT recipients whose BOS were diagnosed within 6 months. The choice of prednisone and azithromycin combined with or without MSCs was based on patient preferences (MSC n=49, non-MSC n=32). The primary endpoint was response rate at 3 months, defined as the proportion of patients achieving FEV1 improvement or steroid sparing. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02543073). FINDINGS: Response rate was 35/49 patients (71%, 95% CI 59 to 84%) and 14/32 (44%, 27 to 61%) in MSC and non-MSC group, respectively (p=0.013). The addition of MSCs was associated with a better difference for change in FEV1 rate of decline, compared to non-MSC group (53mL/months, 2 to 103; p=0.040). The 3-year overall survival post-diagnosis was 70.6% (55.9 to 85.3%) and 58.2% (36.1 to 78.5%) in MSC and non-MSC group, respectively (p=0.21). Clinical improvement was accompanied by a significant increase of interleukin (IL)-10-producing CD5+B cells. There was no statistical difference in the rates of infections and leukemia relapse between the two groups. MSCs were well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: MSCs offer an effective and safe therapeutic option for BOS after allo-HSCT. Our study strengthens evidence for clinical use of MSC therapy in BOS. These data also provide novel insight into potential biological mechanisms of MSC treatment and support further investigation in larger randomized controlled trials.

Clinical features, gene mutations, and survival over 18 years were analyzed in MPN patients. One hundred thirty-eight MPN patients were subcategorized according to MPN subtypes: essential thrombocythemia (ET, n = 41), polycythemia vera (PV, n = 56), primary myelofibrosis (PMF, n = 10), and MPN unclassified (MPN-U, n = 31). Patient characteristics included clinical parameters, overall survival (OS), and mutational status of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR), and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) genes. We compared hematologic and clinical features of JAK2V617F-ET vs. CALR-mutated ET vs. JAK2V617F-PV patients. JAK2V617F-patients had higher values of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit compared to CALR-mutated patients (p < 0.05). The mutant allele burden in JAK2V617F-PV and JAK2V617F-ET patients directly correlated with erythrocyte, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values, but it inversely correlated with platelet count. Thus, mutant allele burden was an indicator of the clinical phenotype in JAK2V617F-MPN patients. OS was not affected by the mutational status.

Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) require repeated lumbar punctures with direct instillation of intrathecal chemotherapy, usually the anti-folate agent methotrexate, during their treatment. These procedures are frequently performed under anesthesia. Concerns have been intermittently raised about a drug interaction between methotrexate and N2 O that may potentiate the undesirable side effects of methotrexate, including neurotoxicity. However, the clinical evidence consists mainly of isolated case reports leading to a lack of consensus among pediatric anesthetists about the relative risk benefits of using N2 O in children with ALL. In this article, we review the biochemical basis and scientific observations that suggest a significant interaction between N2 O and methotrexate due to their dual inhibition of the key enzyme methionine synthase. The possible role of this interaction in potentiating neurotoxicity in children with cancer is discussed, and arguments and counterarguments about the clinical significance of this largely theoretical relationship are explored. Following comprehensive review of all the available data, we make the case for the circumstantial evidence being sufficiently compelling to prompt a review of practice by pediatric anesthetists and call for a precautionary approach by avoiding the use of N2 O in children receiving concurrent methotrexate.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Forster, Victoria J', 'Bell, Graham', 'Halsey, Christina']","['Forster VJ', 'Bell G', 'Halsey C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9103-8551', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1149-0888', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5449-5246']","['The Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumour Research Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Anaesthetics, Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191119,France,Paediatr Anaesth,Paediatric anaesthesia,9206575,"['0 (Anesthetics)', 'EC 2.1.1.13 (5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase)', 'K50XQU1029 (Nitrous Oxide)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Anesthetics/pharmacology', 'Child', '*Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes', 'Nitrous Oxide/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Vitamin B 12']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic', '*drug interactions', '*folic acid antagonists', '*leukemia', '*neurotoxicity syndromes', '*vitamin B12']",2019/11/02 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2019/11/01 06:00'],"['2019/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/pan.13760 [doi]'],ppublish,Paediatr Anaesth. 2020 Jan;30(1):9-16. doi: 10.1111/pan.13760.

Prognosis for relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML patients remains discouraging, with the main curative option still relying on hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for those who are eligible. Beyond morphological bone marrow and peripheral blood assessment, evaluation of patient performance status and comorbidities, as well as genetic/molecular characterization, is crucial to make an accurate diagnosis and prognosis, which will be useful to select the most appropriate treatment. Emerging strategies are mainly focusing on the development of immune- and molecular-based approaches. Novel targeted therapies are generally well tolerated, potentially allowing them to be administered alone or in combination with classical chemotherapy agents. Enrolment in clinical trials should be considered first option for R/R AML patients, either as a bridge to HSCT or to benefit from novel therapies that eventually may prolong survival and improve quality of life.

Furthermore, treatment of mice bearing breast-cancer xenograft with cirmtuzumab inhibited cortactin phosphorylation in vivo and impaired metastatic development. We established that the proline at 841 of ROR1 was required for it to recruit cortactin and ARHGEF1, activate RhoA, and enhance breast-cancer-cell migration in vitro or development of metastases in vivo.

N-Glycan chains are synthesized by the sequential action of glycosyl transferases in the Golgi apparatus. It is an overwhelming task to discover drug-like inhibitors of glycosyl transferases that block the synthesis of specific branching processes in cancer cells, killing tumor cells selectively. It has long been known that N-glycan biosynthesis can be inhibited by disruption of the first committed enzyme, dolichyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1). Selective DPAGT1 inhibitors have the promising therapeutic potential for certain solid cancers that require increased branching of N-linked glycans in their growth progressions. Recently, we discovered that an anti-Clostridium difficile molecule, aminouridyl phenoxypiperidinbenzyl butanamide (APPB) showed DPAGT1 inhibitory activity with the IC50 value of 0.25 muM. It was confirmed that APPB inhibits N-glycosylation of beta-catenin at 2.5 nM concentration. A sharp difference between APPB and tunicamycin was that the hemolytic activity of APPB is significantly attenuated (IC50 > 200 muM RBC). Water solubility of APPB is >350-times greater than that of tunicamycin (78.8 mg/mL for APPB, <0.2 mg/mL for tunicamycin). A novel DPAGT1 inhibitor, APPB selectively inhibits growth of the solid tumors (e.g. KB, LoVo, SK-OV-3, MDA-MB-432S, HCT116, Panc-1, and AsPC-1) at low muM concentrations, but does not inhibit growth of a leukemia cell (L1210) and the healthy cells (Vero and HPNE) at these concentrations. In vitro metabolic stability using rat liver microsomes indicated that a half-life (t 1/2) of APPB is sufficiently long (>60 min) for in vivo studies (PK/PD, safety profiles, and in vivo efficacy) using animal models. We have refined all steps in the previously reported synthesis for APPB for larger-scale. This article summarizes protocols of gram-scale synthesis of APPB and its physicochemical data, and a convenient DPAGT1 assay. *Remember that the abstract is what readers see first in electronic abstracting & indexing services.*This is the advertisement of your article.

Diverse, often confounded co-variates interact to influence one's recommendation. Briefly, the decision metric can be viewed in three spheres: (1) subject-; (2) transplant-; and (3) disease-related co-variates. Subject-related co-variates include items such as age and comorbidities. Transplant-related co-variates include items such as donor-types, graft source, proposed conditioning and pre- and post-transplant immune suppression.But what of disease-related variables? Previously haematologists relied on co-variates such as WBC at diagnosis, chemotherapy cycles to achieve first remission, cytogenetics and most recently, mutation topography. However, these co-variates have largely been replaced by results of measurable residual disease (MRD)-testing. Many chemotherapy-only and transplant studies report strong correlations between results of MRD-testing on therapy outcomes such as cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), leukemia-free survival (LFS) or survival. (CIR makes biological sense in a transplant context whereas LFS and survival do not give competing causes of death such as transplant-related mortality (TRM), graft-versus-host disease and interstitial pneumonia unrelated to relapse probability).This raises the question of how useful results are of MRD-testing in predicting CIR after transplants. Elsewhere we discussed accuracy and precision of MRD-testing in predicting outcomes of therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (Estey E, Gale RP. Leukemia 31:1255-1258, 2017; Hourigan CS, Gale RP, Gormley NJ, Ossenkoppele GJ, Walter RB. Leukemia 31:1482-1490, 2017). Briefly put, not terribly good. Although results of MRD-testing are often the most powerful predictor of CIR in multivariable analyses, the C-statistic (a measure of prediction accuracy) is often only about 0.75. This is much better than flipping a fair coin but far from ideal.In the typescript which follows, Othus and colleagues discuss statistical issues underlying MRD-testing in the context of haematopoietic cell transplants. We hope readers, especially haematologists who often need to make transplant recommendations to people with acute leukemia in first remission, will read it carefully and critically. The bottom line is MRD-test data are useful but considerable uncertainty is unavoidable with substantial false-positive and -negative rates. We need to acknowledge this uncertainty to ourselves and to the people we counsel. The authors quote Voltaire who said: Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is an absurd one. Sadly so, but we do the best we can.

Leukemogenesis can be driven up by a slight change in the expression or function of certain transcription factors. CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Alpha (CEBPA) is a transcription factor with role in cell cycle regulation, granulocytic differentiation and more. Some studies suggest its oncogenic function. The potential role of CEBPA as an oncogene in ALL development has not been completely elucidated so far. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate mRNA level of CEBPA gene in 60 adult patients diagnosed with ALL. Quantitative analysis was performed by qPCR reaction. Analysis revealed that men tended to have higher and more variable CEBPA expression levels (P = 0.032). No associations for other parameters (ALL subtype, age, leukocytosis, blast percentage, Philadelphia chromosome presence, CD10 marker presence) were found. When comparing the results of CEBPA expression with patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia, ALL cases showed statistically significant lower levels of CEBPA (P < 0.0000). It may seem that CEBPA expression level itself has potentially no effect on arising and progression of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, although it is a matter that needs further investigation.",,"['Szmajda, Dagmara', 'Krygier, Adrian', 'Jamroziak, Krzysztof', 'Zebrowska-Nawrocka, Marta', 'Balcerczak, Ewa']","['Szmajda D', 'Krygier A', 'Jamroziak K', 'Zebrowska-Nawrocka M', 'Balcerczak E']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9524-6032', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1525-1577', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7207-8534', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7478-7860', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5257-2914']","['Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland. dagmara.szmajda@umed.lodz.pl.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191030,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2019/11/02 06:00,2020/11/05 06:00,['2019/11/01 06:00'],"['2019/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-52104-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-52104-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Oct 30;9(1):15640. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-52104-w.,PMC6821811,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen and found that inactivation of genes involved in mitochondrial translation restored sensitivity to venetoclax in resistant AML cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis with antibiotics that target the ribosome, including tedizolid and doxycycline, effectively overcame venetoclax resistance. Mechanistic studies showed that both tedizolid and venetoclax suppressed mitochondrial respiration, with the latter demonstrating inhibitory activity against complex I [nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide plus hydrogen (NADH) dehydrogenase] of the electron transport chain (ETC). The drugs cooperated to activate a heightened integrated stress response (ISR), which, in turn, suppressed glycolytic capacity, resulting in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion and subsequent cell death. Combination treatment with tedizolid and venetoclax was superior to either agent alone in reducing leukemic burden in mice engrafted with treatment-resistant human AML. The addition of tedizolid to azacitidine and venetoclax further enhanced the killing of resistant AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that inhibition of mitochondrial translation is an effective approach to overcoming venetoclax resistance and provide a rationale for combining tedizolid, azacitidine, and venetoclax as a triplet therapy for AML.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

The study has been updated at the 13-year median follow up. As of February 2017, 88 (66%) patients were alive, with overall survival of 66.4% at 13 years, without a significant difference between R-HDS (64.5%) and CHOP-R (68.5%). To date, 46 patients have died, mainly because of disease progression (47.8% of all deaths), secondary malignancies (3 solid tumor, 9 myelodysplasia/acute leukemia; 26.1% of all deaths), and other toxicities (21.7% of all deaths). Complete remission was documented in 98 (73.1%) patients and associated with overall survival, with 13-year estimates of 77.0% and 36.8% for complete remission versus no-complete remission, respectively. Molecular remission was documented in 39 (65%) out of 60 evaluable patients and associated with improved survival. In multivariate analysis, complete remission achievement had the strongest effect on survival (P<0.001), along with younger age (P=0.002) and female sex (P=0.013). Overall, 50 patients (37.3%) survived with no disease recurrence (18 CHOP-R, 32 R-HDS). This follow up is the longest reported on follicular lymphoma treated upfront with rituximab-chemotherapy and demonstrates an unprecedented improvement in survival compared to the pre-rituximab era, regardless of the use of intensified or conventional treatment. Complete remission was the most important factor for prolonged survival and a high proportion of patients had prolonged survival in their first remission, raising the issue of curability in follicular lymphoma.

Methods: The clinical data of 28 CML patients with CCA/Ph(-) treated in Henan Cancer Hospital from July 2014 to December 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. The univariate analysis was carried out by Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was done by Cox proportional risk model. Results: A total of 28 CCA/Ph(-)patients were recruited including 17 males and 11 females with median age of 42.5 years old. The most common CCA/Ph(-)were trisomy 8 (60.7%), monosomy 7 (14.3%). 64.3% CCA/Ph(-)were transient and 35.7% recurrent (more than 2 times). Cytopenia in two or three lineages of peripheral blood was seen in 42.9% patients. As to the efficacy, 89.3% patients achieved major cytogenetic response (MCyR), 25% with major molecular response (MMR). The median follow-up time was 26.5 months. Treatment failure (TF) of TKI occurred in 32.1% patients with median duration of response 8 (1-41) months. Univariate analysis showed that TF rate was significantly correlated with the frequency of CCA/Ph(-)and cytopenia (all P<0.05). The MMR rate was also significantly correlated with cytopenia (P<0.05). Cytopenia of two lineages or pancytopenia was an independent risk factor related to MMR rate (RR=3.868, 95%CI 1.216-12.298, P=0.022) . Conclusions: Cytopenia in CCA/Ph(-)appears to be an independent risk factor of MMR in CML patients with TKI treatment. The recurrent CCA/Ph(-)may link to higher treatment failure rate.

Methods: Standard cytological and immune methods including next generation sequencing (NGS) were used for risk stratification. Complete remission (CR) rate, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by multivariate Logistic and Cox regression models in a total of 206 adults (aged 16-65 years) with CBF-AML, including 152 AML patients with t(8;21) and 54 with inv(16). Results: The CR rate of inv(16) patients after first course was 54/54(100%), significantly higher than that of t(8;21) patients [127/147(86.4%), P=0.005]. The fusion transcript level and KIT mutation were independent factors related to CR rate in t(8;21) patients (P=0.044 and 0.027; respectively). DFS and OS in inv(16) patients tended to be more superior than that in t(8;21) patients (P=0.066 for DFS; P=0.306 for OS; respectively). Multivariate Cox identified negative expression of CD(19) and female gender the independent predictors of inferior DFS in t(8;21) patients (P=0.000 for CD(19); P=0.006 for sex; respectively). Analysis of combining CD(19) with gender indicated that females/CD(1)(9-)subpopulation had significantly poor DFS than did males/CD(19)(+) ones (Bonferroni-P<0.000 01). The number of mutations in each patient, FLT3-ITD and additional karyotype abnormalities did not affect CR rate and DFS (all P>0.05). Conclusions: Patients with inv(16) have better induction response than those with t(8;21). High level of fusion transcripts and positive KIT mutation are associated with low CR rate in t(8;21) patients.

Gilteritinib is an oral, potent, selective FLT3 inhibitor with single-agent activity in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML. METHODS: In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adults with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML in a 2:1 ratio to receive either gilteritinib (at a dose of 120 mg per day) or salvage chemotherapy. The two primary end points were overall survival and the percentage of patients who had complete remission with full or partial hematologic recovery. Secondary end points included event-free survival (freedom from treatment failure [i.e., relapse or lack of remission] or death) and the percentage of patients who had complete remission. RESULTS: Of 371 eligible patients, 247 were randomly assigned to the gilteritinib group and 124 to the salvage chemotherapy group. The median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than that in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). The median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The percentage of patients who had complete remission with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). In an analysis that was adjusted for therapy duration, adverse events of grade 3 or higher and serious adverse events occurred less frequently in the gilteritinib group than in the chemotherapy group; the most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher in the gilteritinib group were febrile neutropenia (45.9%), anemia (40.7%), and thrombocytopenia (22.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Gilteritinib resulted in significantly longer survival and higher percentages of patients with remission than salvage chemotherapy among patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML.

METHODS: Overall, 148 patients with HCL (123 male, 25 female; mean age: 59.8 years; range: 25-81 years) had multiparameter flow cytometry performed using CD19, CD20, CD22, CD11c, CD25, CD103, CD123, surface light chains, CD5, and CD23. In parallel, bone marrow IHC was done using PAX5/CD103 and PAX5/tartrate-resistant alkaline phosphatase (TRAP) dual IHC stains. RESULTS: Overall sensitivity of dual IHC stains was 81.4%, positive predictive value was 100%, and negative predictive value was 81.7%. All IHC-positive cases concurred with flow cytometry data, even when HCL burden was extremely low in the flow cytometry specimens (as low as 0.02% of all lymphoid cells). CONCLUSIONS: Dual IHC stain is a sensitive tool in detecting HCL, even in cases with minimal disease involvement.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.']","['Gupta, Gaurav K', 'Sun, Xiaoping', 'Yuan, Constance M', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Kreitman, Robert J', 'Maric, Irina']","['Gupta GK', 'Sun X', 'Yuan CM', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Maric I']",,"['Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Flow Cytometry Unit, Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'Flow Cytometry Unit, Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow', '*Flow cytometry', '*Hairy cell leukemia', '*Immunohistochemistry']",2019/10/31 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/10/31 06:00'],"['2019/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['5607847 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqz171 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2020 Feb 8;153(3):322-327. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqz171.,PMC7315001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When CTLA-4 binds to CD80 or CD86, immunoinhibitory signals are transmitted to retain a homeostasis of the immune response. Recent studies have reported that CTLA-4 is upregulated in chronic infections and malignant neoplasms, contributing to host immune dysfunction. On the other hand, the blockade of CTLA-4 and CD80 or CD86 binding by antibody restores the immune response against these diseases. In a previous report, we indicated that the expression of CTLA-4 was closely associated with disease progression in cattle infected with the bovine leukemia virus (BLV). In this study, we established an anti-bovine CTLA-4 antibody to confirm its immune enhancing effect. RESULTS: Bovine CTLA-4-Ig binds to bovine CD80 and CD86 expressing cells. Additionally, CD80 and CD86 bind to CTLA-4 expressing cells in an expression-dependent manner. Bovine CTLA-4-Ig significantly inhibited interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production from bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) activated by Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB). An established specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) for bovine CTLA-4 specifically recognized only with bovine CTLA-4, not CD28, and the antibody blocked the binding of CTLA-4-Ig to both CD80 and CD86 in a dose-dependent manner. The bovine CTLA-4 mAb significantly restored the inhibited IFN-gamma production from the CTLA-4-Ig treated PBMCs. In addition, the CTLA-4 mAb significantly enhanced IFN-gamma production from CTLA-4 expressing PBMCs activated by SEB. Finally, we examined whether a CTLA-4 blockade by CTLA-4 mAb could restore the immune reaction during chronic infection; the blockade assay was performed using PBMCs from BLV-infected cattle. The CTLA-4 blockade enhanced IFN-gamma production from the PBMCs in response to BLV-antigens. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that anti-bovine CTLA-4 antibody can reactivate lymphocyte functions and could be applied for a new therapy against refractory chronic diseases. Further investigation is required for future clinical applications.",,"['Watari, Kei', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Maekawa, Naoya', 'Okagawa, Tomohiro', 'Suzuki, Yasuhiko', 'Murata, Shiro', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Watari K', 'Konnai S', 'Maekawa N', 'Okagawa T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Murata S', 'Ohashi K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3230-7109'],"['Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-0818, Japan. konnai@vetmed.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Advanced Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan. konnai@vetmed.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Division of Bioresources, Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 001-0020, Japan.', 'Global Station for Zoonosis Control, Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE), Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 001-0020, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191029,England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'B7-1 Antigen', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'COS Cells', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins']",['NOTNLM'],"['BLV', 'CD80', 'CD86', 'CTLA-4', 'Cattle', 'IFN-gamma']",2019/10/31 06:00,2020/03/14 06:00,['2019/10/31 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12917-019-2082-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12917-019-2082-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2019 Oct 29;15(1):380. doi: 10.1186/s12917-019-2082-7.,PMC6820917,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (MRD or MUD), the best alternative donor source remains controversial. Umbilical cord blood and haploidentical donors offer a shorter delay from indication to transplantation. This retrospective multicentre study of a French registry compares overall survival in the 18 months following registration in the absence of a MRD between four types of donors. Between 2012 and 2016, 1302 patients were transplanted using MUD (control, n = 803), mismatched MUD (n = 219), umbilical cord blood (n = 153) and haploidentical (n = 127) donors. Multivariate analyses were conducted for overall survival after registration, after transplant, and transplant-related mortality. After adjustment for variables, the type of donor did not influence any of the three end points. Our results confirmed the significant negative impact of longer time between registration and transplant: HR = 1.04 [1.02-1.06] (p < 0.0001).

The recipient lymphocytes were analyzed and the data showed that CD8 T cells increased significantly after immunization and expressed effector memory T cell marker KLRG1. Functional evaluation demonstrated that these KLRG1(+)CD8 T cells could kill tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in Granzyme B- and Fas/FasL-dependent manners with no tumor antigen specificity, and tend to migrate into tumor sites by high expression of heparanase. Adoptive transfer of these cells could provide antitumor protection against tumors. AlloDC could also treat mice with residual tumors and combination of anti-PD1 antibody could enhance this effects.

ChIP-sequencing indicates significant overlap of the TAF1 and AE binding sites. Knockdown of TAF1 alters the association of AE with chromatin, affecting of the expression of genes that are activated or repressed by AE. Furthermore, TAF1 is required for leukemic cell self-renewal and its reduction promotes the differentiation and apoptosis of AE+ AML cells, thereby impairing AE driven leukemogenesis.

Performing the procedure entails obtaining from the patient their own stem cells from peripheral blood using G-CSF. Currently, various filgrastim biosimilars are widely used. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of three different biosimilars of filgrastim in PBSC mobilization in patients with hematological malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 282 patients (118 women and 164 men) who underwent stem cells mobilization for auto-PBSCT in the Department of Hematology in Wroclaw in 2012-2014. Three filgrastim biosimilars were used: Tevagrastim (95), Nivestim (92), and Zarzio (95). Ninety patients (32%) were diagnosed with multiple myeloma, 55 (19%) with Hodgkin's lymphoma, 90 (32%) with NHLs, 20 (7%) with acute myeloid leukemia, and 27 (10%) with another hematological cancer. RESULTS: The mean number of CD34+ cells collected during the first leukapheresis was 5.95 x 10(6) /kg for Tevagrastim, 7.08 x 10(6) /kg for Nivestim, and 6.8 x 10(6) /kg for Zarzio (P > .05). The necessary number of leukapheresis for patients receiving Zarzio, Nivestim, and Tevagrastim was 1.32, 1.37, and 1.66, respectively (P > .05). The percentage of effective mobilizations was 88.2% for Zarzio, 86.2% for Nivestim, and 84.9% for Tevagrastim. The side effects included bone pain and headache. CONCLUSION: All tested biosimilars demonstrated similar effectiveness and safety profiles in patients with hematological tumors undergoing PBSC mobilization; therefore, they can be used interchangeably.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Wicherska-Pawlowska, Katarzyna', 'Rybka, Justyna', 'Prajs, Iwona', 'Szmigiel, Katarzyna', 'Tyc, Joanna', 'Fraczak, Ewa', 'Biedron, Monika', 'Kalicinska, Elzbieta', 'Szymczak, Donata', 'Wrobel, Tomasz']","['Wicherska-Pawlowska K', 'Rybka J', 'Prajs I', 'Szmigiel K', 'Tyc J', 'Fraczak E', 'Biedron M', 'Kalicinska E', 'Szymczak D', 'Wrobel T']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6021-1123'],"['Department of Hematology, Blood Cancer and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw University Hospital, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Cancer and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw University Hospital, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Cancer and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw University Hospital, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Cancer and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw University Hospital, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Cancer and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw University Hospital, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Cancer and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw University Hospital, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Cancer and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw University Hospital, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Cancer and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw University Hospital, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.', 'Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20191030,United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Filgrastim/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cells/cytology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['auto-PBSCT', 'biosimilars of G-CSF', 'mobilization of PBSCs']",2019/10/31 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2019/10/31 06:00'],"['2019/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jca.21750 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2020 Jan;35(1):4-8. doi: 10.1002/jca.21750.

31663460,NLM,MEDLINE,20200323,20200323,2376-1032 (Electronic),25,11,2019 Nov,Two-Way Clinical Messaging in a CML Specialty Pharmacy Service Model.,1290-1296,10.18553/jmcp.2019.25.11.1290 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Adherence to treatment is correlated with treatment success in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CVS Specialty explored novel methods to improve adherence in this population to ensure optimal adherence and lower the risk of unsuccessful treatment. One novel program explored involved an interactive 2-way clinical messaging technology that coaches patients with adherence and knowledge about taking their treatment and managing their conditions. Clinical secure messaging is a 2-way messaging program distinct from the 1-way refill reminders and order status messages that patients were receiving if opted into the messaging program. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect on adherence of 2-way clinical messaging in a CML population treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) compared with patients enrolled in 1-way refill reminders. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using prescription claims data. Patients new to TKI therapy and enrolled in at least 1-way messaging were identified and divided into control and study cohorts based on clinical messaging enrollment status. Participants were followed for 365 days after their first fill. Adherence outcomes were defined by medication possession ratio (MPR), length of therapy, first fill drop-off rate, and gap days between refills. Optimal adherence was defined as an MPR >/= 85%. RESULTS: Patients receiving clinical messaging had on average a 7.64% higher MPR score (MPR: 73.94% vs. 66.30%) compared with the control arm (P = 0.0063). This translates to 22% more patients being optimally adherent while exposed to clinical messaging (P = 0.022). Patients in the exposed group had a mean 32-day increase in average length of therapy compared with the control group (243 days vs. 275 days, P = 0.0043), potentially driving an increase in adherence. Additional drivers included a 5.4 percentage point reduction in first fill drop-off rates (4.66% vs. 10.04%, P = 0.0149). Persistency after 12 months was similar between the study arms (41%). CONCLUSIONS: Two-way clinical messaging positively affected adherence outcomes in a CML population. This effect was in addition to 1-way refill reminders and order status messages. The nature of the clinical content encourages further investigation into this novel execution of adherence coaching and counseling through a digital platform.

Strategies that enhance the intrinsic regenerative ability are very important for the recovery of SCI to radically prevent the occurrence of sensory disorders. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) showed a limited effect on the growth of primary sensory neuron neurites due to the degradation of phosphorylated-epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR) in a manner dependent on Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) (an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase). MiR-22-3p predicted from four databases could target CBL to inhibit the expression of CBL, increase p-EGFR levels and neurites length via STAT3/GAP43 pathway rather than Erk1/2 axis. EGF, EGFR, and miR-22-3p were downregulated sharply after injury. In vivo miR-22-3p Agomir application could regulate CBL/p-EGFR/p-STAT3/GAP43/p-GAP43 axis, and restore spinal cord sensory conductive function. This study clarified the mechanism of the limited promotion effect of EGF on adult primary sensory neuron neurite and targeting miR-22-3p could be a novel strategy to treat sensory dysfunction after SCI.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Li, Bo', 'Wang, Zhijie', 'Yu, Mei', 'Wang, Xu', 'Wang, Xin', 'Chen, Chuanjie', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Zhang, Meiling', 'Sun, Chao', 'Zhao, Chenxi', 'Li,

Hematological malignancy is one of the most common primary diseases in patients with t-MN. However, the occurrence of t-MN in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) patients is rarely reported, possibly due to the dismal prognosis of ATL per se. Here, we report a 62-year-old female who developed t-MN only three months after the completion of conventional chemotherapy and anti-CCR4 antibody for ATL acute type. The patient presented with persistent fever and monocytosis without any evidence of infectious diseases. Bone marrow examinations revealed chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-like disease with a chromosomal translocation of t(11;22)(q23;q13) as a solo cytogenetic abnormality, resulting in the diagnosis of t-MN. Next-generation sequencing analysis identified a rare chimeric transcript, MLL-EP300, without any additional somatic mutations. Although the patient underwent allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, she died of viral encephalomyelitis at 7 months after diagnosis of t-MN. Since recent therapeutic advances have extended the survival of patients with ATL, further evaluation of the long-term risks of developing t-MN in these patients is warranted.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Reina Takeda et al.'],"['Takeda, Reina', 'Yokoyama, Kazuaki', 'Kobayashi, Seiichiro', 'Kawamata, Toyotaka', 'Nakamura, Sousuke', 'Fukuyama, Tomofusa', 'Ito, Mika', 'Yusa, Nozomi', 'Shimizu, Eigo', 'Ohno, Nobuhiro', 'Yamaguchi, Rui', 'Imoto, Seiya', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Tojo, Arinobu']","['Takeda R', 'Yokoyama K', 'Kobayashi S', 'Kawamata T', 'Nakamura S', 'Fukuyama T', 'Ito M', 'Yusa N', 'Shimizu E', 'Ohno N', 'Yamaguchi R', 'Imoto S', 'Miyano S', 'Uchimaru K', 'Tojo A']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4233-8806', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2556-3833', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1224-227X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2989-308X']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Genomics, Research Hospital, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Health Medical Data Science, Health Intelligence Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Health Medical Data Science, Health Intelligence Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Science, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20191002,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,,,2019/10/31 06:00,2019/10/31 06:01,['2019/10/31 06:00'],"['2019/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/4532434 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2019 Oct 2;2019:4532434. doi: 10.1155/2019/4532434. eCollection 2019.,PMC6791222,,,,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism underlying its downregulation and the role of miR-320a in GC are unknown. AIM: To determine expression and biological functions of miR-320a in GC and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine expression of miR-320a in GC cell lines and tissues. TargetScanHuman7.1, miRDB, and microRNA.org were used to predict the possible targets of miR-320a, and a dual luciferase assay was used to confirm the findings. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels of pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3) in GC cells and tissue samples. Cell Counting Kit-8 proliferation, Transwell, wound healing, and apoptosis assays were performed to analyze the biological functions of miR-320a in GC cells. Methylation-specific PCR was used to analyze the methylation level of the miR-320a promoter CpG islands. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) and trichostatin A (TSA) were used to treat GC cells. RESULTS: miR-320a expression was lower in GC cell lines and tissues than in the normal gastric mucosa cell line GES-1 and matched adjacent normal tissues. miR-320a overexpression suppressed GC cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and induced apoptosis. PBX3 was a target of miR-320a in GC. The methylation level of the miR-320a promoter CpG islands was elevated and this was partly reversed by 5-Aza-CdR and TSA. CONCLUSION: miR-320a acts as a tumor suppressor and inhibits malignant behavior of GC cells, partly by targeting PBX3. DNA methylation is an important mechanism associated with low expression of miR-320a.","['(c)The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) using ddPCR in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2013 and November 2014, CML patients treated with nilotinib were enrolled in our study. BCR/ABL1 transcripts levels were evaluated using ddPCR at the first time of complete molecular response (CMR). We enrolled 15 patients from 7 Institutions. The treatment period and median follow-up period were 45 months and 47 months, respectively. RESULTS: Patients with a high level of BCR/ABL1 transcript had a greater tendency to lose the CMR during the follow-up period (p=0.095). In addition, patients with a low level of BCR/ABL1 transcript showed a longer duration of CMR compared to those with a high level (p=0.032). CONCLUSION: We found that ddPCR is a sensitive method for detecting MRD and that MRD could affect the duration of the treatment response.","['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Park, Hyunkyung', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Kim, Inho', 'Sohn, Sang-Kyun', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Lee, Kyoo-Hyung', 'Kim, Dae-Young', 'Kim, Hyeong-Joon', 'Ahn, Jae-Sook', 'Lee, Jeong-Ok', 'Bang, Soo-Mee', 'Cheong, June-Won', 'Park, Sang-Gon', 'Park, Seonyang', 'Lee, Yoo Jin', 'Ahn, Seo-Yeon']","['Park H', 'Shin DY', 'Kim I', 'Sohn SK', 'Koh Y', 'Lee JH', 'Lee KH', 'Kim DY', 'Kim HJ', 'Ahn JS', 'Lee JO', 'Bang SM', 'Cheong JW', 'Park SG', 'Park S', 'Lee YJ', 'Ahn SY']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Biomedical Research Institute, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul Metropolitan Government Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Biomedical Research Institute, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Biomedical Research Institute, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea ihkimmd@snu.ac.kr sksohn@knu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Republic of Korea ihkimmd@snu.ac.kr sksohn@knu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Biomedical Research Institute, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University, Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University, Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University, Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University, Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University, Severance Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chosun University Hospital, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Biomedical Research Institute, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Inje University, Haeundae Paik Hospital, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University, Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*DNA, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'complete molecular response', 'droplet digital polymerase chain reaction', 'minimal residual disease', 'treatment outcome']",2019/10/31 06:00,2020/03/14 06:00,['2019/10/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['33/6/2273 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.11733 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2019 Nov-Dec;33(6):2273-2280. doi: 10.21873/invivo.11733.,PMC6899155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we provide evidence for a two-step process for the development of neurologic adverse events in response to blinatumomab: (i) blinatumomab induced B-cell-independent redistribution of peripheral T cells, including T-cell adhesion to blood vessel endothelium, endothelial activation, and T-cell transmigration into the perivascular space, where (ii) blinatumomab induced B-cell-dependent T-cell activation and cytokine release to potentially trigger neurologic adverse events. Evidence for this process includes (i) the coincidence of T-cell redistribution and the early occurrence of most neurologic adverse events, (ii) T-cell transmigration through brain microvascular endothelium, (iii) detection of T cells, B cells, and blinatumomab in cerebrospinal fluid, (iv) blinatumomab-induced T-cell rolling and adhesion to vascular endothelial cells in vitro, and (v) the ability of antiadhesive agents to interfere with blinatumomab-induced interactions between T cells and vascular endothelial cells in vitro and in patients. On the basis of these observations, we propose a model that could be the basis of mitigation strategies for neurologic adverse events associated with blinatumomab treatment and other T-cell therapies.

Akt is an oncogenic kinase that regulates multiple cellular functions and its activity is significantly elevated in human cancers. Here we discovered a cross-talk between Mcl-1 and Akt in promoting lung cancer cell growth. Depletion of endogenous Mcl-1 from human lung cancer cells using CRISPR/Cas9 or Mcl-1 shRNA significantly decreased Akt activity, leading to suppression of lung cancer cell growth in vitro and in xenografts. Mechanistically, Mcl-1 directly interacted via its PEST domain with Akt at the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. It is known that the interactions between the PH domain and kinase domain (KD) are important for maintaining Akt in an inactive state. The binding of Mcl-1/PH domain disrupted intramolecular PH/KD interactions to activate Akt. Intriguingly, Mcl-1 expression correlated with Akt activity in tumor tissues from patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Using the Mcl-1-binding PH domain of Akt as a docking site, we identified a novel small molecule, PH-687, that directly targets the PH domain and disrupts Mcl-1/Akt binding, leading to suppression of Akt activity and growth inhibition of lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. By targeting the Mcl-1/Akt interaction, this mechanism-driven agent provides a highly attractive strategy for the treatment of lung cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that targeting Mcl-1/Akt interaction by employing small molecules such as PH-687 represents a potentially new and effective strategy for cancer treatment.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Chen, Guo', 'Park, Dongkyoo', 'Magis, Andrew T', 'Behera, Madhusmita', 'Ramalingam, Suresh S', 'Owonikoko, Taofeek K', 'Sica, Gabriel L', 'Ye, Keqiang', 'Zhang, Chao', 'Chen, Zhengjia', 'Curran, Walter J', 'Deng, Xingming']","['Chen G', 'Park D', 'Magis AT', 'Behera M', 'Ramalingam SS', 'Owonikoko TK', 'Sica GL', 'Ye K', 'Zhang C', 'Chen Z', 'Curran WJ', 'Deng X']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6301-4931', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0576-677X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6301-4931']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. xdeng4@emory.edu.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA217691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA193828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA200905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20191029,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Domains/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2019/10/31 06:00,2020/05/28 06:00,['2019/10/31 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-19-0950 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0950 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2019 Dec 15;79(24):6126-6138. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0950.

We observed that fusion oncogenes, such as ETO2-GLIS2, are associated with acute megakaryoblastic or other myeloid leukemia subtypes in an age-dependent manner. Analysis of a novel inducible transgenic mouse model showed that ETO2-GLIS2 expression in fetal hematopoietic stem cells induced rapid megakaryoblastic leukemia whereas expression in adult bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells resulted in a shift toward myeloid transformation with a strikingly delayed in vivo leukemogenic potential. Chromatin accessibility and single-cell transcriptome analyses indicate ontogeny-dependent intrinsic and ETO2-GLIS2-induced differences in the activities of key transcription factors, including ERG, SPI1, GATA1, and CEBPA. Importantly, switching off the fusion oncogene restored terminal differentiation of the leukemic blasts. Together, these data show that aggressiveness and phenotypes in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia result from an ontogeny-related differential susceptibility to transformation by fusion oncogenes. SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates that the clinical phenotype of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia is determined by ontogeny-dependent susceptibility for transformation by oncogenic fusion genes. The phenotype is maintained by potentially reversible alteration of key transcription factors, indicating that targeting of the fusions may overcome the differentiation blockage and revert the leukemic state.See related commentary by Cruz Hernandez and Vyas, p. 1653.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1631.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer

In ALL, inadequate response at the level of MRD is a commonly accepted risk factor for relapse and thus an indication for allogeneic HSCT. Similarly, growing evidence from the literature strongly suggest that MRD detected by multiparameter flow cytometry or molecular techniques should be also used for risk stratification in AML at the time of HSCT. Despite the well-defined association of MRD and outcomes of HSCT in acute leukemias, there are still many open issues such as the role of additional pre-transplant consolidation for MRD eradication, the ability of HSCT to overcome negative influence of MRD positivity on survival, the impact of conditioning regimen intensity on MRD clearance post HSCT, and transplantation outcomes or the selection of optimal donor with regards to MRD status. In addition, the role of MRD assessment in guiding post-transplant maintenance treatment should also be addressed in prospective trials. These open issues mostly awaiting further clinical studies will be discussed in our current review.",,"['Czyz, Anna', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Czyz A', 'Nagler A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6641-0182', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0763-1265']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Ludwik Pasteur 4, 50-367 Wroclaw, Poland. aczyz@onet.eu.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Derech Sheba 2, 52-621 Ramat Gan, Israel.

We investigated the contemporary incidence, diagnostics, antifungal management and outcome at a major paediatric transplant centre in Germany. METHODS: The single-centre retrospective observational study included all paediatric allogeneic HSCT patients (pts) transplanted between 2005 and 2015. Patient-related data were assessed up to 365 days post-transplant. The primary endpoint was the incidence of possible, probable and proven IFDs. Secondary endpoints included diagnostics and antifungal treatment; analysis of risk factors; and overall survival with the last follow-up in January 2017. RESULTS: A total of 221 first (196), second (21) or third (4) procedures were performed in 200 pts (median age: 9 years, range, 0.5-22) for leukaemia/lymphoma (149) and non-malignant disorders (72). Prophylaxis was administered in 208 HSCT procedures (94%; fluconazole, 116, mould-active agents, 92). At least one computed tomography scan of the chest was performed in 146, and at least one galactomannan antigen assay in 60 procedures. There were 15 cases of proven (candidemia, 4; aspergillosis, 4) or probable (aspergillosis, 7) IFDs, accounting for an incidence rate of 6.8%. Overall mortality at last follow-up was 30%; the occurrence of proven/probable IFDs was associated with a reduced survival probability (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Morbidity and mortality from IFDs at our institution were consistent with data reported from other centres.

Current therapies include intensive chemotherapy and ionizing radiation that preferentially kill malignant cells. Unfortunately, they are frequently accompanied by unintended negative impacts, including the induction of cellular senescence and long-term toxicities in normal host tissues. Whether these senescent cells resulting from therapy increase the susceptibility to relapse or secondary cancers is unknown. Using transgenic and pharmacological approaches to eliminate doxorubicin-induced senescent cells in a Notch-driven T-ALL relapse mouse model, we find that these cells inhibit tumor recurrence, suggesting that senescence in response to treatment suppresses tumorigenesis. This finding, together with extensive evidence from others demonstrating that age-associated health problems develop dramatically earlier among childhood cancer survivors compared to age-matched counterparts, suggests a relationship between therapy-induced senescence and tumorigenesis. Although cancer risk is increased through accelerated premature-aging in the long run, therapy-induced senescence appears to protect survivors from recurrence, at least in the short run.",,"['Zhang, Ying', 'Gundelach, Justin', 'Lindquist, Lonnie D', 'Baker, Darren J', 'van Deursen, Jan', 'Bram, Richard J']","['Zhang Y', 'Gundelach J', 'Lindquist LD', 'Baker DJ', 'van Deursen J', 'Bram RJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5940-6158'],"['Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States of America.', 'Department of Immunology, and Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States of America.']",['eng'],['R21 CA215867/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191029,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/toxicity', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cellular Senescence/*drug effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxorubicin/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2019/10/30 06:00,2020/03/20 06:00,['2019/10/30 06:00'],"['2019/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0224172 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-11218 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Oct 29;14(10):e0224172. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0224172. eCollection 2019.,PMC6818774,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Oxidative stress is a common problem observed in carcinogenesis and it is involved in developing treatment resistance. Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2-Like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor is the main regulator of antioxidant responses. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are tightly controlled and regulated by Nrf2 and its suppressor protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Recently, many studies have shown that most of the genes in the Nrf2/Keap1/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB)/phosphotyrosine-independent ligand for the Lck SH2 domain Of 62 KDa (p62) pathway show abnormally high mutational variations in cancer. However, variations in the Nrf2/Keap1/NF-kappaB1/p62 pathway in pediatric ALL have not been thoroughly investigated, yet. Thirty children, who were diagnosed with pediatirc ALL were included in the study. The Nrf2/Keap1/NF-kappaB1/p62 pathway variants were analyzed by DNA sequencing analysis. The PolyPhen-2 program was used for identifying pathogenic mutations. Our study examined the molecular dynamics (MD) perspectives of the effect of A159T and E121K mutations on protein stability for the first time in the literature by using the GROMACS45 software package utilizing the OPSLAA force field. Of the detected 17 nucleotide changes, 6 were novel. The study predicted the potential pathological effect of two mutations p. A159T and p.E121K in the Keap1 gene. The MD perspectives revealed that the E121K mutant's observed structural behavior accounted for the key role of His-129 and E121K, where E121K exhibited much higher drift compared to His-129. For a future perspective, it would be meaningful to study the protein-small molecule interactions of the Keap1 protein to elaborate on the drug effects in patients carrying these mutations.",,"['Akin-Bali, Dilara Fatma', 'Aktas, Sedef Hande', 'Unal, Mehmet Altay', 'Kankilic, Teoman']","['Akin-Bali DF', 'Aktas SH', 'Unal MA', 'Kankilic T']",,"['Faculty of Medicine, Medical Biology, Nigde Omer Halisdemir University, Nigde, Turkey.', 'Vocational School of Health Services, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Central Research Laboratory Application and Research Center, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Ankara University Stem Cell Institute, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Science Literature, Department of Biotechnology, Nigde Omer Halisdemir University, Nigde, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191029,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (KEAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Molecular dynamics', 'NF-kappaB1/p105', 'Nrf2/Keap1 pathway', 'mutation', 'pediatric leukemia']",2019/10/30 06:00,2020/09/18 06:00,['2019/10/30 06:00'],"['2019/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2019.1682090 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Feb;37(1):58-75. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2019.1682090.

Major limitations in interpreting available data are MPAL's rarity and the use of definitions other than the currently widely accepted criteria: the World Health Organization 2016 (WHO2016) classification. METHODS: To assess the relative efficacy of chemotherapy types for treating pediatric MPAL, the Children's Oncology Group (COG) Acute Leukemia of Ambiguous Lineage Task Force assembled a retrospective cohort of centrally reviewed WHO2016 MPAL cases selected from banking studies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients were not treated in COG trials; treatment and outcome data were captured separately. The findings were then integrated with the available, mixed literature to develop a prospective trial in pediatric MPAL. RESULTS: The central review confirmed that 54 of 70 cases fulfilled WHO2016 criteria for MPAL. ALL induction regimens achieved remission in 72% of the cases (28 of 39), whereas AML regimens achieved remission in 69% (9 of 13). The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for the entire cohort were 72% +/- 8% and 77% +/- 7%, respectively. EFS and OS were 75% +/- 13% and 84% +/- 11%, respectively, for those receiving ALL chemotherapy alone without HSCT (n = 21). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the COG MPAL cohort and a literature review suggest that ALL chemotherapy without HSCT may be the preferred initial therapy. A prospective trial within the COG is proposed to investigate this approach; AML chemotherapy and/or HSCT will be reserved for those with treatment failure as assessed by minimal residual disease. Embedded biology studies will provide further insight into MPAL genomics.",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],"['Orgel, Etan', 'Alexander, Thomas B', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Kahwash, Samir B', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Dai, Yunfeng', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Carroll, Andrew J 3rd', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Berman, Jason N', 'Woods, William G', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A', 'Horan, John T']","['Orgel E', 'Alexander TB', 'Wood BL', 'Kahwash SB', 'Devidas M', 'Dai Y', 'Alonzo TA', 'Mullighan CG', 'Inaba H', 'Hunger SP', 'Raetz EA', 'Gamis AS', 'Rabin KR', 'Carroll AJ 3rd', 'Heerema NA', 'Berman JN', 'Woods WG', 'Loh ML', 'Zweidler-McKay PA', 'Horan JT']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1487-6818', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0605-7342']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", ""Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pediatrics and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, NYU Langone Health, New York, New York.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Mercy Cancer Center, Kansas City, Missouri."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Pediatrics and CHEO Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta/Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital and Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, California."", 'ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham, Massachusetts.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta/Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.""]",['eng'],"['U24 CA196173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191029,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Pediatrics/trends', '*Prognosis', 'World Health Organization', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage', '*biphenotypic acute leukemia', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*mixed-phenotype acute leukemia', '*pediatric leukemia']",2019/10/30 06:00,2020/08/13 06:00,['2019/10/30 06:00'],"['2019/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32552 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Feb 1;126(3):593-601. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32552.

TSCs have been the focus of chemists and biologists due to their wide range of pharmacological effects. One of the promising areas in which these excellent metal chelators are being developed is their use against cancer. TSCs have a wide clinical antitumor spectrum with efficacy in various tumor types such as leukemia, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer and bladder cancer. To obtain better activity, different series of TSCs have been developed by modifying the heteroaromatic system in their molecules. These compounds possessed significant antineoplastic activity when the carbonyl attachment of the side chain was located at a position alpha to the ring nitrogen atom, whereas attachment of the side chain beta or gamma to the heterocyclic N atom resulted in inactive antitumor agents. In addition, replacement of the heterocyclic ring N with C also resulted in a biologically inactive compound suggesting that a conjugated N,N,S-tridentate donor set is essential for the biological activities of thiosemicarbazones. Several possible mechanisms have been implemented for the anticancer activity of thiosemicarbazones.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Shakya, Bhushan', 'Yadav, Paras Nath']","['Shakya B', 'Yadav PN']",,"['Amrit Campus, Tribhuvan University, Thamel, Kathmandu, Nepal.', 'Central Department of Chemistry, Tribhuvan University, Kirtipur, Kathmandu, Nepal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Mini Rev Med Chem,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiosemicarbazones/chemistry/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'apoptosis', 'iron chelation', 'reactive oxygen species', 'ribonucleotide reductase', 'thiosemicarbazone.']",2019/10/30 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2019/10/30 06:00'],"['2019/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['MRMC-EPUB-101991 [pii]', '10.2174/1389557519666191029130310 [doi]']",ppublish,Mini Rev Med Chem. 2020;20(8):638-661. doi: 10.2174/1389557519666191029130310.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Young adult (18-38 years) survivors of a childhood cancer (except leukemia), diagnosed younger than 15 years between 1987 and 1999 in the Rhone-Alpes region of France, were invited to a semistandardized psychological interview after a medical follow-up consultation during two successive long-term follow-up studies in Oncology (SALTO-1 and -2). Psychiatric issues from the DSM-IV were diagnosed and compared with the general French population (GFP) through interviews based on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Results: Of the 288 childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) who attended the consultations, 247 completed the MINI interview. Fifty-five percent indicated they had suffered from psychiatric issues after their cancer compared to 31.9% of the GFP (p < 0.0001). These issues were generally anxiety problems (40.5%), mood disorders (28.7%), and substance dependency (10.5%; p < 0.0001). The risk of suicide was, however, less for the CCS group (8.9% vs. 13.6%, p = 0.03). Unemployment was a significant risk factor for mood disorders (p = 0.009). Men were 4.1 times more likely than women to be addicted during their lifetime (p = 0.0004), while adults cured of bone tumors were 14.3 times more likely to be at risk of drug dependence than adults cured of central nervous system tumors (p = 0.01). Conclusion: CCSs are particularly vulnerable to psychiatric disorders throughout their life. Systematic and long-term psychological monitoring of these patients will enable their psychiatric issues to be detected sooner.",,"['Abadie, Aline', 'Massoubre, Catherine', 'Casagranda, Leonie', 'Protiere, Alice', 'Buisson-Papet, Gaelle', 'Trombert-Paviot, Beatrice', 'Freycon, Claire', 'Isfan, Florantina', 'Faure-Conter, Cecile', 'Berger, Claire']","['Abadie A', 'Massoubre C', 'Casagranda L', 'Protiere A', 'Buisson-Papet G', 'Trombert-Paviot B', 'Freycon C', 'Isfan F', 'Faure-Conter C', 'Berger C']",,"['Department of General Medicine, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of the Rhone-Alpes Region, Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Host Research Team EA4607 SNA-EPIS (Autonomic Nervous System, Epidemiology, Physiology, Exercise, and Health), Jean Monnet University of Saint-Etienne, PRES (Education and Research Cluster) Lyon, Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Centre Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France.', 'Host Research Team EA4607 SNA-EPIS (Autonomic Nervous System, Epidemiology, Physiology, Exercise, and Health), Jean Monnet University of Saint-Etienne, PRES (Education and Research Cluster) Lyon, Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Department of Public Health and Medical Informatics, Universite Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne Faculte de Medecine Jacques Lisfranc, Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Centre Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""Department of Pediatric Neuro-Oncology, Institut d'Hematologie et d'Oncologie Pediatrique, Lyon, France."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Childhood Cancer Registry of the Rhone-Alpes Region, Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Host Research Team EA4607 SNA-EPIS (Autonomic Nervous System, Epidemiology, Physiology, Exercise, and Health), Jean Monnet University of Saint-Etienne, PRES (Education and Research Cluster) Lyon, Saint-Etienne, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191029,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview', '*long-term monitoring', '*pediatrics', '*psychiatric disorders', '*survivors']",2019/10/30 06:00,2021/06/05 06:00,['2019/10/30 06:00'],"['2019/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2019.0056 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2020 Apr;9(2):247-255. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2019.0056.
