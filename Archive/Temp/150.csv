To investigate the biology and regulation of telomerase in CML, we evaluated expression of the telomerase components, its regulators and several telomeric-associated proteins. Quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to compare gene expression in the CD34+/leukaemic blast cells of 22 CML patient samples to the CD34+ cell population of healthy individuals. hTERT, the catalytic component of telomerase, was downregulated in eight of 12 chronic phase (CP) patients (P = 0.0387). Furthermore, hTERT was significantly downregulated in two of three patients in accelerated phase (AP) and seven of seven patients in blast crisis (BC), P = 0.0017. Expression of hTR and telomeric-associated proteins TEP1, TRF1, TRF2, tankyrase and PinX1 was high in the majority of CP and AP patients. With the exceptions of TEP1 and hTR, expression of these factors was highest in CP and decreased during disease progression. Expression of c-Myc, a positive regulator of hTERT transcription, correlated with hTERT expression and decreased with disease progression, falling below control levels in BC. hTERT levels were increased in CP patients following successful treatment with imatinib, relative to untreated CP patients. We suggest that reduced hTERT expression directly causes the shortened telomeres observed in CML.","['Campbell, L J', 'Fidler, C', 'Eagleton, H', 'Peniket, A', 'Kusec, R', 'Gal, S', 'Littlewood, T J', 'Wainscoat, J S', 'Boultwood, J']","['Campbell LJ', 'Fidler C', 'Eagleton H', 'Peniket A', 'Kusec R', 'Gal S', 'Littlewood TJ', 'Wainscoat JS', 'Boultwood J']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PINX1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TEP1 protein, human)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Tankyrases)', 'EC 2.4.4.30 (TNKS protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Benzamides', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tankyrases/biosynthesis', 'Telomerase/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/biosynthesis', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis']",2006/02/25 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/02/25 09:00'],"['2006/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404141 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404141 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Apr;20(4):671-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404141.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To develop a quantitative flow-cytometry approach to its evaluation, we analyzed the expression of CD71, CD105, cytosolic H-ferritin (HF), cytosolic L-ferritin (LF) and mitochondrial ferritin (MtF) in erythroblasts from 104 MDS patients, 69 pathologic control patients and 19 healthy subjects. Six-parameter, 4-color flow cytometry was employed, and data were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity. Compared with pathologic and healthy controls, MDS patients had higher expression of HF (P < 0.001) and CD105 (P < 0.001), and lower expression of CD71 (P < 0.001). MtF was specifically detected in MDS with ringed sideroblasts, and there was a close relationship between its expression and Prussian blue staining (r = 0.89, P < 0.001). In vitro cultures of myelodysplastic hematopoietic progenitors showed that both HF and MtF were expressed at a very early stage of erythroid differentiation, and that MtF expression is specifically related to mitochondrial iron loading. A classification function based on expression levels of HF, CD71 and CD105 allowed us to correctly classify > 95% of MDS patients. This flow-cytometry approach provides an accurate quantitative evaluation of erythroid dysplasia and allows a reliable diagnosis of sideroblastic anemia, and may therefore be a useful tool in the work-up of patients with MDS.","['Della Porta, M G', 'Malcovati, L', 'Invernizzi, R', 'Travaglino, E', 'Pascutto, C', 'Maffioli, M', 'Galli, A', 'Boggi, S', 'Pietra, D', 'Vanelli, L', 'Marseglia, C', 'Levi, S', 'Arosio, P', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Cazzola, M']","['Della Porta MG', 'Malcovati L', 'Invernizzi R', 'Travaglino E', 'Pascutto C', 'Maffioli M', 'Galli A', 'Boggi S', 'Pietra D', 'Vanelli L', 'Marseglia C', 'Levi S', 'Arosio P', 'Lazzarino M', 'Cazzola M']","['Division of Hematology, University of Pavia Medical School, IRCCS Policlinico S.

All tested thimidine-containing PS-ODN, irrespective of their primary sequences, reduced the expression of Bcl-2 protein and increased the levels of the proapoptotic molecules p53, Bid, Bax in CLL cells. Apoptosis induced by thymidine-containing PS-ODN was preceded by cellular activation, could be blocked by the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), and was dependent on ABL kinase.

However, no such hidden anomalies have been reported. We performed a high-resolution genome-wide array-based comparative genome hybridization (array CGH) analysis of 10 AML/MDS cases with isolated +8, utilizing a 32K bacterial artificial chromosome array set, providing >98% coverage of the genome with a resolution of 100 kb. Array CGH revealed intrachromosomal imbalances, not corresponding to known genomic copy number polymorphisms, in 4/10 cases, comprising nine duplications and hemizygous deletions ranging in size from 0.5 to 2.2 Mb. A 1.8 Mb deletion at 7p14.1, which had occurred prior to the +8, was identified in MDS transforming to AML. Furthermore, a deletion including ETV6 was present in one case. The remaining seven imbalances involved more than 40 genes.

To assess a potential role of dendritic cells (DC) in poor anti-leukemia immunity, we analyzed peripheral blood DC in 55 pediatric ALL patients at the time of initial diagnosis and 19 age-matched healthy controls. Dendritic cells were identified by their expression of HLA-DR, lack of B, T, NK, and monocyte markers, and expression of CD11c (myeloid DC(mDC)) or BDCA-2 (plasmacytoid DC(pDC)) using flow cytometry. We found that in children with B-lineage ALL, numbers of both mDC and pDC were significantly reduced (P = 0.0001). In contrast, T-lineage ALL patients showed normal pDC and significantly elevated mDC (P = 0.003) levels, with normal expression of HLA-DR and co-stimulatory molecules. A decrease in DC could not be explained by general impairment of myelopoiesis, as we could not demonstrate a correlation of DC numbers with granulocyte/monocyte numbers in patients with B-lineage ALL. However, aberrant expression of myeloid surface markers on leukemic blasts was frequent in patients lacking myeloid DC indicating a potential block of DC differentiation.

These growth factors have also been used to recruit dormant myeloid leukemia cells into the S phase of cell cycle in order to increase their susceptibility to the antileukemic effects of agents such as cytarabine. Multiple prospective randomized trials have examined the benefit and safety of the addition of growth factors before, during, and after chemotherapy. A reduction in the duration of neutropenia has been the most consistent finding; this has not been associated with stimulation of leukemia cells, the main concern of using this strategy. Unfortunately, few studies have reported a benefit in prolonging the duration of disease-free survival or overall survival. Other cytokines, including interleukins and thrombopoietin, have also been evaluated for their theoretical ability to recruit immune mechanisms to eradicate residual leukemia burden after chemotherapy, and to stimulate platelet production.

The identification of a cytogenetically invisible interstitial deletion resulting in the fusion of FIP1-Like-1 (FIP1L1) to platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) has enabled many IHES cases to be reclassified as chronic eosinophilic leukemia. As it is likely that PDGFRA may fuse to other partner genes, we established a reverse transcriptase-PCR test to detect specific overexpression of the PDGFRA kinase domain as an indicator of the presence of a fusion gene. Overexpression was detected in 12/12 FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive patients, plus 9/217 (4%) patients with hypereosinophilia who had tested negative for FIP1L1-PDGFRA. One of the positive cases was investigated in detail and found to have a complex karyotype involving chromosomes 3, 4 and 10. Amplification of the genomic breakpoint by bubble PCR revealed a novel fusion between KIF5B at 10p11 and PDGFRA at 4q12. Imatinib, a known inhibitor of PDGFRalpha, produced a complete cytogenetic response and disappearance of the KIF5B-PDGFRA fusion by PCR, from both genomic DNA and mRNA. This study demonstrates the utility of screening for PDGFRA kinase domain overexpression in patients with IHES and has identified a third PDGFRA fusion partner in chronic myeloproliferative disorders.","['Score, J', 'Curtis, C', 'Waghorn, K', 'Stalder, M', 'Jotterand, M', 'Grand, F H', 'Cross, N C P']","['Score J', 'Curtis C', 'Waghorn K', 'Stalder M', 'Jotterand M', 'Grand FH', 'Cross NC']","['Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, Wilts, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cohort Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Fusion/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/02/25 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/02/25 09:00'],"['2006/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404154 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404154 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 May;20(5):827-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404154.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CML patients are currently treated with the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, which is effective in early stages of the disease. However, resistance to imatinib arises in later disease stages primarily because of a Bcr-Abl mutation. To gain deeper insight into Bcr-Abl signaling pathways, we generated phosphotyrosine profiles for 6 cell lines that represent 3 Bcr-Abl fusion types by using immunoaffinity purification of tyrosine phosphopeptides followed by tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 188 nonredundant tyrosine-phosphorylated sites, 77 of which are novel. By comparing the profiles, we found a number of phosphotyrosine sites common to the 6 cell lines regardless of cellular background and fusion type, several of which are decreased by imatinib treatment. Comparison of this Bcr-Abl signature with the profile of cells expressing an alternative imatinib-sensitive fusion kinase, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha, revealed that these kinases signal through different pathways.

The effectiveness is generally thought to result from a rapid depletion of asparagine in serum and cells. Asparagine synthetase (AS) opposes the action of L-Asp by resynthesis of asparagine. In vitro, resistance to L-Asp has been associated with up-regulation of AS mRNA expression. We monitored AS mRNA levels in leukemic cells before and during 5 days after intravenous administration of 1000 IU/m(2) pegylated L-asparaginase (PEG-Asp) in a therapeutic window in children with ALL at initial diagnosis. Within 24 hours, AS mRNA levels increased by 3.5-fold and remained stable in the following 4 days. Baseline and L-Asp-induced expression levels of AS did not differ between clinically good, intermediate, and poor responders to PEG-Asp. No significant difference of AS mRNA up-regulation was found between precursor B- and T-ALL or between hyperdiploids, TEL/AML1 rearranged ALL or absence of genetic abnormalities. In 3 of 12 patients with T-ALL even a slight down-regulation of AS mRNA expression upon L-Asp exposure was found. In conclusion, although L-Asp exposure induces the expression of AS mRNA, the up-regulated gene expression does not correlate with an early clinical poor response to this drug in children with ALL.","['Appel, Inge M', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Meijerink, Jules P P', 'Veerman, Anjo J P', 'Reniers, Nathalie C M', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Appel IM', 'den Boer ML', 'Meijerink JP', 'Veerman AJ', 'Reniers NC', 'Pieters R']","[""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, PO Box 2060, 3000 CB Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2006/02/25 09:00,2006/06/30 09:00,['2006/02/25 09:00'],"['2006/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)64557-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-06-2597 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jun 1;107(11):4244-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2597.

Protection from apoptosis is a common feature involved in multidrug-resistance of ATL. IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) family proteins inhibit apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli. In this study, we investigated the expression of IAP family members (survivin, cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP) in the primary leukemic cells from patients with ATL. We found that survivin was overexpressed in ATL, especially in acute-type ATL. Sodium arsenite was shown to down-regulate the expression of survivin at both the protein and RNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner, thus inhibiting cell growth, inducing apoptosis, and enhancing the caspase-3 activity in ATL cells. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) enhances the transcriptional activity of survivin. Sodium arsenite suppressed the constitutive NF-kappaB activation by preventing the IkappaB-alpha degradation and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. These findings suggest that survivin is an important antiapoptotic molecule that confers drug resistance on ATL cells. Sodium arsenite was shown to down-regulate the expression of survivin through the NF-kappaB pathway, thus inhibiting cell growth and promoting apoptosis of ATL cells.","['Che, Xiao-Fang', 'Zheng, Chun-Lei', 'Owatari, Satsuki', 'Mutoh, Masato', 'Gotanda, Takenari', 'Jeung, Hei-Cheul', 'Furukawa, Tatsuhiko', 'Ikeda, Ryuji', 'Yamamoto, Masatatsu', 'Haraguchi, Misako', 'Arima, Naomichi', 'Akiyama, Shin-ichi']","['Che XF', 'Zheng CL', 'Owatari S', 'Mutoh M', 'Gotanda T', 'Jeung HC', 'Furukawa T', 'Ikeda R', 'Yamamoto M', 'Haraguchi M', 'Arima N', 'Akiyama S']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Graduate School of Medical & Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima 890-8520, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '0 (Survivin)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Sodium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Survivin', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2006/02/25 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/02/25 09:00'],"['2006/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63373-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-3423 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jun 15;107(12):4880-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-3423.

We have treated 13 patients with newly diagnosed HCL (n = 11) or after failure of one prior chemotherapy (n = 2) with cladribine (5.6 mg/m(2) given intravenously over 2 hours daily for 5 days) followed by 8 weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)). All patients achieved a CR and minimal residual disease (MRD) assessed by consensus primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or flow cytometry was eradicated in 11 (92%) of 12 and in 12 (92%) of 13 of patients, respectively. There was no decline in the absolute CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte number after rituximab. We conclude that eradication of MRD in HCL is possible. Whether this leads to a reduced risk of relapse would need to be evaluated in a larger number of patients and with longer follow-up. Disease characteristics may potentially be used to identify patients that are more likely to benefit from such additional therapy.","['Ravandi, Farhad', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Koller, Charles A', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Wierda, William G', 'Odinga, Shirley', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Jones, Dan', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Ravandi F', 'Jorgensen JL', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Verstovsek S', 'Koller CA', 'Faderl S', 'Giles FJ', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Wierda WG', 'Odinga S', 'Huang X', 'Thomas DA', 'Freireich EJ', 'Jones D', 'Keating MJ', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. fravandi@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab']",2006/02/25 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/02/25 09:00'],"['2006/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63343-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-11-4590 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jun 15;107(12):4658-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-11-4590.

These factors are difficult to study independently in humans. Ex vivo culture and genetic manipulation of PBPC grafts may also affect immune reconstitution, with relevance to gene therapy applications. We directly compared the effects of three clinically relevant autologous graft compositions on immune reconstitution after myeloblative total body irradiation in rhesus macaques, the first time these studies have been performed in a large animal model with direct clinical relevance. Animals received CD34(+) cell dose-matched grafts of either peripheral blood mononuclear cells, purified CD34(+) PBPCs, or purified CD34(+) PBPCs expanded in vitro and retrovirally transduced. We evaluated the reconstitution of T, B, natural killer, dendritic cells, and monocytes in blood and lymph nodes for up to 1 year post-transplantation. Animals receiving selected-transduced CD34(+) cells had the fastest recovery of T-cell numbers, along with the highest T-cell-receptor gene rearrangement excision circles levels, the fewest proliferating Ki-67(+) T-cells in the blood, and the best-preserved thymic architecture. Selected-transduced CD34(+) cells may therefore repopulate the thymus more efficiently and promote a higher output of naive T-cells. These results have implications for the design of gene therapy trials, as well as for the use of expanded PBPCs for improved T-cell immune reconstitution after transplantation.","['Lore, Karin', 'Seggewiss, Ruth', 'Guenaga, F Javier', 'Pittaluga, Stefania', 'Donahue, Robert E', 'Krouse, Allen', 'Metzger, Mark E', 'Koup, Richard A', 'Reilly, Cavan', 'Douek, Daniel C', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E']","['Lore K', 'Seggewiss R', 'Guenaga FJ', 'Pittaluga S', 'Donahue RE', 'Krouse A', 'Metzger ME', 'Koup RA', 'Reilly C', 'Douek DC', 'Dunbar CE']","['Immunology Laboratory, Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/classification/cytology/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Monocytes/cytology/immunology', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/anatomy & histology/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2006/02/25 09:00,2006/08/26 09:00,['2006/02/25 09:00'],"['2006/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['2005-0455 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2005-0455 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2006 Jun;24(6):1539-48. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2005-0455.

In this article, the action of dasatinib (BMS-354825) is contrasted with that of imatinib, a kinase inhibitor that is currently being used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and other disorders. Both pharmacologic inhibitors target several tyrosine kinases, including Bcr-Abl and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Up to this point, the PDGFR has not been a primary therapeutic target for this class of agents. The work of Chen and colleagues shows that dasatinib is a particularly potent inhibitor of PDGFR and that the compound also targets Src kinase. The authors suggest that this combination of activities could be useful in the treatment of vascular obstructive diseases. Although a lack of absolute specificity has typically been regarded as a pharmacologic drawback, this study exemplifies how drugs with multiple molecular targets can potentially provide a very beneficial spectrum of therapeutic activities in multiple disease states.","['Zhang, Zhihong', 'Meier, Kathryn E']","['Zhang Z', 'Meier KE']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, P.O.

Patients received antimicrobial prophylaxis; those developing episodes of fever and not meeting the criteria for admission were treated with outpatient intravenous antibiotics. RESULTS: Seventy-one cycles of induction chemotherapy were administered for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML. In 25 cycles the patient was discharged post chemotherapy prior to count recovery. Of these, 14 patients developed one or more febrile episodes as an outpatient and nine (36%) required readmission to hospital. Sixty-seven consolidation cycles were given on an outpatient basis. In 39 cycles there was one or more febrile episodes and in 14 (21%) admission was required. Infections were documented in four cases during induction and in 27 during consolidation. There were no treatment-related deaths.

In non-CNS tissues, the protein suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) negatively regulates signaling through gp130. Here, we analyze the role of SOCS3 in inhibiting LIF signaling in NPCs in vitro. SOCS3 is rapidly expressed by NPCs in response to LIF stimulation, with this expression largely dependent on recruitment of STAT proteins to the activated gp130 receptor. Proliferating NPC cultures can be generated from SOCS3 knockout (SOCS3KO/KO) embryos and display prolonged STAT3 phosphorylation and induction of the GFAP gene in response to LIF. In comparison with SOCS3 wild-type (SOCS3WT/WT) NPCs, SOCS3KO/KO cultures display enhanced self-renewal capacity. However, the clonal potential of SOCS3WT/WT but not SOCS3KO/KO NPCs is enhanced by exogenous LIF. Thus, SOCS3 acts as a negative regulator of LIF signaling in NPCs.","['Emery, B', 'Merson, T D', 'Snell, C', 'Young, K M', 'Ernst, M', 'Kilpatrick, T J']","['Emery B', 'Merson TD', 'Snell C', 'Young KM', 'Ernst M', 'Kilpatrick TJ']","['Multiple Sclerosis Group, The Howard Florey Institute, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Neurosci,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/cytology/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/02/25 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/02/25 09:00'],"['2005/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1044-7431(06)00005-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcn.2006.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2006 Apr;31(4):739-47. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2006.01.005.

Normally, MMP-9 expression is tightly controlled in cells. Sustained or enhanced MMP-9 secretion, however, has been demonstrated to contribute to the pathophysiology of numerous diseases, including arthritis and tumor progression, rendering this enzyme a major target for clinical interventions. Here we show that constitutive MMP-9 secretion was abrogated in THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells by addition of neutralizing antibodies against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or TNF receptor type 1 (TNF-R1), as well as by inhibition of TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE). This indicates that MMP-9 production in these cells is maintained by autocrine stimulation, with TNF-alpha acting via TNF-R1. To investigate the intracellular signaling routes involved in MMP-9 gene transcription, cells were treated with different inhibitors of major mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Interruption of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway 1/2 (ERK1/2) using PD98059 significantly downregulated constitutive MMP-9 release. In contrast, blockage of p38 kinase activity by addition of SB203580 or SB202190, as well as inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) using L-JNK-I1, clearly augmented MMP-9 expression and secretion by an upregulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, exogenously added TNF-alpha augmented MMP-9 synthesis and secretion in THP-1 cells via enhancement of ERK1/2 activity. Taken together, our results indicate that ERK1/2 activity plays a pivotal role in TNF-alpha-induced MMP-9 production and demonstrate its negative modulation by p38 and JNK activity. These findings suggest ERK1/2 rather than p38 and JNK as a reasonable target to specifically block MMP-9 expression using MAPK inhibitors in therapeutic applications.","['Heidinger, Michael', 'Kolb, Helmut', 'Krell, Hans-Willi', 'Jochum, Marianne', 'Ries, Christian']","['Heidinger M', 'Kolb H', 'Krell HW', 'Jochum M', 'Ries C']","['Division of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Biochemistry, Surgical Department of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, D-80336 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Autocrine Communication/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism/pharmacology']",2006/02/25 09:00,2006/04/18 09:00,['2006/02/25 09:00'],"['2006/02/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/BC.2006.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Chem. 2006 Jan;387(1):69-78. doi: 10.1515/BC.2006.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The value of the Coombs' test (CT) has been questioned, but detailed surveys of its use are lacking. The objective of this study was to describe 19 cats with primary IMHA (pIMHA) and to examine the diagnostic value of the direct CT. The CT was performed in 92 cats; it was negative in 5 healthy, in 9 sick nonanemic, and in 55 cats with different types of anemia. The CT was positive in 18 anemic cats (2 feline leukemia virus (FeLV) positive, 1 with cholangiohepatitis, 15 with no underlying disease). Moreover, agglutination persisted after saline washing in 5 anemic cats (1 lymphoma, 4 pIMHA). Inclusion criteria for pIMHA were a positive CT (15) or persistent agglutination (4), and the exclusion of other diseases. The age of the 19 cats ranged from 0.5 to 9 years (median, 2 years); male cats were overrepresented. The PCV on admission was 6-22% (median, 12%). The anemia was nonregenerative in 11 cats. Additional abnormal laboratory results were leukocytosis (2), lymphocytosis (6), hyperbilirubinemia (13), hyperglobulimemia (10), and increased liver enzyme activities (10). Initial treatment consisted of blood transfusions (10), crystalloids (11), prednisolone (19), antibiotics (19), and H2-blockers (11).

In response to great public concern, the World Health Organization urged that further epidemiologic studies be conducted in high-exposure areas such as Japan. We conducted a population-based case-control study, which covered areas inhabited by 54% of Japanese children. We analyzed 312 case children (0-15 years old) newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) in 1999-2001 (2.3 years) and 603 controls matched for gender, age and residential area. Weekly mean MF level was determined for the child's bedroom. MF measurements in each set of a case and controls were carried out as closely in time as possible to control for seasonal variation. We evaluated the association using conditional logistic regression models. The odds ratios for children whose bedrooms had MF levels of 0.4 microT or higher compared with the reference category (MF levels below 0.1 microT) was 2.6 (95% CI=0.76-8.6) for AML+ALL and 4.7 (1.15-19.0) for ALL only. Controlling for some possible confounding factors did not alter the results appreciably. Even an analysis in which selection bias was maximized did not fully explain the association. Most of the leukemia cases in the highest exposure category had MF levels far above 0.4 microT. Our results provided additional evidence that high MF exposure was associated with a higher risk of childhood leukemia, particularly of ALL.","['Kabuto, Michinori', 'Nitta, Hiroshi', 'Yamamoto, Seiichiro', 'Yamaguchi, Naohito', 'Akiba, Suminori', 'Honda, Yasushi', 'Hagihara, Jun', 'Isaka, Katsuo', 'Saito, Tomohiro', 'Ojima, Toshiyuki', 'Nakamura, Yosikazu', 'Mizoue, Tetsuya', 'Ito, Satoko', 'Eboshida, Akira', 'Yamazaki, Shin', 'Sokejima, Shigeru', 'Kurokawa, Yoshika', 'Kubo, Osami']","['Kabuto M', 'Nitta H', 'Yamamoto S', 'Yamaguchi N', 'Akiba S', 'Honda Y', 'Hagihara J', 'Isaka K', 'Saito T', 'Ojima T', 'Nakamura Y', 'Mizoue T', 'Ito S', 'Eboshida A', 'Yamazaki S', 'Sokejima S', 'Kurokawa Y', 'Kubo O']","['National Institute for Environmental Studies, Ibaraki, Japan. kabuto@nies.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Geography', 'Housing/standards', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/07/29 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21374 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Aug 1;119(3):643-50. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21374.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

However, the pathogenesis of PTHrP-independent hypercalcemia remains unclear.

Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 were markedly elevated, whereas 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D(3), intact PTH and PTHrP were decreased or undetected. Analysis of urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPY) or bone biopsy of the osteolytic lesion showed an increased bone resorption, and administration of bisphosphonate improved the hypercalcemia. Patients had ALL with immunophenotype positive for CD10, CD34, and HLA-DR but negative for CD19 and obtained remission with chemotherapy.

The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between HAMA and survival in patients given a mouse anti-lymphoma monoclonal antibody (mAb), Lym-1, directed against a unique epitope of HLA-DR antigen that is up-regulated on malignant B-cells. METHODS: ELISA was used to quantify HAMA in 51 patients with B-cell malignancies treated with iodine-131 (131I) labeled Lym-1. Sera were collected prior to and following radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with 131I-Lym-1 until documented to be HAMA negative or throughout lifetime. Univariate, then multivariate analyses including other risk factors, were used to analyze the relationship of HAMA to survival. The relationships of HAMA to prior chemotherapies and to absolute lymphocyte counts prior to RIT were also assessed. RESULTS: Eighteen of 51 patients (35%) developed HAMA following RIT (range of ultimate maximum titers, 6.6-1,802 microg/ml). Using the time dependent Cox proportional hazards model, maximum HAMA titers were associated with survival (P=0.02). HAMA continued to be significant for survival in multivariate analyses that included known risk factors. In Landmark analysis of 39 patients that survived at least 16 weeks, median survival of patients with HAMA less than 5 microg/ml was 61 versus 103 weeks for patients with HAMA equal or greater than 5 microg/ml at 16 weeks (P=0.02). The median survival of the five patients with highest maximum HAMA titers was 244 weeks. At 16 weeks, there was an inverse correlation between the maximum HAMA titer and the number of previous chemotherapies (P<0.003). Absolute lymphocyte counts prior to 131I-Lym-1 treatment for patients that seroconverted were higher than those for patients that did not seroconvert (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with B-cell malignancies that developed high HAMA titers had longer survival that was not explained by risk factors or histologic grade, suggesting the importance of the immune system.","['Azinovic, Ignacio', 'DeNardo, Gerald L', 'Lamborn, Kathleen R', 'Mirick, Gary', 'Goldstein, Desiree', 'Bradt, Bonnie M', 'DeNardo, Sally J']","['Azinovic I', 'DeNardo GL', 'Lamborn KR', 'Mirick G', 'Goldstein D', 'Bradt BM', 'DeNardo SJ']","['Department of Radiotherapy, Hospital San Jaime, Torrevieja, 03180, Alicante, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Heterophile)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Lym-1 monoclonal antibody)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Heterophile/*blood', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2005/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-006-0148-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2006 Dec;55(12):1451-8. doi: 10.1007/s00262-006-0148-4.

They possess antiinflammatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. In the report presented, antiproliferative effects and leukemia cell growth and apoptosis modulating activities of ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA) were investigated. Both triterpenoids are inhibitors of leukemia cell growth and inductors of apoptosis. However, when applied in combination with anthracycline antitumor antibiotic doxorubicin (Dox), UA and OA diversely modulate therapeutic efficacy of Dox, due to different antioxidant activities. Compare to OA showing synergism/additive effect with Dox, UA (stronger antioxidant) acts antagonistically and reduces leukemia cell growth inhibiting and differentiation effects induced by Dox. In conclusion, these findings suggest that although triterpenoids UA and OA can induce apoptosis, their antioxidant activities can interfere with the therapeutic effect of antitumor antibiotic Dox which mechanism of action is attributed to the production of reactive oxygen species.","['Cipak, Lubos', 'Grausova, Lubica', 'Miadokova, Eva', 'Novotny, Ladislav', 'Rauko, Peter']","['Cipak L', 'Grausova L', 'Miadokova E', 'Novotny L', 'Rauko P']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, 833-91 Bratislava, Slovakia. exoncip@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'P3M2575F3F (ursolic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/pathology', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oleanolic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/09/01 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2005/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00204-006-0072-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2006 Jul;80(7):429-35. doi: 10.1007/s00204-006-0072-6.

Such a coexistence of both host and donor hematopoietic cells may influence posttransplant alloreactivity and may affect the occurrence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as well as the intensity of the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Here we evaluated the relation between chimerism state after reduced-intensity conditioning transplantation (RICT), autoantibody production, and chronic GVHD (cGVHD)-related pathology. METHODS: Chimerism state, circulating anticardiolipin, and antidouble stranded DNA autoantibody (Ab) titers as well as occurrence of cGVHD-like lesions were investigated in a murine RICT model. RESULTS: We observed a novel association between mixed chimerism state, high levels of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies, and subsequent development of cGVHD-like lesions. Furthermore, we found that the persistence of host B cells, but not dendritic cell origin or subset, was a factor associated with the appearance of cGVHD-like lesions. The implication of host B cells was confirmed by a host origin of autoantibodies. CONCLUSION: Recipient B cell persistence may contribute to the frequency and/or severity of cGVHD after RICT.","['Perruche, Sylvain', 'Marandin, Aliette', 'Kleinclauss, Francois', 'Angonin, Regis', 'Fresnay, Stephanie', 'Baron, Marie Helene', 'Tiberghien, Pierre', 'Saas, Philippe']","['Perruche S', 'Marandin A', 'Kleinclauss F', 'Angonin R', 'Fresnay S', 'Baron MH', 'Tiberghien P', 'Saas P']","['INSERM U645, University of Franche-Comte, EFSB-FC, IFR133, Besancon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Interleukin-13/blood', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Transplantation Chimera/*immunology']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.tp.0000183878.53367.77 [doi]', '00007890-200602270-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2006 Feb 27;81(4):573-82. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000183878.53367.77.,,,,PMC3414374,,,['HALMS469249'],,,,['NLM: HALMS469249'],,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective single-arm multicentre study. SETTING: Five designated children cancer units of the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Children aged between 1 and 17.9 years with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia seen from November 1997 to December 2002. INTERVENTION: Chemotherapy was modified from a German Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster 95 (BFM95) protocol that included a delayed intensification similar to the induction phase repeated 5 months after diagnosis. High-risk patients were given double delayed intensification. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall survival and event-free survival of the whole group and the three risk groups (standard-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups), and comparison with historical controls. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients were recruited with a median age at diagnosis of 5.57 years (range, 1.15-17.85 years). The induction remission rate was 95.3% and non-leukaemia mortality during remission was 2.3%. At 4 years, the relapse rate of this (HKALL97) study was significantly lower than that of the HKALL93 study (15.7 vs 37.3%; P<0.001). The 4-year overall survival of HKALL97 and HKALL93 studies were 86.5% and 81.8%, respectively (P=0.51). The 4-year event-free survival for HKALL97 and HKALL93 studies were 79% and 65%, respectively (P=0.007). Nonetheless the difference of event-free survival was most remarkable in the intermediate-risk group: 75.6% and 53.1% for HKALL97 and HKALL93 studies, respectively (P=0.06). CONCLUSION: A more intensive delayed consolidation phase improved the outcome for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia by reducing relapses at 4 years.

To determine if there were any overall changes in metalloprotein distribution or metal concentration during the process of macrophage differentiation we induced human myeloid HL-60 leukemia cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and quantitatively mapped their metal content using hard X-ray fluorescence micro-analysis. We found a transient increase in the zinc content of HL-60 cell nuclei during the early stages of differentiation induction. This finding was confirmed by spectrofluorometry in HL-60 cells and extended to U-937 leukemia cells. A role for protein kinase C-beta (PKC-beta) in this process was established by examining zinc content in an HL-60 variant, HL-525, which is PKC-beta deficient, and in HL-525 cells in which PKC-beta was restored by stable overexpression. Chemical chelation of both Cu and Zn served to inhibit macrophage differentiation in HL-60 cells, indicating a requirement for these metals during this process. Finally, we demonstrate that growth of HL-60 cells in a low-zinc environment removes their susceptibility to PMA-induced differentiation, and that this capacity can be partially restored by the addition of exogenous zinc.","['Glesne, David', 'Vogt, Stefan', 'Maser, Jorg', 'Legnini, Daniel', 'Huberman, Eliezer']","['Glesne D', 'Vogt S', 'Maser J', 'Legnini D', 'Huberman E']","['Biosciences Division, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 S Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60439, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Struct Biol,Journal of structural biology,9011206,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trace Elements)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Electron Probe Microanalysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Variation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/chemistry/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Myeloid Cells/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Trace Elements/metabolism', 'Zinc/metabolism/*physiology']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/08/31 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2005/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1047-8477(05)00201-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jsb.2005.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Struct Biol. 2006 Jul;155(1):2-11. doi: 10.1016/j.jsb.2005.09.012.

The deregulated (permanent) kinase activity of Bcr-Abl leads to continuous proliferation of K562 cells and their resistance to the apoptosis promotion by conventional drugs. The photodynamic treatment (PDT) based on the application of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and irradiation with blue light (ALA-PDT) resulted in the suppression of K562 cells proliferation. It was followed by a necrosis-like cell death [K. Kuzelova, D. Grebenova, M. Pluskalova, I. Marinov, Z. Hrkal, J. Photochem. Photobiol. B 73 (2004) 67-78]. ALA-PDT led to the perturbation of the Hsp90/p23 multichaperone complex of which the Bcr-Abl is the client protein. Bcr-Abl protein was suppressed whereas the bcr-abl mRNA level was not affected. Further on, we observed several changes in the cytoskeleton organization. We detected ALA-PDT-mediated disruption of filamental actin structure using FITC-Phalloidin staining. In connection with this we uncovered certain cytoskeleton organizing proteins involved in the cell response to the treatment. Among these proteins, Septin2, which plays a role in maintaining actin bundles, was suppressed. Another one, PDZ-LIM domain protein 1 (CLP36) was altered. This protein acts as an adaptor molecule for LIM-kinase which phosphorylates and thus inactivates cofilin. Cofilin was indeed dephosphorylated and could thus be activated and operate as an actin-depolymerizing factor. We propose the scheme of molecular response of K562 cells to ALA-PDT.","['Pluskalova, Michaela', 'Peslova, Gabriela', 'Grebenova, Dana', 'Halada, Petr', 'Hrkal, Zbynek']","['Pluskalova M', 'Peslova G', 'Grebenova D', 'Halada P', 'Hrkal Z']","['Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 12880 Prague 2, Czech Republic. pluskalm@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

The use of arsenic for treating solid tumors, particularly in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, has been extensively studied. Here, we report that arsenite-resistant human lung cancer CL3R15 cells constitutively overexpress NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), an enzyme responsible for activation of mitomycin C (MMC), and are more susceptible to MMC cytotoxicity than parental CL3 cells. The effects of arsenite pretreatment on NQO1 induction were examined in CL3, H1299, H460, and MC-T2 cells. Arsenite pretreatment significantly enhanced the expression of NQO1 and susceptibility to MMC in CL3, H1299, and MC-T2 cells, but not in H460 cells that express high endogenous levels of NQO1. Alternatively, arsenic pretreatment reduced adriamycin sensitivity of CL3 cells. Arsenite-mediated MMC susceptibility was abrogated by dicumarol (DIC), an NQO1 inhibitor, indicating that NQO1 is one of the key regulators of arsenite-mediated MMC susceptibility. Various cancer cell lines showed different basal levels of NQO1 activity and a different capacity for NQO1 induction in response to arsenite treatment. However, overall, there was a positive correlation between induced NQO1 activity and MMC susceptibility in cells pretreated with various doses of arsenite. These results suggest that arsenite may increase NQO1 activity and thus enhance the antineoplastic activity of MMC. In addition, our results also showed that inhibition of NQO1 activity by DIC reversed the arsenite resistance of CL3R15 cells.","['Lin, Yi-Ling', 'Ho, I-Ching', 'Su, Pei-Fen', 'Lee, Te-Chang']","['Lin YL', 'Ho IC', 'Su PF', 'Lee TC']","['Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenites)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Mitomycin/*pharmacology', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*biosynthesis']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2005/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(06)00029-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2006.01.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2006 Aug 1;214(3):309-17. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2006.01.004.

This oncogene has been the focus of extensive research. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the haematological malignancy are not fully understood. The main objective of the current study was to identify novel transcriptional targets of Bcr-Abl. METHODS: In order to achieve this, microarrays were employed in order to conduct a genome-wide expression analysis comparing 32D cells with a transfected clone expressing high levels of p210 Bcr-Abl. Quantitative RT-PCR was employed in order to confirm the observed increase/decrease in expression for a number of the deregulated genes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This comparison identified 138 genes of known function showing altered expression in response to Bcr-Abl-mediated signalling. Among the genes found to be upregulated in response to p210 Bcr-Abl were aldolase 1A and phosphofructokinase, both of which encode key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. As a consequence of this, we demonstrate that the rate of glycolysis is significantly increased in Bcr-Abl expressing cells in a PI3K-dependent manner. Our results also indicate altered expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, cell adhesion and cell signalling.","['Hickey, Fionnuala B', 'Cotter, Thomas G']","['Hickey FB', 'Cotter TG']","['Department of Biochemistry, Biosciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110 subunit, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Clone Cells', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glycolysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/06/15 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH629 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00629.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 May;76(5):369-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00629.x.

Several studies have indicated that genetically determined low serum levels of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a component of innate immunity, are associated with increased risk for infections in patients receiving chemotherapy. Thus, these patients have been proposed to be candidates for MBL replacement therapy. METHODS: In a population-based cohort of 137 children with ALL treated at a single pediatric hematology-oncology center with an almost identical chemotherapy regimen, we studied the relationship between polymorphisms in the MBL gene (MBL2) and the MBL2 promoter and the risk of infections during the first 50 d of induction therapy. RESULTS: No increased frequency of infection was seen for the children with genotypes encoding serum low levels of MBL. A higher incidence of fever (P < 0.004), infectious events (P = 0.025), days with neutropenia (P < 0.001) and a higher frequency of antimicrobial therapy (P = 0.0007) were seen in the young age group (<2.5 yr) compared with the older age group (> or =2.5 yr), independent of the MBL genotype. CONCLUSIONS: MBL deficiency did not influence the frequency of infections in children receiving induction chemotherapy for ALL, not even in the youngest children (<2.5 yr) whom we found to have the highest risk for infections.","['Lausen, Birgitte', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Andreassen, Bente', 'Madsen, Hans O', 'Garred, Peter']","['Lausen B', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Andreassen B', 'Madsen HO', 'Garred P']","['Pediatric Clinic II, Juliane Marie Centre, H:S Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. lausen@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (MBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Allopurinol/administration & dosage', 'Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Candidiasis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fever/epidemiology', 'Fungemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Mannose-Binding Lectin/*deficiency/genetics', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/07/20 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH632 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00632.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Jun;76(6):481-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2006.00632.x.

At 2 days postirradiation, the decrease in parathyroid hormone-related protein and parathyroid hormone receptor 1 expression in the irradiated growth plate transitional and hypertrophic zones was reversed in both of the combination groups but persisted in the groups treated with the individual drugs. By 2 weeks, positive findings unique to the combination-treatment animals included greater mean proliferation in the irradiated growth plate than on the contralateral side, smaller limb length discrepancies, reversal of the increased overall matrix area fraction, and reversal of the usual deficiency in Indian hedgehog staining in the irradiated hypertrophic zone. While all treatments had a positive effect in reversing the decrease in B-cell leukemia 2 protein and coincident increase in Bax previously observed 2 weeks postirradiation, the two combination groups had a more robust effect. Combinations of radioprotectors may achieve their beneficial additive effects in the growth plate by decreasing the usual early drop in parathyroid hormone-related protein and parathyroid hormone receptor 1 after irradiation, resulting in a cascade of parathyroid hormone-related protein-mediated events.","['Damron, Timothy A', 'Horton, Jason A', 'Naqvi, Asghar', 'Loomis, Richard M', 'Margulies, Bryan S', 'Strauss, Judith A', 'Farnum, Cornelia E', 'Spadaro, Joseph A']","['Damron TA', 'Horton JA', 'Naqvi A', 'Loomis RM', 'Margulies BS', 'Strauss JA', 'Farnum CE', 'Spadaro JA']","['Department of Orthopedic Surgery, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210, USA. damront@upstate.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Parathyroid Hormone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Extremities/anatomy & histology/radiation effects', 'Growth Plate/cytology/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/*metabolism', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Parathyroid Hormone/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/04/13 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['RR3504 [pii]', '10.1667/rr3504.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2006 Mar;165(3):350-8. doi: 10.1667/rr3504.1.,['CA83892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, most animal studies did not find a correlation between magnetic-field exposure and hematopoietic diseases. The present study was performed to investigate whether chronic, high-level (1 mT) magnetic-field exposure had an influence on lymphoma development in a mouse strain that is genetically predisposed to thymic lymphoblastic lymphoma. Three groups of 160 unrestrained female AKR/J mice were sham-exposed or exposed to sinusoidal 50 Hz magnetic fields beginning at the age of 12 weeks for 32 weeks, 7 days per week, either for 24 h per day or only during nighttime (12 h). Exposure was carried out in a blind design. Exposure did not affect survival time, body weight, lymphoma development or hematological parameters. The resulting data do not support the hypothesis that exposure to sinusoidal 50 Hz magnetic fields is a significant risk factor for hematopoietic diseases, even at this relatively high exposure level.","['Sommer, Angela M', 'Lerchl, Alexander']","['Sommer AM', 'Lerchl A']","['School of Engineering and Science, International University Bremen, Bremen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Female', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/*pathology/prevention & control', '*Magnetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Organ Size', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Thymus Gland/pathology']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/04/13 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['RR3513 [pii]', '10.1667/rr3513.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2006 Mar;165(3):343-9. doi: 10.1667/rr3513.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no case of leukemia in mice treated with diethylnitrosamine. Nitrosoethylurea induced 3-more often lung adenomas than diethylnitrosamine. Phenobarbital and thyroxine did not affect development of either leukemias or lung adenomas. By contrast, phenobarbital significantly elevated the number and size of hepatic lesions, whereas thyroxine markedly decreased them in all the experiments. The total and free thyroxine levels were significantly decreased in the blood of mice given phenobarbital and increased in mice given thyroxine. The data obtained indicate that thyroid hormones suppress tumor development in the mouse liver and that the promotion of hepatic tumoro-genesis by phenobarbital is presumably caused by the elimination of this suppressing effect of the thyroid hormones.","['Kaledin, V I', ""Il'nitskaia, S I"", 'Baginskaia, N V', ""Kholodar', A V"", 'Obut, T A']","['Kaledin VI', ""Il'nitskaia SI"", 'Baginskaia NV', ""Kholodar' AV"", 'Obut TA']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Ross Fiziol Zh Im I M Sechenova,Rossiiskii fiziologicheskii zhurnal imeni I.M.

Identification of cell status by less time-consuming methods can be extremely useful in patient management and treatment. This study aims at evaluating the potentials of vibrational spectroscopic methods to perform cell typing and to differentiate between sensitive and resistant human cancer cell lines, in particular those that exhibit the MDR phenotype. Micro-Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra have been acquired from the sensitive promyelocytic HL60 leukemia cell line and two of its subclones resistant to doxorubicin (HL60/DOX) and daunorubicin (HL60/DNR), and from the sensitive MCF7 breast cancer cell line and its MDR counterpart resistant to verapamil (MCF7/VP). Principal components analysis (PCA) was employed for spectral comparison and classification. Our data show that cell typing was feasible with both methods, giving two distinct clusters for HL60- and MCF7-sensitive cells. In addition, phenotyping of HL60 cells, i.e., discriminating between the sensitive and MDR phenotypes, was attempted by both methods. FTIR could not only delineate between the sensitive and resistant HL60 cells, but also gave two distinct clusters for the resistant cells, which required a two-step procedure with Raman spectra. In the case of MCF7 cell lines, both the sensitive and resistant phenotypes could be differentiated very efficiently by PCA analysis of their FTIR and Raman point spectra. These results indicate the prospective applicability of FTIR and micro-Raman approaches in the differentiation of cell types as well as characterization of the cell status, such as the MDR phenotype exhibited in resistant leukemia cell lines like HL60 and MCF7.","['Krishna, C Murali', 'Kegelaer, Gregory', 'Adt, Isabelle', 'Rubin, Sylvain', 'Kartha, Vasudevan B', 'Manfait, Michel', 'Sockalingum, Ganesh D']","['Krishna CM', 'Kegelaer G', 'Adt I', 'Rubin S', 'Kartha VB', 'Manfait M', 'Sockalingum GD']","['Unite MeDIAN, CNRS UMR 6142, UFR Pharmacie, Universite de Reims, 51, rue Cognacq-Jay, 51906, Reims, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biopolymers,Biopolymers,0372525,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared/*methods', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman/*methods', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bip.20485 [doi]'],ppublish,Biopolymers. 2006 Aug 5;82(5):462-70. doi: 10.1002/bip.20485.,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Candida species are an increasingly important cause of infection among patients in intensive care units. Mold infections continue to occur predominantly among highly immunosuppressed patients, such as those who have acute leukemia and those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation. Aspergillus species remain the most common molds to cause invasive infection, but other environmental molds, such as Scedosporium, Fusarium, and various zygomycetes, including Rhizopus and Mucor, appear to be increasing in some medical centers. We now have available a new class of antifungal agents, the echinocandins, that act to damage the cell walls of Candida and Aspergillus species. Although limited in spectrum and only available in intravenous formulations, these agents are very safe and extremely well tolerated. Another new agent is the expanded spectrum triazole voriconazole. This agent has a very broad spectrum of activity, is available in both oral and intravenous formulations, and is approved for treatment of aspergillosis, other molds, and candidiasis. The major drawbacks with voriconazole are the number of drug-drug interactions and side effects, including rash, hepatitis, and visual disturbances. Treatment with amphotericin B, long the mainstay of antifungal therapy despite its inherent toxicity, is required much less often since the introduction of these new antifungal agents.","['Kauffman, Carol A']",['Kauffman CA'],"['University of Michigan Medical School; and Infectious Diseases Section, Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105, USA. ckauff@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Proc Am Thorac Soc,Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society,101203596,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fungi/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', '*Mycoses/diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/07/04 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['3/1/35 [pii]', '10.1513/pats.200510-110JH [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Am Thorac Soc. 2006;3(1):35-40. doi: 10.1513/pats.200510-110JH.,,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structural basis for recruitment specificity is poorly understood but could be exploited to selectively target deleterious G-CSFR-mediated signaling events such as aberrant Stat3 activation demonstrated in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia patients with poor prognosis. Recombinant Stat3 bound to G-CSFR phosphotyrosine peptide ligands pY704VLQ and pY744LRC with similar kinetics. Testing of three models for Stat3 Src homology 2-pY ligand binding in vitro and in vivo revealed unique determinants for Stat3 recruitment and activation by the G-CSFR, the side chain of Stat3 R609, which interacts with the pY ligand phosphate group, and the peptide amide hydrogen of E638, which bonds with oxygen/sulfur within the + 3 Q/C side chain of the pY ligand when it assumes a beta turn. Thus, our findings identify for the first time the structural basis for recruitment and activation of Stat3 by the G-CSFR and reveal unique features of this interaction that can be exploited to target Stat3 activation for the treatment of a subset of acute myeloid leukemia patients.","['Shao, Huang', 'Xu, Xuejun', 'Jing, Naijie', 'Tweardy, David J']","['Shao H', 'Xu X', 'Jing N', 'Tweardy DJ']","['Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Arginine/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Computational Biology', 'Glutamic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lysine/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Phosphopeptides/*physiology', 'Phosphotyrosine/*metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['176/5/2933 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.176.5.2933 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Mar 1;176(5):2933-41. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.176.5.2933.,['R01 CA86430/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 1996 to 2000, we conducted a prospective study to determine the incidence and outcomes of children with TEL/AML1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Children with newly diagnosed ALL were treated on DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 95-01. Patients were risk stratified primarily by current National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Rome risk criteria. With a median follow-up of 5.2 years, the 5-year event-free survival for TEL/AML1-positive patients was 89% compared with 80% for TEL/AML1-negative B-precursor patients (P = .05). The 5-year overall survival rate was 97% among TEL/AML-positive patients compared with 89% among TEL/AML1-negative patients (P = .03).

Most studies have employed Stat5a/b-deficient mice where gene targeting disrupted the first protein-coding exon, resulting in the expression of N-terminally truncated forms of Stat5a/b (Stat5a/b(DeltaN/DeltaN) mice). We have now reanalyzed lymphoid development in Stat5a/b(null/null) mice having a complete deletion of the Stat5a/b gene locus. The few surviving Stat5a/b(null/null) mice lacked CD8(+) T lymphocytes. A massive reduction of CD8(+) T cells was also found in Stat5a/b(fl/fl) lck-cre transgenic animals. While gammadelta T-cell receptor-positive (gammadeltaTCR(+)) cells were expressed at normal levels in Stat5a/b(DeltaN/DeltaN) mice, they were completely absent in Stat5a/b(null/null) animals. Moreover, B-cell maturation was abrogated at the pre-pro-B-cell stage in Stat5a/b(null/null) mice, whereas Stat5a/b(DeltaN/DeltaN) B-lymphoid cells developed to the early pro-B-cell stage. In vitro assays using fetal liver-cell cultures confirmed this observation. Most strikingly, Stat5a/b(null/null) cells were resistant to transformation and leukemia development induced by Abelson oncogenes, whereas Stat5a/b(DeltaN/DeltaN)-derived cells readily transformed. These findings show distinct lymphoid defects for Stat5a/b(DeltaN/DeltaN) and Stat5a/b(null/null) mice and define a novel functional role for the N-termini of Stat5a/b in B-lymphoid transformation.","['Hoelbl, Andrea', 'Kovacic, Boris', 'Kerenyi, Marc A', 'Simma, Olivia', 'Warsch, Wolfgang', 'Cui, Yongzhi', 'Beug, Hartmut', 'Hennighausen, Lothar', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Hoelbl A', 'Kovacic B', 'Kerenyi MA', 'Simma O', 'Warsch W', 'Cui Y', 'Beug H', 'Hennighausen L', 'Moriggl R', 'Sexl V']","['Institute of Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat5b protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Fetus/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, abl/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Quantitative Trait Loci/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/deficiency/*metabolism']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63375-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-09-3596 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jun 15;107(12):4898-906. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-09-3596.

FA is a chromosome instability syndrome characterized by childhood-onset aplastic anemia, cancer or leukemia susceptibility, and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Identification of 11 genes for FA has led to progress in the molecular understanding of this disease. FA proteins, including a ubiquitin ligase (FANCL), a monoubiquitinated protein (FANCD2), a helicase (FANCJ/BACH1/BRIP1), and a breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility protein (FANCD1/BRCA2), appear to cooperate in a pathway leading to the recognition and repair of damaged DNA. Molecular interactions among FA proteins and responsible proteins for other chromosome instability syndromes (BLM, NBS1, MRE11, ATM, and ATR) have also been found. Furthermore, inactivation of FA genes has been observed in a wide variety of human cancers in the general population. These findings have broad implications for predicting the sensitivity and resistance of tumors to widely used anticancer DNA crosslinking agents (cisplatin, mitomycin C, and melphalan).

Groups were similar except that chemotherapy recipients were younger (median age, 5 versus 8 years) and less likely to have combined marrow and extramedullary relapse (19% versus 30%). To adjust for time-to-transplant bias, treatment outcomes were compared using left-truncated Cox regression models. The relative efficacy of chemotherapy and transplantation depended on time from diagnosis to first relapse and the transplant conditioning regimen used. For children with early first relapse (< 36 months), risk of a second relapse was significantly lower after total body irradiation (TBI)-containing transplant regimens (relative risk [RR], 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.71, P < .001) than chemotherapy regimens. In contrast, for children with a late first relapse (> or = 36 months), risks of second relapse were similar after TBI-containing regimens and chemotherapy (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.49-1.70, P = .78).

RESULTS: Plasma CRP level was higher in cancer cases than controls (odds ratio for increase in CRP level of 3.2 mg/L, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.32): The corresponding odds ratio after exclusion of the first year of follow-up and of individuals with CRP level above 20 mg/L was 1.32 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.52). Although based on small number of cases, the association between elevated plasma CRP level and risk was stronger for cancers of the liver, lung, skin, kidney, and bladder, as well as for lymphoma and leukemia than for other neoplasms.

The treatment outcome for DS-AMKL is more favorable than for AMKL in non-DS patients. To gain insight into gene expression differences in AMKL, we compared 24 DS and 39 non-DS AMKL samples. We found that non-DS-AMKL samples cluster in two groups, characterized by differences in expression of HOX/TALE family members. Both of these groups are distinct from DS-AMKL, independent of chromosome 21 gene expression. To explore alterations of the GATA1 transcriptome, we used cross-species comparison with genes regulated by GATA1 expression in murine erythroid precursors. Genes repressed after GATA1 induction in the murine system, most notably GATA-2, MYC, and KIT, show increased expression in DS-AMKL, suggesting that GATA1s fail to repress this class of genes. Only a subset of genes that are up-regulated upon GATA1 induction in the murine system show increased expression in DS-AMKL, including GATA1 and BACH1, a probable negative regulator of megakaryocytic differentiation located on chromosome 21. Surprisingly, expression of the chromosome 21 gene RUNX1, a known regulator of megakaryopoiesis, was not elevated in DS-AMKL.

We demonstrate that PML nuclear bodies partition via mitotic accumulations of PML protein (MAPPs), which are distinct from PML nuclear bodies in their dynamics, biochemistry and structure. During mitosis PML nuclear bodies lose biochemical components such as SUMO-1 and Sp100. We demonstrate that MAPPs are also devoid of Daxx and these biochemical changes occur prior to chromatin condensation and coincide with the loss of nuclear membrane integrity. MAPPs are highly mobile, yet do not readily exchange PML protein as demonstrated by fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP). A subset of MAPPs remains associated with mitotic chromosomes, providing a possible nucleation site for PML nuclear body formation in G1. As the nuclear envelope reforms in late anaphase, these nascent PML nuclear bodies accumulate components sequentially, for example Sp100 and SUMO-1 before Daxx. After cytokinesis, MAPPs remain in the cytoplasm long after the reincorporation of splicing components and their disappearance coincides with new PML nuclear body formation even in the absence of new protein synthesis. The PML protein within MAPPs is not degraded during mitosis but is recycled to contribute to the formation of new PML nuclear bodies in daughter nuclei. The recycling of PML protein from one cell cycle to the next via mitotic accumulations may represent a common mechanism for the partitioning of other nuclear bodies during mitosis.","['Dellaire, Graham', 'Eskiw, Christopher H', 'Dehghani, Hesam', 'Ching, Reagan W', 'Bazett-Jones, David P']","['Dellaire G', 'Eskiw CH', 'Dehghani H', 'Ching RW', 'Bazett-Jones DP']","['Programme in Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/physiology', 'Autoantigens/physiology', 'Chromatin/physiology', 'G1 Phase/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Mitosis/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Matrix/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcs.02817 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.02817 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2006 Mar 15;119(Pt 6):1034-42. doi: 10.1242/jcs.02817.

Activation can be mediated by one of five membrane-bound ligands of either the Delta-like (-1, -2, -4) or Jagged/Serrate (-1, -2) families. Alternatively, dissociation of the Notch heterodimer with consequent activation can also be mediated experimentally by calcium chelators or by mutations that destabilize the Notch1 heterodimer, such as in the human disease T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we show that MAGP-2, a protein present on microfibrils, can also interact with the EGF-like repeats of Notch1. Co-expression of MAGP-2 with Notch1 leads to both cell surface release of the Notch1 extracellular domain and subsequent activation of Notch signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of MAGP-2 is required for binding and activation of Notch1. Based on the high level of homology, we predicted and further showed that MAGP-1 can also bind to Notch1, cause the release of the extracellular domain, and activate signaling. Notch1 extracellular domain release induced by MAGP-2 is dependent on formation of the Notch1 heterodimer by a furin-like cleavage, but does not require the subsequent ADAM metalloprotease cleavage necessary for production of the Notch signaling fragment. Together these results demonstrate for the first time that the microfibrillar proteins MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 can function outside of their role in elastic fibers to activate a cellular signaling pathway.","['Miyamoto, Alison', 'Lau, Rhiana', 'Hein, Patrick W', 'Shipley, J Michael', 'Weinmaster, Gerry']","['Miyamoto A', 'Lau R', 'Hein PW', 'Shipley JM', 'Weinmaster G']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Contractile Proteins)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MFAP5 protein, human)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (microfibrillar protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotinylation', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Contractile Proteins/*physiology', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Dimerization', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Ligands', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Receptor, Notch1/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/06/06 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)56358-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M600298200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Apr 14;281(15):10089-97. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M600298200.

Wilms' tumor1 (WT1) protein is highly expressed in leukemic blast cells of myeloid and lymphoid origin. Thus, WT1 mRNA serves as a tumor marker for leukemias detection and monitoring disease progression. Curcumin is well known for its anti-cancer property. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of curcumin on WT1 gene expression in patient leukemic cells. The leukemic cells were collected from 70 childhood leukemia patients admitted at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand, in the period July 2003 to February 2005. There were 58 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 10 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), and 2 cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). There were 41 males and 29 females ranging from 1 to 15 years old. Leukemic cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 mM curcumin for 48 h. WT1 mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. The result showed that curcumin reduced WT1 gene expression in the cells from 35 patients (50%). It affected the WT1 gene expression in 4 of 8 relapsed cases (50%), 12 of 24 cases of drug maintenance (50%), 7 of 16 cases of completed treatment (44%), and 12 of 22 cases of new patients (54%). The basal expression levels of WT1 gene in leukemic patient cells as compared to that of K562 cells were classified as low level (1-20%) in 6 of 20 cases (30%), medium level (21-60%) in 12 of 21 cases (57%), and high level (61-100%) in 17 of 23 cases (74%). In summary, curcumin decreased WT1 mRNA in patient leukemic cells. Thus, curcumin treatment may provide a lead for clinical treatment in leukemic patients in the future.","['Anuchapreeda, Songyot', 'Limtrakul, Pornngarm', 'Thanarattanakorn, Pattra', 'Sittipreechacharn, Somjai', 'Chanarat, Prasit']","['Anuchapreeda S', 'Limtrakul P', 'Thanarattanakorn P', 'Sittipreechacharn S', 'Chanarat P']","['Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand. songyot@chiangmai.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/04/04 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02977473 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2006 Jan;29(1):80-7. doi: 10.1007/BF02977473.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather than embracing ""one-fits-all"" cytarabine-based chemotherapy as a standard approach for all patients, ongoing clinical research in AML focuses on drugs that target unique genomic aberrations, protein structure/functional alterations, or dysregulated cellular pathways that are specific for molecular subgroups of patients. Epigenetic modifications causing gene transcriptional repression have been associated with malignant transformation and are intriguing new targets in the treatment of AML. In contrast to genetic deletions causing irreversible loss of gene function, epigenetic gene silencing mediated by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation can be reversed via pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases, respectively. When this occurs, normal patterns of gene expression, hematopoietic differentiation, and apoptosis may be restored and disease response obtained. In this review, we focus on the clinical applicability of epigenetic targeting in the treatment of patients with AML.","['Blum, William', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Blum W', 'Marcucci G']","['The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA. william.blum@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '0 (Pyridines)', '1ZNY4FKK9H (entinostat)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Depsipeptides/therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Histones/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenylbutyrates/therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/therapeutic use', 'Valproic Acid/therapeutic use']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2005 Nov;3(11):855-65, 882.",,118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Se(0)-protein conjugates are more toxic than selenium dioxide, sodium selenite, selenomethionine, or selenocystine. They are only minimally affected by drug resistance mechanism, and they potentiate the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation and several standard chemotherapeutic agents.

The CALM/AF10 fusion protein plays a crucial role in t(10;11)(p13;q14) associated leukemogenesis. Using the N-terminal half of CALM as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, a novel protein named CATS (CALM interacting protein expressed in thymus and spleen) was identified. Multiple tissue Northern blot analysis showed predominant expression of CATS in thymus, spleen and colon. CATS codes for two protein isoforms of 238 and 248 amino acids (aa). The interaction between CALM and CATS could be confirmed using pull down assays, co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments. The CATS interaction domain of CALM was mapped to aa 221-335 of CALM. This domain is contained in the CALM/AF10 fusion protein. CATS localizes to the nucleus and shows a preference for nucleoli.

To define specific transcriptional targets in these cells, subtractive hybridization techniques were employed leading to the identification of strongly upregulated genes including OPN (osteopontin), 126MRP, and rac2. OPN is a cytokine and cell attachment protein which has been implicated in human tumor progression and metastasis, the calcium binding 126MRP protein is related to the human S100 protein family involved in invasive cell growth, and the Rac2 protein belongs to the Rho family of small GTPases regulating actin reorganization and cell migration. Promoter analysis indicated that OPN activation is mediated by a non-consensus AP-1 binding site located close to the transcription start site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptional reporter gene analyses showed that c-Fos and c-Jun bind specifically to this site and that c-Fos efficiently transactivates the OPN promoter. High-level expression of OPN, 126MRP, or Rac2 proteins from a retroviral vector led to partial cell transformation, documented by morphological changes and anchorage-independent growth. The specific activation in v-myc/v-mil(raf)-transformed cells of target genes with intrinsic oncogenic potential may provide an explanation for the longstanding observation that concomitant expression of these oncogenes leads to strongly enhanced oncogenicity in vivo and in vitro compared to cell transformation by v-myc or v-mil(raf) alone.","['Hartl, M', 'Karagiannidis, A I', 'Bister, K']","['Hartl M', 'Karagiannidis AI', 'Bister K']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck (CMBI), University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. markus.hartl@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Proteins v-raf)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (rac2 GTP-binding protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Movement/genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'Coturnix', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, jun/genetics', '*Genes, myc/genetics', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins v-raf/genetics/*metabolism', 'Osteopontin', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics/metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209441 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209441 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Jul 6;25(29):4043-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209441.

All cases had chromosome 5 alterations. Two different types of 5q loss were identified: unbalanced translocations and interstitial deletions, or del(5q), each occurring in 10 patients. The most frequent additional chromosome aberrations were -3/-3p/-3q, -7/7q-, +8, 13q-, -16, 17p-, -18/18p-, -20/20q-, and +21q, each occurring in 25%.

Unbalanced 5q translocations occurred more often in combination with monosomy 3 and 7 and with gain of 21q, whereas del(5q) was associated more often with -1p and trisomy 8. A detailed analysis of specific breakpoints and deletions revealed recurrent involvement of specific chromosomal bands harboring known tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes.

It is for this reason that research efforts have focused on the molecular dissection of recurring chromosomal rearrangements. However, even though a large number of leukemia-causing genes have been identified, the genetic basis of many ALL cases remains unknown. We and others have reasoned that novel translocations found in the leukemic cells of ALL patients may mark the location of more frequent gene rearrangements that are otherwise hidden submicroscopically within normal or complex karyotypes. Towards this end, we here describe the first reported association of a t(5;10)(q22;q24) with adult ALL.

Several frequently used techniques for designing classifiers of microarray data, such as support vector machine, neural networks, k-nearest neighbor, and logistic regression model, suffer from low interpretabilities. This paper proposes an interpretable gene expression classifier (named iGEC) with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis. The design of iGEC has three objectives to be simultaneously optimized: maximal classification accuracy, minimal number of rules, and minimal number of used genes. An ""intelligent"" genetic algorithm IGA is used to efficiently solve the design problem with a large number of tuning parameters. The performance of iGEC is evaluated using eight commonly-used data sets. It is shown that iGEC has an accurate, concise, and interpretable rule base (1.1 rules per class) on average in terms of test classification accuracy (87.9%), rule number (3.9), and used gene number (5.0). Moreover, iGEC not only has better performance than the existing fuzzy rule-based classifier in terms of the above-mentioned objectives, but also is more accurate than some existing non-rule-based classifiers.","['Ho, Shinn-Ying', 'Hsieh, Chih-Hung', 'Chen, Hung-Ming', 'Huang, Hui-Ling']","['Ho SY', 'Hsieh CH', 'Chen HM', 'Huang HL']","['Department of Biological Science and Technology, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. syho@mail.nctu.edu.tw']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Biosystems,Bio Systems,0430773,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computational Biology', '*Fuzzy Logic', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/02/24 09:00,2007/10/06 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0303-2647(06)00003-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biosystems.2006.01.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosystems. 2006 Sep;85(3):165-76. doi: 10.1016/j.biosystems.2006.01.002.

Thus, WT1 mRNA and protein serve as promising tumor markers for the detection of leukemia and monitoring of disease progression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the modulating effects of curcumin on WT1 gene expression in the human leukemic cell line K562. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of curcumin on the K562 cell line was evaluated by using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The K562 cell line was treated with a non-cytotoxic dose of curcumin (5, 10, or 15 micromol/L) for 13 d. The expression levels of WT1 protein and WT1 mRNA were assessed by Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. RESULTS: Curcumin had a cytotoxic effect on K562 leukemic cells with an inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC50) of approximately 20 microg/mL (54.3 micromol/L). Non-cytotoxic doses of curcumin, at concentrations of 5, 10, and 15 micromol/L for 2 d, decreased the level of WT1 protein and WT1 mRNA in the K562 cell line in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, curcumin at a concentration of 10 micromol/L significantly decreased the level of WT1 protein and mRNA in a time-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effects of curcumin are associated with a decrease in the levels of both WT1 protein and WT1 mRNA. The current study provides a molecular basis for future clinical trials in leukemic patients. Thus, curcumin could be a promising chemotherapeutic agent for human leukemia.","['Anuchapreeda, Songyot', 'Thanarattanakorn, Pattra', 'Sittipreechacharn, Somjai', 'Chanarat, Prasit', 'Limtrakul, Pornngarm']","['Anuchapreeda S', 'Thanarattanakorn P', 'Sittipreechacharn S', 'Chanarat P', 'Limtrakul P']","['Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Curcumin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2006/02/24 09:00,2006/10/03 09:00,['2006/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1745-7254.2006.00291.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2006 Mar;27(3):360-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7254.2006.00291.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main risk factor for all types of fungal infections in the oncology patient is prolonged and severe neutropenia; this is especially true for disseminated fungal infections. Severe neutropenia occurs most often in leukemia and lymphoma patients exposed to high-dose chemotherapy. Fungal infections in cancer patients can be further divided into five groups: (i) superficial dermatophyte infections with little potential for dissemination; (ii) superficial candidiasis; (iii) opportunistic fungal skin infections with distinct potential for dissemination; (iv) fungal sinusitis with cutaneous extension; and (v) cutaneous manifestations of disseminated fungal infections. In the oncology population, dermatophyte infections (i) and superficial candidiasis (ii) have similar presentations to those seen in the immunocompetent host. Primary cutaneous mold infections (iii) are especially caused by Aspergillus, Fusarium, Mucor, and Rhizopus spp. These infections may invade deeper tissues and cause disseminated fungal infections in the neutropenic host. Primary cutaneous mold infections are treated with systemic antifungal therapy and sometimes with debridement. The role of debridement in the severely neutropenic patient is unclear. In some patients with an invasive fungal sinusitis (iv) there may be direct extension to the overlying skin, causing a fungal cellulitis of the face. Aspergillus, Rhizopus, and Mucor spp. are the most common causes. We also describe the cutaneous manifestations of disseminated fungal infections (v). These infections usually occur in the setting of prolonged neutropenia. The most common causes are Candida, Aspergillus, and Fusarium spp. Therapy is with systemic antifungal therapy. The relative efficacies of amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin are discussed. Recovery from disseminated fungal infections is unlikely, however, unless the patient's neutropenia resolves.","['Mays, Steven R', 'Bogle, Melissa A', 'Bodey, Gerald P']","['Mays SR', 'Bogle MA', 'Bodey GP']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Texas Medical School, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.

Increased levels of the IL-6-related cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) are found in failing hearts, and we have recently shown that LIF reduces ATP production in isolated cardiomyocytes. In the present study we investigated effects of LIF on glucose metabolism, and how LIF-treated cells respond to insulin stimulation. METHODS: Cardiomyocytes were isolated from adult Wistar rats by collagen digestion, maintained in culture for 48 h, and then treated with 1 nmol/l LIF. RESULTS: Acute LIF treatment increased deoxyglucose uptake compared with controls, but no additive effect was observed in cardiomyocytes treated with LIF and insulin. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin did not affect LIF-induced glucose uptake. LIF had no effect on AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Cardiomyocytes treated with LIF for 48 h did not respond to insulin by increasing deoxyglucose uptake and showed a reduced insulin-mediated uptake of oleic acid and formation of complex lipids compared with control cells. Chronic LIF treatment increased gene expression of the suppressor of cytokine signalling (Socs) 3 and reduced expression of solute carrier family 2, member 4 (Slc2a4, previously known as glucose transporter 4 [Glut4]). In line with these observations, chronic LIF treatment reduced insulin-mediated phosphorylation of both Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Acute LIF treatment increased glucose uptake in isolated cardiomyocytes by a pathway different from that of insulin. Chronic LIF treatment induced insulin resistance, possibly mediated by altered expression of Socs3 and Slc2a4, and impaired insulin-mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3 and Akt/PKB.","['Florholmen, G', 'Thoresen, G H', 'Rustan, A C', 'Jensen, J', 'Christensen, G', 'Aas, V']","['Florholmen G', 'Thoresen GH', 'Rustan AC', 'Jensen J', 'Christensen G', 'Aas V']","['Institute for Experimental Medical Research, Ullevaal University Hospital, Oslo, 0407, Norway. geir.florholmen@medisin.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Diabetologia,Diabetologia,0006777,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Insulin/*pharmacology', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Time Factors']",2006/02/21 09:00,2006/10/18 09:00,['2006/02/21 09:00'],"['2005/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00125-006-0150-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetologia. 2006 Apr;49(4):724-31. doi: 10.1007/s00125-006-0150-6.

However, very little is known regarding the relation between inflammatory mediators and cytokines and immature ASMC. The aim of this study was to evaluate 1) the secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (an IL-6 family neurotrophic cytokine) by ASMC; 2) intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) signaling; and 3) the effect of LIF on mast cell chemotaxis and rat airway contractility. Immature and adult human ASMC were cultured. ELISA and real-time PCR were performed to assess LIF protein secretion and mRNA production, [methyl-(3)H]thymidine incorporation to quantify ASMC DNA synthesis, a Boyden chamber to evaluate the effect of LIF on mast cell chemotaxis, microspectroflurimetry using indo-1 (at baseline and after stimulation bradykinin, U-46619, histamine, and acetylcholine, in the presence or absence of LIF or TNF-alpha) for [Ca(2+)](i) signaling, and isolated rat pup tracheae to determine the effect of LIF on airway contractility to ACh. TNF-alpha-stimulated immature ASMC produce more LIF mRNA and protein than adult ASMC, although this cytokine induces a moderate increase in DNA synthesis (+20%) in adult ASMC only. Human recombinant LIF exerts no chemotactic effect on human mast cells. In immature ASMC, ACh-induced [Ca(2+)](i) response was enhanced twofold after incubation with LIF, whereas TNF-alpha increased the [Ca(2+)](i) to U-46619 threefold. In TNF-alpha-exposed adult ASMC, [Ca(2+)](i) responses to ACh were of greater magnitude (sixfold increase) than in immature ASMC. Human recombinant LIF increased contractility to ACh by 50% in immature, isolated rat tracheae. Stimulated immature human ASMC greatly secrete LIF, thus potentially contributing to neuroimmune airway inflammation and subsequent remodeling. Increased LIF secretion enhances airway reactivity and [Ca(2+)](i) signaling.","['Fayon, Michael', 'Rebola, Muriel', 'Berger, Patrick', 'Daburon, Sophie', 'Ousova, Olga', 'Lavrand, Frederic', 'Moukaila, Boutchi', 'Pujol, Wilfried', 'Taupin, Jean Luc', 'Labbe, Andre', 'Molimard, Mathieu', 'Marthan, Roger']","['Fayon M', 'Rebola M', 'Berger P', 'Daburon S', 'Ousova O', 'Lavrand F', 'Moukaila B', 'Pujol W', 'Taupin JL', 'Labbe A', 'Molimard M', 'Marthan R']","['Laboratoire de Physiologie Cellulaire Respiratoire, Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, and Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, France. michael.fayon@chu-bordeaux.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,American journal of physiology.

This study evaluated two variants of DT(388)IL3 with increased affinity for the IL-3 receptor (IL-3R) for their cytotoxicity to AML progenitors and determined the ability of quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assessment of expression of the IL-3R subunits to predict the effectiveness of wild-type DT(388)IL3 and its variants. Both the IL-3 deletion variant (Delta125-133) and the amino acid substitution variant (K116W) showed enhanced toxicity against AML colony-forming cells (AML-CFC; but not normal CFC) compared with wild-type DT(388)IL3 with the K116W variant achieving >90% AML-CFC kill with 17 of 23 patient samples. This variant was also more effective against AML cells engrafting in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice. There was a significant correlation between the expression of the alpha and, particularly, the common beta subunit of the IL-3R on AML blasts detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and AML-CFC kill. Thus, the combined use of IL-3R expression to select patients most likely to respond to DT(388)IL3 and the improved cytotoxicity of the K116W DT(388)IL3 variant against leukemic progenitors may enhance the clinical usefulness of these fusion proteins.","['Hogge, Donna E', 'Yalcintepe, Leman', 'Wong, Siaw-Hui', 'Gerhard, Brigitte', 'Frankel, Arthur E']","['Hogge DE', 'Yalcintepe L', 'Wong SH', 'Gerhard B', 'Frankel AE']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. dhogge@bccancer.bc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diphtheria Toxin/genetics/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Sequence Deletion']",2006/02/21 09:00,2006/04/18 09:00,['2006/02/21 09:00'],"['2006/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/4/1284 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2070 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Feb 15;12(4):1284-91. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2070.,"['R01CA76178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA90263/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, if tissue specific or tumour specific gene expression is desired, a lower level of transgene expression usually has to be accepted due to the weakness of the majority of available tissue or tumour specific promoters. This obstacle can in part be overcome by the insertion of viral cis-acting elements that enhance gene expression in various expression vector contexts regardless of the respective promoter. We designed a series of murine leukaemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral promoter conversion (ProCon) vectors that contain the woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) and evaluated its use by measuring enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) levels and viral titres. In viral vector packaging cells, when the EGFP encoding gene was transcribed from the MLV promoter, incorporation of the WPRE resulted in a marked improvement of the vectors in terms of EGFP expression and virus titres. However, in infected cells after promoter conversion had taken place, the effect of the WPRE became promoter and cell line dependent. When the EGFP gene was transcribed from the heterologous mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter the same beneficial role of the WPRE on transgene expression was observed in all eight cell lines tested. In contrast, when EGFP gene expression was driven by the murine whey acidic protein (WAP) promoter, the positive effect of the WPRE could only be observed in two cell lines whereas expression was actually reduced in the six other cell lines tested. This decrease of EGFP expression was not only demonstrated at the protein level but also manifested on the RNA level.","['Klein, Reinhard', 'Ruttkowski, Barbel', 'Knapp, Elzbieta', 'Salmons, Brian', 'Gunzburg, Walter H', 'Hohenadl, Christine']","['Klein R', 'Ruttkowski B', 'Knapp E', 'Salmons B', 'Gunzburg WH', 'Hohenadl C']","['AUSTRIANOVA Biotechnology GmbH, Veterinarplatz 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dogs', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Hepatitis B Virus, Woodchuck/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly']",2006/02/21 09:00,2006/06/24 09:00,['2006/02/21 09:00'],"['2005/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(06)00028-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2005.12.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2006 May 10;372:153-61. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2005.12.018.

The growth inhibitory effect of CT-32228 on normal hematopoietic progenitors was more pronounced in cells induced to proliferate by growth factors. These data suggest that CT-32228 may have potential in the treatment of acute leukemias, but that efficacy is more directly related to the degree of cell proliferation rather than to the level of LPAAT-beta expression or activity.","['Douvas, Michael G', 'Hogan, Karen N', 'Ji, YanShan', 'Hollenback, David', 'Bonham, Lynn', 'Singer, Jack W', 'Mitchell, Beverly S']","['Douvas MG', 'Hogan KN', 'Ji Y', 'Hollenback D', 'Bonham L', 'Singer JW', 'Mitchell BS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, USA. mgd9a@virginia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (CT-32228)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Halogenated)', '0 (Triazines)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.52 (2-acylglycerophosphate acyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Acyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Halogenated/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Triazines/*pharmacology']",2006/02/21 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2006/02/21 09:00'],"['2005/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00444-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.11.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Aug;30(8):1027-36. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.11.018.

Efficacious FeLV vaccines prevent persistent viremia and development of FeLV-related disease after virus exposure, but not minimal viral replication and a provirus-positive state as recently demonstrated using sensitive real-time PCR assays. Proviral integration is an important parameter of latent infection and persistence of retroviruses in infected cells. So far, FeLV-specific real-time PCR assays could not distinguish between the integrated and episomal forms of the provirus. Thus, it was the aim of the present study to develop a rapid assay for the detection of FeLV proviral integration. The test combines conventional and quantitative real-time PCR that use virus-specific primers and primers specific for cat genomic small interspersed nuclear elements. It was applied to analyze the time course of proviral integration into the genome of a feline fibroblast cell line and detect provirus integration in peripheral white blood cells from vaccinated and unvaccinated, FeLV-exposed cats. The newly developed rapid test will essentially contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of FeLV infection and be especially useful in the development of antiretroviral vaccines and therapies aimed at the inhibition of proviral integration.","['Cattori, Valentino', 'Tandon, Ravi', 'Pepin, Andrea', 'Lutz, Hans', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina']","['Cattori V', 'Tandon R', 'Pepin A', 'Lutz H', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R']","['Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland. vcattori@vetclinics.unizh.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cell Probes,Molecular and cellular probes,8709751,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/blood/diagnosis/virology', 'Genome/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2006/02/21 09:00,2006/07/26 09:00,['2006/02/21 09:00'],"['2005/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0890-8508(05)00104-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcp.2005.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Probes. 2006 Jun-Aug;20(3-4):172-81. doi: 10.1016/j.mcp.2005.11.007.

The mechanisms through which the BCR/ABL protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) induces these effects and the important domains within this protein are not fully defined. The F- and G-actin binding region of the BCR/ABL C-terminus may be important in BCR/ABL-mediated events, and we have investigated this by expressing a C-terminus deletion mutant of the temperature-sensitive BCR/ABL PTK, in a haemopoietic progenitor cell line, which models the chronic phase of CML. The truncated BCR/ABL PTK displayed similar levels of PTK activity when compared with wild type and activation of second messenger formation (in the form of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol) remains intact. On fibronectin substrata, localisation of the protein to the periphery of the cell was, however, dependent on the C-terminus of BCR/ABL PTK. Deletion of the C-terminus reversed both BCR/ABL-mediated apoptotic suppression and drug resistance although the progenitor cells did retain a proliferative advantage at low concentrations of growth factor. These results demonstrated that the C-terminal actin-binding domain of BCR/ABL is important for some of BCR/ABL PTK-mediated leukaemogenic effects.","['Underhill-Day, N', 'Pierce, A', 'Thompson, S E', 'Xenaki, D', 'Whetton, A D', 'Owen-Lynch, P J']","['Underhill-Day N', 'Pierce A', 'Thompson SE', 'Xenaki D', 'Whetton AD', 'Owen-Lynch PJ']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Christie Hospital, Withington, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lipids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Actins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*genetics/mortality', 'Lipids/analysis', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Temperature']",2006/02/21 09:00,2006/05/11 09:00,['2006/02/21 09:00'],"['2006/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5949 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05949.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Mar;132(6):774-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05949.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proportional hazards regression adjusted for differences in prognostic variables. In multivariate analyses transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly higher and relapse lower with URD transplantation. Adjusted 3-year survival probabilities were: in CR1 57 (53-61)% with autotransplants and 44 (37-51)% URD (P = 0.002), in CR2 46 (39-53)% and 33 (28-38)% respectively (P = 0.006).

Multiple probes/panels that included IGH probe were ordered for 57 CLL cases, 11 had an IGH rearrangement with an unidentified partner. This study favours the inclusion of del 6q and IGH probes in the CLL panel. The FISH panel could also serve to monitor 13q deletion for secondary changes with adverse prognosis. Understanding prognosis in specific types of 13q deletion would enhance outcome prediction.","['Reddy, K S']",['Reddy KS'],"['US Labs, Irvine, CA 92612, USA. kavita.reddy@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/immunology', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics/immunology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Markers/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mosaicism', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors']",2006/02/21 09:00,2006/05/11 09:00,['2006/02/21 09:00'],"['2006/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5919 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05919.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Mar;132(6):705-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05919.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to MEL cells, CB3 cells are null for p45 and thus express only extremely low levels of adult globin transcripts upon induction by agents promoting erythroid differentiation. We investigated the response of erythroleukemia cells to hemin treatment. Hemin rapidly induces beta-globin gene transcript levels in MEL cells, but not in CB3 cells. Stable expression of the large p45 NF-E2 subunit in CB3 cells restores hemin mediated beta-globin gene transcription, suggesting that the presence of a functional NF-E2 is required for strong induction of beta-globin mRNA levels by hemin in erythroleukemia cells. We performed mutagenesis of two potential heme-regulatory motifs (HRMs) in p45 NF-E2 and found that the mutated versions are expressed and can still recognize a NF-E2 DNA binding element. In addition, we showed that p45 NF-E2 HRM mutants are able to restore beta-globin gene transcription in CB3 cells upon induction by hemin. Our results suggest that globin gene activation by heme appears to be independent of the putative HRMs in the p45 subunit of the NF-E2 transcription factor.","['Moore, Amy', 'Merad Boudia, Mansouria', 'Lehalle, Damien', 'Massrieh, Wael', 'Derjuga, Anna', 'Blank, Volker']","['Moore A', 'Merad Boudia M', 'Lehalle D', 'Massrieh W', 'Derjuga A', 'Blank V']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Hemin/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2006/02/21 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2006/02/21 09:00'],"['2006/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/ars.2006.8.68 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2006 Jan-Feb;8(1-2):68-75. doi: 10.1089/ars.2006.8.68.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A good number of articles, dealing with this questions have been published recently but produced controversial results. METHODS: We performed a Medline database search and identified 20 relevant articles that were published between 1990 and 2003. There were one retro-/prospective, 13 retrospective, 3 prospective cohort studies and 3 metaanalysis reviewed. Sixteen studies were set in the civil aviation environment, two studies in the military aviation environment and two studies were set in both environments. RESULTS: Seven out of nine studies found an identical or decreased over-all-risk for aviators to develop cancer of any kind compared to the general population. In re- gards to skin cancer, seven out of eight studies found an increased risk for aviators to develop malignant melanoma, basalioma or other kinds of skin cancer. Three studies found an increased risk for the development of prostate cancer and two studies were able to demonstrate a higher risk for the appearance of leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Although our review found some studies, that identified higher risks for pilots to develop cancer of the skin, prostate cancer or leukaemia, there is not enough scientific evidence to support the hypothesis, that cosmic radiation is the cause for these findings. It shows to be important to include other factors in the interpretation of the results, since some of the findings may be well explained by life-style factors of the aviation community.","['Ott, C', 'Huber, S']","['Ott C', 'Huber S']",['Fliegerarztliches Institut (FAI)/Swiss Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine. claudineott@hotmail.com'],['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Praxis (Bern 1994),Praxis,101468093,,IM,"['Aerospace Medicine', '*Aviation', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cosmic Radiation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",2006/02/21 09:00,2006/03/21 09:00,['2006/02/21 09:00'],"['2006/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1024/0369-8394.95.4.99 [doi]'],ppublish,Praxis (Bern 1994). 2006 Jan 25;95(4):99-106. doi: 10.1024/0369-8394.95.4.99.,,21,Die klinische Bedeutung von kosmischer Strahlenbelastung in der Luftfahrt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HSC, which are at the basis of the adult blood cells hierarchy, are generated from Endothelial Cells (EC) through a complex cascade of molecular events. The transcription factor RUNX1/AML1 and its cofactor CBFbeta, disrupted in 20 % of acute myeloid leukaemia cases, are thought to control this process. A detailed gene expression analysis of RUNX1 and its associated factors in the chick embryo, prompted us to speculate on the molecular cascades involved in HSC production. The function of RUNX1 is however tightly regulated at several levels, rendering analysis through classical genetic approaches very difficult to manage. To offer new possibilities of investigation, we have designed a technique to target the blood forming system in vivo. Gene transfer was achieved by lipofection following delivery by intra-cardiac injection in the avian embryo. This method was optimised to allow a wide range of functional analysis, either by gain or loss of function, in a simple and efficient manner. In combination with experimental advantages of the avian embryo, this new system of genetic analysis allows us to perform a detailed study of RUNX1 function in HSC production from EC.","['Bollerot, Karine', 'Escriou, Virginie', 'Gautier, Rodolphe', 'Scherman, Daniel', 'Jaffredo, Thierry']","['Bollerot K', 'Escriou V', 'Gautier R', 'Scherman D', 'Jaffredo T']","['UPMC, CNRS UMR7622, Laboratoire de Biologie du Developpement, 9, quai Saint-Bernard, 75252 Paris.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,J Soc Biol,Journal de la Societe de biologie,100890617,['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Birds', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Vertebrates']",2006/02/21 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/02/21 09:00'],"['2006/02/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1051/jbio:2005010 [doi]'],ppublish,J Soc Biol. 2005;199(2):93-9. doi: 10.1051/jbio:2005010.,,,Aspects cellulaires et moleculaires de l'emergence des cellules souches hematopoietiques: implication de RUNX1/AML1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eighty-four parents of children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia who were enrolled onto a pediatric leukemia RCT at one of six US children's hospitals participated. Parents were interviewed twice, once within 48 hours after the Informed Consent Conference (ICC; time 1 [T1]) and again 6 months later (time 2 [T2]). Interviews focused on parental understanding of key components of the RCT, including random assignment. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and later analyzed. RESULTS: Changes in understanding of random assignment occurred in 19% of parents, with 17% of parents deteriorating in understanding from T1 to T2. Forty-nine percent of parents failed to understand random assignment at both times. Factors associated with understanding at both times included majority ethnicity, high socioeconomic status, parental reading of consent document, and presence of a nurse during the ICC. Physician discussion of specific components of the RCT was also associated with understanding at both times. Female caregivers and parents of low socioeconomic status were overrepresented among those who showed decay in understanding from T1 to T2. CONCLUSION: Parents showed little gain in understanding over time. Factors that predicted understanding at diagnosis as well as sustained understanding over time may be important intervention targets.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MED and ALL survivors (n = 30; 20 male, 10 female; age range, 6.0 to 22.1 years; mean, 13.1 years) were recruited for DTI and IQ tests. In this cross-sectional study, age-matched normal control (n = 55; 32 male, 23 female; age range, 6.0 to 23 years; mean, 12.1 years) DTI was obtained to compute percentage difference in white matter FA (DeltaFA%) for each patient compared with the age-matched control group. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine the relationships between DeltaFA%, age at treatment, irradiation dose, time interval from treatment, and full-scale IQ (FSIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), and performance IQ (PIQ). Receiver operating characteristics curves were used to determine the best DeltaFA% cutoffs for predicting FSIQ, VIQ, and PIQ of less than 85. RESULTS: DeltaFA% had a significant effect on FSIQ (adjusted r2 = 0.439; P < .001), VIQ (adjusted r(2) = 0.237; P = .028), and PIQ (adjusted r(2) = 0.491; P < .001) after adjusting for the effects of age at treatment, irradiation dose, and time interval from treatment. The best DeltaFA% value to predict less than 85 scores in FSIQ, VIQ, and PIQ was -3.3% with specificities of 100% and sensitivities ranging from 77.8% to 87.5%.

Despite exhibiting phenotypic properties of antigen-activated cells, including expression of Fas and FasL, T-LGL cells accumulate and demonstrate resistance to apoptosis. We propose that increased activity of a prosurvival signaling pathway in T-LGL is responsible for attenuated apoptosis in T-LGL. Given the importance of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway in regulating the balance between survival and apoptosis, we analyzed AKT activity in T-LGL cells. Compared with resting CTLs from healthy donors, patients' T-LGL cells showed higher levels of phosphorylated AKT. We demonstrate that phospho-AKT induction is dependent on the upstream activity of a Src family kinase. Since the PI3K-AKT pathway can antagonize the ability of Fas to initiate apoptosis, we hypothesized that inhibition of PI3K would lead to reacquisition of Fas sensitivity in T-LGL. Inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway alone led to brisk spontaneous apoptosis of T-LGL. These results suggest that T-LGL pathogenesis is dependent on activity of the PI3K-AKT pathway, without which the leukemic cells will begin to undergo spontaneous apoptosis. We propose that novel therapeutics inhibiting the PI3K-AKT axis may provide effective treatment for T-LGL.","['Schade, Andrew E', 'Powers, Jennifer J', 'Wlodarski, Marcin W', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Schade AE', 'Powers JJ', 'Wlodarski MW', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Homeostasis/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Male', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/immunology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*immunology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'fas Receptor/immunology', 'src-Family Kinases/immunology']",2006/02/18 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/02/18 09:00'],"['2006/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63367-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-3076 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jun 15;107(12):4834-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-3076.

Although these 2 subtypes feature different clinicopathologic characteristics, no detailed comparative analyses of genomic/genetic alterations have been reported. We performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization for 17 acute and 49 lymphoma cases as well as real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify the target genes of recurrently amplified regions. Comparison of the genome profiles of acute and lymphoma types revealed that the lymphoma type had significantly more frequent gains at 1q, 2p, 4q, 7p, and 7q, and losses of 10p, 13q, 16q, and 18p, whereas the acute type showed a gain of 3/3p. Of the recurrent high-level amplifications found at 1p36, 6p25, 7p22, 7q, and 14q32 in the lymphoma type, we were able to demonstrate that CARMA1 is a possible target gene of the 7p22 amplification for the lymphoma type but not for the acute type. Furthermore, we found BCL11B overexpression in the acute type regardless of the 14q32 gain/amplification, but no or low expression of the gene in the lymphoma type.

This WT1 isoform suppresses cyclin E, which may contribute to the prodifferentiation effect by slowing proliferation, but WT1 target genes that affect survival might also be involved. We screened a cDNA array and identified the bCL2 family member A1/BFL1 as a new WT1 target gene in 32D cl3 murine myeloblast cells. Induction of WT1 (-Ex5/-KTS) expression is accompanied by up-regulation of A1 on the cDNA array, and this up-regulation was confirmed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Moreover, both promoter-reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggest that this isoform of WT1 activates the promoter directly. Constitutive expression of A1 in 32D cl3 cells induces spontaneous granulocytic differentiation, with both morphologic and cell-surface antigen changes, as well as resistance both to chemotherapy and to withdrawal of interleukin-3 (IL-3). Finally, we note an association between WT1 expression and A1 expression in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples. Taken together, these results demonstrate that A1 is a new WT1 target gene involved in both granulocytic differentiation and resistance to cell death, and suggests that these genes might play an important role in the biology of high-risk leukemias.","['Simpson, Lesley A', 'Burwell, Emily A', 'Thompson, Kida A', 'Shahnaz, Samira', 'Chen, Allen R', 'Loeb, David M']","['Simpson LA', 'Burwell EA', 'Thompson KA', 'Shahnaz S', 'Chen AR', 'Loeb DM']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myelopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'WT1 Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2006/02/18 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/02/18 09:00'],"['2006/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63349-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-10-4025 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jun 15;107(12):4695-702. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-10-4025.

There were no significant differences in the CR rate, deaths in CR, relapse rate, or DFS between ADE and FLA, although survival at 4 years was worse with FLA (16% versus 27%, P = .05). Neither the addition of ATRA nor G-CSF demonstrated any differences in the CR rate, relapse rate, DFS, or overall survival between the groups.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of a virgin olive oil phenol extract (PE) on proliferation, the cell cycle distribution profile, apoptosis, and differentiation of the human promyelocytic cell line HL60. PE inhibited HL60 cell proliferation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, as demonstrated by the viable cell count and 3-[4,5-dimethyl(thiazol-2-yl)]-3,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) metabolism. Cell growth was completely blocked at a PE concentration of 13.5 mg/L; apoptosis was also induced as detected by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Determination of the cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry revealed an accumulation of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase. Two compounds isolated from PE, the dialdehydic forms of elenoic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA) and to tyrosol (pHPEA-EDA), were shown to possess properties similar to those of PE; they account for a part of the powerful effects exerted by the complex mixture of compounds present in PE. The concentrations of the different compounds in PE were determined by HPLC, and the purity of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and pHPEA-EDA was ascertained by NMR. Treatment with PE induced a differentiation in HL60 cells, which subsequently acquired the ability to produce superoxide ions and reduce nitroblue tetrazolium to formazan.

Its loss leads to NPC2 disease, an inherited neurodegenerative disorder. When analyzing gene expression profile, we noticed high expression of both NPC2 and its receptor, mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR), in murine hematopoietic stem cells. NPC2 protein, in the presence of thrombopoietin (TPO), causes an increase in CFU-GEMM (colony-forming unit-granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte) and a decrease in CFU-GM (colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage) colony number in colony-forming cell (CFC) assays. This effect is independent of cholesterol binding but does require the presence of MPR. With M07e cells, a TPO-dependent hematopoietic leukemia cell line, NPC2 can inhibit TPO-induced differentiation and enhance TPO-mediated anti-apoptosis effects. Strikingly, these results are not observed under the standard 20% O(2) level of the standard incubator, but rather at 7% O(2), the physiological oxygen level of bone marrow. Furthermore, NPC2 protein upregulates hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha protein level at 7% O(2), but not at 20% O(2).

Here, we report that the doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant MCF-7/Adr cells were more resistant to DOX-treatment than MCF-7 cells. However, an alternative treatment of DOX/TNF-alpha enhanced the cytotoxic effect in multidrug resistant MCF-7/Adr cell line. Treatment of cells with TNF-alpha following doxorubicin (DOX) resulted in a decrease of the activated Rel A/p65 in nuclei. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) was found to interact with Rel A/p65 in the complex, suggesting that HDAC1 is involved in mediating nuclear export of Rel A/p65. The combined treatment of TNF-alpha/DOX also resulted in a significant decrease of mRNA levels of anti-apoptotic genes, such as the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1 (c-IAP1), and the long isoform of B cell leukemia/lymphoma x gene (Bcl-xL), leading to efficient induction of caspase-8 cleavage and cell death. In previous work, we demonstrated that TNF-alpha promotes DOX-induced cell death and anti-cancer effect through downregulation of p21 in p53-deficient tumor cells. Thus, we proposed that alternative administration of TNF-alpha and DOX may be a new and efficient therapeutic strategy for patients that develop resistance to cytotoxic treatment.","['Cao, Wei', 'Ma, Sheng Lin', 'Tang, Juanjuan', 'Shi, Jingquan', 'Lu, Yanjun']","['Cao W', 'Ma SL', 'Tang J', 'Shi J', 'Lu Y']","['Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, Fudan University, 138 Yixueyuan Road, Shanghai 200032, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology/toxicity']",2006/02/18 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2006/02/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4889(05)00282-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2005.12.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2006 Feb;1763(2):182-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2005.12.008.

We previously showed that the HTLV-1 Tax protein protects from apoptosis induced by serum starvation by preventing cytochrome c release and Bax relocation to mitochondria, two early events in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. As a natural extension of these findings, and to better define the action of Tax, in the present study, we investigated the outcome of Tax and two mutants which are inactive in CREB/ATF (M47) or NF-kappaB (M22) pathways, in the control of apoptosis induced by the proapoptotic Bax protein. We found that activation of CREB, rather than NF-kappaB, is a key phenomenon in preventing apoptosis. Furthermore, the importance of CREB activation is strengthened by experiments with CREB mutants, treatment with forskolin, and in situ analysis of P-CREB status in cells transfected with Tax or its nonprotecting M47 mutant. Considered together, these results underscore a primary role of CREB in preventing apoptosis triggered by Bax, and suggest that Tax might act by affecting the phosphorylation state of CREB.","['Trevisan, Roberta', 'Daprai, Laura', 'Paloschi, Lucia', 'Vajente, Nicola', 'Chieco-Bianchi, Luigi', 'Saggioro, Daniela']","['Trevisan R', 'Daprai L', 'Paloschi L', 'Vajente N', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Saggioro D']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, Oncology Section, University of Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2006/02/18 09:00,2006/06/09 09:00,['2006/02/18 09:00'],"['2005/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(06)00005-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.01.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2006 May 1;312(8):1390-400. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.01.009.

This last property enables the release and escape of their cargo from endosomal compartments. The efficiency of this fusion mainly depends on the surface charge of the target membranes. Here, we report that cells of two different lines, epithelial adenocarcinoma HeLa and lymphocytic leukemia Jurkat T, which externalize PS, are more susceptible to fusion with DOTAP liposomes than control cells. We compared the ability to undergo fusion of untreated and apoptotic cells. Apoptosis was induced by various pro-apoptotic agents and treatments, namely: incubation in the presence of MnCl(2), cytostatic drugs fludarabine and mitoxantrone, staurosporine and serum depletion in the case of HeLa cells. Jurkat T cells were treated similarly except apoptosis was additionally induced by incubation in the presence of 4% EtOH. Epithelial cells fused with the highest efficiencies of lipid mixing, when pretreated with staurosporine. Jurkat T cells were less susceptible to fusion, but they also displayed an increase in fusion efficiency after the induction of apoptosis. Alternatively, we treated the cells with metabolic inhibitors causing ATP-depletion in order to inactivate aminophospholipid translocase. After ATP-depletion, HeLa and Jurkat T cells fused with DOTAP liposomes with higher efficiencies than control cells. Our conclusion is that the lipid asymmetry of natural membranes may limit fusion with cationic liposomes.","['Stebelska, Katarzyna', 'Wyrozumska, Paulina', 'Sikorski, Aleksander F']","['Stebelska K', 'Wyrozumska P', 'Sikorski AF']","['Laboratory of Cytobiochemistry, Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Wroclaw, Przybyszewskiego 63/77, 51-148 Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Manganese Compounds)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Phospholipid Transfer Proteins)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'MR86K0XRQP (1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-(trimethylammonium)propane)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'QQE170PANO (manganese chloride)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/*chemistry/drug effects', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Manganese Compounds/pharmacology', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Phospholipid Transfer Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2006/02/18 09:00,2006/04/21 09:00,['2006/02/18 09:00'],"['2005/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(06)00015-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2006.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2006 Mar 25;160(2):165-74. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2006.01.005.

Recently, this important signaling element was detected in leukemic B cells from a subgroup of patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). In this study, ZAP-70 was detected in normal B cells from human tonsils, but not from peripheral blood. The cDNA sequence of B cell ZAP-70 was the same as that in T cells. Germinal center B cells and plasma cells had a substantial proportion of ZAP-70+ cells, while memory and follicular mantle B cells, which contain low numbers of activated B cells, expressed relatively little ZAP-70. A cell fraction of IgD+, CD38+ B cells, which are comprised of many in vivo activated B cells, exhibited the highest levels of ZAP-70. Density gradient fractionation of tonsil B cells confirmed that ZAP-70 was not expressed by resting B cells, but was expressed by buoyant, in vivo activated B cells. In these B cells, the expression of ZAP-70 correlated with that of CD38 and not with that of CD5, a hallmark of B-CLL cells. B-CLL cells are activated cells and their ZAP-70 expression reflects a normal property of activated B cells populations rather than a neoplastic aberration.","['Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Colombo, Monica', 'Matis, Serena', 'Reverberi, Daniele', 'Dono, Mariella', 'Tarantino, Vincenzo', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Ferrarini, Manlio']","['Cutrona G', 'Colombo M', 'Matis S', 'Reverberi D', 'Dono M', 'Tarantino V', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Ferrarini M']","['Division of Medical Oncology C, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, IST, Genova, Italy. giovanna.cutrona@istge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/enzymology/*immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*immunology', 'Germinal Center/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/enzymology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/enzymology/immunology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis/*immunology']",2006/02/17 09:00,2006/04/14 09:00,['2006/02/17 09:00'],"['2006/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.200526355 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2006 Mar;36(3):558-69. doi: 10.1002/eji.200526355.,"['M01 RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 81554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 87956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aspergillus was by far the most common cause of fungal thyroiditis. Immunocompromised patients, such as those with leukemia, lymphoma, autoimmune diseases, and organ-transplant patients on pharmacological immunosuppression were particularly at risk. Fungal thyroiditis was diagnosed at autopsy as part of disseminated infection in a substantial number of patients without clinical manifestations and laboratory evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Local signs and symptoms of infection were indistinguishable from other infectious thyroiditis and included fever, anterior cervical pain, thyroid enlargement sometimes associated with dysphagia and dysphonia, and clinical and laboratory features of transient hyperthyroidism due to the release of thyroid hormone from follicular cell damage, followed by residual hypothyroidism. Antemortem diagnosis of fungal thyroiditis was made by direct microscopy and culture of a fine-needle aspirate, or/and biopsy in most cases. Since most patients with fungal thyroiditis had disseminated fungal infection with delay in diagnosis and treatment, the overall mortality was high.","['Goldani, Luciano Z', 'Zavascki, Alexandre P', 'Maia, Ana Luiza']","['Goldani LZ', 'Zavascki AP', 'Maia AL']","['Section of Infectious Diseases, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

Autophosphorylation of the FTK generates a 'signalosome', an ensemble of signalling proteins that transduce signals to downstream pathways. At the earliest stages of oncogenesis, FTKs can mimic mitogenic cytokine signalling pathways involving the GAB-2 adaptor protein and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factors, generating replicative stress and thereby promoting a mutator phenotype. In parallel, FTKs couple to survival pathways that upregulate prosurvival proteins such as Bcl-xL, so preventing DNA-damage-induced apoptosis. Following transformation, FTKs induce resistance to genotoxic attack by upregulating DNA repair mechanisms such as STAT5-dependent RAD51 transcription. The phenomenon of 'oncogene addiction' reflects the continued requirement of an active FTK 'signalosome' to mediate survival and mitogenic signals involving the PI 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein stress-activated protein kinase pathways, and the nuclear factor-kappa B, activator protein 1 and STAT transcription factors. The available data so far suggest that FTKs, with some possible exceptions, induce and maintain the transformed state using similar panoplies of signals, a finding with important therapeutic implications. The FTK signalling field has matured to an exciting phase in which rapid advances are facilitating rational drug design.","['Turner, S D', 'Alexander, D R']","['Turner SD', 'Alexander DR']","[""Department of Pathology, Division of Molecular Histopathology, University of Cambridge, Lab Block Level 3, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK. sdt36@cam.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2006/02/17 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/02/17 09:00'],"['2006/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404125 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404125 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Apr;20(4):572-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404125.,,128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we have shown that long-term treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a compound clinically approved for differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), represses hTERT in differentiation-resistant APL cell lines leading to telomere shortening and death. This signaling requires the co-activation of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) and the retinoic X receptor (RXR). In contrast to differentiation-therapy, which is only successful in this subtype of leukemia, the telomerase-targeted pathway could also be of use in non-APL. Here, we demonstrate that repression of hTERT occurs in fresh blasts cells from patients with myeloid leukemias of various subtypes exposed ex vivo to ATRA or synthetic retinoids. These results support the idea that, by hTERT targeting, retinoids can induce telomere shortening and cell death and their integration in therapy protocols for myeloid leukemias refractory to maturation should be considered.","['Pendino, F', 'Hillion, J', 'Dudognon, C', 'Delaunay, J', 'Mourah, S', 'Podgorniak, M-P', 'Lafon, I', 'Chomienne, C', 'Lanotte, M', 'Dombret, H', 'Rousselot, P', 'Segal-Bendirdjian, E']","['Pendino F', 'Hillion J', 'Dudognon C', 'Delaunay J', 'Mourah S', 'Podgorniak MP', 'Lafon I', 'Chomienne C', 'Lanotte M', 'Dombret H', 'Rousselot P', 'Segal-Bendirdjian E']","['INSERM U685, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoids)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Telomere/drug effects/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/02/17 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/02/17 09:00'],"['2006/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404127 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404127 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Apr;20(4):599-603. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404127.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed several B-cell lines and ex vivo malignant B cells, ranging from acute lymphoblastic leukemia to multiple myeloma and reflecting different stages of B-cell differentiation, and they showed ZAP-70 expression regardless their maturation stage. We then analyzed by Western blot and flow cytometry different human normal B-lymphocyte subpopulations: naive, germinal center and memory B cells from tonsils, CD19+ CD5+ cells from cord blood and CD19+ lymphocytes from peripheral blood. All expressed ZAP-70 protein, though at different levels depending on their differentiation, activation and tissue localization. In addition, ZAP-70 expression levels could be modulated following stimulation via the B-cell receptor. These findings implicate a potential role of ZAP-70 in the signalling pathway of B lymphocytes at different maturational stages, indicate that ZAP-70 expression is not a CLL-specific feature among B-cell malignancies and suggest that the absence of ZAP-70 rather than its presence should be considered abnormal for malignant B lymphocytes.","['Scielzo, C', 'Camporeale, A', 'Geuna, M', 'Alessio, M', 'Poggi, A', 'Zocchi, M R', 'Chilosi, M', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F', 'Ghia, P']","['Scielzo C', 'Camporeale A', 'Geuna M', 'Alessio M', 'Poggi A', 'Zocchi MR', 'Chilosi M', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Ghia P']","['Department of Oncology, Universita Vita Salute - San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*biosynthesis/*genetics']",2006/02/17 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/02/17 09:00'],"['2006/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404138 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404138 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Apr;20(4):689-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404138.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of 17-AAG to abrogate the function of heat-shock protein Hsp90 and modulate cellular sensitivity to anticancer agents has prompted recent research to use this compound in drug combination therapy. Here we report that 17-AAG has striking opposite effects on the activity of arsenic trioxide (ATO) and ara-C. Combination of 17-AAG with ATO exhibited a synergistic effect in leukemia cells, whereas coincubation of 17-AAG and ara-C showed antagonistic activity. Mechanistic studies revealed that ATO exerted cytotoxic action by reactive oxygen species generation, and activated Akt survival pathway. 17-AAG abrogated Akt activation and enhanced the activity of ATO. In contrast, treatment of leukemia cells with 17-AAG caused a G1 arrest, a decrease in DNA synthesis and reduced ara-C incorporation into DNA, leading to antagonism. The ability of 17-AAG to enhance the antileukemia activity of ATO was further demonstrated in primary leukemia cells isolated from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including cells from refractory patients. Our data suggest that combination of 17-AAG and ATO may be an effective therapeutic regimen.

The impact of these mutations on the overall oncogenic potential of Bcr-Abl and on the clinical course of the disease in the absence of imatinib is presently unclear. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the Bcr-Abl P-loop mutation Y253H and the highly imatinib resistant T315I mutation on kinase activity in vitro and transforming efficiency of Bcr-Abl in vitro and in vivo. Immunoprecipitated Bcr-AblY253H and Bcr-AblT315I proteins displayed similar kinase activities and substrate phosphorylation patterns as Bcr-Abl wildtype. We directly compared the proliferative capacity of mutant to wildtype Bcr-Abl in primary BM cells in vitro and in a murine transplantation model of CML by using a competitive repopulation assay. The results implicate that in the absence of imatinib, there is no growth advantage for cells carrying Bcr-AblT315I or Bcr-AblY253H compared to Bcr-Ablwt, whereas imatinib treatment clearly selects for leukemic cells expressing mutant Bcr-Abl both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the analysed Bcr-Abl mutants confer imatinib resistance, but do not induce a growth advantage in the absence of imatinib.","['Miething, C', 'Feihl, S', 'Mugler, C', 'Grundler, R', 'von Bubnoff, N', 'Lordick, F', 'Peschel, C', 'Duyster, J']","['Miething C', 'Feihl S', 'Mugler C', 'Grundler R', 'von Bubnoff N', 'Lordick F', 'Peschel C', 'Duyster J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Trogerstr, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology/virology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/02/17 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/02/17 09:00'],"['2006/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404151 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404151 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Apr;20(4):650-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404151.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression levels of TP are elevated in many malignant solid tumors and thus the 2-deoxy-d-ribose generated by TP in these tumors may play an important role in tumor progression by preventing hypoxia-induced apoptosis.","['Ikeda, Ryuji', 'Che, Xiao-Fang', 'Ushiyama, Mina', 'Yamaguchi, Tatsuya', 'Okumura, Hiroshi', 'Nakajima, Yuichi', 'Takeda, Yasuo', 'Shibayama, Yoshihiko', 'Furukawa, Tatsuhiko', 'Yamamoto, Masatatsu', 'Haraguchi, Misako', 'Sumizawa, Tomoyuki', 'Yamada, Katsushi', 'Akiyama, Shin-ichi']","['Ikeda R', 'Che XF', 'Ushiyama M', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Okumura H', 'Nakajima Y', 'Takeda Y', 'Shibayama Y', 'Furukawa T', 'Yamamoto M', 'Haraguchi M', 'Sumizawa T', 'Yamada K', 'Akiyama S']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima 890-8520, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '533-67-5 (Deoxyribose)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Polarity/drug effects', 'Cell Shape', 'Deoxyribose/*pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Transport', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2006/02/17 09:00,2006/04/14 09:00,['2006/02/17 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)00217-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.01.142 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 Mar 31;342(1):280-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.01.142.

Notably, the activated AhR exerts complex effects on estrogens and retinoids at both levels of their metabolism and regulation of cognate genes. Our current investigation of these AhR effects revealed the TCDD-dependent activation of a subset of retinoid-dependent genes (tissue-transglutaminase, IGF binding protein-3, AhR) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. A collection of in vitro hormone-dependent reporter gene models showed that AhR activation by TCDD stimulated transactivation by several class I heteromeric receptors (retinoic and thyroid hormone receptors) while it antagonized homodimeric nuclear receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors, ER and PR). TCDD exerted a dose-dependent effect on a retinoic acid-dependent reporter gene expressed in MCF-7 cells. AhR was shown to be involved in a mutual antagonism with RARalpha corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors). This, and the documented physical interaction between AhR and SMRT suggested that SMRT sequestration by AhR might activate RARalpha in the absence of ligand. Immunocytochemical studies of AhR and SMRT strongly suggested they colocalized in nuclear bodies during this sequestration. Concurring with this interpretation, we observed an interaction in vitro between AhR and the PML protein, the core component of nuclear bodies. This ability of AhR to elicit spurious activation of retinoid receptors expands the scope of AhR ligands influence beyond ER antagonism and specific Dioxin-responsive genes. Unknown AhR endogenous ligands may also elicit gene transactivation by class I receptors, while being inactive on classic xenobiotic-responsive genes.","['Widerak, Magdalena', 'Ghoneim, Christelle', 'Dumontier, Marie-France', 'Quesne, Monique', 'Corvol, Marie Therese', 'Savouret, Jean-Francois']","['Widerak M', 'Ghoneim C', 'Dumontier MF', 'Quesne M', 'Corvol MT', 'Savouret JF']","['Universite Paris 5, INSERM UMRS-530, Centre Universitaire, 45, rue des Saints-Peres, 75006 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/immunology/metabolism']",2006/02/17 09:00,2006/07/18 09:00,['2006/02/17 09:00'],"['2005/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-9084(05)00272-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biochi.2005.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 2006 Mar-Apr;88(3-4):387-97. doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2005.11.007.

Dendritic cell cross-presentation is credited with the ability of tumor lysate-loaded dendritic cells to prime both CD4 and CD8-specific T-lymphocyte responses, enabling the generation of cancer specific CTL activity without the loading of the classical MHC class I compartment. Recently, however, several reports have raised doubts as to the efficiency of cross-presentation as a mechanism for CTL priming in vivo. To examine this issue, we have doubly-loaded human dendritic cells with both AML-specific tumor lysate and AML-specific tumor mRNA. Our results show that these doubly-loaded dendritic cells can mediate superior primary, recall, and effector lytic responses in vitro in comparison to those of dendritic cells loaded with either tumor lysate or tumor mRNA alone. Enhanced recall responses appeared to be influenced by CD40/CD40L signaling, underscoring the importance of T-cell help in the generation and perpetuation of the adaptive immune response.","['Decker, William K', 'Xing, Dongxia', 'Li, Sufang', 'Robinson, Simon N', 'Yang, Hong', 'Yao, Xin', 'Segall, Harry', 'McMannis, John D', 'Komanduri, Krishna V', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J']","['Decker WK', 'Xing D', 'Li S', 'Robinson SN', 'Yang H', 'Yao X', 'Segall H', 'McMannis JD', 'Komanduri KV', 'Champlin RE', 'Shpall EJ']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Box 65, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA. wkdecker@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2006/02/17 09:00,2006/09/15 09:00,['2006/02/17 09:00'],"['2005/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0264-410X(06)00043-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.01.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 2006 Apr 12;24(16):3203-16. doi: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.01.029.

WT1 mRNA undergoes alternative splicing at 2 sites resulting in 4 isoforms. The mRNA splice isoforms are constantly expressed in all tissues expressing WT1 with fixed proportions. The functional significance of WT1 isoforms expression in leukemia is unclear. This study was designed to explore the potential effects of exogenous WT1 gene isoforms on proliferation of leukemia cell line NB4 and its possible molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The recombinant eukaryotic expression vector pCB6+/WTA containing full-length human WT1 isoform WTA (-17AA/-KTS) cDNA, and pCB6+ vector with neomycin resistance gene were transfected into NB4 cells by electroperforation. The positive cell clones (NB4/WTA) were selected with G418. The transfected cells were monocloned by limited dilution. The expressing of WTA mRNA and protein in transfected cells was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. The proliferating ability of leukemia cells was measured by trypan blue exclusion assay, MTT assay, colony formation assay and cell cycle analysis. The expression of p53, p21, Cyclin E, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A1 was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: WT1 gene isoforms were transfected into NB4 cells, and the cell line stably expressing exogenous WT1 gene isoforms was established successfully. The monoclonal cells overexpressing WT1 were obtained. The growth of NB4/WTA cells was slower than that of untransfected NB4 cells and NB4 cells transfected with pCB6+ vector (NB4/CMV): the growth of NB4/WTA cells reached plate phase [(78.7+/-18.0 x 10(4)/ml] at the 3rd day, while that of control cells reached plate phase [(146.0+/-21.0) x 10(4)/ml] at the 4th day. The inhibitory rates of NB4/WTA cells at different time points were significantly higher than those of control NB4 cells (P<0.005). The colony forming efficiency of NB4/WTA cells decreased markedly and became much lower when exposed to 0.2 micromol/L As2O3. The proportion of S phase cells was increased in NB4/WTA group. The expression of p21 and Cyclin A1 was higher in NB4/WTA cells than in control cells. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous WTA gene could inhibit the proliferation and colony forming ability of leukemia cells through up-regulating the expression of p21 and Cyclin A1 and arresting cell cycle at S phase.","['Shen, Hui-Ling', 'Chen, Zi-Xing', 'Wang, Wei', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Hu, Shao-Yan', 'Zhao, Ye']","['Shen HL', 'Chen ZX', 'Wang W', 'Cen JN', 'Hu SY', 'Zhao Y']","['Jiangsu Provincial Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Suchoow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, P.

This has been demonstrated both in organs with high cell turnover rate, such as the bone marrow, colon and skin, and in organs with low cell turnover rate, such as the brain. To maintain homeostasis in the body it is important to keep tight control over stem cell fate. Stem cells are under strict control from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors and loss of this control has been postulated to be a key step in the carcinogenic process. There is increasing evidence that cancer initiation results from accumulative oncogenic mutations (intrinsic loss of control) in long-lived stem cells or their immediate progenitor, followed by modification of the surrounding microenvironment (loss of extrinsic control). Decades ago, studies on teratocarcinoma led to the hypothesis that a small subset of self-renewing cancer stem cells with differentiation potential exists within tumors. These studies showed that teratocarcinomas contain undifferentiated embryonic carcinoma cells that are able to give rise to differentiated cells which belong to all three germ layers. More recent studies have confirmed cancer stem cells in such diverse cancers as leukemia, brain and breast cancer. It is, however, unclear whether cancer stem cells originate from resident stem cells or whether they arise as a result of an acquired gain of self-renewal capacity in tissue progenitor cells or even more differentiated cells. The characterization of a cancer stem cell profile within diverse cancer types may open up new avenues for cancer treatment. In this review we discuss the concept of cancer stem cells and focus on examples where these cells have been identified.","['Gudjonsson, Thorarinn', 'Magnusson, Magnus Karl']","['Gudjonsson T', 'Magnusson MK']","['Molecular and Cell Biology Research Laboratory, Icelandic Cancer Society, Reykjavik, Iceland.

LIF activates the JAK-STAT3 pathway through the class I cytokine receptor gp130, which forms a trimeric complex with LIF and the class I cytokine receptor LIF receptor beta. STAT3 has been shown to play a crucial role in self-renewal in mouse ES cells probably by induction of c-myc expression. Thus, ablation of STAT3 activation leads to differentiation. However, important connections between STAT3 and other signalling pathways have been documented. In addition, gp130 activation leads to both PI3K and Src activation. The canonical Wnt pathway is sufficient to maintain self-renewal of both human ES cells and mouse ES cells. It seems quite possible that the main pathway maintaining self-renewal in ES cells is the Wnt pathway, while the LIF-JAK-STAT3 pathway is present in mouse cells as an adaptation for sustaining self-renewal during embryonic diapause, a condition of delayed implantation in mammals. In keeping with this scenario, the Wnt pathway has been shown to elevate the level of c-myc. Thus, the two pathways seem to converge on c-myc as a common target to promote self-renewal. Whereas LIF does not seem to stimulate self-renewal in human embryonic stem cells it cannot be excluded that other cytokines are involved. The pleiotropic actions of the increasing number of cytokines and receptors signalling via JAKs, STATs and SOCS exhibit considerable redundancy, compensation and plasticity in stem cells in accordance with the view that stem cells are governed by quantitative variations in strength and duration of signalling events known from other cell types rather than qualitatively different stem cell-specific factors.","['Kristensen, David Mobjerg', 'Kalisz, Mark', 'Nielsen, Jens Hoiriis']","['Kristensen DM', 'Kalisz M', 'Nielsen JH']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Genetics, Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Denmark,APMIS,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2006/02/17 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/02/17 09:00'],"['2006/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['APMapm_391 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0463.2005.apm_391.x [doi]']",ppublish,APMIS. 2005 Nov-Dec;113(11-12):756-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0463.2005.apm_391.x.,,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether CMV seropositivity of the donor might have an impact on leukemic relapse is unknown. PATIENTS: Between June 1999 and February 2004 48 patients ineligible for conventional allotransplantation underwent reduced-intensity transplants at our institution. Twenty-seven (56%) patients had a CMV-seropositive donor. RESULTS: While donor CMV seropositivity had no effect on overall survival, having a CMV-seropositive donor was associated with a significantly lower risk for relapse (20% vs. 52%, P = 0.02). The beneficial effect of a CMV-seropositive donor, however, was offset by a higher transplant-related mortality (42% vs. 19% in patients with a CMV-seronegative donor, P = 0.2). Donor CMV serostatus had no effect on the incidence of CMV infection/disease, and acute or chronic graft-vs.-host disease. Overall, 27 patients died during the observation period. Causes of death in patients with a CMV-seropositive donor were primarily transplant-related (11 vs. 4 in patients with CMV-seronegative donors), whereas leukemic relapse was the leading cause of death in patients with a CMV-seronegative donor (8 vs. 4 in patients with a CMV-seropositive donor, P = 0.038, chi-squared test). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed risk category by the underlying disease and donor CMV seropositivity to be significant predictors of leukemic relapse following reduced-intensity transplants. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest a possible role of donor CMV serostatus on the risk of relapse following reduced-intensity allogeneic SCT.","['Nachbaur, David', 'Clausen, Johannes', 'Kircher, Brigitte']","['Nachbaur D', 'Clausen J', 'Kircher B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria. david.nachbaur@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/diagnosis/*transmission', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Survival Rate', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/02/17 09:00,2006/06/15 09:00,['2006/02/17 09:00'],"['2006/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH625 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00625.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 May;76(5):414-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00625.x.

METHODS: 111In-ODNs naked and vectorized with lipids were analyzed for binding with serum components using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 111In-ODN was incubated in albumin and transferrin solutions. 111In-DTPA and 111In-mononucleotide were incubated in serum. Degradation of naked 111In-ODN was detected in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and serum containing endonuclease S1. Cellular uptakes of naked and vectorized 111In-ODN in the above cells were examined with and without fetal calf serum (FCS). RESULTS: Time-dependent binding of naked and vectorized 111In- ODN with serum components was observed throughout 24 hours. Transchelation of 111In to transferrin was not detected. HPLC profiles of 111In-DTPA and 111In-mononucleotide did not change in serum. Degradation of 111In-ODN by S1 was less remarkable in serum than in PBS. Specific accumulation of vectorized 111In-ODN in P388/R cells was achieved in culture with and without 10% FCS. CONCLUSIONS: This study verified the intense binding of ODN with serum components, leading to no inhibition on ODN intracellular specific uptake. Binding with serum components protects 111In-ODN from degradation by endonuclease and thus may facilitate ODN transmembrane delivery.","['Bai, Jingming', 'Kinuya, Seigo', 'Shiba, Kazuhiro', 'Michigishi, Takatoshi', 'Tonami, Norihisa']","['Bai J', 'Kinuya S', 'Shiba K', 'Michigishi T', 'Tonami N']","['Department of Biotracer Medicine, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kanazawa, Japan. bjingming@mail.goo.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Indium Radioisotopes/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2006/02/17 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2006/02/17 09:00'],"['2006/02/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cbr.2006.21.34 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2006 Feb;21(1):34-40. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2006.21.34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On flow cytometric immunophenotyping with CD38 gating, most of the abnormal cells expressed surface CD20, CD138, cytoplasmic IgM, but neither surface CD56 nor surface IgM. Immunohistochemical staining of abnormal cells was positive for surface CD38, surface CD20 and cytoplasmic IgM. The final diagnosis was plasma cell leukemia IgM kappa type. Electrocardiography (ECG) on admission showed ST depression in II, III, aV(F), V4, V5, and V6.

It is possible, however, that at that time the transplanted HSC can be affected by the administered drugs. We report the results obtained in 30 patients (pts) with hematological malignancies (multiple myeloma - 14, Hodgkin's disease -6, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas -4, chronic myeloid leukemia -6) treated with HDC with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). The following HDC regimens were applied: melphalan - 14, Dexa-BEAM (dexamethasone, BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) - 10 and BuCy2 (busulfan, cyclophosphamide) - 6. To evaluate the impact of HDC on the growth ability of less /14/ and more /7/ mature CFU-GM, sera were taken directly before cytoreductive chemotherapy, on the last day of HDC (0 day) and on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 after the end of HDC. After melphalan, for CFU-GM/14/ the following results were received: days 0 - 54 +/- 9, 1 - 55 +/- 9, 2 - 68 +/- 12, 3 - 82 +/- 10, 4 - 95 +/- 8,5 - 100 +/- 8% and for CFU-GM/7/: days 0 - 60 +/- 11, 1 - 59 +/- 8, 2 - 72 +/- 11, 3 - 80 +/- 7, 4 - 90 +/- 9, 5 - 105 +/- 7%, determined as a percentage of those obtained before HDC (100%). After Dexa-BEAM, for CFU-GM/14/: days 0 - 45 +/- 13, 1 - 49 +/- 8, 2 - 59 +/- 12, 3 - 85 +/- 15, 4 - 96 +/- 9, 5 - 106 +/- 11%, and for CFU-GM/7/: 0 - 43 +/- 15, 1 - 50 +/- 9, 2 - 63 +/- 11, 3 - 89 +/- 11, 4 - 98 +/- 11, 5 - 110 +/- 8%. In case of BuCy2, for CFU-GM/14/: days 0 - 55 +/- 13, 1 - 67 +/- 7, 2 - 69 +/- 15, 3 - 85 +/- 10, 4 - 103 +/- 12, 5 - 108 +/- 7% and for CFU-GM/7/: days 0 - 50 +/- 12, 1 - 71 +/- 6, 2 - 76 +/- 16, 3 - 98 +/- 9, 4 - 105 +/- 11, 5 - 101 +/- 8%. In all pts PBSCT were infused 72 hours after HDC. The median time to reach granulocytes > 0.5 G/l and >1.0 G/l was 12 (8-17) and 13 (9-18) days, respectively. The recovery of platelets >20.0 G/l and >50. 0 G/l occured after 17 (9-48) and 25 (11-54) days, respectively. We conclude that the suppressive effect of the sera taken on days 0-2 on the CFU-GM growth depends on the HDC-regimen. We have also shown that third day after completion of HDC is the optimal time for the infusion of HSC. The time of hematological reconstituton is related in all investigated pts and independently on the HDC-program (p>0.05).","['Kozlowska-Skrzypczak, Maria', 'Hansz, Janusz', 'Sawinski, Krzysztof', 'Komarnicki, Mieczyslaw']","['Kozlowska-Skrzypczak M', 'Hansz J', 'Sawinski K', 'Komarnicki M']",['Katedra i Klinika Hematologii i Chorob Rozrostowych Ukladu Krwiotworczego AM im.

Thrombotic events are well documented in patients receiving L-asparaginase as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs. The present prospective, randomized study evaluated the effect of two different L-asparaginase preparations, native Escherichia coli L-asparaginase (Crasnitin; Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany; n = 10) and L-asparaginase derived from Erwinia chrysanthemi (Erwinase; Porton Pruducts, London, UK; n = 10) on the changes in parameters concerning hypercoagulability. Patients were randomized to receive a total of eight doses of 10,000 IU/m2 L-asparaginase intravenously with intervals of 3 days during induction therapy. Before starting L-asparaginase treatment all patients had already demonstrated an increased thrombin generation shown by the elevated levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 and thrombin antithrombin III, presumably due to therapy with prednisone, daunorubicin and vincristine. A significant decrease in alpha2-antiplasmin and plasminogen levels was measured in the E. coli L-asparaginase but not in Erwinase-treated patients. Increased thrombin generation combined with a decrease in alpha2-antiplasmin and plasminogen levels may lead to a state of increased risk for thrombosis due to a delay in fibrin elimination in E. coli L-asparaginase-treated patients only.","['Appel, Inge M', 'Hop, Wim C J', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Appel IM', 'Hop WC', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. i.m.appel@erasmusmc.nl""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage', 'Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombosis/blood/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2006/02/16 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/02/16 09:00'],"['2006/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.mbc.0000214709.11492.ec [doi]', '00001721-200603000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2006 Mar;17(2):139-46. doi: 10.1097/01.mbc.0000214709.11492.ec.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we evaluated the role of AKT signaling pathway, known to be anti-apoptotic in diverse cell types, in enhancing the survival of human leukemia HL60 cells induced to differentiate with 1,25D. We found that the phosphorylation and activity of AKT, as well as of its downstream targets, are increased after the exposure to 1,25D. Treatment of HL60 cells with PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin, which decrease the activity of the AKT pathway, induced apoptosis, but this effect was reduced in cells simultaneously treated with 1,25D. Interestingly, LY294002 and Wortmannin also accentuated the 1,25D-induced G(1) to S phase cell cycle block in HL60 cells, and this was associated with an increased expression of p27Kip1. Thus, a combination of 1,25D with inhibitors of AKT pathway is strongly anti-proliferative and should therefore be considered for differentiation therapy of myeloid leukemia.","['Zhang, Yingyu', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G1 Phase/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'S Phase/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2006/02/16 09:00,2006/05/02 09:00,['2006/02/16 09:00'],"['2006/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2467 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.5.4.2467 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2006 Feb;5(4):447-51. doi: 10.4161/cc.5.4.2467.

Immortalized myeloid cell lines can be generated by expression of MLL-ENL in murine hematopoietic progenitors. By establishing myeloid cell lines with conditional expression of MLL-ENL, we recently demonstrated that MLL-ENL is necessary to maintain immortalization and sustain the expression of a characteristic pattern of Hox genes. The cell lines can be induced to undergo terminal differentiation by inhibition of MLL-ENL expression or by treatment with G-CSF. Expression of Hoxa genes is reduced in cells differentiating as a result of MLL-ENL loss, but is maintained in G-CSF treated cells. Thus, although aberrant maintenance of Hoxa gene expression may play an important role in MLL-ENL induced leukemia, the contribution of this pathway to immortalization is critically dependent on the cytokine environment of the immortalized myeloid cells.","['Horton, Sarah J', 'Williams, Owen']","['Horton SJ', 'Williams O']","['Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (MLL-ENL oncoprotein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism']",2006/02/16 09:00,2006/05/02 09:00,['2006/02/16 09:00'],"['2006/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2464 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.5.4.2464 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2006 Feb;5(4):360-2. doi: 10.4161/cc.5.4.2464.

Common dermatological side effects include hyperpigmentation, scaling, erythema, alopecia, desquamation of face and hands. Leg ulceration following HU therapy is less common and very few cases have been reported so far. Objective of this paper is to increase the awareness of hydroxyurea induced leg ulcers which will aid in the early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The first case was a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patient on HU 1.5 g/day for 5 yr, who had bilateral painful perimalleolar ulcers for 6 months. The second case was a CML patient on HU 1.5 g/day for 3 yr who developed bilateral lateral malleolar ulcers. Third case was a polycythemia vera (PV) patient on HU 1 g/day for 5 yr who presented with painful medial malleolar ulcer of 2 months. The last case of our report was an elderly PV patient on HU 1.5 g/day for 2 yr and presented with lateral malleolar ulcer which persisted on reducing the dose of HU. In all the 4 cases the ulcers healed on stopping HU. Our report confirms the association of chronic hydroxyurea therapy and perimalleolar ulcers which respond promptly after discontinuation of the drug. The heightened awareness among the physicians will promote early diagnosis and prompt relief from the agonizing ulcers.","['Saravu, Kavitha', 'Velappan, Praveen', 'Lakshmi, Naik', 'Shastry, Barkur Ananthakrishna', 'Thomas, Joseph']","['Saravu K', 'Velappan P', 'Lakshmi N', 'Shastry BA', 'Thomas J']","['Department of Medicine, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, India. kavithasaravu@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Ankle', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leg Ulcer/*chemically induced/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phlebotomy', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy', 'Wound Healing']",2006/02/16 09:00,2006/04/11 09:00,['2006/02/16 09:00'],"['2006/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['200602177 [pii]', '10.3346/jkms.2006.21.1.177 [doi]']",ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2006 Feb;21(1):177-9. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2006.21.1.177.,,,,PMC2733971,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This newly identified pathway is regulated at the mitochondrial outer membrane by a complex between the prosurvival Bcl-2 member, Mcl-1 and the BH3-only protein, Bim. Under non-apoptotic conditions, Bim is sequestered by Mcl-1. Direct degradation of Mcl-1 by TRAIL-activated caspase-8 or caspase-3 produces Mcl-1-free Bim that mediates a Bax-dependent apoptotic cascade. Using Mcl-1 or Bim RNAi, we demonstrate that a loss in Mcl-1 expression significantly enhances the mitochondrial apoptotic response to TRAIL that is now mediated by freed Bim. Whereas overexpression of Mcl-1 contributes to the preservation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, Mcl-1 knockdown facilitates the Bim-mediated dissipation of this potential. Loss of Mcl-1 contributes to an increased level of caspase activity downstream of the mitochondrial response to TRAIL. Furthermore, the Mcl-1 expression level at the mitochondrial outer membrane determines the release efficiency for the apoptogenic proteins cytochrome c, Smac, and HtrA2 in response to Bim. These are the first findings to demonstrate the involvement of Bim in the TRAIL-mediated mitochondrial cascade. They also suggest that Mcl-1 may serve as a direct substrate for TRAIL-activated caspases implying the existence of a novel TRAIL/caspase-8/Mcl-1/Bim communication mechanism between the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways.","['Han, Jie', 'Goldstein, Leslie A', 'Gastman, Brian R', 'Rabinowich, Hannah']","['Han J', 'Goldstein LA', 'Gastman BR', 'Rabinowich H']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2006/02/16 09:00,2006/06/06 09:00,['2006/02/16 09:00'],"['2006/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)56365-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M510349200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Apr 14;281(15):10153-63. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M510349200.

The approach was used to generate a panel of apoptosis-inducing antibodies specific for antigens differentially expressed in B lymphoma vs. T leukaemia cells. The selections resulted in an antibody pool with near perfect selectivity (>99%) for the B lymphoma target cells. Randomly picked clones (72) revealed 7 unique antibody genotypes. Six of these rapidly induced apoptosis in target cells. Following the conversion to full IgGs, the antibodies were shown to be specific for HLA-DR/DP, the B-cell receptor mu chain and for CD54/ICAM-1. The latter receptor was not previously associated with apoptotic properties in B-cell lymphomas. Anti-ICAM-1 IgG induced apoptosis in a broad range of B lymphoma cell lines and were shown by immunohistochemistry to bind strongly to B lymphoma tissue obtained from 5 different B lymphoma patients. The recombinant IgG antibodies had affinities in the subnanomolar (0.3 nM) to nanomolar (3 nM) range. The described technology is generally applicable for the rapid isolation of high affinity human antibodies with specificity for differentially expressed cell surface receptors with intrinsic negative or positive signalling properties from naive phage libraries.","['Fransson, Johan', 'Tornberg, Ulla-Carin', 'Borrebaeck, Carl A K', 'Carlsson, Roland', 'Frendeus, Bjorn']","['Fransson J', 'Tornberg UC', 'Borrebaeck CA', 'Carlsson R', 'Frendeus B']","['Department of Immunotechnology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Antibodies/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DP Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology']",2006/02/16 09:00,2006/07/15 09:00,['2006/02/16 09:00'],"['2006/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21829 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Jul 15;119(2):349-58. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21829.,,,,,,,,,,"['2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Increasing evidence indicates that these T cells are not exclusively detrimental but might also exert protective effects.

In addition, T-cell clones specific for tetanus toxoid, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and monocytes, but not B cells, secreted LIF. LIF-producing T lymphocytes and macrophages were also identified immunohistochemically in both active and chronic-active MS lesions. We further demonstrated dose-dependent protective effects of LIF on tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis of oligodendrocytes. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that peripheral and CNS-infiltrating T cells from MS patients produce LIF, a protective factor for oligodendrocytes.

However, this agent has limited activity against a number of fungi, including Trichosporon species. We describe 4 patients who developed disseminated trichosporonosis during the use of micafungin. No cases of trichosporonosis had been seen in the 2 years prior to January 2003, when micafungin became available in our hospital. METHODS: We reviewed microbiological records of patients at Kameda General Hospital (Kamogawa City, Chiba, Japan) from 1 January 2002 to 31 July 2005, and identified 4 patients whose blood culture results were positive for Trichosporon species. RESULTS: Since January 2003, four patients--3 with acute myelocytic leukemia and 1 with myelodysplastic syndrome--developed disseminated trichosporonosis while receiving treatment with micafungin with or without amphotericin B. The initial 2 isolates were identified as Trichosporon beigelii, and the later 2 isolates were identified as Trichosporon asahii. All 4 patients received micafungin, and 2 also received amphotericin B concomitantly. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of micafungin were >16 microg/mL for the 2 isolates available for susceptibility testing. One patient with hematologic recovery (neutrophils >500 cells/mm3) showed elimination of the fungus after receiving treatment with voriconazole. However, the 3 other patients without hematologic or immunological recovery died of disseminated infection. CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of trichosporonosis in our hospital and its emergence after the introduction of micafungin therapy support the idea that micafungin may exert a significant, selective pressure toward resistant fungi, such as Trichosporon species. Therefore, care should be taken regarding the possibility of trichosporonosis in patients receiving micafungin with or without amphotericin B.","['Matsue, Kosei', 'Uryu, Hidetaka', 'Koseki, Mihoko', 'Asada, Noboru', 'Takeuchi, Masami']","['Matsue K', 'Uryu H', 'Koseki M', 'Asada N', 'Takeuchi M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kameda General Hospital, Kamogawa-Shi, Chiba, Japan. koseim@dc4.so-net.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Echinocandins', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Lipopeptides', 'Lipoproteins/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Micafungin', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*therapeutic use', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Trichosporon/*isolation & purification']",2006/02/16 09:00,2006/07/25 09:00,['2006/02/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['CID37764 [pii]', '10.1086/500323 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2006 Mar 15;42(6):753-7. doi: 10.1086/500323.

METHODS: The effect of methanolic extracts of the herbs on the inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by MTT colorimetric assay. K562 and Jurkat cell lines treated with the extracts were analyzed for the induction of apoptosis by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining. DNA fragmentation analysis was performed. RESULTS: Various concentrations of L. persicum and E. cheiradenia showed inhibitory effects on different cell lines. Two leukemic lines including K562 and Jurkat were the most sensitive cells for L. persicum with IC50 of 0.1 and 10 mug/ml, respectively. In the cultures of tumor cell lines treated with E. cheiradenia, the main inhibitory effects was for Jurkat cells with IC50 of 12.5 microg/ml. Results indicated a dose-dependent accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 phase. Study of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation showed a typical DNA laddering in agarose gels for both extracts.

Furthermore, PTP-1B levels are up-regulated in certain chronic myelogenous leukemia patients, which points to a potential role for PTP-1B in myeloid development. The results presented here show that the absence of PTP-1B affects murine myelopoiesis by modifying the ratio of monocytes to granulocytes in vivo. This bias toward monocytic development is at least in part due to a decreased threshold of response to CSF-1, because the PTP-1B -/- bone marrow presents no abnormalities at the granulocyte-monocyte progenitor level but produces significantly more monocytic colonies in the presence of CSF-1. This phenomenon is not due to an increase in receptor levels but rather to enhanced phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine. PTP-1B -/- cells display increased inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo through the constitutive up-regulation of activation markers as well as increased sensitivity to endotoxin. Collectively, our data indicate that PTP-1B is an important modulator of myeloid differentiation and macrophage activation in vivo and provide a demonstration of a physiological role for PTP-1B in immune regulation.","['Heinonen, Krista M', 'Dube, Nadia', 'Bourdeau, Annie', 'Lapp, Wayne S', 'Tremblay, Michel L']","['Heinonen KM', 'Dube N', 'Bourdeau A', 'Lapp WS', 'Tremblay ML']","['Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada H3G 1Y6.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', '*Macrophage Activation/genetics', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2006/02/16 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2006/02/16 09:00'],"['2006/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['0508563103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0508563103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 21;103(8):2776-81. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0508563103.

The biologic basis of the stereotypical progression from chronic phase through accelerated phase to blast crisis is poorly understood. We used DNA microarrays to compare gene expression in 91 cases of CML in chronic (42 cases), accelerated (17 cases), and blast phases (32 cases). Three thousand genes were found to be significantly (P < 10(-10)) associated with phase of disease. A comparison of the gene signatures of chronic, accelerated, and blast phases suggest that the progression of chronic phase CML to advanced phase (accelerated and blast crisis) CML is a two-step rather than a three-step process, with new gene expression changes occurring early in accelerated phase before the accumulation of increased numbers of leukemia blast cells. Especially noteworthy and potentially significant in the progression program were the deregulation of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway, the decreased expression of Jun B and Fos, alternative kinase deregulation, such as Arg (Abl2), and an increased expression of PRAME. Studies of CML patients who relapsed after initially successful treatment with imatinib demonstrated a gene expression pattern closely related to advanced phase disease.

A particularly interesting and useful paradigm for investigating CNS axonal regeneration is its enhancement at the CNS branch of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after conditional lesioning of their peripheral branch. Recent reports have implicated the involvement of two well-known signaling pathways utilizing separate transcription factors; the Cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), in conditional lesioning. The former appears to be the pathway activated by neurotrophic factors and Bcl-2, while the latter is responsible for the neurogenic effect of cytokines [such as the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) elevated at lesion sites]. Recent findings also augmented earlier notions that modulations of the activity of another class of cellular signaling intermediate, the conventional protein kinase C (PKC), could result in a contrasting growth response by CNS neurons to myelin-associated inhibitors. We discuss these signaling pathways and mechanisms, in conjunction with other recent reports of regeneration enhancement and also within the context of what is known about aiding regeneration of injured CNS axons.","['Teng, Felicia Yu Hsuan', 'Tang, Bor Luen']","['Teng FY', 'Tang BL']","['Department of Biochemistry Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Central Nervous System/*injuries/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Growth Cones/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Nerve Regeneration/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2006/02/16 09:00,2006/05/11 09:00,['2006/02/16 09:00'],"['2006/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['JNC3663 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03663.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2006 Mar;96(6):1501-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03663.x.

Treatment of the cells with C29 in the presence of H89 (a SerlThr kinase inhibitor) or 8'-bromo-cyclicAMP revealed that apoptosis was mediated by a cAMP-dependent Ser/Thr kinase.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six human CCA cell lines were treated with various concentrations of TRAIL and the resistant cells were identified and subsequently tested for their sensitivity to a combination of TRAIL and triptolide. The susceptibility and resistance of the cells were based on analysis of cytotoxic and apoptotic induction and expression of anti-apoptotic factors (Mcl-1 and cFLIP). RESULTS: The treatment of TRAIL induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in 4 out of the 6 cell lines. A combination of TRAIL and triptolide enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in these 2 resistant cell lines. The combined treatment enhanced activation of caspase-8 and its downstream signaling processes compared with the treatment with either one alone. CONCLUSION: The results presented show that human CCA cells were heterogeneous with respect to susceptibility to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The combination of TRAIL and triptolide could enhance susceptibility to TRAIL-induced apoptotic killing in these TRAIL-resistant CCA cells, thus offering an alternative approach for the treatment of TRAIL-resistant cholangiocarcinoma.","['Panichakul, Tasanee', 'Intachote, Pakamas', 'Wongkajorsilp, Adisak', 'Sripa, Banchob', 'Sirisinha, Stitaya']","['Panichakul T', 'Intachote P', 'Wongkajorsilp A', 'Sripa B', 'Sirisinha S']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Chulabhom Research Institute, Bangkok, Thailand. tasanee_p@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Diterpenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Epoxy Compounds', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phenanthrenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2006/02/16 09:00,2006/03/10 09:00,['2006/02/16 09:00'],"['2006/02/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2006 Jan-Feb;26(1A):259-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diallyl disulfide (DADS), a component of garlic, inhibits the proliferation of human blood, colon, lung and skin cancer cells. Although DADS had been reported to induce apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells, there are no reports regarding whether or not it affects leukemia cells in vivo. Therefore, the present study is focused on the in vivo effects of DADS on WEHI-3 leukemia cells. The effects of DADS on murine WEHI-3 cells were initially examined, and the results indicated that DADS induced cytotoxicity and that this effect was dose-dependent. The effects of DADS on WEHI-3 in BALBIc mice were also examined, and the results indicated that DADS decreased the percentage of MAC-3 marker, indicating that differentiation of the precursor of macrophage and T cells was inhibited. The weights of liver and spleen were also measured, and the results indicated that DADS decreased the weight of these organs.

The outcome of such infections depends on early diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy. The objective of the current study was to determine the significant predictive factors that characterize IPA in patients with cancer. METHODS: The clinical characteristics and computed tomography (CT) findings for 47 cases with IPA were retrospectively reviewed and compared with 49 controls (patients diagnosed on autopsy with nonfungal pneumonias). Data from all 96 patients were modeled using multivariate logistic regression. Subgroups of patients with common characteristics and outcomes were identified. RESULTS: Leukemia, neutropenia, cavitation, and nodular lesions occurred significantly more often among cases than controls (P = 0.04, 0.004, 0.04, and 0.02, respectively). A quantitative scoring system was developed that could be used to identify patients as being at low, medium, and high risk for IPA. CONCLUSIONS: IPA should be highly suspected in leukemia patients with profound neutropenia, pleuritic chest pain, and cavitary or nodular lesions detected on CT scan. These predictive factors can be used to indicate when early prophylactic and therapeutic antifungal interventions should be initiated.","['Hachem, Ray', 'Sumoza, David', 'Hanna, Hend', 'Girgawy, Essam', 'Munsell, Mark', 'Raad, Issam']","['Hachem R', 'Sumoza D', 'Hanna H', 'Girgawy E', 'Munsell M', 'Raad I']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030, USA. rhachem@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology/pathology', 'Chest Pain', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neutropenia', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21755 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Apr 1;106(7):1581-6. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21755.,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors measured the distribution, TCR-Vbeta repertoire, immunophenotype, and functional characteristics of different subsets of BM T lymphocytes from 61 nontreated patients with MG (30 patients with MG of undetermined significance [MGUS], 27 patients with multiple myeloma [MM], and 4 patients with plasma cell leukemia [PCL]). RESULTS: The authors found a significantly increased rate of BM infiltration by T cells in all patient groups, at the expense of CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8- T lymphocytes and both CD4+CD28- and CD8+CD28- cytotoxic/effector T cell subsets, and associated with TCR-Vbeta expansions in both CD4+ and CD8+ BM T cells in the majority of patients with MGUS, MM, and PCL. Moreover, the percentage of T cells secreting interferon (IFN)-gamma was found to be increased (P < or = 0.05) both in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in MGUS and MM patients, and a higher plasma concentration of IFN-gamma was found in patients with MM. It is interesting to note that a positive correlation was noted between the proportion of CD28- and both the percentage of IFN-gamma-secreting cells and the proportion of expanded TCR-Vbeta lymphocytes within the total BM CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated an increased infiltration of BM by T cells associated with frequent TCR-Vbeta expansions and a more prominent cytotoxic/Th1 phenotype in all the patient groups studied.","['Perez-Andres, Martin', 'Almeida, Julia', 'Martin-Ayuso, Marta', 'Moro, Maria Jesus', 'Martin-Nunez, Guillermo', 'Galende, Josefina', 'Hernandez, Jose', 'Mateo, Gema', 'San Miguel, Jesus F', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Perez-Andres M', 'Almeida J', 'Martin-Ayuso M', 'Moro MJ', 'Martin-Nunez G', 'Galende J', 'Hernandez J', 'Mateo G', 'San Miguel JF', 'Orfao A']","['Cytometry Service, Department of Medicine, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Paraproteinemias/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology/metabolism/pathology']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21746 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Mar 15;106(6):1296-305. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21746.,,,,,,"['Spanish Network on Multiple Myeloma', 'Spanish Network of Cancer Research Centers']",,,,['(c) 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-two patients were followed for six months during treatment. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed before treatment and after 3 and 6 months from treatment initiation. As compared with the third month, there was a significant decrease in BCR-ABL expression in the sixth month of treatment (P = 0.0002). At the sixth month, there was a significant difference in the levels of the two major transcripts of BCR-ABL, B2A2 and B3A2 (P = 0.0347), indicating that B2A2 may be more sensitive to imatinib.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical and MR findings in children with acute pelvic pyomyositis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 20 children (mean age 9.4 years) who were evaluated by MR and diagnosed with acute pelvis pyomyositis during the time period between January 2002 and June 2005. We reviewed clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. RESULTS: Fifteen of the 20 children had secondary pyomyositis associated with osteomyelitis (n=13), septic hip (n=4) or sacroiliitis (n=4); all were previously healthy except for one child with leukemia. Seven of the children with secondary pyomyositis underwent bone scintigraphy; three (43%) did not show pelvic abnormalities. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured in 13 of the 15 (87%) children. Five of the 20 children had primary pyomyositis. Three had underlying disease and two others were engaged in vigorous physical activity. Bone scintigraphies (n=2) were negative. Cultures were positive for S. aureus in three of the five (60%) children. CONCLUSION: Septic hip should be the first diagnostic consideration in children with fever and acute hip pain. Pyomyositis should be considered if arthrocentesis is negative or there is clinical suspicion of infection outside the hip joint. MR is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating foci of pyomyositis, muscle abscesses, and additional foci of infection within the pelvis.","['Karmazyn, Boaz', 'Kleiman, Martin B', 'Buckwalter, Kenneth', 'Loder, Randall T', 'Siddiqui, Aslam', 'Applegate, Kimberly E']","['Karmazyn B', 'Kleiman MB', 'Buckwalter K', 'Loder RT', 'Siddiqui A', 'Applegate KE']","['Department of Radiology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA. bkarmazy@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hip Joint/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Myositis/*diagnosis', 'Pelvic Infection/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staphylococcal Infections/*diagnosis']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/09/06 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00247-005-0082-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 2006 Apr;36(4):338-43. doi: 10.1007/s00247-005-0082-1.

The molecular basis for the leukemogenic effects of these fusion proteins is incompletely understood. Using gel-shift assay, we showed that AML1-ETO and AML1-MTG16 bound to a series of AML1 consensus DNA-binding sites with different affinities. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we demonstrated that a fusion of AML1 with ETO or MTG16 exhibits reduced intranuclear mobility compared with wild-type AML1 or either fusion partner. The dimerization domain (nervy homology region 2) of ETO is responsible for the reduced mobility of AML1-ETO. Dual FRAP studies revealed that CBFbeta colocalized with AML1-ETO within the nucleus, resulting in reduced mobility of CBFbeta. Therefore, AML1 fusion proteins may interfere with normal AML1 function due to aberrant nuclear dynamics, which leads to spatial and temporal sequestration of CBFbeta and perhaps other coregulators critical for myeloid differentiation.","['Qiu, J', 'Wong, J', 'Tweardy, D J', 'Dong, S']","['Qiu J', 'Wong J', 'Tweardy DJ', 'Dong S']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Transport', 'Xenopus']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/08/25 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209431 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209431 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Jun 29;25(28):3982-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209431.

Its three sub-families have distinct roles: the BH3-only proteins trigger apoptosis by binding via their BH3 domain to pro-survival relatives, while the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak have an essential downstream role involving disruption of organellar membranes and induction of caspase activation. The BH3-only proteins act as damage sensors, held inert until their activation by stress signals. Once activated, they were thought to bind promiscuously to pro-survival protein targets but unexpected selectivity has recently emerged from analysis of their interactions. Some BH3-only proteins also bind to Bax and Bak. Whether Bax and Bak are activated directly by these BH3-only proteins, or indirectly as a consequence of BH3-only proteins neutralizing their pro-survival targets is the subject of intense debate. Regardless of this, a detailed understanding of the interactions between family members, which are often selective, has notable implications for designing anti-cancer drugs to target the Bcl-2 family.","['van Delft, Mark F', 'Huang, David C S']","['van Delft MF', 'Huang DC']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, and Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/12/19 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['7310028 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cr.7310028 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2006 Feb;16(2):203-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.cr.7310028.,"['CA43540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generating effective CD8+ T cell-mediated responses to tumors is often impeded by T-cell tolerance to relevant tumor antigens, as most of these antigens are also expressed in normal tissues. We examined whether such tolerant T cells could be rescued and functionally restored for use in therapy of established tumors. We used a transgenic T-cell receptor (TCR) mouse model in which peripheral CD8+ T cells specific for a candidate tumor antigen also expressed in liver are tolerant, failing to proliferate or secrete interleukin (IL)-2 in response to antigen. Molecular and cellular analysis showed that these tolerant T cells expressed the IL-15 receptor alpha chain, and could be induced to proliferate in vitro in response to exogenous IL-15. Such proliferation abrogated tolerance and the rescued cells became effective in treating leukemia. Therefore, high-affinity CD8+ T cells are not necessarily deleted by encounter with self-antigen in the periphery, and can potentially be rescued and expanded for use in tumor immunotherapy.","['Teague, Ryan M', 'Sather, Blythe D', 'Sacks, Jilian A', 'Huang, Maria Z', 'Dossett, Michelle L', 'Morimoto, Junko', 'Tan, Xiaoxio', 'Sutton, Susan E', 'Cooke, Michael P', 'Ohlen, Claes', 'Greenberg, Philip D']","['Teague RM', 'Sather BD', 'Sacks JA', 'Huang MZ', 'Dossett ML', 'Morimoto J', 'Tan X', 'Sutton SE', 'Cooke MP', 'Ohlen C', 'Greenberg PD']","['Department of Immunology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Office H-564 HSC, Box 357650, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (IL15RA protein, human)', '0 (Il15ra protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/*immunology', 'Immunologic Memory/immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-15/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/metabolism']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/05/18 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2005/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['nm1359 [pii]', '10.1038/nm1359 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2006 Mar;12(3):335-41. doi: 10.1038/nm1359.

There are two types of integrins: cycle dependent and constitutionally expressed. The coexpression of cycle-dependent integrins may mark the ""implantation window"". The endometrium of fertile and infertile women may vary in expression of the integrins. Insufficient synthesis of integrins may be caused by a luteal phase deficiency.

In studies on tumor cell differentiation, agents such as cytokines, retinoids, forbol esters, and vitamin D3 are the most commonly used, and results show these substances may participate in different pathways of signal transduction. Retinoids and vitamin D3 mostly affect gene transcription via nuclear receptors, whereas cytokines act through membrane receptors.

Other aldehydes such as formaldehyde have been associated with increased cancer rates of the upper respiratory tract and leukemia. Our study is the only one, to our knowledge, to examine cancer rates among exposed glutaraldehyde workers. METHODS: In an extended follow up using death certificates, we calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for three cumulative exposure categories of glutaraldehyde. There were 99,730 person-years of observation among unexposed workers, 2934 person-years in the lower exposure category, < 0-100.0 parts per billion (ppb)-years, and 2805 person-years in the higher exposure category of 100.0+ ppb-years. RESULTS: For all respiratory cancers for these exposure categories, the SMRs were 0.9 (95% CI = 0.7-1.1), 1.0 (95% CI = 0.2-3.0), and 0.3 (95% CI = 0.0-1.5). No increasing trend of SMR with increasing exposure is observed for any cause of death examined. We observed no cancers of the nasal cavity and sinus (0.03 expected), nasopharynx (0.02 expected), or leukemia (0.6 expected) among all glutaraldehyde-exposed workers.

Based on the results of a recent study using 25 N-alkylated methylxanthines with carbohydrate side-chains of various lengths, we formulated the following design criteria for a methylxanthine molecule to effectively reverse P-gp mediated MDR: i) a massive substituent at the N1 position is crucial for MDR reversal potency; ii) elongation of the substituents at the N3 and N7 positions (from methyl to propyl) increases the efficacy of a xanthine to reverse MDR; iii) elongation of the substituent at the C8 position (from H to propyl) decreases the efficacy of a xanthine to reverse MDR. Based on these criteria, we synthesized and tested for potency to reverse MDR a new PTX derivative, 1-(10-undecylenyl)-3-heptyl-7-methyl xanthine (PTX-UHM), with prolonged substituents at the N1 and N3 positions.

It has been proposed that 2F5 neutralization might involve interaction of its long, hydrophobic, complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3, with adjacent viral membrane. Using Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) as a tool, we examined the effect of epitope position on 2F5 neutralization. When the 2F5 epitope was inserted in the proline-rich region of MLV Env surface protein (SU), 2F5 blocked cell fusion and virus infection, whereas MLV with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the same position was not neutralized by anti-HA, even though the antibodies bound their respective Envs on the surface of infected cells and viruses equally well. When the 2F5 epitope was inserted in the MLV Env TM at a position comparable to its natural position in HIV-1 TM, 2F5 antibody blocked Env-mediated cell fusion. Epitope position had subtle effects on neutralization by 2F5: the antibody concentration for 50% inhibition of cell fusion was more than 10-fold lower when the 2F5 epitope was in SU than in TM, and inhibition was less complete at high concentrations of antibody; we discuss possible explanations for these effects of epitope position. Since membrane proximity was not required for neutralization by 2F5 antibody, we speculate that the CDR H3 of 2F5 contributes to neutralization by destabilizing an adjacent protein rather than by inserting into an adjacent membrane.","['Ou, Wu', 'Lu, Ning', 'Yu, Sloane S', 'Silver, Jonathan']","['Ou W', 'Lu N', 'Yu SS', 'Silver J']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Building 4, Room 336, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HIV Antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/immunology', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'HIV Antibodies/*immunology', 'HIV Antigens/*immunology', 'HIV-1/*immunology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Neutralization Tests']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/03/18 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/5/2539 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.5.2539-2547.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Mar;80(5):2539-47. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.5.2539-2547.2006.,,,,PMC1395390,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a functional basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein coded in the minus strand of HTLV-1 genome (HBZ) was identified. We report here a novel isoform of the HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), HBZ-SI, identified by means of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) in conjunction with 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). HBZ-SI is a 206-amino-acid-long protein and is generated by alternative splicing between part of the HBZ gene and a novel exon located in the 3' long terminal repeat of the HTLV-1 genome. Consequently, these isoforms share >95% amino acid sequence identity, and differ only at their N termini, indicating that HBZ-SI is also a functional protein. Duplex RT-PCR and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that the mRNAs of these isoforms were expressed at equivalent levels in all ATL cell samples examined. Nonetheless, we found by Western blotting that the HBZ-SI protein was preferentially expressed in some ATL cell lines examined. A key finding was obtained from the subcellular localization analyses of these isoforms. Despite their high sequence similarity, each isoform was targeted to distinguishable subnuclear structures. These data show the presence of a novel isoform of HBZ in ATL cells, and in addition, shed new light on the possibility that each isoform may play a unique role in distinct regions in the cell nucleus.","['Murata, Ken', 'Hayashibara, Toshihisa', 'Sugahara, Kazuyuki', 'Uemura, Akiko', 'Yamaguchi, Taku', 'Harasawa, Hitomi', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Tsuruda, Kazuto', 'Okazaki, Toshiro', 'Koji, Takehiko', 'Miyanishi, Takayuki', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Murata K', 'Hayashibara T', 'Sugahara K', 'Uemura A', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Harasawa H', 'Hasegawa H', 'Tsuruda K', 'Okazaki T', 'Koji T', 'Miyanishi T', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Japan. kmurata@grape.med.tottori-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/03/18 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/5/2495 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.5.2495-2505.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Mar;80(5):2495-505. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.5.2495-2505.2006.,,,,PMC1395368,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AB219938'],,,,,,,

During the minus-sense DNA synthesis step of reverse transcription, the nascent DNA can transfer multiple times between the two copies of the genome, resulting in recombination. The mechanism for this process is similar to the process of obligate strand transfers mediated by the repeat and primer binding site sequences. The location at which the DNA 3' terminus completely transfers to the second RNA strand defines the point of crossover. Previous work in vitro demonstrated that reverse transcriptase pausing has a significant impact on the location of the crossover, with a proportion of complete transfer events occurring very close to pause sites. The role of pausing in vivo, however, is not clearly understood. By employing a murine leukemia virus-based single-cycle infection assay, strong pausing was shown to increase the probability of recombination, as reflected in the reconstitution of green fluorescent protein expression. The infection assay results were directly correlated with the presence of strong pause sites in reverse transcriptase primer extension assays in vitro. Conversely, when pausing was diminished in vitro, without changing the sequence of the RNA template involved in recombination, there was a significant reduction in recombination in vivo. Together, these data demonstrate that reverse transcriptase pausing, as observed in vitro, directly correlates with recombination during minus-sense DNA synthesis in vivo.","['Lanciault, Christian', 'Champoux, James J']","['Lanciault C', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle, 98195-7242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Reverse Transcription']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/03/18 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/5/2483 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.5.2483-2494.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Mar;80(5):2483-94. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.5.2483-2494.2006.,"['R01 CA051605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA051605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1369041,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Rev-dependent stimulation of viral late gene expression was observed with ATM-overexpressing cells, a result confirmed with a Rev-dependent reporter construct. Both parameters were also enhanced upon treatment of HeLa cells with caffeine, a xanthine that, in this cellular context, stimulates ATM activity. As well, decreased levels of virions with reduced infectivity were released by ATM knockdown cells. Notably, ATM overexpression did not stimulate the HIV-1 late gene expression within the context of Rev-independent constructs or the Rex-dependent production of capsid from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 proviral constructs.

They both restrict N-tropic murine leukemia virus with similar specificity yet act at different points in the viral life cycle. TRIM5alpha-restricted virus is usually unable to reverse transcribe, whereas Fv1-restricted virus reverse transcribes normally. Here we investigate the relationship between these two restriction factors by expressing Fv1 alleles in human cells. We demonstrate that Fv1 is able to compete with TRIM5alpha for virus before reverse transcription. In human cells expressing Fv1(b), N-tropic restricted virus becomes less infectious but reverse transcribes more efficiently, indicating competition between the two antiviral molecules and protection of the virus from TRIM5alpha by Fv1. Our findings suggest that, like TRIM5alpha, Fv1 interacts with virus before reverse transcription, but the consequences of this interaction are not realized until a later stage of the life cycle.

Chromatin remodeling due to histone acetylation and deacetylation is known to play an important role in transcriptional regulation of proinflammatory genes. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of inflammatory responses caused by cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in the human macrophage-like cell line MonoMac6 and whether the treatment of these cells with the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) monoethyl ester, or modulation of the thioredoxin redox system, can attenuate cigarette smoke-mediated IL-8 release. Exposure of MonoMac6 cells to CSE (1% and 2.5%) increased IL-8 and TNF-alpha production vs. control at 24 h and was associated with significant depletion of GSH levels associated with increased reactive oxygen species release in addition to activation of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of IKK ablated the CSE-mediated IL-8 release, suggesting that this process is dependent on the NF-kappaB pathway. CSE also reduced histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 protein levels. This was associated with posttranslational modification of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 protein by nitrotyrosine and aldehyde-adduct formation. Pretreatment of cells with GSH monoethyl ester, but not thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase, reversed cigarette smoke-induced reduction in HDAC levels and significantly inhibited IL-8 release. Thus cigarette smoke-induced release of IL-8 is associated with activation of NF-kappaB via IKK and reduction in HDAC levels/activity in macrophages. Moreover, cigarette smoke-mediated proinflammatory events are regulated by the redox status of the cells.","['Yang, Se-Ran', 'Chida, Asiya S', 'Bauter, Mark R', 'Shafiq, Nusrat', 'Seweryniak, Kathryn', 'Maggirwar, Sanjay B', 'Kilty, Iain', 'Rahman, Irfan']","['Yang SR', 'Chida AS', 'Bauter MR', 'Shafiq N', 'Seweryniak K', 'Maggirwar SB', 'Kilty I', 'Rahman I']","['Dept. of Environmental Medicine, Lung Biology and Disease Program, Univ. of Rochester Medical Center, 601 Elmwood Ave., Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,American journal of physiology.

These findings prompted us to evaluate whether human B-CLL cells express Cox-2 and synthesize prostaglandins. In contrast to naive human B cells, B-CLL cells constitutively expressed Cox-2 protein and produced PGE2, PGF2alpha, and TXA2. Elevated Cox-2 expression was seen in a subgroup of B-CLL cells that exhibit poor prognostic factors, including unmutated variable heavy chain status and increased CD38 expression. Furthermore, stimulation of B-CLL cells with CD40 ligand plus TNFalpha increased Cox-2 levels. The role of Cox-2 in promoting B-CLL survival was investigated using nonselective and selective Cox-2 inhibitors. Significant reductions in B-CLL survival occurred following Cox-2 inhibition. These new findings support that constitutive Cox-2 expression in B-CLL cells promotes their survival and possibly their expansion in vivo. It will therefore be important to evaluate drugs that inhibit Cox-2 as potential therapeutic agents in B-CLL in vivo.","['Ryan, Elizabeth P', 'Pollock, Stephen J', 'Kaur, Kuljeet', 'Felgar, Raymond E', 'Bernstein, Steven H', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Phipps, Richard P']","['Ryan EP', 'Pollock SJ', 'Kaur K', 'Felgar RE', 'Bernstein SH', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Phipps RP']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Immunol,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",100883537,"['0 (3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-4-phenyl-5-trifluoromethylisoxazole)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Sulfones)', '123653-11-2 (N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide)', '162054-19-5', '(1-((4-methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-3-trifluoromethyl-5-(4-fluorophenyl)pyrazole)', '57576-52-0 (Thromboxane A2)', 'B7IN85G1HY (Dinoprost)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 1)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*enzymology/immunology', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cyclooxygenase 1/immunology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Dinoprost/immunology', 'Dinoprostone/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Isoxazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'Nitrobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Thromboxane A2/immunology']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2005/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1521-6616(05)00439-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clim.2005.12.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol. 2006 Jul;120(1):76-90. doi: 10.1016/j.clim.2005.12.012.

We investigated the influence of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for their effects on differentiation and apoptosis in human cell lines with different Flt3 variants (THP-1 versus MV4-11 and MOLM13) dependent on the inhibition of Flt3 tyrosine kinase by the bis(lH-2-indolyl)methanone D-65476. While myeloid differentiation was not observed in both Flt3-ITD cell lines (MV4-11 and MOLM13), we demonstrate an enhanced proapoptotic effect of D-65476 in the presence of ATRA that was restricted to the Flt3-ITD expressing cells. The combined treatment with ATRA and D-65476 also led to a pronounced down-regulation of surviv in on mRNA and protein level in Flt3-ITD but not in Flt3 wildtype expressing cells (THP-1). Surprisingly, there was no differential expression of important proteins like Bcl-X(L), Bcl-2 or Bax that might explain enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, Akt phosphorylation after stimulation with Flt3 ligand dependent on D-65476 was not affected by pretreatment with ATRA. We suggest that regulation of inhibitors of apoptosis might play a crucial role how ATRA can increase the proapoptotic effect of Flt3 inhibitors in myeloid leukemia cells expressing Flt3-ITD. This effect can potentially be exploited for the treatment of Flt3-ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia.","['Scholl, S', 'Muller, R', 'Clement, J H', 'Loncarevic, I F', 'Bohmer, F D', 'Hoffken, K']","['Scholl S', 'Muller R', 'Clement JH', 'Loncarevic IF', 'Bohmer FD', 'Hoffken K']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Oncology and Hematology, Erlanger Allee 101, Friedrich Schiller University, 07740 Jena, Germany. sebastian.scholl@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (D-65476)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/09/01 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2005/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00376-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 May;30(5):633-42. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.10.005.

Telomeric sequences influence the progress of cellular senescence and cancer progression. It has been reported that telomeres are shortened in acute leukemias where the cell turnover is high. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a particularly interesting haematological malignancy in regard to telomere dynamics because most of the malignant cells in CLL are mitotically inactive. In this study, we analysed the telomere length in patients with B-cell CLL in a comparison with the control group by using ddPRINS technique. Twenty patients with CLL and four healthy donors as a control group were included. We found short telomeres and no detectable telomeric repeats at the sites of chromosome fusion. We hypothesise that the telomeric erosion in CLL may reflect the dominance of malignant cells with an abnormally long life span. These cells may have encountered many antigenic stimulants in the past and hence underwent multiple clonal expansions. Our findings imply that shortened telomeres in CLL may be reflecting the ""history"" of the disease and serve as an independent prognostic factor.","['Palanduz, Sukru', 'Serakinci, Nedime', 'Cefle, Kivanc', 'Aktan, Melih', 'Tutkan, Gulcin', 'Ozturk, Sukru', 'Bozkurt, Gokay', 'Dincol, Guncag', 'Pekcelen, Yuksel', 'Koch, Jorn']","['Palanduz S', 'Serakinci N', 'Cefle K', 'Aktan M', 'Tutkan G', 'Ozturk S', 'Bozkurt G', 'Dincol G', 'Pekcelen Y', 'Koch J']","['Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Genetics, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Med Genet,European journal of medical genetics,101247089,,IM,"['Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Primed In Situ Labeling/*methods', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Telomere/*genetics']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2004/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1769-7212(05)00029-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmg.2005.01.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Genet. 2006 Jan-Feb;49(1):63-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmg.2005.01.023.

Unlike RARalpha, the fusion proteins homodimerize, which may be central to oncogenic activation. This model was tested by replacing PML with dimerization domains from p50NFkappaB (p50-RARalpha) or the rapamycin-sensitive dimerizing peptide of FKBP12 (F3-RARalpha). The X-RARalpha fusions recapitulated in vitro activities of PML-RARalpha. For F3-RARalpha, these properties were rapamycin sensitive. Although in vivo the artificial fusions alone are poor initiators of leukemia, p50-RARalpha readily cooperates with an activated mutant CDw131 to induce APL-like disease.

Current models of retroviral particle assembly describe the recruitment of the host vacuolar protein sorting machinery to the cell surface to induce the budding of new particles. Previous fluorescence microscopy study reported the vesicular traffic of the MLV components (Gag, Env and RNA). Here, electron microscopy (EM) associated with immunolabeling approaches were used to go deeply into the assembly of the ""prototypic"" MLV in chronically infected NIH3T3 cells. RESULTS: Beside the virus budding events seen at the cell surface of infected cells, we observed that intracellular budding events could also occur inside the intracellular vacuoles in which many VLPs accumulated. EM in situ hybridization and immunolabeling analyses confirmed that these latter were MLV particles. Similar intracellular particles were detected in cells expressing MLV Gag alone. Compartments containing the MLV particles were identified as late endosomes using Lamp1 endosomal/lysosomal marker and BSA-gold pulse-chase experiments.

Paradigm models of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and chronic myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.",505-14,"Tumour formations arise as a consequence of alterations in the control of cell proliferation as well as with disorders in interactions between cells and their environment that result in invasion and metastasis. Recent advances in understanding the genetic basis of malignant diseases have been dominated by research in colorectal cancer. Genetic alterations of several proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes (e.g. APC/MCC, RAS, DCC, p53 mutations and/or allelic losses, hyperexpression of c-MYC and RB genes), as well as other genomic alterations, appear at characteristic stages of tumor development and are observed in most neoplasms. Generally, the normal cell has multiple independent mechanisms that regulate its growth and differentiation potential, and several separate events would, therefore, be needed to override these control mechanisms, as well as induce the other aspects of the transformed phenotype, like metastasis. These signals may be either positive or negative, and the acquisition of tumorigenicity results from genetic changes that affect these control points following a multistep mode. Statistics of the frequency of cancer incidence with age in humans indicate that for the genesis of e.g. lung carcinoma, five or six steps are required. Other types of cancers, such as leukemias and sarcomas, probably require quite a different number of rate-limiting changes. One of the best characterized tumours to provide a genetic model is colorectal tumorigenesis. Mutations implicated in breast cancer tumorigenicity are also studied and used as a genetic model in the literature worldwide. Finally, activation of c-abl in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia could also be presented as an example, which provides probably the strongest evidence for the role of proto-oncogenes in human malignancy process.","['Karakosta, A', 'Golias, Ch', 'Charalabopoulos, A', 'Peschos, D', 'Batistatou, A', 'Charalabopoulos, K']","['Karakosta A', 'Golias Ch', 'Charalabopoulos A', 'Peschos D', 'Batistatou A', 'Charalabopoulos K']","['Dept. of Physiology, Clinical Unit, Medical Faculty, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/06/02 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Dec;24(4):505-14.,,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The timing of infection and the susceptibility of cells in early gestational stages are not well understood. In this study we investigated the susceptibility of embryonic stem (ES) cells to CMV infection during differentiation. METHODS: ES cell lines were established from transgenic mice integrated with the murine CMV (MCMV) immediate-early (IE) promoter connected with a reporter lacZ gene. The susceptibility of the ES cells was analyzed in terms of viral gene expression and viral replication after induction of differentiation. RESULTS: ES cells were nonpermissive to MCMV infection in the undifferentiated state. Upon differentiation, permissive cells appeared approximately 2 weeks after the leukemia inhibitory factor was removed. Upon neural differentiation by retinoic acid (RA), glial cells showed specific susceptibility in terms of expression of the viral antigen. The MCMV IE promoter was not activated in ES cells from the transgenic mice. Activation of the IE promoter was detected approximately 2 weeks after induction of differentiation and observed predominantly in glial cells. Upon MCMV infection of the ES cells, viral infection was correlated with the activation of the IE promoter.

The objectives of this review were to summarize the most important oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in urothelial carcinoma and to address their role in pathogenesis, their prognostic value, and their potential use as therapeutic targets. The collected data led the authors to propose a common pathway in which the fibroblastic growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) mutation seems to be the earliest genetic abnormality responsible for the transformation from normal tissue to atypia and dysplasia. Three different progression pathways were proposed: The first operative pathway is from dysplasia to superficial papillary pathologic Ta (pTa) tumors to pT1 tumors and, ultimately, to pT2 tumors with FGFR3 and tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) the responsible genes. The second major operative pathway is from dysplasia, to carcinoma in situ, and to solid pT1 and pT2 tumors. The third pathway of progression is from dysplasia to papillary T1 and pT2 tumors. The genes involved in the last 2 pathways are the p53, serine threonine protein kinase 15 (STK15), triple-function domain (TRIO), fragile histidine triad (FHIT), p63 genes; and alterations of 20q and 5p, alterations of adhesions, angiogenesis, and matrix-remodeling gene products also are involved. Finally, murine leukemia viral oncogene homologue 1 (RAF1) and CD9 are involved in the progression from papillary pT1 tumors to pT2 tumors.","['Mhawech-Fauceglia, Paulette', 'Cheney, Richard T', 'Schwaller, Juerg']","['Mhawech-Fauceglia P', 'Cheney RT', 'Schwaller J']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. pmhawech1@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Oncogene Proteins)'],IM,"['*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Urothelium/metabolism/pathology']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21743 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Mar 15;106(6):1205-16. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21743.,,101,,,,,,,,['(c) 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

Despite the relevance of clonal CD34+ cells in developing MDS, only few studies analyze the phenotype of this cell population. The aim of this study was to evaluate phenotypic changes on HPC in MDS that could reflect abnormalities in the differentiation process of stem cells. METHODS: We analyzed the expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD34+ cells by flow cytometry in 36 patients with MDS, as well as in healthy donors (n = 12) and patients with other hematological disorders: non-Hodgkin lymphomas and multiple myeloma, both in complete remission (CR) (n = 32); acute lymphoblastic leukemia in CR (n = 17); de novo acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) at diagnosis (n = 22) and in CR (n = 37); and AML secondary to MDS at diagnosis (n = 19). Cases with available karyotype were grouped according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). RESULTS: Compared to normal BM, the fraction of immature HPC, characterized as CD34+bright, intermediate FSC/SSC, and CD38dim, was significantly increased in high risk MDS and secondary AML, but not in low risk MDS, (P < or = 0.001, P = 0.03, and P = 0.7). De novo AML showed decreased immature HPC. High numbers of immature HPC correlated with higher IPSS risk groups (P = 0.05) and showed significant impact on disease progression (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that evaluation of CD38 expression pattern on HPC is an easy and reproducible test that allows evaluating the immature subset of progenitor cells. Increased immature HPC in high risk MDS and secondary AML may reflect blocked differentiation of CD34+ cells in these diseases.","['Monreal, Mariela B', 'Pardo, Maria L', 'Pavlovsky, Miguel A', 'Fernandez, Isolda', 'Corrado, Claudia S', 'Giere, Isabel', 'Sapia, Sandra', 'Pavlovsky, Santiago']","['Monreal MB', 'Pardo ML', 'Pavlovsky MA', 'Fernandez I', 'Corrado CS', 'Giere I', 'Sapia S', 'Pavlovsky S']","['FUNDALEU (Foundation to Fight Leukemia) and Centro de Investigacion Clinica A.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, comparative study designed in the haematology unit of a university hospital in Turkey. RESULTS: A total of 89 febrile episodes in 60 neutropenic patients were treated; 29 febrile episodes in 23 patients with ceftazidime plus amikacin (group 1), 30 episodes in 25 patients with piperacillin/tazobactam plus amikacin (group 2), and 30 episodes in 25 patients with meropenem plus amikacin (group 3). The 3 groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, underlying malignancy, pretherapy neutrophil counts, duration of neutropenia and types of infections. Neutropenia, since the start of fever, persisted for > or =10 days in all of the episodes in the 3 study groups. Nearly all of the episodes were seen in patients with acute leukaemia. In 25.8% (23/89) of the febrile neutropenia episodes, an aetiologic organism was isolated, with gram-negative bacteria being the most commonly isolated. The success without modification rates were 34.5%, 30% and 36.7% for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P >0.05). After modification with a different class of antimicrobial therapy, the response rates increased to 65.5%, 63.3% and 70% for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P >0.05). The mean duration of treatment and the time to defervescence were also comparable in all groups. In all arms, side effects were minimal. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the 3 regimens were equally effective and safe in the empirical treatment of high-risk febrile neutropenic episodes.","['Serefhanoglu, K', 'Ersoy, Y', 'Serefhanoglu, S', 'Aydogdu, I', 'Kuku, I', 'Kaya, E']","['Serefhanoglu K', 'Ersoy Y', 'Serefhanoglu S', 'Aydogdu I', 'Kuku I', 'Kaya E']","['Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Inonu University, School of Medicine, Turgut Ozal Medical Center, Turkey. drkivancse@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Thienamycins)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', '87-53-6 (Penicillanic Acid)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'FV9J3JU8B1 (Meropenem)', 'SE10G96M8W (Tazobactam)', 'X00B0D5O0E (Piperacillin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amikacin/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Ceftazidime/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Meropenem', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Penicillanic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Piperacillin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Tazobactam', 'Thienamycins/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2006/02/14 09:00,2007/02/14 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2006 Jan;35(1):11-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children are now surviving malignancies that previously resulted in mortality. Complications, however, occur including thrombosis that result in mortality and morbidity. This review will explore the association in children and discuss the epidemiology and evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of thrombosis in this cohort. RECENT FINDINGS: Thrombin is an important link between malignancy, metastases, and inflammation. The accurate diagnosis of thrombosis in the upper venous system is directly related to the diagnostic technique used. Antithrombotic treatment is challenging owing to higher risks of bleeding, for example, decreased platelet counts, tiffelitis, large vascular tumor, etc. SUMMARY: Thrombosis and malignancy are associated in children.

In this study, we show that the transforming property of Meis1 is modulated by 3 conserved domains, namely the Pbx interaction motif (PIM), the homeodomain, and the C-terminal region recently described to possess transactivating properties. Meis1 and Pbx1 interaction domain-swapping mutants are dysfunctional separately, but restore the full oncogenic activity of Meis1 when cotransduced in primary cells engineered to overexpress Hoxa9, thus implying a modular nature for PIM in Meis1-accelerated transformation. Moreover, we show that the transactivating domain of VP16 can restore, and even enhance, the oncogenic potential of the Meis1 mutant lacking the C-terminal 49 amino acids. In contrast to Meis1, the fusion VP16-Meis1 is spontaneously oncogenic, and all leukemias harbor genetic activation of endogenous Hoxa9 and/or Hoxa7, suggesting that Hoxa gene activation represents a key event required for the oncogenic activity of VP16-Meis1.","['Mamo, Aline', 'Krosl, Jana', 'Kroon, Evert', 'Bijl, Janet', 'Thompson, Alexander', 'Mayotte, Nadine', 'Girard, Simon', 'Bisaillon, Richard', 'Beslu, Nathalie', 'Featherstone, Mark', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Mamo A', 'Krosl J', 'Kroon E', 'Bijl J', 'Thompson A', 'Mayotte N', 'Girard S', 'Bisaillon R', 'Beslu N', 'Featherstone M', 'Sauvageau G']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Stem Cells, Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65/physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia/*etiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/08/23 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52815-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-06-2244 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jul 15;108(2):622-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2244.

We have previously demonstrated that IM reversibly blocks proliferation but does not induce apoptosis of primitive CML cells. Here, we have attempted to overcome this resistance with dasatinib. Primitive IM-resistant CML cells showed only single-copy BCR-ABL but expressed significantly higher BCR-ABL transcript levels and BCR-ABL protein compared with more mature CML cells (P = .031). In addition, CrKL phosphorylation was higher in the primitive CD34(+)CD38(-) than in the total CD34(+) population (P = .002). In total CD34(+) CML cells, IM inhibited phosphorylation of CrKL at 16 but not 72 hours, consistent with enrichment of an IM-resistant primitive population.

Several studies have suggested that the expression levels of Bcr-Abl are elevated at disease progression to blast crisis and that this plays a significant role in the achievement of drug resistance. We have established cell lines expressing low and high levels of Bcr-Abl to study the molecular mechanisms involved in disease progression and drug resistance. It is now known that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can play a major role in the regulation of apoptosis. We therefore investigated whether Bcr-Abl expression modulates ER homeostasis and interferes with ER-mediated apoptotic pathways to promote survival. Bcr-Abl-expressing cells exhibit a decreased amount of free releasable calcium in the ER as well as a weaker capacitative calcium entry response, relative to parental cells. This effect is independent of Bcl-2, which is a known modulator of ER calcium homeostasis. The reduction in ER releasable calcium results in inhibition of the ER/mitochondria-coupling process and mitochondrial calcium uptake. This study demonstrates a novel downstream consequence of Bcr-Abl signaling. The ability to negate calcium-dependent apoptotic signaling is likely to be a major prosurvival mechanism in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells.","['Piwocka, Katarzyna', 'Vejda, Susanne', 'Cotter, Thomas G', ""O'Sullivan, Gerald C"", 'McKenna, Sharon L']","['Piwocka K', 'Vejda S', 'Cotter TG', ""O'Sullivan GC"", 'McKenna SL']","['Department of Biochemistry, BioSciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/06/15 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63830-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-04-1523 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 15;107(10):4003-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-04-1523.

An immunohistochemical study was carried out on some of the most common kinds of cancer. All of these cancers had serologically high levels of HbF as evaluated previously. METHODS: Immunoaffinity-purified anti-HbF was immunohistochemically used to study F cell distribution in the following cancers: colorectal adenocarcinoma, urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma, brain tumours, lung carcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma, leukaemia, Burkitt's lymphoma and endometrial carcinoma. RESULTS: In colorectal adenocarcinoma, HbF-containing red blood cells (FRBC) were present within thin-walled vessels or were disposed in dense clusters within the tumour. Some of these cells were nucleated or binucleated HbF-erythroblasts or HbF-normoblasts (FNBS). In two cases, high levels of mitoses within HbF-erythroblasts were observed. In half of the cases with transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, regional intratumoral blood vessels were found to contain 5-50% FRBC. In the other tumours examined, F cells were not observed. FRBCs, however, were occasionally observed in the regional lymph nodes of some of these cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of HbF as a potential plasma marker is suggested by the high concentration of FRBCs in colorectal tumours. The apparent development of FRBCs in colorectal tumour tissues is an interesting observation, as these cells were previously thought to develop in medullary or lymphoid tissues. It is thus suggested that the colonic microenvironment may stimulate extramedullary fetal-type haematopoiesis.","['Wolk, M', 'Martin, J E', 'Reinus, C']","['Wolk M', 'Martin JE', 'Reinus C']","['Department of Morbid Anatomy and Histopathology, The Royal London Hospital, London, UK. wolk1@bezeqint.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*blood supply', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/blood supply', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood supply', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*blood supply', 'Erythroblasts/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Lung Neoplasms/blood supply', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*metabolism', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/blood supply']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcp.2005.029934 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2005.029934 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2006 Jun;59(6):598-602. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2005.029934.

Our aims were to assess the mechanisms by which over-expression of IL-6 promotes transformed cell growth in malignant cholangiocytes. METHODS: Stably transfected cell lines over-expressing IL-6 were derived from malignant human cholangiocytes. Transformed cell growth was assessed by anchorage independent growth in vitro and by xenograft growth in nude mice. Expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 was quantitated by immunoblot analysis and by real-time PCR. Gene silencing was performed using siRNA. Dominant negative upstream kinase activators and isoform-specific constructs were used to evaluate the involvement of p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways. RESULTS: Over-expression of IL-6 increased xenograft growth, anchorage independent growth and cell survival but did not significantly alter cell proliferation. The basal expression of Mcl-1 was increased in IL-6 over-expressing cells. Selective knockdown of Mcl-1 by siRNA increased gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, IL-6 increased Mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression via a p38 MAPK dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a major role of survival signaling pathways in mediating the effects of IL-6 over-expression in cholangiocarcinoma growth. Mcl-1 is identified as a mediator of IL-6-induced tumor cell survival and shown to be transcriptionally regulated by IL-6 via a p38 MAPK dependent pathway. We conclude that modulation of IL-6 mediated survival signaling pathways involving the p38 MAPK or downstream targets such as Mcl-1 may prove useful therapeutic strategies for human cholangiocarcinoma.","['Meng, Fanyin', 'Yamagiwa, Yoko', 'Ueno, Yoshiyuki', 'Patel, Tushar']","['Meng F', 'Yamagiwa Y', 'Ueno Y', 'Patel T']","['Division of Gastroenterology, Scott and White Clinic, Texas A&M University System Health Science Center College of Medicine, 2401 South 31st Street, Temple, TX 76508, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/08/12 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2005/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-8278(05)00770-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jhep.2005.10.030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 2006 Jun;44(6):1055-65. doi: 10.1016/j.jhep.2005.10.030.

Using a single cycle reversion assay, we unexpectedly found that the reversion rates of HIV, avian leukosis virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus were the same, within statistical error. Because both the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) and cellular RNA polymerase II (RNAP) are required for viral replication, we hypothesized that the similar reversion rates actually reflect the intrinsic error rate of RNAP, which is the enzyme common to all three retroviruses in the reversion assay. To address this possibility, HIV vectors with the U3 region replaced by a reporter reversion cassette were constructed and vector supernatant produced by transient transfection. All single integrant revertant cell lines showed the identical mutations at both long terminal repeats. This indicates that either RNAP or another cellular enzyme is responsible for these reversions, or that HIV RT only makes errors during first strand synthesis. Additionally, when HIV particles were rescued from an integrated vector as opposed to being produced by transient transfection, the reversion rate was significantly lower, suggesting that one or more factors in the virus-producing cells plays a role in the fidelity of retroviral replication. These results have implications regarding the fidelity of the transgene after transient transfection production of lentiviral vector supernatants.","['Laakso, Meg M', 'Sutton, Richard E']","['Laakso MM', 'Sutton RE']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV/genetics/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics/*physiology', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/physiology', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Temperature', '*Transfection', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/07/01 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2005/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(05)00849-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2005.12.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2006 May 10;348(2):406-17. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2005.12.037.

Methods to reliably generate antigen-specific T-cell responses in vitro would be useful not only to screen candidate antigens for immunogenicity prior to embarking on in vivo vaccination trials, but also to generate T-cell lines or clones that could be used directly for adoptive immunotherapy approaches. Although many techniques have proven successful for expanding ex vivo effector cells from antigen-specific memory CD8(+) cells that have been primed in vivo, methods to reliably generate high-avidity CTL clones from the naive repertoire have not been well described. Various methods for the induction and expansion of antigen-specific CD8(+) CTL clones from healthy A2(+) donors were compared, using WT1 as a model tumor-associated antigen for which there is a low frequency of precursor T cells in naive individuals. In contrast to the well-studied Melan-A/MART-1 (Melan-A) A2-restricted response, for which the CD8(+) T-cell precursor frequency in the naive repertoire is unusually high, successful expansion of WT1-specific CD8(+) T cells appeared to be more dependent upon cell culture conditions. In particular, primary stimulation with autologous peptide-loaded monocyte-derived DC generated in 48 h (DC2d) was more effective in expanding WT1-reactive populations of CTL than stimulation with DC generated using the more standard week-long protocol (DC7d). Adding supplemental IL-7 2 to 3 days after initiation of a stimulation cycle expanded antigen-specific cells within CTL lines more efficiently than including the cytokine from the beginning of the cycle. Following primary stimulation with peptide-loaded mature DC, subsequent restimulation with peptide-loaded PBMC as the stimulators was more effective at expanding antigen-specific cells than repeated stimulation with mature DC. Using these techniques, high-avidity CTL clones specific for an A()0201-restricted epitope of WT1 have been generated from nearly all normal A2(+) donors tested. Such clones have been demonstrated to be capable of recognizing and lysing leukemic cells, and will soon be tested for therapeutic activity in clinical trials of adoptive immunotherapy in patients with relapsed leukemia after transplantation.","['Ho, William Y', 'Nguyen, Hieu N', 'Wolfl, Matthias', 'Kuball, Juergen', 'Greenberg, Philip D']","['Ho WY', 'Nguyen HN', 'Wolfl M', 'Kuball J', 'Greenberg PD']","['Program in Immunology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Clone Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-7/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*cytology/*immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/immunology']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/05/10 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2005/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-1759(05)00429-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jim.2005.11.023 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2006 Mar 20;310(1-2):40-52. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2005.11.023.

Important kinases such as Inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK)2, mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases and phsopho-inositol (PI)3 kinase regulate inflammation either through activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as activating protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), which are activated in airway disease, or through regulation of mRNA half-life. Selective kinase inhibitors have been developed which reduce inflammation and some characteristics of disease in animal models. Targeting specific kinases that are overexpressed or over active in disease should allow for selective treatment of respiratory diseases. Interest in this area has intensified due to the success of the specific Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene (Abl) kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Encouraging data from animal models and primary cells and early Phase I and II studies in other diseases suggest that inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase and IKK2 may prove to be useful novel therapies in the treatment of severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis and other inflammatory airway diseases.","['Adcock, Ian M', 'Chung, K Fan', 'Caramori, Gaetano', 'Ito, Kazuhiro']","['Adcock IM', 'Chung KF', 'Caramori G', 'Ito K']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Group, Airways Disease Section, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, Dovehouse Street, London, SW3, 6LY, United Kingdom. ian.adcock@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication', 'Review']",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Asthma/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/drug therapy/enzymology']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/05/12 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2005/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(05)01383-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.12.054 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2006 Mar 8;533(1-3):118-32. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.12.054.

This review summarizes recent evidence of similarities between the behaviour of ND10 components and DNA repair pathway proteins in response to viral infection and DNA damage. ND10 structures become associated with the parental genomes and early replication compartments of many DNA viruses, and DNA repair pathway proteins are also recruited to these sites. Similarly, PML and DNA repair proteins are recruited to sites of DNA damage. The mechanisms by which these events might occur, and the implications for ND10 function in DNA virus infection and chromatin metabolism, are discussed.","['Everett, Roger D']",['Everett RD'],"['MRC Virology Unit, Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, Scotland, UK. r.everett@vir.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Microbiol,Cellular microbiology,100883691,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA Viruses/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['CMI677 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00677.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Microbiol. 2006 Mar;8(3):365-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00677.x.,['MC_U130169966/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They can significantly enhance the effectiveness of Photofrin-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced cell killing. In this study, the peroxidizability of conjugated fatty acid isomers (9c,11t-linoleic acid and 9c,11c-linoleic acid) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; linoleic acid, gamma-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid) with 2,2'-azo-bis(2-amidinpropane)dihydrochloride, soybean lipoxygenase and photomediated peroxidation are compared with each other. Peroxidation was determined using different methods: by means of gas chromatography to estimate the fatty acid (FA) consumption, by photometry for the level of FA peroxides or phospholipid peroxides and by definition of the content of malondialdehyde for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The results suggest that the generation of oxidation products from individual FAs indicate a different formation rate of oxidation products. Radical FA peroxides were produced most by polyunsaturated arachidonic acid, followed by linoleic acid and gamma-linolenic acid, whereas conjugated FA isomers did not generate peroxides. Accordingly, the levels of lipid peroxides and TBARS were substantially increased after incorporation and oxidation of polyunsaturated FAs into U937 cells and could significantly enhance the effectiveness of Photofrin-PDT-induced cytotoxicity. The results showed that PUFA, but not conjugated FA supplementation of U937 cells, can act as a PDT amplification factor.","['Voigt, Astrid', 'Agatha, Gerhard', 'Zintl, Felix']","['Voigt A', 'Agatha G', 'Zintl F']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University of Jena, Germany.

CONCLUSION: Poorly-immunogenic tumor cells can induce the proliferation of TR cells, which may play an important role in tumor evasion.","['Wang, Yan', 'Zhou, Le', 'Geng, Yi-ping', 'Si, Lu-sheng', 'Wang, Yi-li']","['Wang Y', 'Zhou L', 'Geng YP', 'Si LS', 'Wang YL']","[""The Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, Institute for Cancer Reasearch, School of Life Sciences and Technology College, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""]",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*cytology/immunology']",2006/02/14 09:00,2007/06/09 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Sep;34(9):583-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of some studies suggest the Wilms tumour gene (WT1) as a possible molecular marker of MRD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured the expression of WT1 at diagnosis and during treatment of the acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. The expression of WT1 was measured by the quantitative real-time RT-PCR in peripheral leukocytes from 56 AML at diagnosis and 7 patients with AML transformed from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The WT1 expression was significantly elevated (up to 3 orders of magnitude) in peripheral blood samples (PB) of AML patients at diagnosis compared to PB samples of healthy donors (P < 0.0001). The level of WT1 expression depends particularly on FAB AML subtype, with the highest being found in AML patients with subtypes M4, M1, M3 and AML transformed from MDS. Conversely, AML patients with M2 and with the presence of AML1/ET0 at presentation showed a significantly lower expression of the WT1 gene compared to the remaining AML patients at presentation (P = 0,005). Further, sequence samples of 12 AML patients under long-term surveillance were tested for the WT1 expression in parallel with the expression of specific MRD markers--fusion genes: AMLI/ETO, PML/RARalpha and CBFB/MYH11. The levels of WT1 gene expression and the above specific fusion genes significantly correlated. Moreover, 14 patients without the specific MRD marker were tested for the WT1 expression. The results show that haematological relapses were associated with the rise of expression of the specific fusion genes and with the WT1 gene expression. The rise of WT1 expression above the level seen in leucocytes from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow of healthy donors--in four patients under long-term surveillance the ""molecular relapse"" predicted ongoing haematological relapses as early as 2 months in advance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, in accordance with some of the previously published ones, show that WT1 expression seems to be a suitable marker of minimal residual disease in AML patients.","['Polak, J', 'Markova, J', 'Schwarz, J', 'Maaloufova, J', 'Volkova, Z', 'Cermak, J', 'Haskovec, C']","['Polak J', 'Markova J', 'Schwarz J', 'Maaloufova J', 'Volkova Z', 'Cermak J', 'Haskovec C']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha. japol@uhkt.cz']",['cze'],['Journal Article'],Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '139874-82-1 (RT-TIP protein, Nicotiana tabacum)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/analysis', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis', 'Plant Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2006;145(1):36-42.,,,Uziti kvantitativniho stanoveni exprese genu wilmsova tumoru 1 pro monitorovani rezidualni nemoci pacientu s akutni myeloidni leukemii.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we present our experience with monitoring of residual disease using real-time PCR with hybridization probes detection in patients treated with imatinib mesylate and in collected peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured the level of BCR-ABL transcripts in peripheral blood cells of 27 subjects before and in the course of the imatinib treatment. The median of relative quantity of BCR-ABL in the blood before imatinib therapy was 2.55%. The number of the transcripts in 23 imatinib-sensitive subjects decreased to 0.02% in 6 months. After 12 months of the treatment the BCR-ABL median was 0.005%. Subsequent levels fluctuated between values below the detection limit (DL, 0.001%) and 0.005%. Three patients were primarily resistant to imatinib with the BCR-ABL range of 0.13%-11.7% during the treatment. One subject showed marks of molecular relapse after 18 months of the treatment. Only two of 16 filgrastim-stimulated patients had BCR-ABL levels in the blood and in collected PBPC below DL. In other subjects BCR-ABL transcripts were determined within the measurable range of RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account prognostic importance, the measurement of BCR-ABL transcripts is an effective approach to monitoring of residual CML kinetics. Evaluation of BCR-ABL levels in collected PBPC can complete information on quality of the cells in potential autotransplants, and choose subsequent therapeutic protocols and patient prognosis.","['Beranek, M', 'Voglova, J', 'Sykorova, A', 'Belada, D', 'Blaha, M']","['Beranek M', 'Voglova J', 'Sykorova A', 'Belada D', 'Blaha M']","['Ustav klinicke biochemie a diagnostiky LF UK a FN, Hradec Kralove. beranek@lfhk.cuni.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",2006/02/14 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2006/02/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2006;145(1):25-9; discussion 29-30.,,,Vyznam kvantitativniho hodnoceni transkriptu BCR-ABL pomoci real-time PCR pro efektivni lecbu chronicke myeloidni leukemie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the notable performance achieved by ATRA in the differentiation induction therapy, we investigated the role of JWA in ATRA-mediated differentiation of the human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. We found that concomitant with the progressive cell differentiation, JWA expression was up-regulated by ATRA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Inhibition of JWA expression by RNA interference partially blocked ATRA-induced differentiation and growth inhibition of HL-60 cells. Pre-treatment of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (TPA), a PKC activator, decreased ATRA-mediated differentiation, companied with the down-regulation of JWA expression. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3), 0.5 microM) enhanced the cellular differentiation induced by 0.01 microM ATRA, but had no noticeable effect on the differentiation induced by 0.1 microM ATRA. Concurrent with the enhancement, JWA expression was up-regulated. All the data suggest that up-regulation of JWA expression is essential for ATRA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. And JWA, associated with PKC, is involved in its signal pathways. Ideal therapeutic efficacy with low toxicity may be obtained if low doses of ATRA (0.01 microM) and As(2)O(3) (0.5 microM) are combined. These findings may present a novel mechanism that cellular differentiation and growth inhibition induced by ATRA are mediated at least in part through regulation of JWA expression. JWA may be a novel molecular marker for ATRA-induced HL-60 cell differentiation. ATRA up-regulates JWA expression by stimulating the transcriptional activity of JWA gene promoter.","['Huang, Shu', 'Shen, Qun', 'Mao, Wen-Ge', 'Li, Ai-Ping', 'Ye, Jian', 'Liu, Qi-Zhan', 'Zou, Chang-Ping', 'Zhou, Jian-Wei']","['Huang S', 'Shen Q', 'Mao WG', 'Li AP', 'Ye J', 'Liu QZ', 'Zou CP', 'Zhou JW']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Toxicology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics and Applied Toxicology, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (ARL6IP5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Interference', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', '*Up-Regulation']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/08/29 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2005/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11373-005-9068-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Sci. 2006 May;13(3):357-71. doi: 10.1007/s11373-005-9068-0.

The in vitro induction of tumor-reactive CTL requires repeated stimulation of CTL precursors with dendritic cells (DC). To circumvent problems like scarcity of blood DC precursors and donor variability, it would be attractive to use DC from a non-autologous, unlimited source. DCs derived from the human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line MUTZ-3 are attractive candidates since these DCs closely resemble monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) in terms of phenotype and T cell stimulatory capacity. Here we demonstrate that functional CTL clones could be generated against multiple tumor-associated antigens, i.e., human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), ErbB3-binding protein-1 (Ebp1), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and Her-2/neu, by stimulating CD8beta(+) CTL precursors with peptide-loaded allogeneic, HLA-A2-matched MUTZ-3-derived DC. A consistent induction capacity, as determined by MHC tetramer-binding, was found in multiple donors and comparable to autologous peptide-loaded MoDC. Functional characterization at the clonal level revealed the priming of CTL that recognized endogenously processed epitopes on tumor cell lines in an HLA-A2-restricted fashion. Our data indicate that MUTZ-3-derived DC can be used as stimulator cells for in vitro priming and expansion of functional TAA-specific effector CTL. MUTZ-3-derived DCs thus represent a ready and standardized source of allogeneic DC to generate CTL for therapeutic adoptive transfer strategies.","['Santegoets, Saskia J A M', 'Schreurs, Marco W J', 'Masterson, Allan J', 'Liu, Ying Poi', 'Goletz, Steffen', 'Baumeister, Hans', 'Kueter, Esther W M', 'Lougheed, Sinead M', 'van den Eertwegh, Alfons J M', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'Hooijberg, Erik', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D']","['Santegoets SJ', 'Schreurs MW', 'Masterson AJ', 'Liu YP', 'Goletz S', 'Baumeister H', 'Kueter EW', 'Lougheed SM', 'van den Eertwegh AJ', 'Scheper RJ', 'Hooijberg E', 'de Gruijl TD']","['Departments of Pathology, VU University Medical Center, P.O. box 7057, 1007 MB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (PA2G4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clone Cells', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*transplantation', 'Telomerase/immunology']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-006-0142-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2006 Dec;55(12):1480-90. doi: 10.1007/s00262-006-0142-x.

The most frequent base or type abnormalities of the PIG-A gene in AA and MDS patients were base substitutions or missense mutations, respectively, and deletions or frameshift mutations, respectively, in PNH patients. Several PIG-A mutations, most of which were statistically minor, were found in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-negative cells from all AA and MDS patients but not from all PNH patients. However, the common PIG-A mutations during the clinical course between CD59- granulocytes and/or CD48- monocytes from each AA or MDS patient, except for Case 5, were not found. PIG-A mutations were different between the granulocytes and monocytes from five AA and five MDS patients. Our results indicate that there were some characteristics of PIG-A mutations in AA and MDS patients compared with PNH patients and that several minor PNH clones in these patients occurred at random during the clinical course.

Although AML1 mutations are suspected to play a pivotal role in the development of MDS/AML, acquisition of additional genetic alterations is also necessary. We analyzed gene alterations in MDS/AML patients with AML1 mutations, comparing them to alterations in those without an AML1 mutation. AML1 mutations were significantly associated with -7/7q-, whereas MDS/AML patients without AML1 mutations showed a high frequency of -5/5q- and a complex karyotype. Patients with AML1 mutations showed more mutations of their FLT3, N-RAS, PTPN11, and NF1 genes, resulting in a significantly higher mutation frequency for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-RAS signaling pathways in AML1-mutated MDS/AML patients compared to AML1-wild-type MDS/AML patients (38% versus 6.3%, P < 0.0001). Conversely, p53 mutations were detected only in patients without AML1 mutations. Furthermore, blast cells of the AML1-mutated patients expressing surface c-KIT, and SHP-2 mutants contributed to prolonged and enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation following stem cell factor stimulation. Our results suggest that MDS/AML arising from AML1/RUNX1 mutations has a significant association with -7/7q- alteration, and frequently involves RTK-RAS signaling pathway activation.","['Niimi, H', 'Harada, H', 'Harada, Y', 'Ding, Y', 'Imagawa, J', 'Inaba, T', 'Kyo, T', 'Kimura, A']","['Niimi H', 'Harada H', 'Harada Y', 'Ding Y', 'Imagawa J', 'Inaba T', 'Kyo T', 'Kimura A']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', '*Genes, ras', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404136 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404136 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Apr;20(4):635-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404136.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report results of pyrosequencing to quantitate the non-mutated and mutant alleles in 12 CML patients monitored over periods ranging from 11 to 58 months, and describe three contrasting kinetic patterns: Group 1 - in four patients total BCR-ABL transcript numbers remained high with the mutant allele predominating; Group 2 - in four patients the total number of BCR-ABL transcripts fell to low levels but the mutant allele predominated; and Group 3 - in four other patients the total level of transcripts remained high (n = 2) or fell (n = 2) but the mutant clone persisted at relatively low level. In Group 2 the mutant leukemia clone was presumably still relatively sensitive to imatinib but in Group 1 the leukemia could be classified as resistant. In Group 3 patients the imatinib sensitivity of the leukemia was variable.

These cytokines play an essential role for the survival and maintenance of developing and postnatal somatic motoneurons. CNTF may also serve the maintenance of autonomic, preganglionic sympathetic neurons (PSNs) in the spinal cord, as suggested by its capacity to prevent their death after destruction of one of their major targets, the adrenal medulla. Although somatic motoneurons and PSNs share a common embryonic origin, they are distinct in several respects, including responses to lesions. We have studied PSNs in mice with targeted deletions of the LIFRbeta or CT-1 genes, respectively. We show that LIF, CNTF, and CT-1 are synthesized in embryonic adrenal gland and spinal cord and that PSNs express LIFRbeta. In embryonic day 18.5 LIFRbeta (-/-) and CT-1 (-/-) mice, PSNs were reduced by approximately 20%. PSNs projecting to the adrenal medulla were more severely affected (-55%). Although LIFRbeta (-/-) mice revealed normal numbers of adrenal chromaffin cells and axons terminating on chromaffin cells, levels of adrenaline and numbers of adrenaline-synthesizing cells were significantly reduced. We conclude that activation of LIFRbeta is required for normal development of PSNs and one of their prominent targets, the adrenal medulla. Thus, both somatic motoneurons and PSNs in the spinal cord depend on LIFRbeta signaling for their development and maintenance, although PSNs seem to be overall less affected than somatic motoneurons by LIFRbeta deprivation.","['Oberle, Stephan', 'Schober, Andreas', 'Meyer, Verena', 'Holtmann, Bettina', 'Henderson, Christopher', 'Sendtner, Michael', 'Unsicker, Klaus']","['Oberle S', 'Schober A', 'Meyer V', 'Holtmann B', 'Henderson C', 'Sendtner M', 'Unsicker K']","['Neuroanatomy and Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences, University of Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '139298-40-1 (KN 93)', '6LR8C1B66Q (Dizocilpine Maleate)', '78VO7F77PN (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['Actins/physiology', 'Adrenal Medulla/drug effects/innervation/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Benzylamines/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Dizocilpine Maleate/pharmacology', 'Hippocampus/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Nerve Fibers/drug effects/*physiology', 'Neurons/drug effects/*physiology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/embryology', 'Synapses/drug effects/physiology', 'Synaptic Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Synaptosomes/drug effects/physiology']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/6/1823 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4127-05.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2006 Feb 8;26(6):1823-32. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4127-05.2006.,,,,PMC6793615,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Parents and teachers of 150 long-term survivors completed the CPRS-R:S or CTRS-R:S as part of a screening battery. The data were submitted to a maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis to test the construct validity of the scales and the forms were compared. The CPRS-R:S was also compared to selected subscales of the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for further validation. RESULTS: The analyses demonstrated an adequate fit of the original three-factor structure of the CTRS-R:S [oppositional, cognitive problems/inattention, hyperactivity]. The analyses of the CPRS-R:S suggested a less adequate fit of the original three-factor structure but principal components factor analysis yielded a three-factor solution with factors similar to those of Conners' original factor structure.

Isobologram analysis confirmed the synergistic (13 of 25 patients) or additive (8 of 25 patients) nature of this interaction. Moreover, we demonstrated that the p53-related gene p73 is a molecular target of the combined treatment in AML blasts. Indeed, ATO modulates the expression of the p73 gene by inducing the proapoptotic and antiproliferative TAp73 and the antiapoptotic and proproliferative DeltaNp73 isoforms, thereby failing to elevate the TA/DeltaNp73 ratio. Conversely, treatment with PD184352 reduces the level of DeltaNp73 and blunts the arsenic-mediated up-regulation of DeltaNp73, thus causing an increase in the TA/DeltaNp73 ratio of dual-treated cells. High doses of ATO induced p53 accumulation in 11 of 21 patients. Combined treatment resulted in the induction of the proapoptotic p53/p73 target gene p53AIP1 (p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1) and greatly enhanced the apoptosis of treated cells.","['Lunghi, Paolo', 'Costanzo, Antonio', 'Salvatore, Luigi', 'Noguera, Nelida', 'Mazzera, Laura', 'Tabilio, Antonio', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Levrero, Massimo', 'Bonati, Antonio']","['Lunghi P', 'Costanzo A', 'Salvatore L', 'Noguera N', 'Mazzera L', 'Tabilio A', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Levrero M', 'Bonati A']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Section of Hemato-Oncology, University of Parma, Via Gramsci 14, 43100 Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (delta Np73 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/06/30 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)64594-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-07-2829 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jun 1;107(11):4549-53. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-07-2829.

Both events correlated only in the group of patients who had a good response and patients in continuous remission, suggesting that intact apoptosis signaling is a characteristic for favorable outcome. By combining both parameters, we identified a novel indicator, cytochrome c-related activation of caspase-3 (CRAC). CRAC directly connects the extent of caspase-3 activation to cytochrome c release in single cells in an individual patient sample. In CRAC-positive patients, indicating proficient apoptosis signaling, the number of persisting leukemia cells on day 15 was significantly lower than in the CRAC-negative patient group (n = 27, mean 6.0% versus n = 36, mean 22.6%; P = .003).

The resistance against apoptotic stimuli of these cells hints at a viral survival function in addition to a proliferation-stimulating activity. Here we describe the up-regulation of the antiapoptotic HIAP-1/CIAP-2 gene as a consistent phenotype of HTLV-1-transformed and ATL-derived cultures and its stimulation by the viral oncoprotein Tax. Cotransfections revealed a 60-fold increase of HIAP-1 promoter activity mediated by Tax mainly via nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. To address the relevance of virally increased HIAP-1 levels for the survival of HTLV-1-transformed cells, its expression was RNA interference (RNAi) suppressed using a lentiviral transduction system. This resulted in a dramatic reduction of cell growth, a strong induction of apoptosis rates, and increased caspases 3/7 activity, which is known to be suppressed by HIAP-1. Thus, the Tax-mediated HIAP-1 overexpression is required to suppress endogenous apoptosis and, therefore, is essential for the survival of HTLV-1-transformed lymphocytes. Moreover, this points to HIAP-1 as an important target of the HTLV-1-mediated NF-kappaB activation.","['Waldele, Katja', 'Silbermann, Katrin', 'Schneider, Grit', 'Ruckes, Tobias', 'Cullen, Bryan R', 'Grassmann, Ralph']","['Waldele K', 'Silbermann K', 'Schneider G', 'Ruckes T', 'Cullen BR', 'Grassmann R']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/*virology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/06/30 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)64587-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-3138 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jun 1;107(11):4491-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-3138.

The precursor cells ultimately derive from undifferentiated stem LCs (SLCs), which are postulated to be present in testes before the onset of precursor cell differentiation. We searched for cells in the neonatal rat testis with the abilities to: (i) proliferate and expand indefinitely in vitro (self renew); (ii) differentiate (i.e., 3betaHSD and ultimately synthesize testosterone); and (iii) when transplanted into host rat testes, colonize the interstitium and subsequently differentiate in vivo. At 1 week postpartum, spindle-shaped cells were seen in the testicular interstitium that differed from the precursor cells in that they were 3betaHSD-negative, luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor (LHR)-negative, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR alpha)-positive. These cells were purified from the testes of 1-week-old rats. The cells contained proteins known to be involved in LC development, including GATA4, c-kit receptor, and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor. The putative SLCs expanded over the course of 6 months while remaining undifferentiated. When treated in media that contained thyroid hormone, insulin-like growth factor I, and LH, 40% of the putative SLCs came to express 3betaHSD and to synthesize testosterone. When transplanted into host rat testes from which LCs had been eliminated, the putative SLCs colonized the interstitium and subsequently expressed 3betaHSD, demonstrating their ability to differentiate in vivo.

Herceptin, in combination with standard chemotherapy, such as taxol or etoposide, gives a synergistically apoptotic response in breast tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The mechanism underlying this synergy between chemotherapy and herceptin treatment is not well understood. Herein, we have determined that addition of herceptin, sensitized breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 to etoposide- or taxol-induced apoptosis. RESULTS: This treatment resulted in reduced expression of ErbB2 and the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Using antisense oligonucleotides against Mcl-1, MDA-MB-231 cells were rendered sensitive to etoposide-induced apoptosis similar to herceptin, but combined treatment of antisense against Mcl-1 and herceptin failed to give a significant increase in apoptosis. In 29 human breast tumors immunostained for ErbB2 and Mcl-1, we found that when ErbB2 was overexpressed, there was a corresponding increase in Mcl-1 expression. DISCUSSION: Using murine fibroblasts that express human ErbB2, but no other ErbB family member (NE2), these cells showed resistance to both taxol- and etoposide-induced apoptosis compared with parental cells. In addition, NE2 cells preferentially express the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 compared with parental cells, and treatment with herceptin reduces Mcl-1 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that herceptin sensitizes ErbB2-overexpressing cells to apoptosis by reducing antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein levels.","['Henson, Elizabeth S', 'Hu, Xiaojie', 'Gibson, Spencer B']","['Henson ES', 'Hu X', 'Gibson SB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Etoposide/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, erbB-2/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligoribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Trastuzumab', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/06/28 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/3/845 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0754 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Feb 1;12(3 Pt 1):845-53. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0754.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, it has been described that ZAP-70 contributes to the B-cell development at early stages of B-cell differentiation in mice. The purpose was to investigate the presence of ZAP-70 in normal pro/pre B cells and mature B cells and in tumoral cells from B-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ZAP-70 expression was ascertained by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Analysis of ZAP-70 and other signaling proteins of the pre-TCR/TCR was done by Western blot. RESULTS: ZAP-70 was expressed in pro/pre B cells but not in normal mature B cells derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or tonsil. Among tumoral cells, ZAP-70 was expressed in 56% of B-ALLs with pro/pre B-cell phenotype and in 4 of 6 Burkitt/ALL lymphomas. In B-ALL cells, expression of CD38 protein correlated with ZAP-70 expression (P = 0.05). Mutational analysis of the ZAP-70 gene revealed the absence of mutations in cases lacking ZAP-70 expression. Moreover, other elements of the pre-TCR/TCR signaling pathway, like LAT and Lck, were also found in B-ALL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Among normal B-cell subsets, ZAP-70 was found expressed in normal pro/pre B cells but not in a significant proportion of normal B cells with mature phenotype. Moreover, the presence of ZAP-70 in B-ALLs probably reflects their cellular origin. The lack of ZAP-70 expression in normal mature B cells suggests that its expression in mature-derived neoplasms with different cellular origin, such as Burkitt's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, might be due to an aberrant phenomenon.","['Crespo, Marta', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Gine, Eva', 'Muntanola, Ana', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Marafioti, Teresa', 'Jones, Margaret', 'Camos, Mireia', 'Campo, Elias', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Bosch, Francesc']","['Crespo M', 'Villamor N', 'Gine E', 'Muntanola A', 'Colomer D', 'Marafioti T', 'Jones M', 'Camos M', 'Campo E', 'Montserrat E', 'Bosch F']","[""Department of Hematology, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/06/28 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/3/726 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1531 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Feb 1;12(3 Pt 1):726-34. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1531.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The morphological changes were observed by Acridine orange (AO) staining. The screened results through DNA fragmentation and the Annexin V-FITC/PI staining assay showed that compound 8 blocked cell cycles at G(1) phase which led to apoptosis. The increase of caspase-3, 8, and 9 was detected, indicating that both of death-receptor and mitochondria-pathways were activated. Compound 8 induced a biphasic alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential of K562 cells. A dramatic elevation of Ca(2+) was also observed. In addition, a transient increase of ROS was also involved in the process. This study showed that compound 8 might be a potential chemopreventive agent for chronic myelogenous leukemia. It would guide our future work to synthesize more compounds derived from compound 8, which might have better effect, and to determine the target protein. Moreover, it might also provide a background mechanism for the introduction of this new type of promising therapeutic agent.","['Ding, Guoyu', 'Liu, Feng', 'Yang, Ting', 'Jiang, Yuyang', 'Fu, Hua', 'Zhao, Yufen']","['Ding G', 'Liu F', 'Yang T', 'Jiang Y', 'Fu H', 'Zhao Y']","['Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology, Guangdong Province, Graduate School of Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518057, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'N762921K75 (Nitrogen)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nitrogen/*chemistry', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/08/15 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2005/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(06)00084-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2006.01.050 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2006 Jun 1;14(11):3766-74. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2006.01.050.

Wong. 2004. Possible involvement of both endoplasmic reticulum- and mitochondria-dependent pathways in MoMuLV-ts1-induced apoptosis in astrocytes. J. NeuroVirol. 10, 189-198). In the present study, we show that caspase 8 activation in these cells is mediated through ER stress-associated elevation of death receptor DR5 and the C/EBP homologous protein (GADD153/CHOP), an ER stress-initiated transcription factor, rather than through TNFalpha and TNF-R1 interactions on the cell surface. Treatment with Z-IETD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase 8 enzymatic activity, reduced ER stress by two mechanisms: by inhibiting caspase 8 activation, and by preventing cleavage of the ER-associated membrane protein BAP31 into BAP20, which exacerbates the ER stress response. These findings suggest that caspase 8- and ER stress-associated apoptotic pathways are linked in ts1-infected astrocytes.","['Liu, Na', 'Scofield, Virginia L', 'Qiang, Wenan', 'Yan, Mingshan', 'Kuang, Xianghong', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Liu N', 'Scofield VL', 'Qiang W', 'Yan M', 'Kuang X', 'Wong PK']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park-Research Division, Smithville, 78957, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl', 'ketone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Mutation', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/deficiency/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/07/01 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2005/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(06)00005-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2006.01.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2006 May 10;348(2):398-405. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.01.002.

The neoplastic cell is an autoreactive CD5 CD23 B lymphocyte. B-CLL may involve the skin, typically in the context of known disease. We present a case of subclinical B-CLL presenting initially in the skin. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old male developed a lesion on his right cheek in April 2003 compatible with basal cell carcinoma. The re-excision specimen contained a well-differentiated atypical lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with B-CLL along with residual carcinoma. Subsequent laboratory studies revealed peripheral blood lymphocytosis with smudge cells. A diagnosis was made of Rai stage 0 CLL. Chromosomal studies on peripheral blood showed a deletion at 13q14.3. Excision of a second primary skin carcinoma revealed a squamous cell carcinoma in association with B-CLL that was identical to his previously diagnosed skin involvement. CONCLUSION: This case identifies a cutaneous presentation of subclinical B-CLL. There are two prior reports describing B-CLL presenting initially in the skin. In one case, the infiltrates were incidental on a re-excision specimen. The second report suggests 16% of B-CLL patients have cutaneous manifestations as the first sign of disease.","['Khandelwal, Abha', 'Seilstad, Kay H', 'Magro, Cynthia M']","['Khandelwal A', 'Seilstad KH', 'Magro CM']","['School of Medicine and Public Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/pathology/surgery', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Spectral Karyotyping']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/03/31 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['CUP430 [pii]', '10.1111/j.0303-6987.2006.00430.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2006 Mar;33(3):256-9. doi: 10.1111/j.0303-6987.2006.00430.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incident cases of AML <18 years of age, diagnosed between 1989 and 1993, and registered with the Children's Cancer Group (a paediatric clinical co-operative group), were eligible for inclusion. Control children were selected via random digit dialling and individually matched 1:1 to cases on age, race and residential location, except for rare morphological subtypes that were matched 1:2. Parental telephone interviews were conducted to determine exposure and covariate information. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate matched odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals [CI] adjusted for household income, parental education and parental age. The analysis included 517 cases and 610 matched controls. A series of sensitivity analyses examined the potential for recall bias. Ever lifetime use of marijuana by mothers was not associated with childhood AML [OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.66, 1.19]. Maternal marijuana use any time during the 3 months before, or during pregnancy was inversely associated with childhood AML [OR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.23, 0.80]. Paternal use during the same time period was not associated with risk. Assuming a large degree of differential exposure misclassification was present, the corrected ORs ranged between 0.82 and 1.40. The previously reported positive association between maternal marijuana use before or during pregnancy and childhood AML was not confirmed. The decreased ORs observed in this study may be due to recall bias assuming plausibly low values of sensitivity.","['Trivers, Katrina F', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Ross, Julie A', 'Steinbuch, Michael', 'Olshan, Andrew F', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Trivers KF', 'Mertens AC', 'Ross JA', 'Steinbuch M', 'Olshan AF', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7435, USA. trivers@unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Male', 'Marijuana Abuse/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', '*Parents', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/epidemiology', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/05/31 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['PPE700 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3016.2006.00700.x [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2006 Mar;20(2):110-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2006.00700.x.,"['PS0ES10126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA49450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA09330-21-25/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"[""Children's Cancer Group""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The syndrome is characterized by hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperuricemia. The standard of care for hyperuricemia consists of hydration with or without alkalinization and administration of allopurinol. When treated in this manner, patients often experience persistent hyperuricemia that lasts several days after the start of antineoplastic therapy; sometimes they develop uric acid nephropathy as a consequence. Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme, quickly removes large amounts of uric acid from plasma. The drug is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for management of elevated plasma uric acid levels in pediatric patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumor malignancies who are receiving chemotherapy. We undertook a retrospective review of adult patients treated with a single dose of rasburicase 6 mg for hyperuricemia associated with malignancy. Ten patients received one 6-mg dose of rasburicase, and one patient received two 6-mg doses as an adjuvant therapy to normalize uric acid levels. In most of the patients, a single 6-mg dose of rasburicase was effective in correcting uric acid levels in the typical time between diagnosis and start of antineoplastic therapy.","['Hutcherson, Donald A', 'Gammon, David C', 'Bhatt, Mansi S', 'Faneuf, Melissa']","['Hutcherson DA', 'Gammon DC', 'Bhatt MS', 'Faneuf M']","['Department of Pharmacy, Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperuricemia/chemically induced/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Urate Oxidase/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Uric Acid/blood']",2006/02/10 09:00,2006/06/15 09:00,['2006/02/10 09:00'],"['2006/02/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1592/phco.26.2.242 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2006 Feb;26(2):242-7. doi: 10.1592/phco.26.2.242.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients harboring leukemia commonly display suppressed cell mediated immunity, which may contribute to their inability to control the disease. Immune response against leukemia is evident in allogeneic HLA-mismatched bone marrow transplantation, implicating the involvement of NK cells. This graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity suggests that, if not suppressed, an autologous NK cell response could potentially control acute leukemia that had down-regulated HLA expression. In the current study we assessed the role of non-suppressed autologous NK cells in controlling a syngeneic highly malignant leukemia, the CRNK-16 line, that constitute a major cause of natural death in aged F344 rats. A minuscule dose of 60 CRNK-16 leukemia cells per rat was sufficient to induce 50% mortality rates, and animals that survived this challenge did not show improved survival upon a second challenge. The CRNK-16 line was found to exhibit low levels of MHC-I, and selective in vivo depletion of NK cells nullified in vitro NK activity against the CRNK-16 line and reduced survival rates from this leukemia. In vivo activation of NK cells, employing low doses of poly I-C or IL-12, increased in vitro NK activity against the leukemia and dramatically improved survival rates when treatment was initiated before, but not after leukemia inoculation. These results indicate the ability of competent autologous NK cells to restrict highly malignant non-immunogenic leukemia. Thereby, this model presents an opportunity to study specific in vivo NK-leukemia interactions.","['Avraham, Roi', 'Inbar, Shelly', 'Rosenne, Ella', 'Ben-Eliyahu, Shamgar']","['Avraham R', 'Inbar S', 'Rosenne E', 'Ben-Eliyahu S']","['Department of Psychology, Tel Aviv University, 69978 Tel Aviv, Israel. roia@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HLA Antigens/chemistry', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interleukin-12/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neutrophils', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Time Factors']",2006/02/09 09:00,2006/10/17 09:00,['2006/02/09 09:00'],"['2005/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-006-0139-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2006 Nov;55(11):1348-57. doi: 10.1007/s00262-006-0139-5.

Fifty percent methanol extract of MEC powder showed potent inhibitory activity against histamine release from basophils of patients suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis to ceder pollen. To examine this anti-allergic mechanism in detail, we next used rat basophlilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. MEC significantly inhibited IgE-induced histamine and beta-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells. Since MEC contains a variety of flavonoids, we selected nobiletin, hesperetin, and hesperidin (hesperetin glycoside) as representative compounds, and further evaluated these inhibitory activities. Among the flavonoids tested, hesperetin was the most potent, while hesperidin had far less, if any, inhibitory activity. The mechanism by which flavonoids inhibited the degranulation process was then examined. As a result, hesperetin and nobiletin suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt-1, direct downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). Thus, it was assumed that these flavonoids suppressed IgE-mediated stimulation of basophils through PI3-K pathway and that proper intake of Citrus unshiu would be favorable for managing seasonal allergic rhinitis to ceder pollen.","['Kobayashi, Shoko', 'Tanabe, Soichi']","['Kobayashi S', 'Tanabe S']","['Department of Food and Life-Science, Takasaki University of Health and Welfare, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Basophils/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', '*Citrus', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Preparations/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pollen/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal/*drug therapy/immunology', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2006/02/09 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2006/02/09 09:00'],"['2006/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2006 Mar;17(3):511-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To treat acute myeloid leukemia, calicheamicin has been conjugated to an antibody that recognizes CD33 (gemtuzumab ozogamicin). The application range of this 'active' targeting strategy is limited since it depends on specific antigen expression by tumor cells. This limitation could be reduced by using an antigen-independent 'passive targeting' strategy for calicheamicin. 'Passive targeting' relies on the dysfunctional vasculature of a neoplastic tumor that allows enhanced retention of macromolecules. We studied the efficacy of calicheamicin conjugated to various carrier molecules: i.e. immunoglobulin, albumin or PEGylated Fc fragments. In nude mice, a conjugate of anti-CD33 and calicheamicin accumulates in human tumor xenografts in the absence of detectable amounts of targeting antigen. Passive targeting provided sufficient accumulation of this conjugate to inhibit tumor growth of 10 different CD33-negative xenograft models. This efficacy depended on the use of an acid-labile linker between antibody and calicheamicin. Substitution of immunoglobulin as a carrier with either albumin or PEGylated Fc reduced or eliminated the efficacy of the conjugate. The results showed that using 'non-specific' immunoglobulin for passive targeting of calicheamicin might be an effective mode of cancer therapy.","['Boghaert, Erwin R', 'Khandke, Kiran', 'Sridharan, Latha', 'Armellino, Douglas', 'Dougher, Maureen', 'Dijoseph, John F', 'Kunz, Arthur', 'Hamann, Philip R', 'Sridharan, Ashwin', 'Jones, Stanley', 'Discafani, Carolyn', 'Damle, Nitin K']","['Boghaert ER', 'Khandke K', 'Sridharan L', 'Armellino D', 'Dougher M', 'Dijoseph JF', 'Kunz A', 'Hamann PR', 'Sridharan A', 'Jones S', 'Discafani C', 'Damle NK']","['Wyeth Research, Pearl River, NY 10965, USA. boghaee@wyeth.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry', 'Rituximab', 'Serum Albumin/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/*methods']",2006/02/09 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2006/02/09 09:00'],"['2006/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2006 Mar;28(3):675-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether this phenomenon results from altered expression of Bcl-2 or related proteins, Northern and Western analysis was employed to assess the effects of bryostatin 1 and other PKC activators on steady-state levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-x, and Mcl-1 mRNA and protein. Pretreatment of cells for 24 h with 10 nM bryostatin 1, or, to a lesser extent, the stage-1 tumor-promoter phorbol dibutyrate (PDB) significantly potentiated apoptosis induced by ara-C (100 microM; 6 h); in contrast, equivalent exposure to the stage-2 tumor promoter, mezerein (MZN), which, unlike bryostatin 1, is a potent inducer of differentiation in this cell line, failed to modify ara-C-related cell death. Neither bryostatin 1 nor PDB altered expression of bcl-2/Bcl-2 over this time frame. In contrast, MZN down-regulated bcl-2 mRNA levels, but this effect was not accompanied by altered expression of Bcl-2 protein. None of the PKC activators modified expression of Bax or Bcl-x(L) mRNA or protein; levels of Bcl-x(S) were undetectable in both treated and untreated cells. However, expression of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein increased modestly after treatment with either bryostatin 1 or PDB, and to a greater extent following exposure to MZN. Combined treatment of cells with bryostatin 1 and MZN resulted in undiminished potentiation of ara-C-mediated apoptosis and by antagonism of cellular maturation. These effects were accompanied by unaltered expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-x(L), and by a further increase in Mcl-1 protein levels. When cells were co-incubated with bryostatin 1 and calcium ionophore (A23187), an identical pattern of expression of Bcl-2 family members was observed, despite the loss of bryostatin 1's capacity to potentiate apoptosis, and the restoration of its ability to induce differentiation. Finally, treatment of cells with bryostatin 1+/-ara-C (but not ara-C alone) resulted in a diffuse broadening of the Bcl-2 protein band, whereas exposure of cells to taxol (250 nM, 6 h) led to the appearance of a distinct Bcl-2 species with reduced mobility, phenomena compatible with protein phosphorylation. Together, these findings indicate that the ability of bryostatin 1 to facilitate drug-induced apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cells involves factors other than quantitative changes in the expression of Bcl-2 family members, and raise the possibility that qualitative alterations in the Bcl-2 protein, such as phosphorylation status, may contribute to this capacity. They also suggest that increased expression of Mcl-1 occurs early in the pre-commitment stage of myeloid cell differentiation, and that this event does not protect cells from drug-induced apoptosis.","['Bartimole, T M', 'Vrana, J A', 'Freemerman, A J', 'Jarvis, W D', 'Reed, J C', 'Boise, L H', 'Grant, S']","['Bartimole TM', 'Vrana JA', 'Freemerman AJ', 'Jarvis WD', 'Reed JC', 'Boise LH', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,,,,1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/07/30 00:00 [received]', '1999/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '1999/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['4400242 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4400242 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1997 May;4(4):294-303. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400242.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that rRNA and DNA cleavages can occur independently in apoptotic cells, i.e. that the previously observed correlation is likely to be coincidental. In HL-60 cells, apoptosis with massive DNA fragmentation could be induced without any signs of rRNA cleavage. The opposite situation; rRNA cleavage without concomitant internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, was found in okadaic acid-treated Molt-4 cells. Other leukemia cell lines underwent apoptosis either without (K562 and Molt-3) or with (U937) both forms of polynucleotide cleavage. In K562 cells transfected with a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation but not 28S rRNA cleavage was inducible by wild-type p53 expression. The absence of apoptotic rRNA cleavage in some cell types suggests that this phenomenon is tightly regulated and unrelated to DNA fragmentation or a presumed scheme for general macromolecular degradation in apoptotic cells.","['Samali, A', 'Gilje, B', 'Doskeland, S O', 'Cotter, T G', 'Houge, G']","['Samali A', 'Gilje B', 'Doskeland SO', 'Cotter TG', 'Houge G']","['Department of Biochemistry, University College Cork, Lee Maltings, Prospect Row, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,,,,1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1999/09/13 00:00 [received]', '1999/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '1999/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['4400246 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cdd.4400246 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1997 May;4(4):289-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400246.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency rate of visceral mycoses with leukemia and MDS was 27.9% (435/1,557) in 1989, 23.0% (319/1,388) in 1993, 22.3% (246/1,105) in 1997 and 25.1% (260/ 1,037) in 2001, which was clearly higher than the rate of cases without leukemia and MDS: 3.4%, 2.7%, 3.5% and 3.7%, respectively. Furthermore, in comparing the rate of mycoses in recipients of stem cell transplantation with that of non-recipients, that of recipients was about 10% higher. The predominant causative agents were Candida and Aspergillus, at approximately the same rate (Candida 33.6%, Aspergillus 33.3%) as in 1989. However, Aspergillus increased conspicuously in 1993 (Candida 22.3% Aspergillus 44.5%), and continued to increase (Candida 22.8%, Aspergillus 50.8% in 1997; Candida 16.9%, Aspergillus 54.2% in 2001). In aspergillosis and zygomycosis, the lung and bronchi comprised the most commonly infected organs: 74.7% and 75.6% of the total cases, respectively. Among a total of 1,260 cases with mycotic infections in the four years studied, acute lymphatic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia were the major diseases (35.5% and 33.5%, respectively) followed by MDS (29.0%). Given these facts, we emphasize that a greater interest in mycoses should be taken by clinicians, and immunocompromised patients should be protected from opportunistic invasive fungal infections, especially aspergillosis.","['Kume, Hikaru', 'Yamazaki, Toshikazu', 'Abe, Michiko', 'Tanuma, Hiroyuki', 'Okudaira, Masahiko', 'Okayasu, Isao']","['Kume H', 'Yamazaki T', 'Abe M', 'Tanuma H', 'Okudaira M', 'Okayasu I']","['Dept. of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kitasato University, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Ishinkin Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Ishinkin Gakkai zasshi = Japanese journal of medical mycology,9425640,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aspergillosis/epidemiology', 'Candidiasis/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*complications/pathology/therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/pathology/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Virus Diseases/epidemiology']",2006/02/09 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2006/02/09 09:00'],"['2006/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3314/jjmm.47.15 [doi]'],ppublish,Nihon Ishinkin Gakkai Zasshi. 2006;47(1):15-24. doi: 10.3314/jjmm.47.15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of a greater study, acquired and congenital prothrombotic risk factors were investigated in children with leukaemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and compared with similar investigations in children with congenital heart defects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples were taken from 60 children with newly diagnosed leukaemia or lymphoma and 133 children with congenital heart defects in the course of a scheduled cardiac catheterization. When children with cancer were in remission, analyses of acquired prothrombotic risk factors were repeated. Children with cancer were observed for symptoms of thromboembolism throughout their treatment period. RESULTS: Total homocysteine levels were significantly raised in children with cancer (median value 10.0 micromol/L) as compared with the levels in children with congenital heart diseases (5.0 micromol/L) (p<0.001), while children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia had the highest values. The median level of lipoprotein(a) was slightly increased in children with newly diagnosed leukaemia or lymphoma (105 mg/L versus 100 mg/L, p<0.001), and levels of coagulation inhibitors were higher (p<0.001). Total homocysteine levels normalized when children attained remission of cancer disease. Two children had symptoms of acute thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Raised concentrations of total homocysteine were frequent in children with newly diagnosed cancer, but this normalized when the children were in remission.

In this study, we used TAL1xLMO1 leukemia cells adoptively transferred in mice, to generate murine leukemia with poorly immunogenic cells as a model for human T-ALL. Subsequently, these animals were treated with several different immunotherapeutic protocols. We compared the efficiency of a classical, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy (injection of dendritic cells loaded with tumor-derived antigenic products), to a combined treatment associating injection of antigen-loaded dendritic cells and disruption of the two immunoregulatory pathways: CD25+ suppressive T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigens (CTLA-4). We show that this combined treatment resulted in cure, concomitantly with in vivo generation of immune memory, and TNF-alpha secretion. This study demonstrates that the disruption of these two immunoregulatory pathways synergized with immunostimulation by dendritic cells loaded with tumor-derived antigens, and paves the way for the testing of this combination in clinical trials.","['Fiorentino, S', 'Chopin, M', 'Dastot, H', 'Boissel, N', 'Reboul, M', 'Legres, L', 'Janin, A', 'Aplan, P', 'Sigaux, F', 'Regnault, Armelle']","['Fiorentino S', 'Chopin M', 'Dastot H', 'Boissel N', 'Reboul M', 'Legres L', 'Janin A', 'Aplan P', 'Sigaux F', 'Regnault A']","[""Unite U728 INSERM-Laboratoire de Pathologie Universite Paris VII, Hopital Saint-Louis--Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, 1 avenue Claude-Vellefaux, 75475 Paris Cedex 10, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Ctla4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/administration & dosage', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Immunologic Memory', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2006/02/09 09:00,2009/02/14 09:00,['2006/02/09 09:00'],"['2006/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 2005 Dec;16(4):300-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a significant association was reported with CC genotype of GNbeta3. AIM: To explore the association of candidate genotypes altering adrenergic, serotonergic, CCKergic, and G protein functions, and dyspepsia in a sample from a U.S. community. METHODS: Dyspeptics and healthy controls were identified among community respondents who had been randomly selected to complete validated questionnaires. Other diseases were excluded by face-to-face history and physical examination. Polymorphisms of candidate genes for alpha(2A), alpha(2C), 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2C), CCK-1 receptors and CCK promoter, GNbeta3 protein, and SERT-promoter (SERT-P) were studied. The association between polymorphisms and meal-related or meal-unrelated dyspepsia, high somatic symptom scores, and somatization were evaluated using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: DNA was available from 41 dyspeptics and 47 healthy controls from Olmsted County. Community dyspepsia unrelated to meals was associated with both homozygous GNbeta3 protein 825T and C alleles. There were no significant associations with meal-related dyspepsia. Using Rome II subgroups, the same genotype was associated with dysmotility-like and other dyspepsia. Higher somatization scores were not significantly associated with any of the candidate genes when considered as single factors. CONCLUSION: Meal-unrelated dyspepsia in a U.S. community study is associated with the homozygous 825T or C alleles of GNbeta3 protein. Candidate genes controlling adrenergic, serotonergic, and CCKergic functions do not appear to be associated with dyspepsia.","['Camilleri, Christopher E', 'Carlson, Paula J', 'Camilleri, Michael', 'Castillo, Emma J', 'Locke, G Richard 3rd', 'Geno, Debra M', 'Stephens, Debra A', 'Zinsmeister, Alan R', 'Urrutia, Raul']","['Camilleri CE', 'Carlson PJ', 'Camilleri M', 'Castillo EJ', 'Locke GR 3rd', 'Geno DM', 'Stephens DA', 'Zinsmeister AR', 'Urrutia R']","['Gastroenterology Research Unit, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Gastroenterol,The American journal of gastroenterology,0421030,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CCL28 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (GTP-Binding Protein beta Subunits)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Serotonin)', '0 (SLC6A4 protein, human)', '0 (Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Chemokines/*genetics', 'Chemokines, CC', 'Dyspepsia/ethnology/*genetics', 'Ethnicity/genetics', 'Female', 'GTP-Binding Protein beta Subunits/genetics', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetics, Population', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'Postprandial Period', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Serotonin/*genetics', 'Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2006/02/09 09:00,2006/04/11 09:00,['2006/02/09 09:00'],"['2006/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['AJG481 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00481.x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Gastroenterol. 2006 Mar;101(3):581-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00481.x.

Low density lipoprotein (LDL) was prepared by density gradient ultracentrifugation and oxidized by incubation with CuCl2. The human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was cultured in RPMI1640. The differentiation of THP-1 cells into macrophages (MPs) was induced by using myristate acetate (PMA) for 48 h. The macrophages were then incubated with oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) to generate foam cells (FCs). The mRNA and protein expression levels of human TLR-4 were detected by immunocytochemistry, Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that the TLR-4 mRNA and the protein expression levels were significantly increased during the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages (P < 0.05) as well as during the formation of lipid-laden foam cells (P < 0.05). It was concluded that the upregulation of human TLR-4 gene expression during the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and the differentiation of macrophages into foam cells could increase TLR-4 protein synthesis dramatically, which may enhance the ability of foam cells inflammation reaction in atherosclerosis.","['Cheng, Bei', 'Yu, Qizhen', 'Bai, Zhifeng', 'Ke, Li', 'He, Ping']","['Cheng B', 'Yu Q', 'Bai Z', 'Ke L', 'He P']","['Department of Gerontology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently proposed a new classification system that has not been validated clinically. The authors investigated the significance of the WHO classification system and compared it with the classification systems used to date in imatinib trials (""standard definition"") to determine its impact in establishing the outcome of patients after therapy with imatinib. METHODS: In total, 809 patients who received imatinib for CML were classified into chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP), and blast phase (BP) based on standard definitions and then were reclassified according to the new WHO classification system. Their outcomes with imatinib therapy were compared, and the value of individual components of these classification systems was determined. RESULTS: With the WHO classification, 78 patients (10%) were reclassified: 45 patients (6%) were reclassified from CP to AP, 14 patients (2%) were reclassified from AP to CP, and 19 patients (2%) were reclassified from AP to BP. The rates of complete cytogenetic response for patients in CP, AP, and BP according to the standard definition were 72%, 45%, and 8%, respectively. After these patients were reclassified according to WHO criteria, the response rates were 77% (P = 0.07), 39% (P = 0.28), and 11% (P = 0.61), respectively. The 3-year survival rates were 91%, 65%, and 10%, respectively, according to the standard classification and 95% (P = 0.05), 63% (P = 0.76), and 16% (P = 0.18), respectively, according to the WHO classification. Patients who had a blast percentage of 20-29%, which is considered CML-BP according to the WHO classification, had a significantly better response rate (21% vs. 8%; P = 0.11) and 3-year survival rate (42% vs. 10%; P = 0.0001) compared with patients who had blasts > or = 30%. CONCLUSIONS: Different classification systems had an impact on the outcome of patients, and some prognostic features had different prognostic implications in the imatinib era. The authors believe that a new, uniform staging system for CML is warranted, and they propose such a system.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Talpaz, Moshe', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Rios, Mary B', 'Shan, Jenny', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Cortes JE', 'Talpaz M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Verstovsek S', 'Rios MB', 'Shan J', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

It is therefore particularly unsuited to older individuals, who are most at risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Reduced-intensity SCT (RISCT) may be of value in this group. We report 17 consecutive patients with high-risk AML whose median age was 58 years and who received stem cells from HLA-matched siblings (n=5), or alternative donors (n=12). We used lymphodepleting antibodies as a part of the reduced-intensity conditioning regimen to limit the risk of graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). All patients engrafted. One patient developed severe fatal GVHD, and two patients died of infection. At a median follow-up of 861 days (372-1957 days), seven patients are alive in remission, which includes two patients treated in relapse and five patients who lacked an MHC identical sibling donor. Both progression-free survival and overall survival are 40% (95% CI, 17-64%).

Pluripotency is lost during embryogenesis as cells commit to specific developmental pathways. Although restriction of developmental potential is often associated with repression of inappropriate genetic programmes, the role of epigenetic silencing during early lineage commitment remains undefined. Here, we used mouse embryonic stem cells to study the function of epigenetic silencing in pluripotent cells. Embryonic stem cells lacking Mbd3 - a component of the nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex - were viable but failed to completely silence genes that are expressed before implantation of the embryo. Mbd3-deficient embryonic stem cells could be maintained in the absence of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and could initiate differentiation in embryoid bodies or chimeric embryos, but failed to commit to developmental lineages.

The authors studied 15 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma who were treated using protocols that included high-dose methotrexate (3.0 g/m), for an overall total of 43 courses. Methotrexate-induced toxicities and the plasma methotrexate concentrations were evaluated retrospectively. Hematologic toxicity was the most frequently observed toxicity, appearing in 87% of the patients. In a subset of patients (47%), elevation of liver transaminase levels showed a repeated tendency to develop. High plasma methotrexate concentrations at 48 hours after the methotrexate infusion were not significantly related to methotrexate-induced toxicities except for mucositis. A generalized estimating equation analysis revealed that vomiting during the high-dose methotrexate treatment was more pronounced in patients who had a larger number of G alleles at the RFC1 80G>A polymorphism.

This review will focus on recent clinical trials for adjuvant chemotherapy, and will help to interpret the applicability of these results to daily clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Four large-scale randomized trials that used platinum-based chemotherapy have reported positive results during the last 3 years. These trials included cisplatin-based chemotherapy [the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer (IALT) trial], cisplatin plus vinorelbine [the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) BR10 trial], and carboplatin plus paclitaxel [the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9633 trial]. More recently, another adjuvant trial [Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association (ANITA)] was reported, which has added greatly to our understanding of the potential role of adjuvant treatment. Regarding adjuvant UFT (tegafur and uracil) chemotherapy, an individual patient data-based meta-analysis demonstrated its significant effect on survival in selected patients with completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer. SUMMARY: Recent trials indicate a survival benefit of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. These findings are anticipated to change the clinical management of patients with completely resectable non-small-cell lung cancer.","['Hotta, Katsuyuki', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Kiura, Katsuyuki', 'Ueoka, Hiroshi', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune']","['Hotta K', 'Matsuo K', 'Kiura K', 'Ueoka H', 'Tanimoto M']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Okayama University Hospital, Japan. khotta@md.okayama-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/trends', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', '*Postoperative Care/trends', '*Pulmonary Surgical Procedures', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cco.0000208787.91947.a2 [doi]', '00001622-200603000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2006 Mar;18(2):144-50. doi: 10.1097/01.cco.0000208787.91947.a2.,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the renewed interest in its pathophysiology and treatment, this review discusses recent clinical and laboratory advances in this disease. Advances in pathophysiology, the relationship between chronic graft-versus-host disease and relapse incidence, and recent developments in the prophylaxis, initial therapy, and therapy for refractory disease are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: A better understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic graft-versus-host disease, including the potential role of a coordinated B-cell and T-cell response, is demonstrated. Corticosteroids and cyclosporine or tacrolimus remain the standard as initial therapy. This combination is effective in the majority of affected patients, although therapy is often required for longer than 1 year. Although no strategy has been demonstrated to be effective in specifically preventing chronic graft-versus-host disease, several drugs have recently been demonstrated to be effective therapeutic agents for steroid-refractory disease. Agents such as mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, and rituximab have demonstrated response rates of greater than 60% in patients with steroid-refractory disease. SUMMARY: Renewed interest and understanding of chronic graft-versus-host disease have led to novel treatment strategies for steroid-refractory disease.

Extensive data are available on the use of donor leukocyte infusion after matched-sibling stem cell transplantation, but reports are remarkably few on the use of donor leukocyte infusion after unrelated-donor stem cell transplantation. But the role for unrelated-donor leukocyte infusion is not well established. RECENT FINDINGS: The dramatic success of donor leukocyte infusion to treat relapse after matched-sibling stem cell transplantation has led to the use of unrelated-donor leukocyte infusion in many patients. Several case studies suggest that unrelated-donor leukocyte infusion effectively induces direct graft-versus-tumor reactions with toxicity comparable to that of matched-sibling donor leukocyte infusion. Important issues include the relationship between dose and response/toxicity appropriate timing, dose, and schedule; and identification of the best tumor targets. In particular nonmyeloablative transplant strategies using unrelated donors are expanding rapidly, but relapse rates are high. There is a paucity of data on unrelated-donor leukocyte infusion in this setting. SUMMARY: This review summarizes recent data on the use of unrelated-donor leukocyte infusion. We discuss anticipated outcomes and identify areas under active investigation in both ablative and nonmyeloablative unrelated-donor stem cell transplantation.","['Loren, Alison W', 'Porter, David L']","['Loren AW', 'Porter DL']","['Stem Cell Transplant Program and Hematology-Oncology Division, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', '*Living Donors', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/09/29 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cco.0000208781.61452.d3 [doi]', '00001622-200603000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2006 Mar;18(2):107-14. doi: 10.1097/01.cco.0000208781.61452.d3.,,63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with a combination of dexamethasone (10 nM) and aminophylline (1 microM) significantly increased the number of apoptotic HL-60 cells, but not that of Jurkat cells, compared with dexamethasone (10 nM) or aminophylline (1 microM) treatment alone. Dexamethasone and aminophylline also increased the number of phospho-histone H2B (Ser(14))-positive Jurkat and HL-60 cells. Phospho-histone H2B (pH2B)-positive HL-60 cells were significantly increased by treatment with a combination of dexamethasone (10 nM) and aminophylline (1 microM), although no such effect was observed in Jurkat cells. On the other hand, simultaneous treatment with 10 nM dexamethasone and 1 muM aminophylline activated the 36-kDa MBP kinase, pro-apoptotic protein kinase in HL-60 cells. The activation of 36-kDa MBP kinase by dexamethasone and aminophylline was supported by studies showing an increase in the number of pH2B-positive and apoptotic Jurkat and HL-60 cells upon exposure to these drugs. Thus treatment with a combination of dexamethasone and aminophylline accelerates apoptosis of HL-60 cells via activation of 36-kDa MBP kinase and H2B phosphorylation.","['Kizawa, Yasuo', 'Furuya, Minori', 'Saito, Kiyoshige', 'Masuko, Takashi', 'Kusama, Tadashi']","['Kizawa Y', 'Furuya M', 'Saito K', 'Masuko T', 'Kusama T']","['Department of Physiology and Anatomy, Nihon University College of Pharmacy, Funabashi, Chiba 275-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '27Y3KJK423 (Aminophylline)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (STK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aminophylline/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/29.281 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.29.281 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2006 Feb;29(2):281-5. doi: 10.1248/bpb.29.281.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T4gp32 doubled the yield of in vitro transcripts obtained with T7 RNA polymerase and increased the yield of cDNA synthesis when used in combination with an RNaseH-deficient Moloney murine leukemia virus [Au: ok] reverse transcriptase. The positive effect could be correlated with the RNA chaperone activity of T4gp32. T4gp32 stimulated the synthesis of long cDNAs, particularly species longer than 7 kb. By comparison, thermal activation of reverse transcriptase with trehalose only boosted the production of shorter cDNAs. For the construction of an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library, where the average cDNA size is 1.2 kbp, both the presence of T4gp32 under standard reaction conditions as well as thermal activation resulted in similarly high percentages of full-length cDNA.

Patients with this leukemia can be divided into prognostic categories using clinical staging parameters, as well as molecular features [presence or absence of IgVH mutations in rearranged VHDJH segments that code for the leukemic B cell's receptor for antigen (BCR)]. In addition, the deduced amino acid structure of the BCRs from patients that fall into different prognostic categories is shared, to varying degrees, within these groups. In this paper, the molecular features of the genes that code for the BCRs of B-CLL patients are reviewed, and these are compared to antibodies of known specificity. These comparisons suggest that the BCRs of many cases resemble autoantibodies, and in some cases, antibodies to microbial antigens. Antigen-binding analyses confirm these impressions, and also indicate that polyreactivity appears to distinguish cases with worse clinical outcomes differ from those with better outcomes. The persistence of autoreactivity and polyreactivity is somewhat surprising, because IgV DNA sequence analyses suggest that many of the B cells that become leukemic have undergone one form or another of receptor editing. Thus, B-CLL appears to be a disease of B-cell clones that have undergone various types of receptor reconfiguration and yet retain inappropriate antigen-binding properties.","['Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Hatzi, Katerina', 'Albesiano, Emilia']","['Chiorazzi N', 'Hatzi K', 'Albesiano E']","['Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-LIJ Health System, 350 Community Drive, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA. nchizzi@nshs.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Autoantigens/immunology/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/07/01 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1062/1/1 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1358.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2005 Dec;1062:1-12. doi: 10.1196/annals.1358.002.,"['M01 RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 81554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 87956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the efficiency of bcr-abl+ DC vaccines will critically depend on the absence of deleterious effects of bcr-abl and of imatinib on DC functions. We show that bcr-abl+ monocytes, devoid of contamination of CD14low granulocytic precursors, differentiate into DC with typical immunophenotypical and functional features, and bcr-abl transcription decreases simultaneously. During differentiation, imatinib induces a slight increase of DC apoptosis and prevents CD1a up-regulation in a dose-dependent manner in bcr-abl+ and normal monocyte-derived DC, but at most, 25% of DC fail to acquire CD1a. When DC maturation is induced in the presence of imatinib, bcr-abl+ and normal monocyte-derived DC up-regulate major histocompatibility complex and costimulatory molecules, CC chemokine receptor 7 and CD83. However, secretion of interleukin-12p70 is decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Imatinib exposure of bcr-abl+ and normal monocyte-derived DC during differentiation and maturation is not detrimental to T cell immunostimulatory functions of DC. In sharp contrast, imatinib, when added to DC-T cell cultures, profoundly suppresses DC-mediated T cell proliferation, despite reciprocal DC-T cell activation attested by up-regulation of CD25 on T cells and of CD86 on DC. Our findings demonstrate that T cells, not normal or bcr-abl+ monocyte-derived DC, are major targets for imatinib immunomodulatory effects. It can be envisioned already that imatinib-free windows will be required to enable vaccination-induced, leukemia-specific T cell expansion.","['Boissel, Nicolas', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Soulier, Jean', 'Mooney, Nuala', 'Charron, Dominique', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Toubert, Antoine', 'Rea, Delphine']","['Boissel N', 'Rousselot P', 'Raffoux E', 'Cayuela JM', 'Soulier J', 'Mooney N', 'Charron D', 'Dombret H', 'Toubert A', 'Rea D']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Histocompatibilite, INSERM U662, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunologic Tests', 'Interleukin-12/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Time Factors']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/07/29 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0705419 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0705419 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2006 Apr;79(4):747-56. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0705419.

In chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), basophilia is a diagnostic and prognostic determinant. So far, however, no reliable approach for routine detection and enumeration of bone marrow basophils has become available. OBJECTIVE: To detect and enumerate basophils in bone marrow sections in patients with CML and other MPD. METHODS: The anti-basophil antibody 2D7 was applied to paraffin embedded bone marrow sections from normal/reactive subjects (n = 31), patients with CML (chronic phase, n = 37; accelerated phase, n = 9), and other MPD (chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF), n = 20; polycythaemia vera (PV), n = 20; essential thrombocythaemia (ET), n = 20; indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM), n = 7). RESULTS: As assessed by serial section staining, 2D7(+) cells were found to co-express myeloperoxidase, histidine decarboxylase, CD9, and CD43, but did not express B cell or T cell restricted antigens. 2D7(+) bone marrow cells were found to increase in CML compared with normal/reactive bone marrow and other MPD (median numbers of 2D7(+) cells/mm(2): CML, 33; normal/reactive bone marrow, 6; CIMF, 10; PV, 6; ET, 5; ISM, 3; p<0.05).

Noonan syndrome is characterized by proportionate short stature, facial dysmorphia, increased risk of leukemia, and congenital heart defects in approximately 50% of cases. Congenital heart abnormalities are common in Noonan syndrome, but the signaling pathway(s) linking gain-of-function SHP-2 mutants to heart disease is unclear. Diverse cell types coordinate cardiac morphogenesis, which is regulated by calcium (Ca2+) and the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). It has been shown that the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations regulates NFAT activity. Here, we show that in fibroblasts, Ca2+ oscillations in response to FGF-2 require the phosphatase activity of SHP-2. Conversely, gain-of-function mutants of SHP-2 enhanced FGF-2-mediated Ca2+ oscillations in fibroblasts and spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in cardiomyocytes. The enhanced frequency of cardiomyocyte Ca2+ oscillations induced by a gain-of-function SHP-2 mutant correlated with reduced nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NFAT. These data imply that gain-of-function SHP-2 mutants disrupt the Ca2+ oscillatory control of NFAT, suggesting a potential mechanism for congenital heart defects in Noonan syndrome.","['Uhlen, Per', 'Burch, Peter M', 'Zito, Christina Ivins', 'Estrada, Manuel', 'Ehrlich, Barbara E', 'Bennett, Anton M']","['Uhlen P', 'Burch PM', 'Zito CI', 'Estrada M', 'Ehrlich BE', 'Bennett AM']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA. per.uhlen@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', '*Calcium Signaling/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Heart Valve Diseases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Noonan Syndrome/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/04/08 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['0510876103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0510876103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Feb 14;103(7):2160-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0510876103.

We have identified a novel guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) named CRAG that contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence and forms nuclear inclusions in response to stress. After ultraviolet irradiation, CRAG interacted with and induced an enlarged ring-like structure of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) body in a GTPase-dependent manner. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by polyQ accumulation triggered the association of CRAG with polyQ and the nuclear translocation of the CRAG-polyQ complex. Furthermore, CRAG promoted the degradation of polyQ at PML/CRAG bodies through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. CRAG knockdown by small interfering RNA in neuronal cells consistently blocked the nuclear translocation of polyQ and enhanced polyQ-mediated cell death. We propose that CRAG is a modulator of PML function and dynamics in ROS signaling and is protectively involved in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine diseases.","['Qin, Qingyu', 'Inatome, Ryoko', 'Hotta, Azusa', 'Kojima, Masaki', 'Yamamura, Hirohei', 'Hirai, Hirokazu', 'Yoshizawa, Toshihiro', 'Tanaka, Hirofumi', 'Fukami, Kiyoko', 'Yanagi, Shigeru']","['Qin Q', 'Inatome R', 'Hotta A', 'Kojima M', 'Yamamura H', 'Hirai H', 'Yoshizawa T', 'Tanaka H', 'Fukami K', 'Yanagi S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biochemistry and 6Laboratory of Genome and Biosignal, School of Life Science, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Autophagy-Related Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '26700-71-0 (polyglutamine)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ATG3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Rats', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcb.200505079 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200505079 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2006 Feb 13;172(4):497-504. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200505079.

Measuring uptake at 25 s, when fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) does not appreciably affect uptake, AEA accumulated via a nonsaturable mechanism at 37 degrees C. Interestingly, saturation was observed when uptake was plotted using unbound AEA at 37 degrees C. Such apparent saturation can be explained by rate-limited delivery of AEA through an unstirred water layer surrounding the cells (1). In support of this, we observed kinetics consistent with rate-limited diffusion at 0 degrees C. Novel transport inhibitors have been synthesized that are either weak FAAH inhibitors or do not inhibit FAAH in vitro (e.g. UCM707, OMDM2, and AM1172). In the current study, none of these purported AEA transporter inhibitors affected uptake at 25 s. Longer incubation times illuminate downstream events that drive AEA uptake. Unlike the situation at 25 s, the efficacy of these inhibitors was unmasked at 5 min with appreciable inhibition of AEA accumulation correlating with partial inhibition of AEA hydrolysis. The uptake and hydrolysis profiles observed with UCM707, VDM11, OMDM2, and AM1172 mirrored two selective and potent FAAH inhibitors CAY10400 and URB597 (at low concentrations), indicating that weak inhibition of FAAH can have a pronounced effect upon AEA uptake. At 5 min, the putative transport inhibitors did not reduce AEA uptake in FAAH chemical knock-out cells. This strongly suggests that the target of UCM707, VDM11, OMDM2, and AM1172 is not a transporter at the plasma membrane but rather FAAH, or an uncharacterized intracellular component that delivers AEA to FAAH. This system is therefore unique among neuro/immune modulators because AEA, an uncharged hydrophobic molecule, diffuses into cells and partial inhibition of FAAH has a pronounced effect upon its uptake.","['Kaczocha, Martin', 'Hermann, Anita', 'Glaser, Sherrye T', 'Bojesen, Inge N', 'Deutsch, Dale G']","['Kaczocha M', 'Hermann A', 'Glaser ST', 'Bojesen IN', 'Deutsch DG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York 11794-5215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*pharmacokinetics', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Membrane', 'Diffusion', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/05/31 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)56436-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M509721200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Apr 7;281(14):9066-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M509721200.

DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy-one patients were transplanted after 1997. Their median age was 29 years (15-55), and the median follow-up time was 18 months (1-71). Most patients had acute or chronic leukemia (n=142, 83%), 91 (53%) were transplanted in advanced phase and an autologous transplant had failed in 32 (19%). Most patients (87%) received an HLA-mismatched cord blood unit with 1-2 HLA disparities. At infusion, the median number of nucleated cells and CD34(+) cells was 2.1x10(7)/kg and 1x10(5)/kg, respectively RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 60 was 72+/-3% with a median of 28 days (11-57). A higher neutrophil count and use of hematopoietic growth factors were independently associated with faster neutrophil recovery. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 32+/-4% and this complication was not associated with the number of HLA mismatches. The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease, transplant related-mortality and relapse were 36+/-10%, 51+/-4% and 22+/-4%, respectively. At 2-years, disease-free-survival for patients transplanted in early, intermediate and advanced phases of disease was 41+/-9%, 34+/-10% and 18+/-4%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, advanced disease status was an adverse factor for relapse and disease-free survival. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Unrelated CBT is a clear alternative for adults with hematological malignancies lacking an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor. The choice of units containing a higher neutrophil count and a policy of earlier transplantation are likely to provide better results.","['Arcese, William', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Iori, Anna Paola', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Sirvent, Anne', 'Busca, Alessandro', 'Asano, Shigheta', 'Ionescu, Irina', 'Wernet, Peter', 'Gluckman, Eliane']","['Arcese W', 'Rocha V', 'Labopin M', 'Sanz G', 'Iori AP', 'de Lima M', 'Sirvent A', 'Busca A', 'Asano S', 'Ionescu I', 'Wernet P', 'Gluckman E']",['Eurocord-Netcord.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Feb;91(2):223-30.,,,,,,['Eurocord-Netcord Transplant group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the ultimate goal of therapy for CML is complete elimination of Philadelphia chromosome positive cells or BCR-ABL rearrangements. We studied molecular responses in CML patients in CCR after imatinib treatment. DESIGN AND METHODS: Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to monitor BCR-ABL levels in 59 CCR patients. Negative results were confirmed by two different techniques performed in two different laboratories. Patients were considered in complete molecular remission if they had four undetectable analyses from two separate samples taken three months apart. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 41 months (17-53). The median BCR-ABL/ABL ratio at the time of CCR was 0.3 % (0-9.88). Patients were split into two groups: group A (n=43) comprised patients with a detectable BCR-ABL/ABL ratio throughout the follow-up and group B (n=16) included those with an undetectable level of BCR-ABL/ABL (< 10(-5)) i.e. in complete molecular remission. No relapses were observed in group B, while 13 group A patients lost their CCR. The probability of losing CCR in this group was 33.2 % >+/-18.0. By Cox regression analysis the best factor for predicting the probability of achieving molecular remission was having a CCR at 6 months (p=0.038) or at 3 months (p=0.024). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Molecular remission after imatinib treatment, i.e. BCR-ABL/ABL< 10-5 in peripheral blood, is not a rare event, particularly in patients achieving CCR at 6 months.","['Colombat, Marie', 'Fort, Marie-Pierre', 'Chollet, Claudine', 'Marit, Gerald', 'Roche, Catherine', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Praloran, Vincent', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier']","['Colombat M', 'Fort MP', 'Chollet C', 'Marit G', 'Roche C', 'Preudhomme C', 'Reiffers J', 'Praloran V', 'Mahon FX']","[""Laboratoire d'hematologie Universite Victor Segalen, Bordeaux, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction/methods']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Feb;91(2):162-8.,,,,,,,,,"['Haematologica. 2006 Feb;91(2):145a.

The detection of t(15;17) at the single cell level, is commonly done by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using recombinant locus specific genomic probes greater than 14 kilobases kb in length. To allow a more thorough study of t(15;17), we designed small (0.9-3.6 kb), target-specific, single-copy probes from the human genome sequence. A novel detection approach was evaluated using moieties possessing more fluorophores, DNA dendrimers (up to 375 fluorophores per dendrimer). Two detection approaches were evaluated using the dendrimers: (1) dendrimers modified with anti-biotin antibodies for detection of biotinylated bound probes, and (2) dendrimers modified with 45-base long oligonucleotides designed from the single-copy probes, for direct detection of the target region. The selectivity of the probes was confirmed via indirect labeling with biotin/digoxigenin by nick translation, with detection efficiencies between 50 and 90%. Furthermore, the scFISH probes were successfully detected on metaphase cells with anti-biotin dendrimer conjugates and on interphase cells with 45-base modified dendrimers. Our results bring up the possibility to detect target regions of less than 1 kb, which will be a great contribution to high-resolution analysis of genomic sequences.","['Mora, Johanna R', 'Knoll, Joan H M', 'Rogan, Peter K', 'Getts, Robert C', 'Wilson, George S']","['Mora JR', 'Knoll JH', 'Rogan PK', 'Getts RC', 'Wilson GS']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, 66045, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cell Probes,Molecular and cellular probes,8709751,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Dendrimers)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'DNA Probes/chemistry', 'Dendrimers/chemistry', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Metaphase', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/06/30 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2005/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0890-8508(05)00097-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcp.2005.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Probes. 2006 Apr;20(2):114-20. doi: 10.1016/j.mcp.2005.11.005.

METHODS: Ten children (nine boys) between the ages of 3.6 and 14.6 years, on identical maintenance chemotherapy for ALL or NHL were treated with oral alendronate once weekly, and daily calcium supplementation, for a period of six months. Outcome measures were WB-BMC and LS-BMD; biochemical measures of bone mineral metabolism including plasma osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx), serum calcium, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-OHD), and parathyroid hormone (PTH); as well as assessments of motor function and HRQL. RESULTS: A gain in Z score was observed in 7/9 evaluable patients for WB-BMC (mean increase of 0.49) and LS-BMD (0.51). Plasma osteocalcin and CTx showed a change in bone turnover favouring formation over resorption. Serum calcium and 25-OHD remained normal throughout treatment. After an initial spike, serum PTH returned to baseline values at week 4. Measures of motor function showed some improvement and there were modest gains in HRQL.

STUDY DESIGN: Seventy patients in first complete remission received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (28 allogeneic and 42 autologous HSCT) as late intensification after conventional chemotherapy; 38 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a more advanced phase. A reference group was built up by collecting 40 acute myeloid leukemia patients who received high-dose cytosine arabinoside as late intensification and whose complete remission lasted more than 10 months. RESULTS: Results of the study led to conclude that an earlier timing of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be recommended in order to treat patients who would otherwise suffer an early relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients not in first complete remission supports the possibility of achieving good quality second complete remissions and suggests that autografting may be a life-saving strategy in selected acute myeloid leukemia patients with advanced disease.","['Annaloro, Claudio', 'Zilioli, Vittorio Ruggero', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola Stefano', 'Vener, Claudia', 'Soligo, Davide', 'Della Volpe, Aldo', 'Deliliers, Giorgio Lambertenghi']","['Annaloro C', 'Zilioli VR', 'Fracchiolla NS', 'Vener C', 'Soligo D', 'Della Volpe A', 'Deliliers GL']","['Ematologia I, Centro Trapianti di Midollo, Fondazione Ospedale Maggiore e Universita degli Studi di Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/02/08 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2006/02/08 09:00'],"['2006/02/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 2005 Sep-Oct;91(5):388-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This technique does not require the identification of the tumor antigen or HLA haplotype of the patient. We applied this approach to induce HLA class I- and class II-restricted T-cell responses directed against autologous acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) cell line NH-1. METHODS: Autologous T cells were stimulated by apoptotic tumor cell-loaded DCs generated from a patient with ALL. The stimulated and expanded T cells were isolated into CD8(+) T-cell line and CD4(+) T-cell line, and each of them was examined as to their functions. RESULTS: Both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell lines demonstrated cytotoxicity against NH-1 in an major histocompatibility complex-dependent manner. Finally, we established two independent CD4(+) T-cell clones restricted to HLA-DR. The CD4(+) T-cell line responded strongly to autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCL) but not to autologous normal cells. Furthermore, the T-cell clones also responded to allogeneic EBV-LCLs and B-ALL cell lines in the context of the HLA-DRB1( *)04051 molecule. Interestingly, 293T and COS-7 cells, which had been transfected with the HLA-DRB1( *)04051, were also recognized by T-cell clones. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that B-ALL has shared and strong immunogenic epitopes expressed on HLA class II molecules, the expression of which is limited to immortalized cells. These data suggest that vaccinations using DCs loaded with apoptotic tumor cells might be a potent strategy in the treatment of B-ALL.","['Hatakeyama, Naoki', 'Tamura, Yasuaki', 'Sahara, Hiroeki', 'Suzuki, Nobuhiro', 'Suzuki, Kazuhiko', 'Hori, Tsukasa', 'Mizue, Nobuo', 'Torigoe, Toshihiko', 'Tsutsumi, Hiroyuki', 'Sato, Noriyuki']","['Hatakeyama N', 'Tamura Y', 'Sahara H', 'Suzuki N', 'Suzuki K', 'Hori T', 'Mizue N', 'Torigoe T', 'Tsutsumi H', 'Sato N']","['Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', '*Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/immunology', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/classification/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology']",2006/02/07 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2006/02/07 09:00'],"['2005/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00525-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Feb;34(2):197-207. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.11.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its potential as an anticancer drug has not been investigated. METHODS: The effects of tetrahydroxyquinone on HL60 leukemia cells are investigated using fluorescein-activated cell sorting-dependent detection of phosphatidylserine exposure combined with 7-amino-actinomycin D exclusion, via Western blotting using phosphospecific antibodies, and by transfection of constitutively active protein kinase B. RESULTS: We observe that in HL60 leukemia cells tetrahydroxyquinone causes ROS production followed by apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, whereas cellular physiology of normal human blood leukocytes was not affected by tetrahydroxyquinone. The antileukemic effect of tetrahydroxyquinone is accompanied by reduced activity of various antiapoptotic survival molecules including the protein kinase B pathway. Importantly, transfection of protein kinase B into HL60 cells and thus artificially increasing protein kinase B activity inhibits tetrahydroxyquinone-dependent cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Tetrahydroxyquinone provokes cytotoxic effects on leukemia cells by reduced protein kinase B-dependent survival signaling followed by apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Thus, tetrahydroxyquinone may be representative of a novel class of chemotherapeutic drugs, inducing apoptosis in cancer cells through diminished survival signaling possibly as a consequence of ROS generation.","['Martins Cavagis, Alexandre D', 'Ferreira, Carmen Verissima', 'Versteeg, Henri H', 'Assis, Cristiane Fernandes', 'Bos, Carina L', 'Bleuming, Sylvia A', 'Diks, Sander H', 'Aoyama, Hiroshi', 'Peppelenbosch, Maikel P']","['Martins Cavagis AD', 'Ferreira CV', 'Versteeg HH', 'Assis CF', 'Bos CL', 'Bleuming SA', 'Diks SH', 'Aoyama H', 'Peppelenbosch MP']","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Quinones/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/02/07 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2006/02/07 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00528-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.11.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Feb;34(2):188-96. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.11.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next, expression outlined the ventral neural tube, the somites, the limbs, and the eye lens remaining at low levels throughout the embryo. By 13.0 dpc, expression became stronger in the spinal cord, in hand/foot plates, and in gonads. RT-PCR confirmed that Mll3 is expressed early during gametogenesis.

However, their action on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during oxidative stress remains to be explored. In this study, we have evaluated the anti-apoptotic and radical scavenging activities of dietary phenolics, namely caffeic acid (CA), ellagic acid (EA) and ferulic acid (FA). H2O2-induced apoptosis in normal human PBMCs was assayed by phosphotidylserine externalization, nucleosomal damage and DNA fragmentation. Incubation of PBMCs with 5 mM H2O2 led to increased Annexin-V binding to externalized phosphatidyl serine (PS), an event of pre-apoptotic stage of the cell. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells pretreated with phenolics could resist H2O2-induced apoptotic damage. Caffeic acid (60 and 120 microM) and EA (100 and 200 microM) caused no change in externalization of PS, whereas FA (100 and 200 microM) increased externalization of PS in PBMCs treated with H2O2. The effects of phenolics were abolished to a large extent by culturing the PBMCs for 24 h after washing the phenolics from the medium. Inhibitory activities of these phenolics on lipid peroxidation were in the order of EA<CA<FA. DPPH-scavenging activities of EA, CA and FA were found to be 31.2+/-1.36, 50+/-1.86 and 73.0+/-1.58 microM respectively. Although, the phenolics significantly inhibited DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, they could not alter the Bcl-2 expression in PBMCs. In conclusion, the anti-apoptotic effect of EA, CA and FA in PBMCs seems to be through the Bcl-2 independent mechanism.","['Khanduja, Krishan Lal', 'Avti, Pramod Kumar', 'Kumar, Surender', 'Mittal, Nidhi', 'Sohi, Kiranjit Kaur', 'Pathak, Chander Mohan']","['Khanduja KL', 'Avti PK', 'Kumar S', 'Mittal N', 'Sohi KK', 'Pathak CM']","['Department of Biophysics, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh-160012, India.

Defects in the tumour suppressor gene p53 pathway are known to be important in CLL and p53 inactivation is associated with a particularly aggressive form of CLL. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in codon 72 of TP53 leads to a single amino acid change leading to a change in apoptotic potential and alters prognosis in squamous carcinomas. A polymorphism within intron 6 of TP53 has been postulated to alter the susceptibility to lung cancer. Our study looked at the influence of these two polymorphisms in a cohort of approximately 200 CLL patients. The codon 72 polymorphism A2/A2 genotype (homozygous arginine) was associated with an increased susceptibility to CLL and CD38 negativity but did not appear to influence other biological behaviour or clinical response.

In order to investigate the genes involved in drug resistance, a human leukemia cell line that is resistant to doxorubicin, an anthracycline anticancer agent (AML-2/DX100), was selected and its gene expression profile was analyzed using a cDNA microarray. A number of genes were differentially expressed in the AML-2/DX100 cells, compared with the wild type (AML-2/WT). Pro-apoptotic genes such as TNFSF7 and p21 (Cip1/Waf1) were significantly down-regulated, whereas the IKBKB, PCNA, stathmin 1, MCM5, MMP-2 and MRP1 genes, which are involved in anti-apoptotic or cell cycle progression, were over-expressed. The AML-2/DX100 cells were also resistant to other anticancer drugs, including daunorubicin and camptothecin, and the expression levels of the differentially regulated genes such as STMN1, MMP-2 and CTSG, were constantly maintained. This suggests that the deregulated genes obtained from the DNA microarray analysis in a cell line model of drug resistance might contribute to the acquired drug resistance after chronic exposure.","['Song, Ju Han', 'Choi, Cheol Hee', 'Yeom, Hye-Jung', 'Hwang, Seung Yong', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Song JH', 'Choi CH', 'Yeom HJ', 'Hwang SY', 'Kim TS']","['College of Pharmacy and Genome Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2006/02/07 09:00,2006/07/04 09:00,['2006/02/07 09:00'],"['2005/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0024-3205(06)00026-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2005.12.054 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2006 Jun 6;79(2):193-202. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2005.12.054.

Cytokines and growth factors are candidates to be involved in astrocyte and microglial activation, and the up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is associated with brain damage. One of these candidates is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is induced in astrocytes by brain damage or seizure. LIF also regulates expression of both neuropeptide Y (NPY) and galanin following peripheral nerve injury. To test the hypothesis that LIF regulates astrocyte, microglial and neuropeptide responses to a mild insult, we used a low-dose pilocarpine model to induce a brief seizure in LIF knock-out (KO) mice. Compared to wild type mice, the LIF KO mouse displays reduced astrocyte and microglial activation in the hippocampus. In addition, LIF KO mice display dramatically altered NPY, but not galanin, expression in response to injury. Thus, LIF is required for normal glial responses to brain damage, and, as in the periphery, LIF regulates NPY expression in the CNS.","['Holmberg, Kristina H', 'Patterson, Paul H']","['Holmberg KH', 'Patterson PH']","['Biology Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA. kholmber@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Muscarinic Agonists)', '01MI4Q9DI3 (Pilocarpine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Hippocampus/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/deficiency/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microglia/drug effects/*physiology', 'Muscarinic Agonists/toxicity', 'Neurons/drug effects/*physiology', 'Pilocarpine/toxicity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2006/02/07 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2006/02/07 09:00'],"['2005/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-8993(05)02030-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.brainres.2005.12.103 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2006 Feb 23;1075(1):26-35. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2005.12.103.

Cannabinoids are used therapeutically by some patients as they have analgesic, anti-emetic and appetite stimulant properties which palliate adverse symptoms. Use of these agents in an oncology setting raises the question of whether they act to modulate the effectiveness of concurrently administered anti-cancer drugs. The transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) confers multiple drug resistance (MDR) by effluxing a diverse array of anti-cancer agents. This study was undertaken to examine the effect of cannabinoids on P-gp. Unlike the known P-gp inhibitor, PSC833, short 1h exposure to three plant-derived cannabinoids, cannabinol (CBN), cannabidiol (CBD) and Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN55, 212-2 (WIN) did not inhibit the efflux of the P-gp substrate Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) in either a drug-selected human T lymphoblastoid leukaemia cell line (CEM/VLB(100)) or in a mouse fibroblast MDR1 transfected cell line (77.1). However, in CEM/VLB(100) cells, prolonged 72 h exposure to the cannabinoids, THC and CBD, decreased P-gp expression to a similar extent as the flavonoid, curcumin (turmeric). This correlated with an increase in intracellular accumulation of Rh123 and enhanced sensitivity of the cells to the cytotoxic actions of the P-gp substrate, vinblastine. Taken together, these results provide preliminary evidence that cannabinoids do not exacerbate P-gp mediated MDR. Further, plant-derived cannabinoids are moderately effective in reversing MDR in CEM/VLB(100) cells by decreasing P-gp expression.","['Holland, M L', 'Panetta, J A', 'Hoskins, J M', 'Bebawy, M', 'Roufogalis, B D', 'Allen, J D', 'Arnold, J C']","['Holland ML', 'Panetta JA', 'Hoskins JM', 'Bebawy M', 'Roufogalis BD', 'Allen JD', 'Arnold JC']","['Department of Pharmacology, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cannabinoids)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cannabinoids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Protein Transport']",2006/02/07 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/02/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00003-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2005.12.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2006 Apr 14;71(8):1146-54. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2005.12.033.

Liposomes, bonding peculiarly with serum protein (opsonization), are taken up by reticuloendothelial system (RES) cells in the liver and spleen. It is known that polyethyleneglycol (PEG) modification of the liposome surface induces the formation of a fixed aqueous layer around the liposomes due to the interaction between the PEG-polymer and water molecule, and thus prevents the attraction of opsonins. Namely, PEG-modified liposomes are able to escape trapping by the RES cells, and have a prolonged circulation time. In this study, the effects of different anchors with the same PEG molecular weight on the cell uptake and cytotoxicity of mixed PEG-modified liposomal doxorubicin (DOX) were examined. The fixed aqueous layer thickness (FALT) of liposomes covered with mixtures of PEG-molecules which differ in their chain length were increased, compared to that of the single PEG2000-modified liposome. Mixed PEG-modification of liposomes with different anchors (PEG2000-(1-monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol-2,3-distearoylglycerol (DSG): cholesterol (CHO)=1:1)-modified liposome) led to an increase in the FALT, compared to that of each single PEG-modification. The uptake of DOX into Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells by the liposomes covered with PEG-CHO was higher than the other liposomes. Thus, liposomes covered with PEG-DSG and PEG-CHO have an enhanced cytotoxicity. In conclusion, it was confirmed that mix-modified liposomes using PEG-lipid with different anchors were superior.","['Sadzuka, Yasuyuki', 'Sugiyama, Ikumi', 'Tsuruda, Tomoko', 'Sonobe, Takashi']","['Sadzuka Y', 'Sugiyama I', 'Tsuruda T', 'Sonobe T']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Suruga-ku, Shizuoka 422-8526, Japan. sadzuka@u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liposomes)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Cholesterol/*chemistry', 'Doxorubicin/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Liposomes', 'Molecular Weight', 'Particle Size', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Surface Properties']",2006/02/07 09:00,2006/08/30 09:00,['2006/02/07 09:00'],"['2005/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-5173(06)00004-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2005.12.043 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2006 Apr 7;312(1-2):83-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2005.12.043.

This study aimed to evaluate the radiation body exposure during breast radiotherapy and to characterize the factors associated with an increased exposure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 120 women, radiation measurements were taken from four sites on the body at the time of adjuvant breast radiotherapy. Multiple regression analysis was performed to analyze patient and treatment factors associated with the amount of scattered radiation. RESULTS: For standard 50 Gy breast radiotherapy, the minimal dose received by abdominal organs is on average 0.45 Gy, ranging from 0.06 to 1.55 Gy. The use of physical wedges as a compensation technique was the most significant factor associated with increased scattered dose (p < 0.001), resulting in approximately three times more exposure compared with breast intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and dynamic wedge. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of radiation that is scattered to a patient's body is consistent with exposure reported to be associated with excess of leukemia. In accordance with the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle, we recommend using breast IMRT or virtual wedging for the radiotherapy of breast cancer receiving high-dose anthracycline chemotherapy.","['Woo, Tony C S', 'Pignol, Jean-Philippe', 'Rakovitch, Eileen', 'Vu, Toni', 'Hicks, Deanna', ""O'Brien, Peter"", 'Pritchard, Kathleen']","['Woo TC', 'Pignol JP', 'Rakovitch E', 'Vu T', 'Hicks D', ""O'Brien P"", 'Pritchard K']","[""Department of Radiation Oncology, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Body Height', 'Body Weight', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/*adverse effects', '*Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/methods', 'Regression Analysis', '*Scattering, Radiation']",2006/02/07 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/02/07 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(05)02977-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.11.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 May 1;65(1):52-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.11.023.

In this study, we found that AZT induces TP expression and enhances the sensitivity of human myeloid leukemia U937 cells to 5'-DFUR. Both the protein level and the activity of TP in U937 cells were elevated for 48h after exposure to AZT (20, 100 or 300muM). AZT enhanced TP promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. AZT also increased TP mRNA levels in U937 cells as assayed by Real-time reverse-transcription PCR. AZT enhanced the cytotoxic effect of 5'-DFUR on U937 cells. A TP inhibitor, TPI, abrogated the cytotoxic activity of 5'-DFUR, and attenuated the combined cytotoxicity of AZT and 5'-DFUR. These results suggest that AZT enhances the cytotoxic effect of 5'-DFUR on U937 cells by upregulating TP activity in addition to its inhibition of thymidine kinase (TK) activity and reduction of intracellular dTTP pools.","['Tsuneyoshi, Kengo', 'Haraguchi, Misako', 'Hongye, Zhao', 'Gotanda, Takenari', 'Tachiwada, Tokushi', 'Sumizawa, Tomoyuki', 'Furukawa, Tatsuhiko', 'Baba, Masanori', 'Akiyama, Shin-Ichi', 'Nakagawa, Masayuki']","['Tsuneyoshi K', 'Haraguchi M', 'Hongye Z', 'Gotanda T', 'Tachiwada T', 'Sumizawa T', 'Furukawa T', 'Baba M', 'Akiyama S', 'Nakagawa M']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Field of Oncology, Course of Advanced Therapeutics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Sakuragaoka 8-35-1, Kagoshima 890-8520, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.4.2.4 (Thymidine Phosphorylase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'V1JK16Y2JP (doxifluridine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', '*Drug Synergism', 'Floxuridine/*toxicity', 'Fluorouracil/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Thymidine Phosphorylase/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells/drug effects', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",2006/02/07 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/02/07 09:00'],"['2005/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(05)01089-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2005.12.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2006 Dec 8;244(2):239-46. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2005.12.020.

Although rapamycin and its analogues are attractive candidates for cancer therapy, their sensitivities with respect to growth inhibition differ markedly among various cancer cells. Using human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 as an experimental model system, we examined the growth-inhibitory effects of combinations of various agents and rapamycin to find the agent that most potently enhances the growth-inhibitory effect of rapamycin. METHOD: We evaluated the growth-inhibitory effect of rapamycin plus various agents, including cotylenin A (a novel inducer of differentiation of myeloid leukaemia cells) to MCF-7 cells, using either MTT assay or trypan blue dye exclusion test. The cell cycle was analyzed using propidium iodide-stained nuclei. Expressions of several genes in MCF-7 cells with rapamycin plus cotylenin A were studied using cDNA microarray analysis and RT-PCR. The in vitro results of MCF-7 cells treated with rapamycin plus cotylenin A were further confirmed in vivo in a mouse xenograft model. RESULTS: We found that the sensitivity of rapamycin to MCF-7 cells was markedly affected by cotylenin A. This treatment induced growth arrest of the cells at the G1 phase, rather than apoptosis, and induced senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. We examined the gene expression profiles associated with exposure to rapamycin and cotylenin A using cDNA microarrays. We found that expressions of cyclin G2, transforming growth factor-beta-induced 68 kDa protein, BCL2-interacting killer, and growth factor receptor-bound 7 were markedly induced in MCF-7 cells treated with rapamycin plus cotylenin A. Furthermore, combined treatment with rapamycin and cotylenin A significantly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells as xenografts, without apparent adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Rapamycin and cotylenin A cooperatively induced growth arrest in breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells in vitro, and treatment with rapamycin and cotylenin A combined more strongly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells as xenografts in vivo than treatment with rapamycin or cotylenin A alone, suggesting that this combination may have therapeutic value in treating breast cancer.

In preclinical and clinical studies, various attenuated vaccine strains and engineered virus vectors are currently being tested for their ability to achieve tumor-selective cell killing. However, significant improvements are still required in tumor selectivity, cytolytic potency, and modulating immune responses to achieve anti-tumor effects without prematurely terminating virus spread. Recently, we have developed murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) vectors for highly efficient, selective, and persistent gene transfer to cancer cells, and found that such vectors may offer significant advantages as oncolytic agents. In a variety of preclinical models, RCR vectors can achieve efficient and persistent gene delivery as the virus replicates throughout an entire tumor mass after inoculation with initial multiplicities of infection as low as 0.001. When engineered to deliver suicide genes, RCR vectors achieve highly efficient and synchronized cell killing triggered by pro-drug administration, both in culture and in tumor models in vivo. Further strategies are being explored to enhance the packaging capacity, efficiency, and specificity of this vector system through the development of semi-replicative RCR vectors, adenovirus-RCR hybrids, and incorporation of tumor targeting mechanisms via modification of binding tropism and transcriptional regulation. In addition, the ability of these vectors to achieve stable transgene expression in infected tumor cells may allow therapeutic applications that move beyond oncolysis per se.","['Dalba, Charlotte', 'Klatzmann, David', 'Logg, Christopher R', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki']","['Dalba C', 'Klatzmann D', 'Logg CR', 'Kasahara N']","['EPIXIS, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Gene Ther,Current gene therapy,101125446,,IM,"['Drug Design', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', '*Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Virus Replication']",2006/02/07 09:00,2006/06/01 09:00,['2006/02/07 09:00'],"['2006/02/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/156652305774964659 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Gene Ther. 2005 Dec;5(6):655-67. doi: 10.2174/156652305774964659.,"['P01 CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA93709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To increase the coverage of proteins present in detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (DRMMs), a combination of 16O/18O and isotope coded affinity tags (ICAT) labeling was used in a comparative analysis of detergent-insoluble membrane proteins isolated from rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3), with either Triton X-100 or Brij-96. The analysis resulted in the quantification of 738 unique proteins from Triton X-100 and Brij-96 isolated DRMMs, significantly exceeding the number of proteins quantified from either single labeling technique. Twenty-five noncysteine-containing proteins were quantified, as well as 32 cysteine-containing proteins that would have been missed if either 16O/18O or ICAT labeling had been used exclusively, which illustrate better proteome coverage and enhanced ability to quantitate. The comparative analysis revealed that proteins were more readily extracted using Triton X-100 than Brij-96; however, Triton X-100 also extracted larger quantities of non-DRMMs-associated proteins.

The HOX proteins which they encode are master regulators of embryonic development and continue to be expressed throughout postnatal life. The 39 human HOX genes are located in four clusters (A-D) on different chromosomes at 7p15, 17q21 [corrected] 12q13, and 2q31 respectively and are assumed to have arisen by duplication and divergence from a primordial homeobox gene. Disorders of limb formation, such as hand-foot-genital syndrome, have been traced to mutations in HOXA13 and HOXD13. Evolutionary conservation provides unlimited scope for experimental investigation of the functional control of the Hox gene network which is providing important insights into human disease. Chromosomal translocations involving the MLL gene, the human homologue of the Drosophila gene trithorax, create fusion genes which exhibit gain of function and are associated with aggressive leukaemias in both adults and children. To date 39 partner genes for MLL have been cloned from patients with leukaemia. Models based on specific translocations of MLL and individual HOX genes are now the subject of intense research aimed at understanding the molecular programs involved, and ultimately the design of chemotherapeutic agents for leukaemia.

Using a clinically relevant NOD/SCID mouse xenograft model of ALL, we established that alterations in the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton are involved in in vivo VCR resistance. Altered protein expression between VCR-sensitive ALL xenografts, and xenografts with intrinsic or acquired VCR resistance, was identified using 2-D DIGE coupled with MS. Of the 19 proteins displaying altered expression, 11 are associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Altered expression of the actin- and/or tubulin-binding proteins gelsolin, moesin, ezrin, tropomyosin, CAP-G, HSP27, HSP70, TCP-1, and stathmin were associated with in vivo VCR resistance. The actin-regulating protein gelsolin was increased in both acquired and resistant leukemia as confirmed by immunoblotting and gene expression. The major cytoskeletal protein, gamma-actin, was down-regulated in the VCR-resistant leukemia xenografts; in contrast, there was no significant change in beta-actin expression. This study provides the first evidence for a role of the actin cytoskeleton in intrinsic and acquired in vivo antimicrotubule drug resistance in childhood leukemia and highlights the power of 2-D DIGE for the discovery of resistance markers, pharmacoproteomics, and signaling pathways in cancer.","['Verrills, Nicole M', 'Liem, Natalia L', 'Liaw, Tracy Y E', 'Hood, Brian D', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Kavallaris, Maria']","['Verrills NM', 'Liem NL', 'Liaw TY', 'Hood BD', 'Lock RB', 'Kavallaris M']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Randwick, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Actins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cytoskeleton/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Microtubule Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Vincristine']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/06/27 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.200500417 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2006 Mar;6(5):1681-94. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200500417.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several flow cytometry assays have been described for assessing ZAP-70 in CLL, certain technical and scientific issues remain unsolved, which have prevented results of this crucial test from being reported, even in the best routine flow cytometry laboratories. In this report, we aimed to solve some of these issues by providing a computerized quantitative flow cytometric assay for ZAP-70 within the entire CLL population, which would be easy to perform and enable standardization between laboratories. METHODS: Intracellular ZAP-70 levels in CLL and normal B cells were assessed by molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF), employing Quantum FITC MESF calibration beads to establish a standard curve relating channel value to fluorescence intensity in MESF units and the QuickCal v. 2.2 program (www.bangslabs.com) and clinical relevance of the data was determined. RESULTS: The average ZAP-70 expression value in the CD19(+)/CD5(+) cells from 35 CLL patients was 103,701 MESF when compared with 12,621 MESF in B cells from 20 normal blood samples. ""Low"" and ""high"" ZAP-70 CLL subgroups were defined. Patients with ""high ZAP-70 MESF"" CLL had a shorter time to disease progression (P = 0.0005) and a more advanced clinical stage (P = 0.0018) when compared with patients in the ""low ZAP-70 MESF"" CLL subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: This quantitative analysis method can be employed to obtain a more specific and highly accurate assessment of ZAP-70 levels in CLL cells. The method can easily be standardized, in any routine flow laboratory, thereby improving reproducibility and reliability of ZAP-70 analysis.","['Kay, Sigi', 'Herishanu, Yair', 'Pick, Marjorie', 'Rogowski, Ori', 'Baron, Shoshana', 'Naparstek, Elizabeth', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Deutsch, Varda R']","['Kay S', 'Herishanu Y', 'Pick M', 'Rogowski O', 'Baron S', 'Naparstek E', 'Polliack A', 'Deutsch VR']","['The Hematology Institute, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center,Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

METHODS: The lipofectamine mediation was used to transfect the recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid (pcDNA3-RZ) containing anti-VEGF hairpin ribozyme gene and the non-recombinant vector as control into K562 cells. And the positive clones were screened by G418. Ribozyme gene in K562 cells was confirmed by PCR. Fluorescent real time reverse transcription-PCR(RT-PCR) and Western blotting were employed to detect the expression of VEGF mRNA and protein in leukemia cells. cDNA microarray was used to explore the alteration of gene expression profiles when decreasing VEGF gene expression in leukemia cells. Expression of PCNA and GSN genes were verified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: The pcDNA3-RZ and pcDNA3 had been transfected into the human leukemia cell line K562 and positive clones been screened by G418. Stable expression of the ribozyme gene in K562 cells was confirmed by PCR. The level of VEGF mRNA and protein decreased dramatically in K562-RZ cells when compared with K562 or K562-PC (K562 cell transfected with empty vector) cells. The gene expression profiles were changed by transfection of anti-VEGF hairpin ribozyme gene into K562 cells. Among 4096 gene clones on the microarray, 191 (4.86%) genes were detected to have the marked changes with 104 down-regulated and 87 up-regulated, that were functionally related to cell cycle progression, gene replication, metabolism, cell apoptosis, cell signal transduction, and oncogenes etc. An increased expression of GSN gene and a decreased expression of PCNA gene in K562/RZ cells have been detected by RT-PCR.

These results indicate that Mcl-1 plays an apical role in many cell death and survival regulatory programs.","['Yang-Yen, Hsin-Fang']",['Yang-Yen HF'],"['Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, 128 Yen-Jiou Yuan Road, Section 2, Nankang, Taipei, 11529, Taiwan. imbyy@gate.sinica.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11373-005-9064-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Sci. 2006 Mar;13(2):201-4. doi: 10.1007/s11373-005-9064-4.,,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: We present a 17-year-old patient who suffered from an intraventricular malignant meningioma. At the age of 2 years, acute lymphatic leukemia (common ALL [cALL]) was diagnosed and successfully treated with chemotherapy. There was no cranial radiation therapy. In December 2001, 13 years after diagnosis of cALL, he complained of headache, vomiting, and walking difficulties. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing mass with cystic components in the trigone of the right lateral ventricle. The tumor was removed completely. Histological diagnosis revealed a malignant papillary meningioma. After removal of a recurrent meningioma 16 months later, he received local radiotherapy.

Thus there is a need for developing approaches to overcome and prevent resistance to imatinib. RECENT FINDINGS: Several new agents have been developed with significant activity in imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia. A second generation of more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors, some with dual activity against Abl and Src, have shown very impressive results. Other agents, such as hypomethylating agents, farnesyl transferase inhibitors and homoharringtonine, have also shown preclinical and clinical promise. The use of vaccines as a way of providing an immunomodulatory approach to chronic myeloid leukemia is starting to develop as a major strategy to achieve eradication of the disease. SUMMARY: Multiple effective agents are being developed to overcome resistance to imatinib. The challenge for the future is to incorporate them into effective strategies that can eliminate the disease and cure all patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Cortes, Jorge']",['Cortes J'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Models, Animal', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.moh.0000208468.40991.f2 [doi]', '00062752-200603000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2006 Mar;13(2):79-86. doi: 10.1097/01.moh.0000208468.40991.f2.,,93,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substantial evidence also indicates that abnormal Hox protein expression is functionally significant in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid malignancies. The purpose of this review is to outline recent progress in understanding molecular mechanisms involved in Hox regulation of myelopoiesis and myeloid leukemogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Since Hox proteins function as transcription factors, recent studies have focused on identifying Hox target genes. Various approaches to this problem have been taken, including high throughput screening techniques. In these studies, expression profiles of hematopoietic cells overexpressing various Hox proteins have been analyzed to obtain initial information about potential target genes. Identification of common and unique sets of target genes for various Hox proteins will shed light on function and regulation of the Hox code in developing hematopoietic cells. SUMMARY: Recent studies have generated some intriguing information about potential Hox target genes involved in myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis. A number of issues regarding Hox protein function are unresolved, however. These issues include determining whether the effects of various Hox proteins are redundant versus antagonistic, identifying mechanisms which regulate Hox protein function and mechanisms by which Hox proteins modulate target gene transcription in a context-dependent manner.","['Eklund, Elizabeth A']",['Eklund EA'],"['The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University and Jesse Brown VHA Medical Center, 710 N.

We could demonstrate that rimming of adipocytes by neoplastic cells can be recognized not only in subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, but also in several different entities of malignant lymphoma with skin involvement. Precise classification of cases with prominent involvement of the subcutaneous tissues can only be achieved upon precise correlation of clinicopathologic and phenotypic features.

Recently, we reported that rituximab treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients induced substantial loss of CD20 on B cells found in the circulation after rituximab infusion, when rituximab plasma concentrations were high. Such antigenic modulation can severely compromise therapeutic efficacy, and we postulated that B cells had been stripped (shaved) of the rituximab/CD20 complex by monocytes or macrophages in a reaction mediated by FcgammaR. We developed an in vitro model to replicate this in vivo shaving process, based on reacting rituximab-opsonized CD20(+) cells with acceptor THP-1 monocytes. After 45 min at 37 degrees C, rituximab and CD20 are removed from opsonized cells, and both are demonstrable on acceptor THP-1 cells. The reaction occurs equally well in the presence and absence of normal human serum, and monocytes isolated from peripheral blood also promote shaving of CD20 from rituximab-opsonized cells. Tests with inhibitors and use of F(ab')(2) of rituximab indicate transfer of rituximab/CD20 complexes to THP-1 cells is mediated by FcgammaR. Antigenic modulation described in previous reports may have been mediated by such shaving, and our findings may have profound implications for the use of mAbs in the immunotherapy of cancer.","['Beum, Paul V', 'Kennedy, Adam D', 'Williams, Michael E', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Taylor, Ronald P']","['Beum PV', 'Kennedy AD', 'Williams ME', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Taylor RP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Rituximab']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['176/4/2600 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.176.4.2600 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Feb 15;176(4):2600-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.176.4.2600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show in this study that G-CSF-induced activation of Akt in myeloid 32D was specifically inhibited by treatment with PMA, a protein kinase C (PKC) activator. PMA treatment also rapidly attenuated sustained Akt activation mediated by a carboxy truncated G-CSF receptor, expressed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia evolving from severe congenital neutropenia. The inhibitory effect of PMA was abolished by pretreatment of cells with specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X, suggesting that the PKC pathway negatively regulates Akt activation. Ro31-8820, a PKCepsilon inhibitor, also abrogated PMA-mediated inhibition of Akt activation, whereas rottlerin and Go6976, inhibitors of PKCdelta and PKCalphabetaI, respectively, exhibited no significant effects. Furthermore, overexpression of the wild-type and a constitutively active, but not a kinase-dead, forms of PKCepsilon markedly attenuated Akt activation, and inhibited the proliferation and survival of cells in response to G-CSF. The expression of PKCepsilon was down-regulated with G-CSF-induced terminal granulocytic differentiation. Together, these results implicate PKCepsilon as a negative regulator of Akt activation stimulated by G-CSF and indicate that PKCepsilon plays a negative role in cell proliferation and survival in response to G-CSF.","['Liu, Hong', 'Qiu, Yaling', 'Xiao, Lei', 'Dong, Fan']","['Liu H', 'Qiu Y', 'Xiao L', 'Dong F']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Toledo, OH 43606, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-epsilon)']",IM,"['3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C-epsilon/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['176/4/2407 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.176.4.2407 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Feb 15;176(4):2407-13. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.176.4.2407.,"['R01 CA092172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA88815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA92172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of TRAIL-R resulted in caspase 3-dependent apoptosis of CBMC and HMC-1. IgE-dependent activation of CBMC increased their susceptibility to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

NPM1 mutations were most prevalent in patients with normal karyotype (NK) (324 of 709; 45.7%) compared with 58 of 686 with karyotype abnormalities (8.5%; P < .001) and were significantly associated with several clinical parameters (high bone marrow [BM] blasts, high white blood cell [WBC] and platelet counts, female sex). NPM1 alterations were associated with FLT3-ITD mutations, even if restricted to patients with NK (NPM1-mut/FLT3-ITD: 43.8%; versus NPM1-wt/FLT3-ITD: 19.9%; P < .001). The analysis of the clinical impact in 4 groups (NPM1 and FLT3-ITD single mutants, double mutants, and wild-type [wt] for both) revealed that patients having only an NPM1 mutation had a significantly better overall and disease-free survival and a lower cumulative incidence of relapse. In conclusion, NPM1 mutations represent a common genetic abnormality in adult AML. If not associated with FLT3-ITD mutations, mutant NPM1 appears to identify patients with improved response toward treatment.","['Thiede, Christian', 'Koch, Sina', 'Creutzig, Eva', 'Steudel, Christine', 'Illmer, Thomas', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Ehninger, Gerhard']","['Thiede C', 'Koch S', 'Creutzig E', 'Steudel C', 'Illmer T', 'Schaich M', 'Ehninger G']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der Technischen Universitat, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307 Dresden, Germany. thiede@mk1.med.tu-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/06/15 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63831-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-3167 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 15;107(10):4011-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-3167.

Older study patients with AML presented with poorer performance status, lower white blood cell counts, and a lower percentage of marrow blasts. Multidrug resistance was found in 33% of AMLs in patients younger than age 56 compared with 57% in patients older than 75. The percentage of patients with favorable cytogenetics dropped from 17% in those younger than age 56 to 4% in those older than 75. In contrast, the proportion of patients with unfavorable cytogenetics increased from 35% in those younger than age 56 to 51% in patients older than 75. Particularly striking were the increases in abnormalities of chromosomes 5, 7, and 17 among the elderly. The increased incidence of unfavorable cytogenetics contributed to their poorer outcome, and, within each cytogenetic risk group, treatment outcome deteriorated markedly with age. Finally, the combination of a poor performance status and advanced age identified a group of patients with a very high likelihood of dying within 30 days of initiating induction therapy. The distinct biology and clinical responses seen argue for age-specific assessments when evaluating therapies for AML.","['Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Gundacker, Holly', 'Head, David R', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Godwin, John E', 'Anderson, Jeanne E', 'Petersdorf, Stephen H']","['Appelbaum FR', 'Gundacker H', 'Head DR', 'Slovak ML', 'Willman CL', 'Godwin JE', 'Anderson JE', 'Petersdorf SH']","['Southwest Oncology Group, Operations Office, 14980 Omicron Dr, San Antonio, TX 78245-3217, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/*etiology/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65525-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-09-3724 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 1;107(9):3481-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-09-3724.

In this paper, we have elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying the abnormal cytoplasmic localization of NPM. All 29 AML-associated mutated NPM alleles so far identified encode abnormal proteins which have acquired at the C-terminus a nuclear export signal (NES) motif and lost both tryptophan residues 288 and 290 (or only the residue 290) which determine nucleolar localization. We show for the first time that both alterations are crucial for NPM mutant export from nucleus to cytoplasm. In fact, the cytoplasmic accumulation of NPM is blocked by leptomycin-B and ratjadones, specific exportin-1/Crm1-inhibitors, and by reinsertion of tryptophan residues 288 and 290, which respectively relocate NPM mutants in the nucleoplasm and nucleoli. NPM leukemic mutants in turn recruit the wild-type NPM from nucleoli to nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. These findings indicate that potential therapeutic strategies aimed to retarget NPM to its physiological sites will have to overcome 2 obstacles, the new NES motif and the mutated tryptophan(s) at the NPM mutant C-terminus.","['Falini, Brunangelo', 'Bolli, Niccolo', 'Shan, Jing', 'Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Liso, Arcangelo', 'Pucciarini, Alessandra', 'Bigerna, Barbara', 'Pasqualucci, Laura', 'Mannucci, Roberta', 'Rosati, Roberto', 'Gorello, Paolo', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Roti, Giovanni', 'Tiacci, Enrico', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Schnittger, Suzanne', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Gu, Wei', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Nicoletti, Ildo']","['Falini B', 'Bolli N', 'Shan J', 'Martelli MP', 'Liso A', 'Pucciarini A', 'Bigerna B', 'Pasqualucci L', 'Mannucci R', 'Rosati R', 'Gorello P', 'Diverio D', 'Roti G', 'Tiacci E', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Biondi A', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Martelli MF', 'Gu W', 'Mecucci C', 'Nicoletti I']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Perugia, 06122 Perugia, Italy. faliniem@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Export Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Export Signals/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Transfection', 'Tryptophan/*genetics']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/06/30 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)64590-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-11-4745 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jun 1;107(11):4514-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-11-4745.

METHODS: We analyzed 98 treatment courses. The study endpoints were to determine how methotrexate exposure is related to homocysteine accumulation and whether it is influenced by pretreatment plasma folate. RESULTS: Peak concentrations of homocysteine increased from the start of the intravenous infusion through cessation of methotrexate therapy up to time point t(42), when this trend was reversed by administration of folinic acid. The area under the curve (AUC) for plasma homocysteine showed decreasing course-to-course tendencies with a statistically significant decrease only between courses 1 and 2 (P <or=0.05), indicating decreased whole-body homocysteine accumulation in response to administration of consecutive methotrexate courses. Therapeutic courses with low initial folate concentrations (<or=10 nmol/L) gave significantly higher responses in homocysteine accumulation expressed both as (hcys)AUC(0-66 h) and the peak t(42) homocysteine concentrations than did courses with initial folate >10 nmol/L. Correspondingly, in the courses with low initial folate, peak plasma concentrations of methotrexate were significantly higher than in courses with high precourse concentrations of plasma folate. CONCLUSION: Endogenous pretreatment plasma folate modulates the magnitude of the methotrexate effect, providing support for a ""folate overrescue"" concept.","['Sterba, Jaroslav', 'Dusek, Ladislav', 'Demlova, Regina', 'Valik, Dalibor']","['Sterba J', 'Dusek L', 'Demlova R', 'Valik D']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '12001-76-2 (Vitamin B Complex)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/*blood', 'Homocysteine/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leucovorin/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Vitamin B 12/blood', 'Vitamin B Complex/*therapeutic use']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['clinchem.2005.061150 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2005.061150 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2006 Apr;52(4):692-700. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2005.061150.

The use of radioimmunotherapy may deliver a significant dose of radiation to the kidneys. We therefore studied the incidence and clinical picture of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) nephropathy in our patients receiving radioimmunotherapy before allogeneic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: This study was a clinical trial of 114 consecutive patients who received conditioning with a radiolabeled anti-CD66 antibody-188Re (n = 93) or 90Y (n = 21)-between 1998 and 2003. RESULTS: Although BMT nephropathy has developed in none of the patients in the [90Y]anti-CD66 group, 6 of 93 patients receiving [188Re]anti-CD66 presented with signs of BMT nephropathy at a median of 11.5 mo after stem cell transplantation. The absorbed renal dose was significantly lower in the 90Y group (4 vs. 7 Gy, P < 0.0001). Of the patients receiving [188Re]anti-CD66 who are alive, BMT nephropathy developed in 19% (6/32). Five of 6 patients with BMT nephropathy received total-body irradiation. The patients presented with elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria, anemia, hypertension, and signs of microangiopathy. All 6 patients in whom BMT nephropathy has developed are alive at a median follow-up of 58 mo after stem cell transplantation, and 1 patient has entered a dialysis program.

Drug allergy.,S464-70,"Drug reactions can be considered as being either predictable or unpredictable. A predictable reaction would be the result of the pharmacologic action of the medication. An unpredictable reaction might be idiosyncratic, might be drug intolerance, or might have or imply an immunologic basis, such as being IgE mediated. Immediate reactions that are not IgE mediated can be considered as pseudoallergic (non-IgE-mediated mast cell activation). This review will discuss allergic and immunologic reactions to immunomodulators, penicillins and cephalosporins, sulfonamides, aspirin, and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and consider the serious drug-related conditions of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The field of drug ""allergy"" has expanded to include adverse reactions associated with immunosuppressive medications, anticytokine therapies, and mAbs. The cytokine release reaction that occurs with anti-CD20 antibody infusions in patients with leukemia and white blood cell counts of greater than 50 x 10(9)/L is associated with high concentrations of TNF, IL-6, and IL-8. Because of the findings of fever, dyspnea, rigors, and hypotension, this reaction resembles the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction that occurs 60 to 90 minutes after penicillin administration in patients with secondary syphilis. Furthermore, the care of the patient with penicillin allergy has been made more difficult in the absence of the major determinant, penicilloyl-polylysine, in that from 34% to 84% of patients who have positive skin test reactions to penicillin have exclusively positive reactions to the major determinant. SJS and TEN typically are caused by medications within 1 to 8 weeks of initiation of therapy. Evidence for death of the keratinocytes through (1) drug-specific cytotoxicity with the perforin-granzyme B-mediated killing and (2) activation of Fas on keratinocytes have provided explanations for the sloughing of skin.

Leukemic lineage-associated monoclonal antibodies were separately immobilized onto the nanogold-PA-modified surface of the crystals, which were constructed by a 2 x 2 type of probes forming a QCM-based immunosensor array. The main detection conditions were investigated, including the immobilization amount of antibodies, pH, immunoreaction time, sample dilution ratio, etc. The immunophenotyping feasibility of the new technique was investigated through simultaneously analyzing Jurkat cells by the immunosensor array method, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry.

Moreover, comparison studies were carried out for CD antigens expressed on the nucleated cells isolated from 96 acute leukemic patients and 24 normal subjects using the QCM-based immunosensor method and the fluoroimmunoassay. Results obtained by immunophenotyping patients' samples with the immunosensor-based method achieved the rate of 88.93% in 768 groups of numerical data, where no significant statistical difference was observed between the two methods when checked by chi2 analysis (chi2 = 3.4, p > 0.05). This new immunosensor array showed the merits of high sensitivity, high specificity, good reproducibility, easy operation, and low cost. The results of specimen evaluation indicated that it might be clinically suitable for quantifying human differentiated leukocytes and immunophenotyping of acute leukemias.","['Zeng, Hui', 'Wang, Hua', 'Chen, Fangping', 'Xin, Hongya', 'Wang, Guangping', 'Xiao, Le', 'Song, Kui', 'Wu, Dengshu', 'He, Qun', 'Shen, Guoli']","['Zeng H', 'Wang H', 'Chen F', 'Xin H', 'Wang G', 'Xiao L', 'Song K', 'Wu D', 'He Q', 'Shen G']","['Hematology Department, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,['14808-60-7 (Quartz)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Biosensing Techniques', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*immunology', '*Quartz']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/06/10 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2005/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-2697(05)00880-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ab.2005.12.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 2006 Apr 1;351(1):69-76. doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2005.12.006.

Previous studies have shown that in vitro stimulation of bone marrow cells (BMCs) from FA mice promotes apoptosis, reduces the reconstitution ability of the stem cells, and induces myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemia upon reinfusion of the cells. This suggests the convenience of adapting standard protocols of gene therapy to FA. Here we show that the reserve of BM progenitors in FA patients is generally below 20% of normal values. Because this reduced reserve could activate the cycling of BM progenitors, we developed a simplified protocol to transduce BMCs from FA patients with gammaretroviral vectors. We demonstrate that a short in vitro manipulation (12-24 hr) of fresh mononuclear BMCs is sufficient to transduce 42% of hematopoietic progenitors from FA-A patients, in the absence of in vitro prestimulation. When FANCA-expressing vectors were used, this simple procedure reversed the phenotype of the BM progenitors from these patients. We propose that our approach will be more efficient and safer compared with standard gene therapy protocols for FA.","['Jacome, A', 'Navarro, S', 'Casado, J A', 'Rio, P', 'Madero, L', 'Estella, J', 'Sevilla, J', 'Badell, I', 'Ortega, J J', 'Olive, T', 'Hanenberg, H', 'Segovia, J C', 'Bueren, J A']","['Jacome A', 'Navarro S', 'Casado JA', 'Rio P', 'Madero L', 'Estella J', 'Sevilla J', 'Badell I', 'Ortega JJ', 'Olive T', 'Hanenberg H', 'Segovia JC', 'Bueren JA']","['Spanish Fanconi Anemia Research Network, Madrid 28040, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fanconi Anemia/blood/*therapy', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Reference Values', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/03/11 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2006.17.245 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2006 Feb;17(2):245-50. doi: 10.1089/hum.2006.17.245.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is most intensely expressed by the most immature thymus T-lineage cells and is more intensely expressed by CD34-positive/CD33-positive myeloid cells (compared to more mature myeloid cells) and the earliest CD34-positive/CD10-positive B-cell precursor cells (compared to cells of later B-cell precursor stages). CD99 (MIC2) is characteristically expressed in precursor B- and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas/leukemias, as well as in Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (ES/PNET). It has also been shown to be expressed in a few terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-positive myeloid processes, but has been uniformly negative in TdT-negative myeloid processes. A more recent study showed that 43% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and 55% of chloromas express CD99, concluding that CD99 is commonly expressed in AML and rarely seen in myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes, or normal bone marrow. Although this study speculated that MIC2 expression was probably not limited to TdT-positive AML, there was no comparison with TdT reactivity in this study. OBJECTIVE: Since AML and high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome may occasionally be difficult to distinguish morphologically from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and ES/ PNET, we undertook a study to analyze MIC2 expression in conjunction with TdT reactivity in distinguishing AML or high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and ES/PNET. DESIGN: We studied bone marrow core and clot paraffin specimens from AML (classified according to criteria of the World Health Organization; n = 49), myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 4), precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 4), ES/PNET (n = 1), and normal bone marrow (n = 3) with MIC2 (CD99) and TdT immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Overall, CD99 was expressed in 24 (49%) of 49 AML cases, including all (11/11) TdT-positive cases. CD99 was expressed in all subtypes of AML except M5. Myelodysplastic syndromes and normal bone marrow specimens were uniformly CD99 negative. Expression of TdT was limited to a subset of AML-M0, -M1, -M2, and -M4, and AML with multilineage dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to a previous study, CD99 expression was not restricted to TdT-positive hematologic proliferations. In particular, the CD99-positive M3 and M7 AMLs were TdT negative. An M5 AML may likely be excluded based on a uniform TdT-negative/CD99-negative immunophenotype. In addition, in our experience, CD99 should be routinely evaluated on bone marrow clots, owing to decreased reactivity or loss of reactivity in rapid decalcifying (RDO) solution-decalcified specimens.","['Kang, Loveleen C', 'Dunphy, Cherie H']","['Kang LC', 'Dunphy CH']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7525, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/diagnosis']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['OA-2005-012 [pii]', '10.5858/2006-130-153-IOMCAT [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2006 Feb;130(2):153-7. doi: 10.5858/2006-130-153-IOMCAT.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe inhibition of retrovirus production by multiple siRNAs designed to target various regions of the viral genomes. Using murine leukemia virus (MuLV) as a model, we demonstrate that the virus production can be inhibited by 77% in siLTR2 (a siRNA targeting the U3 region of MuLV) expression vector transfected cells. Coexpression of siLTR2 with siPsi2 (a siRNA targeting the 3' Psi (packaging signal sequence) results in 93% suppression of the virus production, suggesting that an increased inhibition of the virus production can be achieved by coexpression of multiple siRNAs to target different regions of the viral RNA simultaneously. Our results also indicate that not all sequences of the viral RNA are equally accessible to siRNA. We show that U3 region of MuLV is more accessible to siRNA, whereas the packaging signal sequence, especially the region adjacent to 5'LTR, is less accessible to siRNA, partly as a result of the binding of Gag precursors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coexpression of siLTR2 with siPsi2 in virus producer cells leads to 88% knockdown of viral titer, showing the benefit of coexpression of multiple siRNAs for potent suppression of virus production in the setting of an established infection. Moreover, we demonstrate that infection of MuLV in cells that stably coexpress siLTR2 with siPsi2 diminishes by 77%. Taken together, we establish that siRNA-mediated gene silencing can suppress multiple steps of the retrovirus life cycle, offering a potential for both treating virus-associated diseases and preventing viral infection.","['Ye, Kaiming', 'Jin, Sha']","['Ye K', 'Jin S']","['Biomedical Engineering Program, College of Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas 72701, USA. kye@uark.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Viral/*drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",2006/02/04 09:00,2006/05/23 09:00,['2006/02/04 09:00'],"['2006/02/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bp050133u [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2006 Jan-Feb;22(1):45-52. doi: 10.1021/bp050133u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A metabolite, SAN-Gly, which is thought to be generated through metabolism of KRN5500 by a cytosomal enzyme, exhibited a marked inhibitory effect. KRN5500 is expected to be useful even for treatment of refractory solid tumors because of its unique antitumor mechanism.

METHODS: This descriptive study was carried out at the Aga Khan University Hospital pathology department including 1721 cases of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL) diagnosed during a period of five years (1998-2002) and classified according to REAL/WHO classification. The antibodies used included Leukocyte Common Antigen (LCA), Pan B (CD20, CD79a), Pan T (UCHL-1), Bcl 2, Mib 1(Ki 67) and Cyclin D1 (Dako, Denmark). RESULTS: Out of the 1721 NHL cases, only 140 (8.1%) could be categorized as small B-cell NHL. The study group comprised small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (58 cases; 41.4%) followed by follicular lymphoma (46 cases; 32.9%), mantle cell lymphoma (15 cases; 10.7%), extra nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of MALT type (15 cases; 10.7%), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (5 cases; 3.6%) and splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (1 case; 0.7%). No case of nodal marginal zone lymphoma was diagnosed. The age ranged from 18 to 98 years with a mean and median of 54.64 and 58.50 years respectively. Small B-cell NHL was more common in males; with male to female ratio of 2.1. Majority of the small B-cell NHL were nodal at presentation with a nodal to extranodal ratio of 3.4. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the frequency of these small B-cell NHL is very low in our population in contrast to the western literature.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at the department of Pathology and Oncology, Aga Khan University Karachi from January 2003 to January 2005. Newly diagnosed patients with denovo AML admitted to the hospital were included in the study. Diagnosis of AML was based on FAB criteria, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic studies. They were treated according to standard protocols (combination of anthracycline and cytarabine -3+7) and those who had acute promyelocytic leukaemia additionally received all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA). RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were enrolled, 4 were excluded due to inadequate cytogenetic analysis and the remaining patients entered the study protocol. There were 32 males and 20 females with mean age of 31.3 years (range 9 months to 73 years). Thirty-five (67.3%) patients had normal karyotype while 17 (32.7%) were found to have cytogenetic abnormalities. Eleven patients did not receive treatment at our hospital. Half of the (51.2%) patients out of remaining 41 achieved complete remission on bone marrow examination after receiving induction chemotherapy. In favourable risk group 3/3 (100%) achieved complete remission (CR) while 15/32 (46.9%) in intermediate risk group and 3/6 (50%) in unfavourable risk group. There was low CR rate in patients with high white cell counts. CONCLUSION: The frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in AML and response to induction chemotherapy was low when compared with international data possibly due to the small sample size. However, there was a clear difference in CR rates between favourable and unfavourable risk groups.","['Harani, Mahadev S', 'Adil, Salman N', 'Kakepoto, Ghulam Nabi', 'Khilji, Zahida', 'Shaikh, Usman', 'Khurshid, Mohammad']","['Harani MS', 'Adil SN', 'Kakepoto GN', 'Khilji Z', 'Shaikh U', 'Khurshid M']","['Department of Pathology, Chandka Medical College, Larkana.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Pakistan,J Pak Med Assoc,JPMA.

Here we report the first characterization of a new DNA polymerase activity, specific to CaMV-infected tissues. A subcellular fraction of infected cells shows capacity to copy poly(C) and the heteropolymeric regions of natural mRNAs. Chromatographic isolation of the poly(C)-dependent activity clearly establishes that it is distinct from the classical gamma-like DNA polymerases previously described in plant cells. The significant homology observed between defined regions of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) polymerase and CaMV unassigned gene V product favours the idea that the reverse transcriptase-like DNA polymerase detected in infected cells is a virus-encoded enzyme.","['Volovitch, M', 'Modjtahedi, N', 'Yot, P', 'Brun, G']","['Volovitch M', 'Modjtahedi N', 'Yot P', 'Brun G']","[""Laboratoire de Biochimie, Section de Biologie, Institut Curie, 26 rue d'Ulm, 75231 Paris Cedex 05, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,,,,1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1984 Feb;3(2):309-14.,,,,PMC557339,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a sequence, for which we propose the name v-mil, from MilI-Hill-2 virus, is not homologous to v-myc, the previously described oncogene of MH2, nor to avian leukaemia virus-related sequences.

One method is based upon drawing Thiessen polygons around each control. It is unnecessary to actually draw or compute the boundaries of the polygons; it is sufficient to count, for each control, the number of cases that are closer to that control than to any other control. A second method is similar to the Cuzick-Edwards method, which is based on counts of cases that are among the k-nearest neighbours of cases, but is instead based upon the number of cases within a specified distance of cases. These first two methods are global methods in the sense that they provide a single statistic that measures the degree of spatial clustering. The third method suggests a local statistic, for tests of the null hypothesis of no spatial clustering around a prespecified focus. The method is based upon the cumulative chi2 test, which is typically used to test whether cases are more prevalent than expected around a prespecified location. This is also extended to the case where all observational locations are considered as potential cluster locations and multiple testing is carried out. Each of the new methods is illustrated using data on childhood leukaemia and lymphoma cases in North Humberside.","['Rogerson, Peter A']",['Rogerson PA'],"['Department of Geography, Wilkeson Hall, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14261, USA. rogerson@buffalo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,"['*Bayes Theorem', '*Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Cluster Analysis', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2006/02/03 09:00,2006/06/21 09:00,['2006/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.2426 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2006 Mar 15;25(5):811-23. doi: 10.1002/sim.2426.,"['1R01 ES09816-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA92693-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,

Whether motor problems persist in other children who receive different cumulative doses of VCR is to the authors' knowledge not known. The objective of the current study was to determine the extent of motor problems in children with ALL, Wilms tumor (WT), B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), and malignant mesenchymal tumors (MMT) and whether these motor problems were related to VCR dose. METHODS: In 128 children ages 4-12 years who completed treatment after at least 1 year, motor performance was measured using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (m-ABC). RESULTS: The m-ABC scores of the total study group were significantly lower than those of the normal population (P < 0.001). There were no differences in scores noted between children with ALL, WT, B-NHL, or MMT. There also were no differences noted between those children with ALL who had received pulses of VCR and steroids during maintenance therapy and those who had not. All groups demonstrated large variability in scores. Scores were not found to be significantly different between those children who had received low (< 20 mg/m(2)), intermediate (20-40 mg/m(2)), or high (> 40 mg/m(2)) cumulative doses of VCR. Cumulative doses of corticosteroids and methotrexate did not affect scores, nor did age at diagnosis and time since the completion of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although motor performance was impaired in all patient groups, no correlation was found between motor performance and the cumulative dose of VCR or other drugs, age, and follow-up time. Future studies have to address several issues, including whether polymorphisms in drug metabolizing genes or drug target genes explain the significant variability noted in the long-term motor outcome of children with cancer.","['Hartman, Annelies', 'van den Bos, Cor', 'Stijnen, Theo', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Hartman A', 'van den Bos C', 'Stijnen T', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, 3000 CB Rotterdam, The Netherlands. j.hartman@erasmusmc.nl""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/drug effects', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Psychomotor Performance/*drug effects', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Wilms Tumor/complications/drug therapy']",2006/02/03 09:00,2006/05/05 09:00,['2006/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21706 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Mar 15;106(6):1395-401. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21706.,,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

Acquisition of new chromosomal translocations into the switch region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene (chromosome 14q32) in MM, often heralds transformation to more aggressive disease. Since the combined effects of CD40 plus interleukin-4 (IL-4) mediate IgH isotype class switch recombination (CSR), and this process involves DNA double strand break repair (DSBR), we hypothesized that CD40 and/or IL-4 activation of MM cells could induce abnormal DNA DSBR and lead to genomic instability and clonal evolution. In this study, we show that MM cell lines that are optimally triggered via CD40 and/or IL-4 demonstrate abnormal decoupling of IL-4 signal transduction from CD40. Specifically, CD40 alone was sufficient to trigger maximal growth of tumor cells. We further demonstrate that CD40 triggering induced both DNA DSBs as well as newly acquired karyotypic abnormalities in MM cell lines. Importantly, these observations were accompanied by induction of activation induced cytidine deaminase expression, but not gross apoptosis. These data support the role of abnormal CD40 signal transduction in mediating genomic instability, suggesting a role for the CD40 pathway and intermediates in myelomagenesis and clonal evolution in vivo.","['Hwang, W Y K', 'Gullo, C A', 'Shen, J', 'Poh, C K', 'Tham, S C', 'Cow, G', 'Au, M', 'Chan, E W E', 'Teoh, G']","['Hwang WY', 'Gullo CA', 'Shen J', 'Poh CK', 'Tham SC', 'Cow G', 'Au M', 'Chan EW', 'Teoh G']","['Multiple Myeloma Research Laboratory (MMRL), Singapore Health Services (SingHealth) Research Facilities, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytidine Deaminase/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/drug effects/genetics/*immunology', 'Interleukin-4/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/02/03 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404099 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404099 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Apr;20(4):715-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404099.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One-hundred-one patients (62.3%) achieved a CyR prior to HSCT. Survival probabilities were higher in patients, who achieved any CyR prior to HSCT than in patients without CyR (63.6 vs 49.2%: P = 0.019). Survival probabilities in patients, who achieved a major CyR were better than in patients with minimal and minor CyR or in patients with no CyR (69.4 vs 58.8% vs 49.2%: P = 0.040).

In this study, we demonstrate that NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in various HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and ATL-derived cell lines irrespectively of Tax expression as evidenced by the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and p65 subunit of NF-kappaB, activation of NF-kappaB DNA binding, and upregulation of various target genes including bcl-xL, bcl-2, XIAP, c-IAP1, survivin, cyclinD1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.

We found that ACHP could inhibit the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and p65, as well as NF-kappaB DNA-binding, associated with downregulation of the NF-kappaB target genes and induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis in these cells. When Tax-active and Tax-inactive cell lines were compared, ACHP could preferentially inhibit cell growth of Tax-active cells. Moreover, ACHP exhibited strong apoptosis-inducing activity in fresh ATL cells. These findings indicate that ACHP and its derivatives are effective in inducing ATL cell death and thus feasible candidates for the treatment of ATL.","['Sanda, T', 'Asamitsu, K', 'Ogura, H', 'Iida, S', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Ueda, R', 'Okamoto, T']","['Sanda T', 'Asamitsu K', 'Ogura H', 'Iida S', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Ueda R', 'Okamoto T']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (2-amino-6-(2-(cyclopropylmethoxy)-6-hydroxyphenyl)-4-piperidin-4-yl', 'nicotinonitrile)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nicotinic Acids)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/virology', 'Nicotinic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Subunits/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/virology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2006/02/03 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404129 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404129 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Apr;20(4):590-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404129.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the maintenance of pluripotency and undifferentiated propagation of embryonic stem (ES) cells in vitro requires tight cell to cell contacts and effective intercellular signaling, we hypothesize that MV derived from ES cells (ES-MV) express stem cell-specific molecules that may also support self-renewal and expansion of adult stem cells. To address this hypothesis, we employed expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) as a model. We found that ES-MV (10 microg/ml) isolated from murine ES cells (ES-D3) in serum-free cultures significantly (i) enhanced survival and improved expansion of murine HPC, (ii) upregulated the expression of early pluripotent (Oct-4, Nanog and Rex-1) and early hematopoietic stem cells (Scl, HoxB4 and GATA 2) markers in these cells, and (iii) induced phosphorylation of MAPK p42/44 and serine-threonine kinase AKT. Furthermore, molecular analysis revealed that ES-MV express Wnt-3 protein and are selectively highly enriched in mRNA for several pluripotent transcription factors as compared to parental ES cells. More important, this mRNA could be delivered by ES-MV to target cells and translated into the corresponding proteins. The biological effects of ES-MV were inhibited after heat inactivation or pretreatment with RNAse, indicating a major involvement of protein and mRNA components of ES-MV in the observed phenomena. We postulate that ES-MV may efficiently expand HPC by stimulating them with ES-MV expressed ligands (e.g., Wnt-3) as well as increase their pluripotency after horizontal transfer of ES-derived mRNA.","['Ratajczak, J', 'Miekus, K', 'Kucia, M', 'Zhang, J', 'Reca, R', 'Dvorak, P', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Ratajczak J', 'Miekus K', 'Kucia M', 'Zhang J', 'Reca R', 'Dvorak P', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Biology Program, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WNT3 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt3 Protein)', '0 (Wnt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/metabolism', 'Biological Transport/genetics', 'Cell Communication/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Structures/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'Wnt3 Protein']",2006/02/03 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404132 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404132 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 May;20(5):847-56. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404132.,['R01 CA106281-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2006 May;20(5):767-9.

LIF transcripts are expressed in the uterus in a biphasic manner: LIF is expressed in the gland on the morning of day 4 and again in stromal cells surrounding the blastocyst with the onset of implantation in the evening of day 4 of pregnancy. However, it is not yet clear whether both phases of LIF expression are required for implantation, since the receptor usage by uterine LIF still remains elusive. Here we have provided evidence that major cell types expressing theLIF receptor (LIFR) and its signal transducing partner gp130 are mostly disparate in the mouse uterus during the glandular LIF expression in the morning of day 4. In contrast, LIFR and gp130 expressions overlap in the luminal epithelium at the time of blastocyst attachment on the evening of day 4 when the second phase of LIF expression occurs in stromal cells surrounding the blastocyst, suggesting that LIF participates in implantation in a paracrine manner. Similar expression patterns for LIFR and gp130 were observed when a delayed implantation model was used. For example, a transient overlapping expression of LIFR and gp130 was evident at 12 h after estrogen-induced termination of delayed implantation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that LIFR and gp130 form heterodimers and are available for LIF signaling at the time of blastocyst attachment. We have also shown that an intra-peritoneal administration of recombinant LIF in LIF-deficient pregnant mice on the evening of day 4, close to the time when the second phase of LIF expression is normally observed, is sufficient to rescue implantation failure, and that there is no evidence of antagonistic action by soluble forms of the receptors. Collectively, our results have provided evidence that LIFR and gp130 form a functional heterodimer in the uterus during the attachment reaction to direct LIF signaling.","['Song, Haengseok', 'Lim, Hyunjung']","['Song H', 'Lim H']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Obstetrics and Gynecology.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Embryo Implantation, Delayed', 'Female', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Situ Hybridization/methods', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",2006/02/03 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2006/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['131/2/341 [pii]', '10.1530/rep.1.00956 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2006 Feb;131(2):341-9. doi: 10.1530/rep.1.00956.,['HD40810/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated whether LIF treatment can reduce obesity in OVX mice. DESIGN: Eight-week-old female C57Bl/6 mice were OVX or sham-operated. The mice were treated with LIF, 30 microg/kg or PBS via daily i.p. injections for 15 days (n = 9-10). METHODS: Dual X-ray absorptiometry and computerized tomography. RESULTS: We found that LIF treatment of OVX mice caused a significant reduction in the weight of white fat depots (P = 0.017) and serum leptin levels (P = 0.011). LIF also caused a significant decrease in brown fat mass (P = 0.036). Treatment with LIF decreased thymus weight but did not affect crown-rump length, femur length, trabecular bone mineral density or the weight of several non-fat organs including the uterus.

Physical activity is also known to affect BMD. The aim was to study BMD and markers of bone turnover in a well-defined group of survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who had all reached final height as well as peak bone mass, taking both previous treatment and physical activity into consideration. DESIGN: All patients treated for ALL before the onset of puberty in the region of western Sweden, between 1973 and 1985, in first remission were included. Thirty-five out of forty-seven patients aged 20-32 years participated. Nineteen patients had received cranial radiotherapy, and the median follow-up time was 20 years. METHODS: BMD was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Serum concentrations of markers of bone turnover were analysed. Physical performance was measured using a performance exercise capacity stress test. RESULTS: BMD was slightly reduced in lumbar spine (-0.4 SD), but not in femoral neck or total body. BMD in femoral neck was correlated to physical performance and dose of corticosteroid, but no correlation was found with spontaneous growth hormone (GH) secretion. Markers of bone turnover were also correlated to physical performance, but not to GH secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Physical fitness seems to be the most important factor in developing and preserving normal bone mineral density in ALL patients. We propose that lifestyle education promoting physical activity is encouraged from an early point in time for these patients.","['Jarfelt, M', 'Fors, H', 'Lannering, B', 'Bjarnason, R']","['Jarfelt M', 'Fors H', 'Lannering B', 'Bjarnason R']","['Department of Paediatrics, Division of Haematology and Oncology, Sahlgrenska Academy of Goteborg University, Goteborg, Sweden. marianne.jarfelt@vgregion.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Procollagen)', '0 (collagen type I trimeric cross-linked peptide)', '0 (procollagen type I carboxy terminal peptide)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Bone Density/*physiology', 'Bone Remodeling/*physiology', 'Collagen Type I', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Activity/physiology', 'Osteocalcin/blood', 'Osteoporosis/blood/*etiology/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Peptides', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Procollagen/blood', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2006/02/03 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['154/2/303 [pii]', '10.1530/eje.1.02092 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 2006 Feb;154(2):303-9. doi: 10.1530/eje.1.02092.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Duplin knockout mice exhibit embryonic lethality at 5.5-em day, suggesting that Duplin has important roles other than as a negative regulator of the Wnt signal. To identify new roles of Duplin, the Duplin-binding proteins were screened. PIAS3, which is a SUMO E3 ligase and acts as an inhibitor of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3), was identified as a Duplin-binding protein. Duplin was sumoylated, but PIAS3 affected neither the sumoylation of Duplin nor its ability to inhibit Tcf-4 activity. Like PIAS3, Duplin suppressed the leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced STAT3 transcriptional activity. Duplin did not affect the LIF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation or nuclear localization of STAT3 but inhibited the formation of complex between STAT3 and DNA. Although STAT3 is not modified with SUMO, PIAS3 inhibited the STAT3 activity in a manner partially depending on its SUMO E3 ligase activity. Duplin suppressed the LIF-dependent STAT3 activity independently of sumoylation. These results demonstrate that Duplin inhibits not only Tcf-4 but also STAT3, suggesting that Duplin may act as a repressor for multiple transcriptional factors.","['Yamashina, Keitaro', 'Yamamoto, Hideki', 'Chayama, Kazuaki', 'Nakajima, Koichi', 'Kikuchi, Akira']","['Yamashina K', 'Yamamoto H', 'Chayama K', 'Nakajima K', 'Kikuchi A']","['Department of Biochemistry, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Hiroshima 734-8551, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (duplin protein, mouse)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/pharmacology/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/chemistry/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Wnt Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism']",2006/02/03 09:00,2007/01/06 09:00,['2006/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['139/2/305 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvj033 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2006 Feb;139(2):305-14. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvj033.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was aimed at (a) investigating the mechanism(s) of 1D09C3-induced cell death and (b) further exploring the therapeutic efficacy of 1D09C3 in nonobese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice. The chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line JVM-2 and the mantle cell lymphoma cell line GRANTA-519 were used. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane depolarization were measured by flow cytometry following cell incubation with dihydroethidium and TMRE, respectively. Western blot analysis was used to detect c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). NOD/SCID mice were used to investigate the activity of 1D09C3 in early- or advanced-stage tumor xenografts. In vitro, 1D09C3-induced cell death involves a cascade of events, including ROS increase, JNK activation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and AIF release from mitochondria. Inhibition of JNK activity significantly reduced 1D09C3-induced apoptosis, indicating that 1D09C3 activity involves activation of the kinase. In vivo, 1D09C3 induces long-term disease-free survival in a significant proportion of tumor-bearing mice treated at an early stage of disease. Treatment of mice bearing advanced-stage lymphoma results in a highly significant prolongation of survival. These data show that 1D09C3 (a) exerts a potent antitumor effect by activating ROS-dependent, JNK-driven cell death, (b) cures the great majority of mice treated at an early-stage of disease, and (c) significantly prolongs survival of mice with advanced-stage disease.","['Carlo-Stella, Carmelo', 'Di Nicola, Massimo', 'Turco, Maria Caterina', 'Cleris, Loredana', 'Lavazza, Cristiana', 'Longoni, Paolo', 'Milanesi, Marco', 'Magni, Michele', 'Ammirante, Massimo', 'Leone, Arturo', 'Nagy, Zoltan', 'Gioffre, Walter R', 'Formelli, Franca', 'Gianni, Alessandro M']","['Carlo-Stella C', 'Di Nicola M', 'Turco MC', 'Cleris L', 'Lavazza C', 'Longoni P', 'Milanesi M', 'Magni M', 'Ammirante M', 'Leone A', 'Nagy Z', 'Gioffre WR', 'Formelli F', 'Gianni AM']","['Cristina Gandini Medical Oncology Unit, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Via Venezian 1, 20133 Milan, Italy. carmelo.carlostella@unimi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2006/02/03 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2006/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/3/1799 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1200 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Feb 1;66(3):1799-808. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), dmin are observed in approximately 1% of the cases. Most of them consist of an amplified segment from chromosome band 8q24, always including the MYC gene. Besides this information, little is known about their internal structure. We have characterized in detail the genomic organization of 32 AML and two MDS cases with MYC-containing dmin. The minimally amplified region was shown to be 4.26 Mb in size, harboring five known genes, with the proximal and the distal amplicon breakpoints clustering in two regions of approximately 500 and 600 kb, respectively. Interestingly, in 23 (68%) of the studied cases, the amplified region was deleted in one of the chromosome 8 homologs at 8q24, suggesting excision of a DNA segment from the original chromosomal location according to the 'episome model'. In one case, sequencing of both the dmin and del(8q) junctions was achieved and provided definitive evidence in favor of the episome model for the formation of dmin. Expression status of the TRIB1 and MYC genes, encompassed by the minimally amplified region, was assessed by northern blot analysis. The TRIB1 gene was found over-expressed in only a subset of the AML/MDS cases, whereas MYC, contrary to expectations, was always silent. The present study, therefore, strongly suggests that MYC is not the target gene of the 8q24 amplifications.","['Storlazzi, Clelia Tiziana', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Surace, Cecilia', 'Lonoce, Angelo', 'Mastrorilli, Angela', 'Strombeck, Bodil', ""D'Addabbo, Pietro"", 'Iacovelli, Francesco', 'Minervini, Crescenzio', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Jotterand, Martine', 'Muhlematter, Dominique', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Smith, Arabella', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Van Roy, Nadine', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Rocchi, Mariano']","['Storlazzi CT', 'Fioretos T', 'Surace C', 'Lonoce A', 'Mastrorilli A', 'Strombeck B', ""D'Addabbo P"", 'Iacovelli F', 'Minervini C', 'Aventin A', 'Dastugue N', 'Fonatsch C', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Jotterand M', 'Muhlematter D', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Schoch C', 'Slovak ML', 'Smith A', 'Sole F', 'Van Roy N', 'Johansson B', 'Rocchi M']","['Department of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Bari, Via Amendola 165/A, 70126 Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (TRIB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Female', '*Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Plasmids/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion']",2006/02/03 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2006/02/03 09:00'],"['2006/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['ddl010 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddl010 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2006 Mar 15;15(6):933-42. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddl010.

Another important stability indicator is the frequency with which a given gene is selected across subsamples. We have conducted studies to assess stability and some other properties of several gene selection procedures with biological and simulated data. RESULTS: Using resampling techniques we have found that some genes are selected much less frequently (across sub-samples) than other genes with the same adjusted p-values. The extent to which this type of instability manifests itself can be assessed by a method introduced in this paper. The effect of correlation between gene expression levels on the performance of multiple testing procedures is studied by computer simulations. CONCLUSION: Resampling represents a tool for reducing the set of initially selected genes to those with a sufficiently high selection frequency. Using resampling techniques it is also possible to assess variability of different performance indicators. Stability properties of several multiple testing procedures are described at length in the present paper.,"['Qiu, Xing', 'Xiao, Yuanhui', 'Gordon, Alexander', 'Yakovlev, Andrei']","['Qiu X', 'Xiao Y', 'Gordon A', 'Yakovlev A']","['Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, University of Rochester, 601 Elmwood Avenue, Rochester, New York 14642, USA. xqiu@bst.rochester.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/02/03 09:00,2006/04/12 09:00,['2006/02/03 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-7-50 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-7-50 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2006 Feb 1;7:50. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-7-50.,"['R01 GM075299/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM075299/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1403808,20060201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A population-based cohort design was used, and all patients aged > or = 15 years with an incident haematological malignancy who were living in North Jutland County, Denmark, during 1992-2002 were included in the study. Among 1666 patients with an incident haematological malignancy, 358 (21%) suffered an episode of bacteraemia during a median follow-up period of 1.1 years (quartile 0.2-3.4) from the date of cancer diagnosis (overall incidence rate of 96/1000 person-years). In comparison to Hodgkin's disease, adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were 23.3 (95% CI, 10.0-54.5) for acute myeloid leukaemia, 3.8 (95% CI, 1.5-9.3) for multiple myeloma, and 2.2 (95% CI, 0.9-5.1) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphatic leukaemia. Overall cumulative 30-day mortality was 32% (95% CI, 27-37), and 90-day mortality was 50% (95% CI, 44-55). In comparison with acute myeloid leukaemia, adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRRs) were close to 1.0 for other haematological malignancies. In comparison to bacteraemia caused by Gram-positive bacteria, adjusted MRRs were 1.0 (95% CI, 0.6-1.5) for Gram-negative bacteraemia, and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.1-3.3) for polymicrobial bacteraemia or fungaemia. Thus, the risk of bacteraemia varied greatly according to the type of malignancy, while mortality rates were similar for these diseases, although dependent on the type of bacteraemia.

However, drug resistance and cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines limit their clinical application. We hypothesize that direct modifications of the sugar moiety of anthracyclines avert P-glycoprotein (P-gp) recognition and efflux, increase drug intracellular concentration in cancer cells, and thus overcome P-gp-mediated drug resistance. Daunorubicin (DNR) analogues with sugar modifications were synthesized by directly transforming the amino group of DNR to an azido group or triazole group. Molecular docking showed that the lead compound (3'-azidodaunorubicin, ADNR) averts P-gp binding, while daunorubicin (DNR) extensively interacts with multidrug-resistance (MDR) protein through H-bonds and electrostatic interactions. FACS assay demonstrated that these new compounds abolished P-gp drug efflux and accumulated high intracellular concentration in the drug-resistant leukemia K562/Dox. P-gp inhibition by CsA confirmed that these new analogues are no longer P-gp substrates. ADNR exhibited potent anticancer activity in both drug-sensitive (K562) and drug-resistant leukemia cells (K562/Dox), with a 25-fold lower drug resistance index than DNR. An in vivo xenograft model demonstrated that ADNR showed more than 2.5-fold higher maximum growth inhibition rate against drug-resistant cancers and significant improvement for animal survival rate versus DNR.

Patients had strong preferences about continuity and language use. Displays of empathy were important, but must be genuine. Patients wanted to know about likely emotional reactions and future support. Where patients brought a companion, they found this valuable. Patients concur with much of the content of the guidelines, but place more emphasis on their illness journey, the doctor's ability to adapt to their emotional needs, language used, information leaflets, having a companion and genuinely personalizing the approach.

Little is known about its causes, although its early age at diagnosis has focused interest on maternal and perinatal factors. We have previously observed a protective effect of maternal folate supplementation during pregnancy against ALL, and a number of studies have reported protective effects of some common polymorphisms of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. One study has suggested that the effect of MTHFR polymorphisms on risk of ALL may depend on folate status. This study aimed to look for evidence of an interaction between maternal folate supplementation and child's genotype among the cases from our previous study. Bone marrow specimens from 82 of 83 case children were available. DNA was extracted and genotyped for MTHFR C677T and A1298C using standard techniques. We used a case-only analysis to estimate the case-only odds ratio (COR) for MTHFR genotype and folate supplementation in association with ALL. None of the CORs indicated a significant departure from a multiplicative model. Adjustment for sex, age or genotype at the other locus had little effect on the results. Other studies of this gene and environment interaction in ALL and other cancers have produced contradictory results, perhaps because of varying definitions of folate exposure. Further research into the interaction of folate intake and genotype in causing ALL and other cancers is needed. We are specifically studying it in an Australian national case-control study of genetic and environmental causes of ALL.","['Milne, Elizabeth', 'de Klerk, Nicholas H', 'van Bockxmeer, Frank', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Thompson, Judith R', 'Baker, David', 'Armstrong, Bruce K']","['Milne E', 'de Klerk NH', 'van Bockxmeer F', 'Kees UR', 'Thompson JR', 'Baker D', 'Armstrong BK']","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, The University of Western Australia, WA, Australia. lizm@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cysteine', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Mothers', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Pregnancy', 'Threonine']",2006/02/02 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2006/02/02 09:00'],"['2006/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21803 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Jul 1;119(1):229-32. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21803.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a novel t(9;11;19)(p22;q23;p13.3) disrupting MLL in an infant AML patient. The 5' end of MLL fused to chromosome 9 sequences on the der(11), whereas the 3' end was translocated to chromosome 19. We developed long-distance inverse-polymerase chain reaction assays to investigate the localization of the breakpoints on der(11) and der(19). We found that intron 5 of MLL was fused to intron 5 of MLLT3 at the der(11) genomic breakpoint, resulting in a novel in-frame MLL exon 5-MLLT3 exon 6 fusion transcript. On the der(19), a novel gene annotated as FLJ10374 was disrupted by the breakpoint. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, we showed that FLJ10374 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells. Transfection of the FLJ10374 protein in different cell lines revealed that it localized exclusively to the nucleus. In serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells, the expression of FLJ10374 decreased the rate of the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle, whereas the suppression of FLJ10374 through short interfering RNA increased cell proliferation. These results indicate that FLJ10374 negatively regulates cell cycle progression and proliferation. Thus, a single chromosomal rearrangement resulting in formation of the MLL-MLLT3 fusion gene and haplo-insufficiency of FLJ10374 may have cooperated to promote leukemogenesis in AML with t(9;11;19).","['Vieira, Luis', 'Sousa, Ana C', 'Matos, Paulo', 'Marques, Barbara', 'Alaiz, Helena', 'Ribeiro, Maria J', 'Braga, Paula', 'da Silva, Maria G', 'Jordan, Peter']","['Vieira L', 'Sousa AC', 'Matos P', 'Marques B', 'Alaiz H', 'Ribeiro MJ', 'Braga P', 'da Silva MG', 'Jordan P']","['Centro de Genetica Humana, Instituto Nacional de Saude Dr. Ricardo Jorge, Lisboa, Portugal. luis.vieira@insa.min-saude.pt']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA', 'Exons', 'Female', '*Genes, cdc', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2006/02/02 09:00,2006/05/31 09:00,['2006/02/02 09:00'],"['2006/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20311 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 May;45(5):455-69. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20311.,,,,,,,,,,"['2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc']",,,,,,,,,,

Due to advances in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and particularly the advent of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), the scope of transplantation has now extended to those patients previously ineligible due to age and health restrictions and has been associated with a decrease in transplant related mortality. The apparent graft versus leukaemia (GvL) effect observed following HSCT demonstrates the potential of the immune system to target and eradicate AML cells. Building on previously published pre-clinical studies by ourselves and others, we are now initiating a Phase I clinical study in which lentiviral vectors are used to genetically modify AML cells to express B7.1 (CD80) and IL-2. By combining allogeneic HSCT with immunisation, using the autologous AML cells expressing B7.1 and IL-2, we hope to stimulate immune eradication of residual AML cells in poor prognosis patients that have achieved donor chimerism. In this report we describe the background to cell therapy based approaches for AML, and discuss difficulties associated with the deployment of a chronically stimulated, hence exhausted/depleted immune system to eradicate tumour cells that have already escaped immune surveillance.","['Chan, Lucas', 'Hardwick, Nicola R', 'Guinn, Barbara-ann', 'Darling, Dave', 'Gaken, Joop', 'Galea-Lauri, Joanna', 'Ho, Aloysius Y', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Farzaneh, Farzin']","['Chan L', 'Hardwick NR', 'Guinn BA', 'Darling D', 'Gaken J', 'Galea-Lauri J', 'Ho AY', 'Mufti GJ', 'Farzaneh F']","[""King's College London, Department of Haematological Molecular Medicine, The Rayne Institute, 123 Coldharbour Lane, SE5 9NU, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/*therapy', 'Tumor Escape/immunology']",2006/02/02 09:00,2006/12/30 09:00,['2006/02/02 09:00'],"['2005/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-006-0129-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2006 Aug;55(8):1017-24. doi: 10.1007/s00262-006-0129-7.

Abnormality of this apparatus is known to cause multinuclei formation, a hallmark of chromosomal instability (CIN). A549, aneuploid cell line, aberrantly passed through the mitotic phase and became multinuclei morphology in the presence of nocodazole. Time-lapse videomicroscopy showed unreported bizarre morphology, which we named 'mitotic lobulation' in A549 cells just before the exit from mitosis and multinuclei formation. External expression of wild-type Bub1-EGFP clearly suppressed the multinuclei formation by retaining A549 cells at the mitotic phase during 48 h of time-lapse observation. This suppressive effect on mitotic aberrancy should not be mere restoration of normal Bub1 function, because A549 cells express proper amount of Bub1, which distributed cytoplasm during interphase and concentrated at kinetochore in metaphase. Furthermore, external expression of wild-type Bub1-EGFP suppressed multinuclei formation induced by Tax both in A549 and HeLa cells. Tax is known to induce mitotic abnormality by binding and inactivating Mad1. These observations, therefore, suggest functional redundancy between Bub1 and other mitotic checkpoint protein(s) and a possibility of correction of mitotic aberrancy by external Bub1 expression.","['Sasaki, M', 'Sugimoto, K', 'Tamayose, K', 'Ando, M', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Oshimi, K']","['Sasaki M', 'Sugimoto K', 'Tamayose K', 'Ando M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Oshimi K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins)', '0 (mad1 protein, S pombe)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BUB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bub1 spindle checkpoint protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, pX/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Kinetochores/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Video/methods', 'Mitosis/genetics', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Spindle Apparatus/drug effects/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/02/02 09:00,2006/08/09 09:00,['2006/02/02 09:00'],"['2006/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209404 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209404 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Jun 22;25(26):3621-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209404.

To identify downstream mediators of RA signaling, we used retrovirus-mediated insertion mutagenesis in PLB985 leukemia cells and established the RA-resistant cell line WY-1. In PLB985, but not WY-1 cells, RA induced TRAIL and its DR4 and DR5 receptors. Knocking down TRAIL expression by RNA interference blocked RA-induced apoptosis. WY-1 cells are defective for RA-induced differentiation, G1 arrest and exhibit co-resistance to TRAIL. In WY-1 cells, a single virus copy is integrated into a novel RA-regulated gene termed RAM (retinoic acid modulator). RAM is expressed in the myelomonocytic lineage and extinguished by RA in PLB985, but not WY-1 cells. Whereas knocking down RAM expression by RNA interference promoted RA-induced differentiation and TRAIL-triggered apoptosis of PLB985 and WY-1 cells, overexpression of the predicted 109 amino-acid RAM open reading frame did not alter RA signaling in PLB985 cells. This indicates that, apart from encoding the putative RAM protein, RAM RNA may exert additional functions that are impaired by the retrovirus insertion. Our study demonstrates that RA induction of the TRAIL pathway is also operative in leukemia cells lacking an RARalpha oncofusion protein and identifies RAM as a novel RA-dependent modulator of myeloid differentiation and death.","['Yin, W', 'Rossin, A', 'Clifford, J L', 'Gronemeyer, H']","['Yin W', 'Rossin A', 'Clifford JL', 'Gronemeyer H']","['Department of Cell Biology and Signal Transduction, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, IGBMC/CNRS/INSERM/ULP, Illkirch Cedex, C U de Strasbourg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (long noncoding RNA CCDC26, human)', '0 (rab27 GTP-Binding Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.6.1.-.

SAP25 is required for mSin3A-mediated, but not N-CoR-mediated, repression. SAP25 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, actively exported from the nucleus by a CRM1-dependent mechanism. A fraction of SAP25 is located in promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies, and PML induces a striking nuclear accumulation of SAP25. An isotope-coded affinity tag quantitative proteomic analysis of the SAP25 complex revealed that SAP25 is associated with several components of the mSin3 complex, nuclear export machinery, and regulators of transcription and cell cycle.

All 84 samples positive on PCR had detectable CLL cells by qPCR and flow cytometry. A good correlation was seen between MRD levels by flow cytometry and by qPCR (n = 254; r = 0.826; P < .001). Fifteen of 25 patients receiving autografts suffered a relapse, with increasing levels of MRD being observed before relapse in all of them. MRD detection within the first 6 months after autologous transplantation identified patients with a high relapse risk. In contrast, in allografted patients (n = 15) MRD did not correlate with outcome. In conclusion, quantitative methods to assess MRD (flow cytometry and qPCR) are more accurate than consensus PCR to predict clinical evolution.

Current models propose that ICN functions by suppressing E2A through a pre-T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent mechanism. Here we show that lymphomas arising in E2A(-/-) mice require the activation of Notch1 for their survival and have accumulated mutations in, or near, the Notch1 PEST domain, resulting in increased stability and signaling. In contrast, lymphomas arising in p53(-/-) mice show the activation of Notch1, but no mutations were identified in ICN. The requirement for Notch1 signaling in E2A(-/-) lymphomas cannot be overcome by ectopic expression of pTalpha; however, pTalpha is required for optimal survival and expansion of these cells. Our findings indicate that the activation of Notch1 is an important ""second hit"" for the transformation of E2A(-/-) T cell lymphomas and that Notch1 promotes survival through pre-TCR-dependent and -independent mechanisms.","['Reschly, Erica J', 'Spaulding, Christina', 'Vilimas, Tomas', 'Graham, W Vallen', 'Brumbaugh, Rachel L', 'Aifantis, Iannis', 'Pear, Warren S', 'Kee, Barbara L']","['Reschly EJ', 'Spaulding C', 'Vilimas T', 'Graham WV', 'Brumbaugh RL', 'Aifantis I', 'Pear WS', 'Kee BL']","['Department of Pathology, MC1089, The University of Chicago, 5841 S.

Our results showed that CML derived MSCs are similar to normal MSCs in phenotype, morphology and multi-differentiation capacity. Moreover, CML derived MSCs did not express BCR/ABL gene and Ph chromosome, and had not the ability to development tumor in nude mice. At last, they could express hematopoietic cytokines, and possessed hematopoietic supportive ability.

Therefore, if the oncogene or set of oncogenes contributing maximally to a tumor cell's survival can be identified, such oncogene(s) are the most appropriate target(s) for maximizing tumor cell kill. METHODS AND RESULTS: A mathematical model is presented that describes cellular phenotypic entropy as a function of cellular proliferation and/or survival, and states of transformation and differentiation. Oncogenes become part of the cellular machinery, block apoptosis and differentiation or promote proliferation and give rise to new states of cellular transformation. Our model gives a quantitative assessment of the amount of cellular death or growth inhibition that result from the ablation of an oncogene's protein product. We review data from studies of chronic myelogenous leukemia and K562 cells to illustrate these principles. CONCLUSION: The model discussed in this paper has implications for oncogene-directed therapies and their use in combination with other therapeutic modalities.","['Alfano, Francis D']",['Alfano FD'],"['The Harold Leever Cancer Center, 1075 Chase Parkway, Waterbury, Connecticut 06708, USA. fralfano@aol.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Theor Biol Med Model,Theoretical biology & medical modelling,101224383,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogenes/*genetics/*physiology', 'Stochastic Processes']",2006/02/02 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2006/02/02 09:00'],"['2005/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4682-3-5 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4682-3-5 [doi]']",epublish,Theor Biol Med Model. 2006 Jan 31;3:5. doi: 10.1186/1742-4682-3-5.,,,,PMC1373613,20060131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the development of lymphocytes bearing receptors with unique specificities requires the generation of programmed double strand breaks (DSBs) coupled with bursts of proliferation, rendering lymphocytes susceptible to mutations contributing to oncogenic transformation. Consequently, mechanisms responsible for monitoring global genomic integrity must be activated during lymphocyte development to limit the oncogenic potential of antigen receptor locus recombination.

Here, we review recent evidence providing insight into the mechanisms by which ATM promotes normal lymphocyte development and protects from neoplastic transformation.","['Matei, Irina R', 'Guidos, Cynthia J', 'Danska, Jayne S']","['Matei IR', 'Guidos CJ', 'Danska JS']","['Program in Developmental Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/enzymology/genetics/immunology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA/genetics', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/enzymology', 'Lymphopoiesis/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*enzymology/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'VDJ Recombinases']",2006/02/02 09:00,2006/09/15 09:00,['2006/02/02 09:00'],"['2006/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['IMR361 [pii]', '10.1111/j.0105-2896.2006.00361.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2006 Feb;209:142-58. doi: 10.1111/j.0105-2896.2006.00361.x.,,157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tissue protective actions of melatonin are attributed to its antioxidant activity though, under certain conditions, melatonin might also exert oxidant effects, particularly in cancer cells. This study evaluated the effects of 10(-5) and 10(-3) m concentrations of melatonin on human leukemia cells. Moderate cytotoxic effects of melatonin at 10(-3) m concentrations were observed in CMK, Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells which was associated with significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Melatonin treatment was not associated with significant cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells, although the generation of ROS was significantly increased. K562 and Daudi cells did not appear to be effected by melatonin treatment. Cellular membrane lipid peroxidation was not influenced by melatonin with the exception of CMK cells. Cell cycle kinetics were not affected in melatonin-treated samples, again with the exception of CMK cells which showed increased apoptosis. Melatonin, therefore, induces the production of ROS that may be associated with cytotoxicity depending on the concentration of melatonin in some leukemia cells and does not appear to stimulate leukemia cell growth. These pro-oxidant actions of melatonin may assist in limiting leukemic cell growth.","['Buyukavci, Mustafa', 'Ozdemir, Oner', 'Buck, Steven', 'Stout, Mark', 'Ravindranath, Yaddanapudi', 'Savasan, Sureyya']","['Buyukavci M', 'Ozdemir O', 'Buck S', 'Stout M', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Savasan S']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Fundam Clin Pharmacol,Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,8710411,"['0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Melatonin/*toxicity', 'Oxidants/*toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",2006/02/02 09:00,2006/07/18 09:00,['2006/02/02 09:00'],"['2006/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['FCP389 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1472-8206.2005.00389.x [doi]']",ppublish,Fundam Clin Pharmacol. 2006 Feb;20(1):73-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1472-8206.2005.00389.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional survey. ANIMALS: 18,038 cats tested at 345 veterinary clinics (n=9,970) and 145 animal shelters (8,068) between August and November 2004. PROCEDURE: Cats were tested with a point-of-care ELISA for FeLV antigen and FIV antibody. A multivariable random effects logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors significantly associated with seropositivity while accounting for clinic-to-clinic (or shelter) variability. RESULTS: 409 (2.3%) cats were seropositive for FeLV antigen, and 446 (2.5%) cats were seropositive for FIV antibody; 58 (0.3%) cats were seropositive for infection with both viruses. Multivariable analysis indicated that age, sex, health status, and cat lifestyle and source were significantly associated with risk of seropositivity, with adults more likely to be seropositive than juveniles (adjusted odds ratios [ORs], 2.5 and 2.05 for FeLV and FIV seropositivity, respectively), sexually intact adult males more likely to be seropositive than sexually intact adult females (adjusted ORs, 2.4 and 4.66), and outdoor cats that were sick at the time of testing more likely to be seropositive than healthy indoor cats (adjusted ORs, 8.89 and 11.3). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that certain characteristics, such as age, sex, health status, and lifestyle, are associated with risk of FeLV and FIV seropositivity among cats in North America. However, cats in all categories were found to be at risk for infection, and current guidelines to test all cats at the time of acquisition and again during illness should be followed.","['Levy, Julie K', 'Scott, H Morgan', 'Lachtara, Jessica L', 'Crawford, P Cynda']","['Levy JK', 'Scott HM', 'Lachtara JL', 'Crawford PC']","['Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610-0126, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animal Husbandry/methods', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cats', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods/veterinary', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Feline/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'North America/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Sex Factors']",2006/02/02 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/02/02 09:00'],"['2006/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/javma.228.3.371 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2006 Feb 1;228(3):371-6. doi: 10.2460/javma.228.3.371.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Removal of LIF, reduced levels of fetal calf serum (FCS), and addition of retinoic acid all induced embryonic stem cell differentiation as measured by reduced Oct 4 expression. Lower levels of retinoic acid (0.1-10 nM) promoted the formation of epithelial-like cells, whereas higher levels (100-10,000 nM) favored differentiation into fibroblastic-like cells. The effects of dbcAMP varied with the presence or absence of FCS and LIF and the concentration of dbcAMP. In FCS-containing media, a low level of dbcAMP (100 microM) increased self-renewal in the absence of LIF, but it had no effect in its presence. In contrast, at higher concentrations (1,000 microM dbcAMP), regardless of LIF, differentiation was promoted. A similar effect of dbcAMP was seen in the presence of retinoic acid. In media without FCS but with serum replacement supplements, there was no effect of dbcAMP. This study shows that the Oct 4 expression system of IOUD2 cells provides a novel, simple method for quantifying cellular differentiation.","['Faherty, S', 'Kane, M T', 'Quinlan, L R']","['Faherty S', 'Kane MT', 'Quinlan LR']","['Department of Physiology, National University of Ireland, Galway, University Road, Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

These cells were allowed to endocytose fluorescein tetramethylrhodamine dextran (FRD), a ratiometric probe that has fluorescein as a pH-dependent fluorophore and tetramethylrhodamine as a pH-independent fluorophore. Isolated organelle fractions from these cells were then subjected to capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF) analysis. The detection of individual organelle fluorescence at two different wavelengths, selected on the basis of the emission range of the FRD probe, gives a fluorescence intensity ratio used to calculate the pH from a calibration curve. This curve was constructed from CE-LIF measurements of individual liposomes loaded with several pH buffer standards. The respective median pH values are 5.1 +/- 0.2 in CEM/C2 cells and 6.1 +/- 0.4 in CCRF-CEM cells. These measurements compare well with pixel-based epifluorescence microscopy measurements of whole cells where the corresponding average pH values are 5.0 +/- 0.6 (n = 15) and 6.2 +/- 0.7 (n = 15). A pH comparison between the two cell types suggests that the lower pH in the CEM/C2 cells may be relevant to the protonation and sequestration of weak base anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin. The determination of the pH of individual vesicles, liposomes, and acidic organelles is a new resource for measuring and investigating the role of the acid-base properties of subcellular-size compartments.","['Chen, Yun', 'Arriaga, Edgar A']","['Chen Y', 'Arriaga EA']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary/methods', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lasers', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Organelles/*chemistry', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/02/02 09:00,2007/04/12 09:00,['2006/02/02 09:00'],"['2006/02/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ac051513x [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2006 Feb 1;78(3):820-6. doi: 10.1021/ac051513x.,"['1K02-AG21453/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM61969/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The normal sinus rhythm was restored 15 days thereafter, and the patient eventually reached remission.

PML remains unusual although there is a high prevalence of JCV among the population and immunosuppression is not rare because of chemotherapies. METHODS: We present two groups of patients: first, we studied reports of three patients suffering from lymphoma type B who developed a PML, proved by cerebral biopsy. The second group included six HIV-infected patients who developed a PML. No biopsy was made but MRI and the physical examination suggested strong arguments for the diagnosis. RESULTS: In the first group, PML was furthered by humoral immunosuppression (rate of immunoglobulin G under 4 g/l). Average survival was five months. In the second group, HIV-infected patients had a survival range from 2 to 58 months after the first PML symptoms and one of them is still alive. CONCLUSION: Humoral immunosuppression in lymphoma can contribute to the development of PML. PML prognosis is often severe but prolonged survivals were described. So it is necessary to restore a sufficient immunity level. But immunity failure may be insufficient to lead to PML. In the case of lymphomas, the role of malignant lymphocytes in multiplication and mutation of JCV might be an interesting pathophysiological hypothesis.","['Malkoun, I', 'Vidry, E', 'Revenco, E', 'Drobacheff, M-C', 'Berger, E', 'Rumbach, L']","['Malkoun I', 'Vidry E', 'Revenco E', 'Drobacheff MC', 'Berger E', 'Rumbach L']","['Service de Neurologie, Centre Hospitalier de Belfort-Montbeliard. imalkoun@ch-belfort-montbeliard.rss.fr']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Neurol (Paris),Revue neurologique,2984779R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Agammaglobulinemia/etiology', 'Aged', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/complications/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'JC Virus/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/immunology', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/*etiology/mortality/virology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/complications/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Virus Activation/immunology']",2006/02/01 09:00,2006/05/04 09:00,['2006/02/01 09:00'],"['2006/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['MDOI-RN-01-2006-162-1-0035-3787-101019-200505580 [pii]', '10.1016/s0035-3787(06)74985-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Neurol (Paris). 2006 Jan;162(1):82-8. doi: 10.1016/s0035-3787(06)74985-2.,,,Role de l'immunite dans le developpement de la leucoencephalopathie multifocale progressive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that activation of FLT3 in human AML inhibits CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) function by ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation, which may explain the differentiation block of leukemic blasts. In MV4;11 cells, pharmacological inhibition of either FLT3 or MEK1 leads to granulocytic differentiation. Differentiation of MV4;11 cells was also observed when C/EBPalpha mutated at serine 21 to alanine (S21A) was stably expressed. In contrast, there was no effect when serine 21 was mutated to aspartate (S21D), which mimics phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha. Thus, our results suggest that therapies targeting the MEK/ERK cascade or development of protein therapies based on transduction of constitutively active C/EBPalpha may prove effective in treatment of FLT3 mutant leukemias resistant to the FLT3 inhibitor therapies.","['Radomska, Hanna S', 'Basseres, Daniela S', 'Zheng, Rui', 'Zhang, Pu', 'Dayaram, Tajhal', 'Yamamoto, Yukiya', 'Sternberg, David W', 'Lokker, Nathalie', 'Giese, Neill A', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Delmotte, Marie-Helene', 'Davis, Roger J', 'Small, Donald', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Radomska HS', 'Basseres DS', 'Zheng R', 'Zhang P', 'Dayaram T', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Sternberg DW', 'Lokker N', 'Giese NA', 'Bohlander SK', 'Schnittger S', 'Delmotte MH', 'Davis RJ', 'Small D', 'Hiddemann W', 'Gilliland DG', 'Tenen DG']","['Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'E1IO3ICJ9A (tandutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', '*Point Mutation', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2006/02/01 09:00,2006/04/04 09:00,['2006/02/01 09:00'],"['2006/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20052242 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20052242 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2006 Feb 20;203(2):371-81. doi: 10.1084/jem.20052242.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of all patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with imatinib were reviewed. We report the experience on 19 pregnancies involving 18 patients (10 females and eight males) who conceived while receiving imatinib for the treatment of CML. RESULTS: All female patients discontinued therapy immediately on recognition of pregnancy. Three pregnancies (involving two female patients and one male patient) ended in spontaneous abortion, and one patient had an elective abortion. All other pregnancies were uneventful. Two of the 16 babies had minor abnormalities at or shortly after birth (hypospadias in one baby and rotation of small intestine in one baby) that were surgically repaired. All babies have continued normal growth and development. Among female patients who interrupted therapy, five of nine in complete hematologic remission (CHR) at the time of treatment interruption eventually lost CHR, and six experienced an increase in Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases. At a median of 18 months after resuming therapy with imatinib, eight patients had a cytogenetic response (complete in three patients). CONCLUSION: Although there is no evidence that a brief exposure to imatinib during conception and pregnancy adversely affects the developing fetus, most patients lose their response after treatment interruption. Patients receiving imatinib should be advised to practice adequate contraception.","['Ault, Patricia', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Koller, Charles', 'Giles, Francis', 'Keating, Michael', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Ault P', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Faderl S', 'Beran M', 'Rios MB', 'Koller C', 'Giles F', 'Keating M', 'Talpaz M', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Teratogens)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous/chemically induced', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Congenital Abnormalities/etiology/surgery', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Metaphase', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', '*Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Teratogens']",2006/02/01 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2006/02/01 09:00'],"['2006/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.04.6557 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.04.6557 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Mar 1;24(7):1204-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.6557.

A connection between telomerase activity and resistance to apoptosis has been established. Telomerase, therefore, has been proposed to represent a novel and potentially selective target for cancer therapy. Several synthetic compounds have been developed in recent years with a view to inhibit telomerase activity with telomere shortening below a critical length resulting in apoptosis. Such compounds are always highly toxic. Many plant-derived products act through the induction of apoptosis as a mechanism to suppress carcinogenesis. Curcumin, a phenolic compound isolated from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa Linn., has been reported to possess anti-tumor, apoptotic and anti-angiogenic properties. Apoptosis has emerged as the major mechanism by which anti-tumor agents eliminate pre-neoplastic cells or cells progressed to malignancy. The present study was undertaken to examine the mechanism of curcumin-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cell line K-562 with particular emphasis on the role of curcumin on telomerase activity. Induction of apoptosis by curcumin is initiated by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, and evidenced by the increase in DNA content in the sub-G1 region as obtained from FACS analysis. Apoptosis is mediated by the activation of caspases 3 and 8, up-regulation of the apoptotic gene bax with concomitant down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2. Using TRAP assay it has been observed that curcumin inhibits telomerase activity in a dose and time-dependent manner, the inhibition being due to suppression of translocation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit, from cytosol to nucleus. Most significantly, the inhibition of telomerase activity by curcumin correlates with several parameters of apoptosis. The results suggest that telomerase status plays an important role in the induction of apoptosis in K-562 cells by curcumin.","['Chakraborty, Sutapa', 'Ghosh, Utpal', 'Bhattacharyya, N P', 'Bhattacharya, R K', 'Roy, Madhumita']","['Chakraborty S', 'Ghosh U', 'Bhattacharyya NP', 'Bhattacharya RK', 'Roy M']","['Environmental Carcinogenesis and Toxicology Department, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, 37, SP Mukherjee Road, Kolkata 700026, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/metabolism']",2006/02/01 09:00,2006/07/06 09:00,['2006/02/01 09:00'],"['2005/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0027-5107(05)00535-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2005.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2006 Apr 11;596(1-2):81-90. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2005.12.007.

The mechanism of As2O3-induced cell death has yet to be clarified, especially in solid cancers. In the present study, the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was examined as a cellular model for As2O3 treatment. The involvement of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was investigated in As2O3-induced cell death. 3. It was found that As2O3 activates the prosurvival mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells, which, conversely, may compromise the efficacy of As2O3. Hence, a combination treatment of As2O3 and MEK inhibitors was investigated to determine whether this treatment could lead to enhanced growth inhibition and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. 4. Inhibition of MEK/ERK with the pharmacological inhibitors U0126 (10 micromol/L) or PD98059 (20 micromol/L) together with As2O3 (2 and 5 micromol/L) resulted in a significant enhancement of growth inhibition in breast cancer MCF-7 cells as determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay and [Methyl-3H]-thymidine incorporation. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that combined treatment with As2O3 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 could augment breast cancer MCF-7 cell apoptosis approximately twofold compared with the effects of the two drugs alone, as determined by Hoechst 33258 or annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. 5. In addition, As2O3 activated p38 in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on JNK1/2. Treatment with a p38 inhibitor did not prevent As2O3-induced apoptosis. 6. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that enhanced apoptosis is detected in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in the presence of As2O3 and an MEK inhibitor, which may be a new promising adjuvant to current breast cancer treatments.","['Ye, Jian', 'Li, Aiping', 'Liu, Qizhan', 'Wang, Xinru', 'Zhou, Jianwei']","['Ye J', 'Li A', 'Liu Q', 'Wang X', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Toxicology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics and Applied Toxicology, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (U 0126)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics']",2006/02/01 09:00,2006/03/18 09:00,['2006/02/01 09:00'],"['2006/02/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['CEP4302 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1681.2005.04302.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 2005 Dec;32(12):1042-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1681.2005.04302.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Interactions between imatinib, and valproate have been examined in imatinib-sensitive and -resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)cell lines (K562, KCL-22, CML-T1) and in bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) derived from imatinib-resistant CML patients. RESULTS: In imatinib-sensitive cell lines, cotreatment with imatinib 0.5 muM and valproate 5 microM for 48 hours potently enhanced imatinib-induced growth arrest and apoptosis. In resistant cell lines and in primary MNCs derived from imatinib-rsistant patients, valproate restored sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of imatinib. Coexposure of cells to valproate and imatinib was associated with repression of several genes involved in Bcr-Abl transformation. In particular, the combination valproate-imatinib downregulated the expression of Bcr-Abl and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is particularly overexpressed in imatinib-resistant clones. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study suggested that administration of the clinically available HDAC inhibitor valproate may be a powerful strategy to enhance cytotoxic effects of imatinib in those patient resistant to imatinib or in which complete cytogenetic remission has been not reached.","['Morotti, Alessandro', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Messa, Francesca', 'Arruga, Francesca', 'Defilippi, Ilaria', 'Carturan, Sonia', 'Catalano, Renata', 'Rosso, Valentina', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Pilatrino, Chiara', 'Guerrasio, Angelo', 'Taulli, Riccardo', 'Bracco, Enrico', 'Pautasso, Marisa', 'Baraban, Daniela', 'Gottardi, Enrico', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Morotti A', 'Cilloni D', 'Messa F', 'Arruga F', 'Defilippi I', 'Carturan S', 'Catalano R', 'Rosso V', 'Chiarenza A', 'Pilatrino C', 'Guerrasio A', 'Taulli R', 'Bracco E', 'Pautasso M', 'Baraban D', 'Gottardi E', 'Saglio G']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. alessandromorotti@yahoo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",2006/01/31 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2006/01/31 09:00'],"['2006/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21725 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Mar 1;106(5):1188-96. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21725.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to examine the diagnostic and prognostic significance of elevated IGFBP-2 levels in children with AML after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at relapse and continuous complete remission (CCR). In 27 children with AML (mean age 13.6+/-5.3 years; patients in remission n=15 with relapse n=12) serum parameters of IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IGF-I and IGF-II were analyzed up to 18 months after HSCT by RIA. AML-patients with evidence of relapse demonstrated a continuous increase of IGFBP-2 levels during the follow-up. At day 100 after HSCT, IGFBP-2 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with relapse than in children without relapse (7.4+/-4.0 standard deviation score (SDS) vs 3.9+/-1.7 SDS; P=0.01). Serum IGFBP-2 was identified as an independent factor for the prediction of relapse.

Current AFM techniques for measuring elastic and viscoelastic properties of whole cells are based on indentation of cells firmly adhered to a substrate, but these techniques are not appropriate for probing nonadherent cells, such as passive human leukocytes, due to a lateral instability of the cells under load. Here we present a method for characterizing nonadherent cells with AFM by mechanically immobilizing them in microfabricated wells. We apply this technique to compare the deformability of human myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells and neutrophils at low deformation rates, and we find that the cells are well described by an elastic model based on Hertzian mechanics. Myeloid (HL60) cells were measured to be a factor of 18 times stiffer than lymphoid (Jurkat) cells and six times stiffer than human neutrophils on average (E(infinity) = 855 +/- 670 Pa for HL60 cells, E(infinity) = 48 +/- 35 Pa for Jurkat cells, E(infinity) = 156 +/- 87 for neutrophils, mean +/- SD). This work demonstrates a simple method for extending AFM mechanical property measurements to nonadherent cells and characterizes properties of human leukemia cells that may contribute to leukostasis, a complication associated with acute leukemia.","['Rosenbluth, Michael J', 'Lam, Wilbur A', 'Fletcher, Daniel A']","['Rosenbluth MJ', 'Lam WA', 'Fletcher DA']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of California Berkeley and University of California San Francisco/University of California Berkeley Joint Graduate Group in Bioengineering, Berkeley, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Elasticity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*pathology', 'Micromanipulation', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Models, Biological', 'Neutrophils/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*pathology', 'Viscosity']",2006/01/31 09:00,2006/06/27 09:00,['2006/01/31 09:00'],"['2006/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(06)72480-8 [pii]', '10.1529/biophysj.105.067496 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2006 Apr 15;90(8):2994-3003. doi: 10.1529/biophysj.105.067496.

The current study was undertaken to determine the association between previous consolidation and outcome of autotransplantation for AML in first remission. Posttransplantation outcomes of 146 patients receiving no consolidation were compared with those of 244 patients receiving standard-dose (<1 gm/m(2)) and 249 patients receiving high-dose (1-3 gm/m(2)) cytarabine, using proportional hazards regression to adjust for differences in prognostic variables. One-year transplantation-related mortality was similar among the cohorts. Five-year relapse rates were 49% (95% confidence interval CI} = 39%-58%) with no consolidation, 35% (95% CI = 29%-42%) with standard-dose cytarabine, and 40% (95% CI = 33%-48%) with high-dose cytarabine (P = .07). Five-year leukemia-free survival rates were 39% (95% CI = 30%-47%) with no consolidation, 53% (95% CI = 46%-60%) with standard-dose cytarabine, and 48% (95% CI = 40%-56%) with high-dose cytarabine (P = .03). Similarly, 5-year overall survival was better in those patients receiving consolidation: 42% (95% CI = 34%-51%) with no consolidation, 59% (95% CI = 52%-65%) with standard-dose cytarabine, and 54% (95% CI = 46%-61%) with high-dose cytarabine (P = .01). Although most patients received 1 or 2 cycles of consolidation, the number of courses had no detectable effect on transplantation outcome. In multivariate analysis, risks of relapse and treatment failure were lower in the patients receiving consolidation, especially among those patients receiving blood cell grafts. Outcomes with standard-dose and high-dose cytarabine were similar. Based on our findings, we recommend that patients with AML in first remission receive consolidation before undergoing autotransplantation.","['Tallman, Martin S', 'Perez, Waleska S', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Maziarz, Richard T', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Marks, David I', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Bishop, Michael R', 'Christiansen, Neal', 'Frankel, Stanley R', 'Garcia, Juan J', 'Ilhan, Osman', 'Laughlin, Mary J', 'Liesveld, Jane', 'Linker, Charles', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Luger, Selina', 'McCarthy, Philip L', 'Milone, Gustavo A', 'Pavlovsky, Santiago', 'Phillips, Gordon L', 'Russell, James A', 'Saez, Ruben A', 'Schiller, Gary', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Weiner, Roy S', 'Zander, Axel R', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Keating, Armand', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Horowitz, Mary M']","['Tallman MS', 'Perez WS', 'Lazarus HM', 'Gale RP', 'Maziarz RT', 'Rowe JM', 'Marks DI', 'Cahn JY', 'Bashey A', 'Bishop MR', 'Christiansen N', 'Frankel SR', 'Garcia JJ', 'Ilhan O', 'Laughlin MJ', 'Liesveld J', 'Linker C', 'Litzow MR', 'Luger S', 'McCarthy PL', 'Milone GA', 'Pavlovsky S', 'Phillips GL', 'Russell JA', 'Saez RA', 'Schiller G', 'Sierra J', 'Weiner RS', 'Zander AR', 'Zhang MJ', 'Keating A', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Horowitz MM']","['Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2006/01/31 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/01/31 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(05)00683-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.10.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Feb;12(2):204-16. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.10.013.,['U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biomarkers have been defined as any characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of a normal biologic or pathogenic process, a pharmacologic response to a therapeutic intervention, or a surrogate end point intended to substitute for a clinical end point. The following applications of biomarkers could be useful in chronic GVHD clinical trials or management: (1) predicting response to therapy; (2) measuring disease activity and distinguishing irreversible damage from continued disease activity; (3) predicting the risk of developing chronic GVHD; (4) diagnosing chronic GVHD: (5) predicting the prognosis of chronic GVHD; (6) evaluating the balance between GVHD and graft-versus-leukemia effects (graft-versus-leukemia or GVT); and (7) serving as a surrogate end point for therapeutic response. Such biomarkers can be identified by either hypothesis-driven testing or by high-throughput discovery-based methods. To date, no validated biomarkers have been established for chronic GVHD, although several candidate biomarkers have been identified from limited hypothesis-driven studies. Both approaches have merit and should be pursued.

Additionally, patients who carry one of the dubious cancer-specific health insurance policies are usually not eligible for financial benefits when they receive a diagnosis of MDS. Likewise, patients with MDS who have been led to believe they do not have a form of cancer by their primary physician may become upset when seeing another health care provider who does refer to MDS in this way.

These interactions have been confirmed by in vitro pull down experiments. The interaction between p87C3G and Bcr-Abl involves the SH3-binding domain of p87C3G and the SH3 domain of Abl and depends mostly on the first polyproline region of p87C3G. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that p87C3G is phosphorylated in vitro by a Bcr-Abl-dependent mechanism. These results indicate that p87C3G overexpression is linked to CML phenotype and that p87C3G may exert productive functional interactions with Bcr-Abl signaling components suggesting the implication of this C3G isoform in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Gutierrez-Berzal, Javier', 'Castellano, Esther', 'Martin-Encabo, Susana', 'Gutierrez-Cianca, Noelia', 'Hernandez, Jesus M', 'Santos, Eugenio', 'Guerrero, Carmen']","['Gutierrez-Berzal J', 'Castellano E', 'Martin-Encabo S', 'Gutierrez-Cianca N', 'Hernandez JM', 'Santos E', 'Guerrero C']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide-Releasing Factor 2)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Guanine Nucleotide-Releasing Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",2006/01/31 09:00,2006/05/17 09:00,['2006/01/31 09:00'],"['2005/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(05)00598-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2006 Apr 1;312(6):938-48. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2005.12.007.

Eleven cycloimide derivatives of bacteriochlorin p (CIBCs) with different N-substituents at the fused imide ring and various substituents replacing the 3-acetyl group were evaluated as photosensitizers with special emphasis on structure-activity relationships. The studied CIBCs absorb light within a tissue transparency window (780-830 nm) and possess high photostability at prolonged light irradiation. The most active derivatives are 300-fold more phototoxic toward HeLa and A549 cells than the clinically used photosensitizer Photogem due to the substituents that improve intracellular accumulation (distribution ratio of 8-13) and provide efficient photoinduced singlet oxygen generation (quantum yields of 0.54-0.57). The substituents predefine selective CIBC targeting to lipid droplets, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes or provide mixed lipid droplets and Golgi apparatus localization in cancer cells. Lipid droplets and Golgi apparatus are critically sensitive to photoinduced damage. The average lethal dose of CIBC-generated singlet oxygen per volume unit of cell was estimated to be 0.22 mM. Confocal fluorescence analysis of tissue sections of tumor-bearing mice revealed the features of tissue distribution of selected CIBCs and, in particular, their ability to accumulate in tumor nodules and surrounding connective tissues.

PBMCs were stimulated with either alloantigen or soluble antigen, then infected with a murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector carrying an immortalizing gene, either the Tax gene from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, or the human telomerase-reverse transcriptase gene. Since such vectors can only integrate in dividing cells, only antigen-activated T cells are efficiently transduced. This approach generated immortalized antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell lines that maintained strictly IL-2-dependent growth and HLA-restricted, antigen-specific responsiveness, some of which have been in continuous culture for longer than 1 year, far in excess of the survival of parallel control non-immortalized cultures. Clones derived from these lines showed antigen-specific proliferation with induced cytokine and chemokine production, and, in the case of a CD8+ T-cell clone, antigen-specific cytolytic activity.

The focus of this ongoing debate is on the requirement of a death receptor and its role in subsequent activation of caspase-8. Understanding the precise mechanism responsible for apoptosis and identifying molecules targeted by chemotherapy will allow us to develop better therapeutic strategies that target the inherent abnormalities of cancer cells. To show conventional chemotherapy drugs can trigger the caspase cascade, including caspase-8, -9, -3 and DNA fragmentation factor, Jurkat T leukemia cells were treated with cisplatin or etoposide in a dose-dependent and a time-dependent manner. Cisplatin and etoposide all induced apoptosis in wild-type Jurkat T leukemia cells. On the other hand, when a pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK was pretreated, apoptosis did not occur, indicating that these chemotherapy drugs mediated caspase-dependent apoptosis. However, the chemotherapy drug induction of apoptosis was not inhibited by treatment of zIETD-FMK, a caspase-8 inhibitor. There was no difference in cell death between wild-type and caspase-8 or FADD-deficient Jurkat cells after treatment of chemotherapy drug. In addition, cisplatin-induced apoptosis is abrogated by the overexpression of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L), which diminished changes of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased the amount of cytochrome c released from mitochondria. Again, cisplatin-induced apoptosis was not diminished by c-FLIP-overexpression, whereas the c-FLIP-overexpressing cells were less sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis than the wild type cells. Therefore, these results indicate that conventional chemotherapy drug-triggered apoptosis is indispensable, and its pathway is independent of the death receptor.","['Wang, Peng', 'Song, Jin H', 'Song, Doyoun K', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Hao, Chunhai']","['Wang P', 'Song JH', 'Song DK', 'Zhang J', 'Hao C']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2S2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', '*Drug Therapy', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Death Domain/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2006/01/31 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2006/01/31 09:00'],"['2005/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(05)00332-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2005.12.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2006 Sep;18(9):1528-35. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2005.12.004.

IL-1alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine, is expressed constitutively by the intact adult rat testis where it acts on germ, Sertoli and Leydig cells to regulate germ cell proliferation and steroidogenesis. The sequence identity of testicular IL-1alpha matches with the one secreted by activated macrophages in systemic immunity. The classical macrophage IL-1alpha is produced as 32 kDa precursor protein which is processed to mature 17 kDa IL-1alpha and a 16 kDa propiece. The rat testicular IL-1alpha, mainly secreted by Sertoli cells, was found to have molecular heterogeneity that can be observed both at the transcriptional and the translational levels. In the rat testis, two transcripts were found to be expressed with 941 bp and 767 bp (that lacks 174 bp) which were translated into 32 kDa and 24 kDa precursor proteins, respectively. The 32 kDa precursor protein is processed to the 17 kDa mature IL-1alpha. Identical transcripts are also shown to be present in cat, dog and pig. Most of the functional role is assigned to the mature 17 kDa IL-1alpha isoform. However, functional analysis of recombinant rat IL-1alpha isoforms showed that there was a clear biopotency difference between these forms in order of 17 kDa IL-1alpha>32proIL-1alpha>24proIL-1alpha. Furthermore, the mature 17 kDa tIL-1alpha has also been implicated in pathologies such as orchitis, relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the testis and infertility disorders in men. Thus, tIL-1alpha may play an important functional role both in coordination of normal testicular physiology as well as in contributing to the disease states in the testis.","['Amjad, Ali Imran', 'Soder, Olle', 'Sultana, Taranum']","['Amjad AI', 'Soder O', 'Sultana T']","['Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS), The Aga Khan University, Karachi.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Pakistan,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,9606447,['0 (Interleukin-1)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Spermatogenesis/physiology', 'Testicular Diseases/*etiology', 'Testis/*metabolism/*physiopathology']",2006/01/31 09:00,2006/08/02 09:00,['2006/01/31 09:00'],"['2005/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['040579197 [pii]', '1.2006/JCPSP.5560 [doi]']",ppublish,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2006 Jan;16(1):55-60. doi: 1.2006/JCPSP.5560.,,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transfusion of D- blood components after AHSCT has been recommended but anti-D alloimmunization in this setting has been studied little. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze anti-D formation after D-mismatched AHSCT. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty patients with a hematologic disease who underwent D-mismatched AHSCT were retrospectively studied. Support therapy included red blood cells (RBCs) and platelet (PLT) concentrates (PCs) from whole-blood donations and PLTs from apheresis. After AHSCT, patients received D+ PCs without administering Rh immunoglobulin (RhIG). An antibody screening to detect anti-D was performed by low-ionic-strength saline-indirect antiglobulin test with the tube test. RESULTS: Fifteen D+ patients received stem cells (SCs) of D- donors and 15 D- patients received SCs of D+ donors. After AHSCT, patients received a median of 11.5 (range, 0-32) D- RBC units. D+ patients received 682 (83%) of 825 PLT units from D+ donors, and D- patients received 573 (85%) of 678 PLT units from D+ donors. None of the 30 patients developed anti-D after a median follow-up of 32 weeks (range, 4-310 weeks). CONCLUSION: Anti-D alloimmunization after performing a D-mismatched AHSCT is infrequent in patients with hematologic diseases although patients receive D-mismatched PLT transfusions without RhIG administration.","['Cid, Joan', 'Lozano, Miguel', 'Fernandez-Aviles, Francesc', 'Carreras, Enric', 'Pereira, Arturo', 'Mazzara, Roberto', 'Ordinas, Antorio']","['Cid J', 'Lozano M', 'Fernandez-Aviles F', 'Carreras E', 'Pereira A', 'Mazzara R', 'Ordinas A']","['Department of Hemotherapy, August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Hospital Clinic Provincial, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Rh-Hr Blood-Group System)', '0 (Rho(D) antigen)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/immunology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/01/31 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2006/01/31 09:00'],"['2006/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF00698 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2006.00698.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2006 Feb;46(2):169-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2006.00698.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UV irradiation triggers multiple cellular events which lead to cell death, in particular to apoptosis; this process involves reactive oxygen species. Apoptotic machinery involves several pathways, in which mitochondria play crucial roles. In this work we have evaluated by means of cytometric, biochemical and ultrastructural approaches, if incubation of U937 promonocytic leukemia cells with melatonin may affect apoptotic behavior induced by UV-B. The cell line was treated with 1 mm melatonin before and after UV-B exposure. Melatonin pretreatment significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells, as revealed by FITC Annexin-V and propidium iodide assays (P < 0.005), as well as attenuated mitochondria alterations, as shown by ultrastructural morphology, Mito Tracker and JC-1 staining, and cytochrome c (cyt c) release (P < 0.005). On the contrary, incubation with melatonin after UV-B exposure significantly protect U937 cells from UV-B induced alterations, showing a possible delay of the apoptotic machinery (as revealed by the presence of earlier stages of apoptosis and significant cyt c release).

We have determined high-resolution structures of all of the human family members, screened them against a library of 24000 compounds and identified two classes of inhibitors, cyclopenta[c]quinolinecarboxylic acids and 2,5-dimethylpyrrolyl benzoic acids. Comparative structural analysis revealed significant differences within this conserved family that could be explored for the design of selective inhibitors. PTPN5 crystallized, in two distinct crystal forms, with a sulphate ion in close proximity to the active site and the WPD (Trp-Pro-Asp) loop in a unique conformation, not seen in other PTPs, ending in a 3(10)-helix. In the PTPN7 structure, the WPD loop was in the closed conformation and part of the KIM (kinase-interaction motif) was visible, which forms an N-terminal aliphatic helix with the phosphorylation site Thr66 in an accessible position. The WPD loop of PTPRR was open; however, in contrast with the structure of its mouse homologue, PTPSL, a salt bridge between the conserved lysine and aspartate residues, which has been postulated to confer a more rigid loop structure, thereby modulating activity in PTPSL, does not form in PTPRR. One of the identified inhibitor scaffolds, cyclopenta[c]quinoline, was docked successfully into PTPRR, suggesting several possibilities for hit expansion.

Firstly, HDACs can deacetylate histones as well as transcription factors, and can modulate gene expression through both these mechanisms. Secondly, acetylation is an important post-translational modulation of several proteins involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (e.g., p53, tubulin, heat-shock protein 90). The only HDAC inhibitors that have been investigated in clinical studies of AML are butyrate derivatives, valproic acid and depsipeptide. In the first studies, the drugs have usually been used as continuous therapy for several weeks or months, and in most studies the drugs were used alone or in combination with all-trans retinoic acid for treatment of patients with relapsed or primary resistant AML. Neurological toxicity and gastrointestinal side effects seem to be common for all three drugs. Complete haematological remission lasting for several months has been reported for a few patients (< 5% of included patients), whereas increased peripheral blood platelet counts seem more common and have been described both for patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndromes. Taken together, these studies suggest that HDAC inhibition can mediate antileukaemic effects in AML, but for most patients the clinical benefit seems limited and further studies of combination therapy are required.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Stapnes, Camilla', 'Tronstad, Karl Johan', 'Ryningen, Anita', 'Anensen, Nina', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Bruserud O', 'Stapnes C', 'Tronstad KJ', 'Ryningen A', 'Anensen N', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Lysine/*metabolism']",2006/01/31 09:00,2006/07/19 09:00,['2006/01/31 09:00'],"['2006/01/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14728222.10.1.51 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2006 Feb;10(1):51-68. doi: 10.1517/14728222.10.1.51.,,136,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microelectrodes of interdigitated and quadrupolar geometries were used. A field-frequency window has been identified that should be either avoided or utilised, depending on whether or not cell damage is to be minimised or is a desired objective. The width and location of this frequency window depends on the cell type, as defined by cell size, morphology and dielectric properties, and is bounded by two characteristic frequencies. These frequencies are the DEP cross-over frequency, where a cell makes the transition from negative to positive DEP, and a frequency determined by the time constant that controls the frequency dependence of the field induced across the cell membrane. When operating in this frequency window, and for the microelectrode designs used in this work, cell destruction can be minimised by ensuring that cells are not directed by positive DEP to electrode edges where fields exceeding 30-40 kV/m are generated. Alternatively, this field-frequency window can be exploited to selectively destroy specific cell types in a cell mixture.","['Menachery, A', 'Pethig, R']","['Menachery A', 'Pethig R']","['School of Informatics, University of Wales, Bangor, Gwynedd, LL57 1UT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,IEE Proc Nanobiotechnol,IEE proceedings.

Plasma concentrations of pentostatin were calculated with the known pharmacokinetics parameters. The differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fitted to the measured concentration-time data. Tumor lysis syndrome occurred 4 days after the course of the highest dose (3mg/m2), and the patient achieved complete remission. Anorexia, graded as 2 according to the NCI-CTC classification system, occurred and continued for four weeks.

This 'non-genomic' effect of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) blocked by pharmacological antagonists of nuclear vitamin D receptors (VDR(nuc)) and does not appear to require hetero-dimerisation with the retinoid-X receptor (RXR). Inhibitors of the Src tyrosine kinase (PP1), RAS (manumycin A), RAS-RAF interactions (sulindac sulphide and RAS inhibitory peptide), RAF (GW5074 or chloroquine), and protein kinase Calpha (HBDDE) abrogated the 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)-stimulated increase in ERK-MAP kinase activity.

However, in Bcr/Abl-transformed cells the monocyclic monoterpene, perillyl alcohol (POH), induces G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis without affecting Bcr/Abl expression or activity. The primary effect of POH is to cause growth arrest while apoptosis is a consequence of this arrest. Since Bcr/Abl induces constitutive expression of c-Myc, which is necessary for cell cycle transit from G1 into the S phase, we tested whether POH causes growth arrest by inhibiting expression of c-Myc. However, in POH-arrested Bcr/Abl-transformed cells, expression of c-Myc RNA and protein was not affected. Because expression of c-Myc during growth arrest can lead to apoptosis, we examined the role of c-Myc in POH-induced apoptosis. c-Myc induces expression of the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) gene, which synthesizes polyamines that are necessary for cell growth. Myc-induced apoptosis operates through ODC and can be prevented with the ODC inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). We report that DFMO strongly protects cells from POH-induced apoptosis. These results show that in Bcr/Abl-transformed cells, POH activates a Myc-ODC apoptotic pathway that is not protected by the Bcr/Abl antiapoptotic mechanism.","['Clark, Steven S']",['Clark SS'],"['Department of Human Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 53792, USA. ssclark@wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Monoterpenes)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '319R5C7293 (perillyl alcohol)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Eflornithine/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Monoterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/biosynthesis', '*Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Transformation, Genetic']",2006/01/28 09:00,2006/03/31 09:00,['2006/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['91181 [pii]', '10.1159/000091181 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2006;70(1):13-8. doi: 10.1159/000091181.

Several drugs currently used in the therapy of B-CLL act, at least partially, through activation of the p53 pathway. Recently, nongenotoxic small-molecule activators of p53, the nutlins, have been developed that inhibit p53-MDM2 binding. We have investigated the antitumor potential of nutlin-3 in B-CLL and find that it can activate the p53 pathway and effectively induce apoptosis in cells with wild-type p53, including cells with dysfunctional ataxia telangiectasia mutated, but not mutant p53. Nutlin-3 stabilized p53 and induced p53 target genes, including MDM2, p21(CIP1), PUMA, BAX, PIG3, and WIG1. Nutlin-3 synergized with the genotoxic drugs doxorubicin, chlorambucil, and fludarabine, but not with acadesine, which induces p53-independent apoptosis. Normal human T cells showed lower sensitivity to nutlin-3 than B-CLL cells and no synergism with the genotoxic drugs.

In this study, AMD3100-mobilized CD34(+) cells were phenotypically analyzed, marked with Neo(R)-containing retroviral vectors, and subsequently transplanted into myeloablated rhesus macaques. We show engraftment of transduced AMD3100-mobilized CD34(+) cells with Neo(R) gene marked myeloid and lymphoid cells up to 32 months after transplantation, demonstrating the ability of AMD3100 to mobilize true long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells. More AMD3100-mobilized CD34(+) cells are in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and more cells express CXCR4 and VLA-4 compared with G-CSF-mobilized CD34(+) cells. In vivo gene marking levels obtained with AMD3100-mobilized CD34(+) cells were better than those obtained using CD34(+) cells mobilized with G-CSF alone. Overall, these results indicate that AMD3100 mobilizes a population of hematopoietic stem cells with intrinsic characteristics different from those of hematopoietic stem cells mobilized with G-CSF, suggesting fundamental differences in the mechanism of AMD3100-mediated and G-CSF-mediated hematopoietic stem cell mobilization. Thus, AMD3100-mobilized CD34(+) cells represent an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells for clinical stem cell transplantation and genetic manipulation with integrating retroviral vectors.","['Larochelle, Andre', 'Krouse, Allen', 'Metzger, Mark', 'Orlic, Donald', 'Donahue, Robert E', 'Fricker, Simon', 'Bridger, Gary', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E', 'Hematti, Peiman']","['Larochelle A', 'Krouse A', 'Metzger M', 'Orlic D', 'Donahue RE', 'Fricker S', 'Bridger G', 'Dunbar CE', 'Hematti P']","['National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bldg 10 CRC, Rm 4E-5132, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzylamines', 'Cyclams', 'DNA/genetics', 'Dogs', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/metabolism', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2006/01/28 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/01/28 09:00'],"['2006/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65567-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-09-3592 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 1;107(9):3772-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-09-3592.

However, it is unknown whether p53 signaling is functional in B-CLL and if targeted nongenotoxic activation of the p53 pathway by using nutlin-3, a small molecule inhibitor of the p53/MDM2 interaction, is sufficient to kill B-CLL cells. In vitro treatment with nutlin-3 induced a significant cytotoxicity on primary CD19(+) B-CLL cells, but not on normal CD19(+) B lymphocytes, peripheral-blood mononuclear cells, or bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors. Among 29 B-CLL samples examined, only one was resistant to nutlin-3-mediated cytotoxicity. The induction of p53 by nutlin-3 in B-CLL samples was accompanied by alterations of the mitochondrial potential and activation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Among several genes related to the p53 pathway, nutlin-3 up-regulated the steady-state mRNA levels of PCNA, CDKN1A/p21, GDF15, TNFRSF10B/TRAIL-R2, TP53I3/PIG3, and GADD45. This profile of gene activation showed a partial overlapping with that induced by the genotoxic drug fludarabine. Moreover, nutlin-3 synergized with both fludarabine and chlorambucil in inducing B-CLL apoptosis. Our data strongly suggest that nutlin-3 should be further investigated for clinical applications in the treatment of B-CLL.","['Secchiero, Paola', 'Barbarotto, Elisa', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Zerbinati, Carlotta', 'di Iasio, Maria Grazia', 'Gonelli, Arianna', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Campioni, Diana', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Secchiero P', 'Barbarotto E', 'Tiribelli M', 'Zerbinati C', 'di Iasio MG', 'Gonelli A', 'Cavazzini F', 'Campioni D', 'Fanin R', 'Cuneo A', 'Zauli G']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, Human Anatomy Section, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 66, 44100 Ferrara, Italy. secchier@mail.umbi.umd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*blood']",2006/01/28 09:00,2006/06/15 09:00,['2006/01/28 09:00'],"['2006/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63844-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-11-4465 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 15;107(10):4122-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-11-4465.

Infection of cattle and sheep with bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a complex retrovirus related to human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), is associated with the development of B-cell leukemia. Whereas the natural disease in cattle is characterized by a low tumor incidence, experimental infection of sheep leads to overt leukemia in the majority of infected animals, providing a model for studying the pathogenesis associated with BLV and HTLV-1. Tax(BLV), the major oncoprotein, initiates a cascade of events leading toward malignancy, although the basis of transformation is not fully understood. We have taken a cross-species ovine-to-human microarray approach to identify Tax(BLV)-responsive transcriptional changes in two sets of cultured ovine B cells following retroviral vector-mediated delivery of Tax(BLV). Using cDNA-spotted microarrays comprising 10,336 human genes/expressed sequence tags, we identified a cohort of differentially expressed genes, including genes related to apoptosis, DNA transcription, and repair; proto-oncogenes; cell cycle regulators; transcription factors; small Rho GTPases/GTPase-binding proteins; and previously reported Tax(HTLV-1)-responsive genes. Interestingly, genes known to be associated with human neoplasia, especially B-cell malignancies, were extensively represented. Others were novel or unexpected. The results suggest that Tax(BLV) deregulates a broad network of interrelated pathways rather than a single B-lineage-specific regulatory process. Although cross-species approaches do not permit a comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns, they can provide initial clues for the functional roles of genes that participate in B-cell transformation and pinpoint molecular targets not identified using other methods in animal models.","['Klener, Pavel', 'Szynal, Maud', 'Cleuter, Yvette', 'Merimi, Makram', 'Duvillier, Hugues', 'Lallemand, Francoise', 'Bagnis, Claude', 'Griebel, Philip', 'Sotiriou, Christos', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Martiat, Philippe', 'Van den Broeke, Anne']","['Klener P', 'Szynal M', 'Cleuter Y', 'Merimi M', 'Duvillier H', 'Lallemand F', 'Bagnis C', 'Griebel P', 'Sotiriou C', 'Burny A', 'Martiat P', 'Van den Broeke A']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Bordet Institute, 121 Blvd. de Waterloo, 1000 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology/*virology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sheep']",2006/01/28 09:00,2006/02/25 09:00,['2006/01/28 09:00'],"['2006/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/4/1922 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.4.1922-1938.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Feb;80(4):1922-38. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.4.1922-1938.2006.,,,,PMC1367148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify FLVCR1 residues critical for mediating FeLV-C infection, we first independently isolated a human cDNA encoding the FLVCR2 protein that shares 52% identity to human FLVCR1, and we show that FLVCR2 does not function as a receptor for FeLV-C. Then, by generating specific hybrids between FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 and testing susceptibility of mouse cells expressing these hybrids to beta-galactosidase encoding FeLV-C, we identify FLVCR1 ECLs 1 and 6 as critical for mediating FeLV-C infection. Mouse cells expressing a hybrid protein containing FLVCR2 backbone with the ECL6 sequence from FLVCR1 were highly susceptible to FeLV-C infection. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that a single mutation of Asn463 in FLVCR2 ECL6 to an acidic Asp residue (a residue present in the corresponding position 487 in FLVCR1 ECL6) is sufficient to render FLVCR2 functional as an FeLV-C receptor. However, an Asp487Asn mutation in FLVCR1 ECL6 or substitution of the entire FLVCR1 ECL6 sequence for FLVCR2 ECL6 sequence does not disrupt receptor function. Subsequent substitutions show that residues within FLVCR1 ECL1 also contribute to mediating FeLV-C infection. Furthermore, our results suggest that FLVCR1 regions that mediate FeLV-C surface unit binding are distinct from ECL1 and ECL6. Our results are consistent with previous conclusions that infection of cells by gammaretroviruses involves interaction of virus with multiple receptor regions.","['Brown, Jennifer K', 'Fung, Claire', 'Tailor, Chetankumar S']","['Brown JK', 'Fung C', 'Tailor CS']","['The Hospital for Sick Children, Infection, Immunity, Injury Repair Program, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (FLVCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*physiology', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Virus/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'beta-Galactosidase/analysis/genetics']",2006/01/28 09:00,2006/02/25 09:00,['2006/01/28 09:00'],"['2006/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/4/1742 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.4.1742-1751.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Feb;80(4):1742-51. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.4.1742-1751.2006.,,,,PMC1367145,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF456126'],,,,,,,

In some cases, such as FeLV-T, a nonclassical receptor that includes both a transport protein (Pit1) and a soluble cofactor (FeLIX) is required for entry. To define which regions confer specificity to classical versus nonclassical receptor pathways, we engineered mutations found in either FeLV-A/T or FeLV-T, individually and in combination, into the backbone of the transmissible form of the virus, FeLV-A. The receptor specificities of these viruses were tested by measuring infection and binding to cells expressing the FeLV-A receptor or the FeLV-T receptors. FeLV-A receptor specificity was maintained when changes at amino acid position 6, 7, or 8 of the mature envelope glycoprotein were introduced, although differences in infection efficiency were observed. When these N-terminal mutations were introduced together with a C-terminal 4-amino-acid insertion and an adjacent amino acid change, the resulting viruses acquired FeLV-T receptor specificity. Additionally, a W-->L change at amino acid position 378, although not required, enhanced infectivity for some viruses. Thus, we have found that determinants in the N and C termini of the envelope surface unit can direct entry via the nonclassical FeLV-T receptor pathway. The region that has been defined as the receptor binding domain of gammaretroviral envelope proteins determined entry via the FeLV-A receptor independently of the presence of the N- and C-terminal FeLV-T receptor determinants.","['Cheng, Heather H', 'Anderson, Maria M', 'Hankenson, F Claire', 'Johnston, Lily', 'Kotwaliwale, Chitra V', 'Overbaugh, Julie']","['Cheng HH', 'Anderson MM', 'Hankenson FC', 'Johnston L', 'Kotwaliwale CV', 'Overbaugh J']","['Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave. N., Mail Stop C3-168, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (feline leukemia virus receptor)', '0 (glycoprotein gp70, Feline leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/*physiology']",2006/01/28 09:00,2006/02/25 09:00,['2006/01/28 09:00'],"['2006/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['80/4/1619 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.80.4.1619-1628.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2006 Feb;80(4):1619-28. doi: 10.1128/JVI.80.4.1619-1628.2006.,"['R01 CA051080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1367127,,,,,,,,,,['J Virol. 2006 Dec;80(24):12431'],,,,,,

Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-1 (ERAP1) generates human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-adapted antigenic peptides, but its function in trophoblasts lacking classical HLA class I molecules remains undetermined. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is produced from decidua during the implantation period and plays a necessary role in establishing pregnancy. This study is intended to investigate the location and the function of ERAP1 in trophoblastic cells, focusing on LIF. Immunohistochemistry showed strong ERAP1 expression in cultured EVTs. In choriocarcinoma cell lines used as a model for trophoblasts, ERAP1 was expressed more intensively in JEG-3 than BeWo cells. Immunoblot analysis and immunocytochemistry localized ERAP1 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in JEG-3 cells. Flow cytometry with HLA-G antibody to monitor the supply of antigenic peptides presenting to HLA-G in the ER showed that reducing ERAP1 transcripts by RNA interference did not affect cell surface expression of membrane HLA-G1 (mHLA-G1) in JEG-3 cells under basal conditions. In LIF-treated JEG-3 cells, cell surface mHLA-G1 expression was increased along with ERAP1 protein and promoter activities. In contrast to nonstimulated cells, eliminating ERAP1 from LIF-treated JEG-3 cells reduced the cell surface mHLA-G1 expression and soluble HLA-G1 secretion. This study provides the first evidence showing that ERAP1 is localized in the ER of trophoblasts and is involved in regulating cell surface HLA-G expression in the presence of LIF. Consequently, ERAP1 would function to present antigenic peptides to HLA-G in trophoblasts.","['Shido, Fumi', 'Ito, Tomomi', 'Nomura, Seiji', 'Yamamoto, Eiko', 'Sumigama, Seiji', 'Ino, Kazuhiko', 'Itakura, Atsuo', 'Hattori, Akira', 'Tsujimoto, Masafumi', 'Mizutani, Shigehiko', 'Kikkawa, Fumitaka']","['Shido F', 'Ito T', 'Nomura S', 'Yamamoto E', 'Sumigama S', 'Ino K', 'Itakura A', 'Hattori A', 'Tsujimoto M', 'Mizutani S', 'Kikkawa F']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (ERAP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aminopeptidases/analysis/*physiology', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Choriocarcinoma/immunology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*enzymology', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Trophoblasts/enzymology/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/01/28 09:00,2006/04/15 09:00,['2006/01/28 09:00'],"['2006/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2005-1449 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2005-1449 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2006 Apr;147(4):1780-8. doi: 10.1210/en.2005-1449.

The present studies show that RA up-regulated expression of SLP-76 (Src-homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte-specific phospho-protein of 76 kDa), which became a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in RA-treated cells. SLP-76 is a known adaptor molecule associated with T-cell receptor and MAPK signaling. To characterize functional effects of SLP-76 expression in RA-induced differentiation and G0 arrest, HL-60 cells were stably transfected with SLP-76. Expression of SLP-76 had no discernable effect on RA-induced ERK activation, subsequent functional differentiation, or the rate of RA-induced G0 arrest. To determine the effects of SLP-76 in the presence of a RA-regulated receptor, SLP-76 was stably transfected into HL-60 cells already overexpressing the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor, c-FMS, from a previous stable transfection. SLP-76 now enhanced RA-induced ERK activation, compared to parental c-FMS transfectants. It also enhanced RA-induced differentiation, evidenced by enhanced paxillin expression, inducible oxidative metabolism and superoxide production. RA-induced RB tumor suppressor protein hypophosphorylation was also enhanced, as was RA-induced G0 cell cycle arrest. A triple Y to F mutant SLP-76 known to be a dominant negative in T-cell receptor signaling failed to enhance RA-induced paxillin expression, but enhanced RA-induced ERK activation, differentiation and G0 arrest essentially as well as wild-type SLP-76. Thus, SLP-76 overexpression in the presence of c-FMS, a RA-induced receptor, had the effect of enhancing RA-induced cell differentiation. This is the first indication to our knowledge that RA induces the expression of an adapter molecule to facilitate induced differentiation via co-operation between c-FMS and SLP-76.","['Yen, Andrew', 'Varvayanis, Susi', 'Smith, James L', 'Lamkin, Thomas J']","['Yen A', 'Varvayanis S', 'Smith JL', 'Lamkin TJ']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, T4-008 VRT, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. ay13@cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (SLP-76 signal Transducing adaptor proteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Paxillin/genetics/physiology', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2006/01/28 09:00,2006/04/01 09:00,['2006/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-9335(05)00170-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejcb.2005.09.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 2006 Feb;85(2):117-32. doi: 10.1016/j.ejcb.2005.09.020.

Only two studies, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) rat and mouse studies, show any indication of carcinogenic effects and these results, an increase in mononuclear cell leukemia in the rat and an increase in forestomach tumors in the mouse, appear to be related to the corn oil vehicle. The increase in mononuclear cell leukemia was confined to the male rat, was not dose-related, did not show an earlier onset than the controls, had no effect on survival, was within the range seen in historical controls, and was not confirmed in five other rat studies, four of which used higher doses. The increase in forestomach tumors in mice in the NTP study, in which DDVP was administered by corn oil gavage, was confined to the highest dose, occurred against a high background of hyperplasia and forestomach tumors in the control mice, and was not confirmed in 10 other studies. Sustained irritation from daily gavaging with the corn oil vehicle, in conjunction with this high background, likely explains this response in the forestomach, which does not exist in humans.

These, so called, untargeted effects are demonstrated in cells that have received damaging signals produced by irradiated cells (radiation-induced bystander effects) or that are the descendants of irradiated cells (radiation-induced genomic instability). Radiation-induced genomic instability is characterized by a number of delayed adverse responses including chromosomal abnormalities, gene mutations and cell death. Similar effects, as well as responses that may be regarded as protective, have been attributed to bystander mechanisms. Whilst the majority of studies to date have used in vitro systems, some adverse non-targeted effects have been demonstrated in vivo. However, at least for haemopoietic tissues, radiation-induced genomic instability in vivo may not necessarily be a reflection of genomically unstable cells. Rather the damage may reflect responses to ongoing production of damaging signals; i.e. bystander responses, but not in the sense used to describe the rapidly induced effects resulting from direct interaction of irradiated and non-irradiated cells. The findings are consistent with a delayed and long-lived tissue reaction to radiation injury characteristic of an inflammatory response with the potential for persisting bystander-mediated damage. An important implication of the findings is that contrary to conventional radiobiological dogma and interpretation of epidemiologically-based risk estimates, ionizing radiation may contribute to malignancy and particularly childhood leukaemia by promoting initiated cells rather than being the initiating agent. Untargeted mechanisms may also contribute to other pathological consequences.","['Wright, Eric G', 'Coates, Philip J']","['Wright EG', 'Coates PJ']","['University of Dundee, Division of Pathology and Neuroscience, Molecular and Cellular Pathology Laboratories, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland, UK. e.g.wright@dundee.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication/radiation effects', 'Child', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Genomic Instability/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inflammation/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/etiology', '*Radiobiology', 'Signal Transduction/radiation effects']",2006/01/28 09:00,2006/07/01 09:00,['2006/01/28 09:00'],"['2005/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0027-5107(05)00509-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2005.03.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2006 May 11;597(1-2):119-32. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2005.03.035.

The MDS classification systems were revised recently and updated. These refined classification and prognostic schemes help stratify patients by their risk of leukemia progression and death; this knowledge can help clinicians select appropriate therapy. Although many treatments for MDS have been proposed and evaluated, at present, only hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers any real hope for cure, and no available therapy beyond general supportive care offers benefit to more than a minority of patients. However, recent clinical trials enrolling patients with MDS have reported encouraging results with use of newer drugs, including lenalidomide, decitabine, and darbepoetin alfa. Other exciting treatment regimens are being tested. Here, we present a contemporary, practical clinical approach to the diagnosis and risk-stratified treatment of MDS.

We have identified a motif in the granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptor composed of a tyrosine and a serine residue that functions as a binary switch for the independent regulation of multiple biological activities. Signalling occurs either through Ser585 at lower cytokine concentrations, leading to cell survival only, or through Tyr577 at higher cytokine concentrations, leading to cell survival as well as proliferation, differentiation or functional activation. The phosphorylation of Ser585 and Tyr577 is mutually exclusive and occurs via a unidirectional mechanism that involves protein kinase A and tyrosine kinases, respectively, and is deregulated in at least some leukemias. We have identified similar Tyr/Ser motifs in other cell surface receptors, suggesting that such signalling switches may play important roles in generating specificity and pleiotropy in other biological systems.","['Guthridge, Mark A', 'Powell, Jason A', 'Barry, Emma F', 'Stomski, Frank C', 'McClure, Barbara J', 'Ramshaw, Hayley', 'Felquer, Fernando A', 'Dottore, Mara', 'Thomas, Daniel T', 'To, Bik', 'Begley, C Glenn', 'Lopez, Angel F']","['Guthridge MA', 'Powell JA', 'Barry EF', 'Stomski FC', 'McClure BJ', 'Ramshaw H', 'Felquer FA', 'Dottore M', 'Thomas DT', 'To B', 'Begley CG', 'Lopez AF']","['Cytokine Receptor Laboratory, Department of Human Immunology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Hanson Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2006/01/27 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2006/01/27 09:00'],"['2005/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['7600948 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600948 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2006 Feb 8;25(3):479-89. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600948.

To characterize its regulatory mechanisms, we examined the activities of a Hemgn promoter containing 2975 bp of 5' flanking sequence and 196 bp of 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) sequence both in vitro and in vivo: this promoter is preferentially activated in a hematopoietic cell line, not in nonhematopoietic cell lines, and is sufficient to drive the transcription of a lacZ transgene in hematopoietic tissues in transgenic mice. Mutagenesis analyses showed that the 5' UTR including two highly conserved GATA boxes is critical for the promoter activity. GATA1, not GATA2, binds to the GATA binding sites and transactivates the Hemgn promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the expression of human hemogen (EDAG) transcripts were closely correlated with levels of GATA1 transcripts in primary acute myeloid leukemia specimens. This study suggests that the Hemgn promoter contains critical regulatory elements for its transcription in hematopoietic tissues and Hemgn is a direct target of GATA1 in leukemia cells.","['Yang, L V', 'Wan, J', 'Ge, Y', 'Fu, Z', 'Kim, S Y', 'Fujiwara, Y', 'Taub, J W', 'Matherly, L H', 'Eliason, J', 'Li, L']","['Yang LV', 'Wan J', 'Ge Y', 'Fu Z', 'Kim SY', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Taub JW', 'Matherly LH', 'Eliason J', 'Li L']","['Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (HEMGN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'DNA', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2006/01/27 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404105 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404105 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Mar;20(3):417-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404105.,"['HL58916/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA76641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA92308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vast majority of T-LGL proliferations express TCRalphabeta. Much less is known about the characteristics and pathogenesis of TCRgammadelta+ cases. We evaluated 44 patients with clonal TCRgammadelta+ T-LGL proliferations with respect to clinical data, immunophenotype and TCR gene rearrangement pattern. TCRgammadelta+ T-LGL leukemia patients had similar clinical presentations as TCRalphabeta+ T-LGL leukemia patients. Their course was indolent and 61% of patients were symptomatic. The most common clinical manifestations were chronic cytopenias - neutropenia (48%), anemia (23%), thrombocytopenia (9%), pancytopenia (2%) - and to a lesser extent splenomegaly (18%). Also multiple associated autoimmune (34%) and hematological (14%) disorders were found. Leukemic LGLs were predominantly positive for CD2, CD5, CD7, CD8, and CD57, whereas variable expression was seen for CD16, CD56, CD11b, and CD11c. The Vgamma9/Vdelta2 immunophenotype was found in 48% of cases and 43% of cases was positive for Vdelta1, reflecting the TCR-spectrum of normal TCRgammadelta+ T-cells in adult PB.

Protein kinase C-delta is a permanently activated kinase and a putative downstream target of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase in B-CLL. Blockade of protein kinase C-delta (PKC-delta) by the highly specific inhibitor rottlerin induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells. By co-culturing bone marrow stromal and CLL cells, we determined that the proapoptotic effect of rottlerin is not abolished in the presence of survival factors, indicating that a targeted therapy against PKC-delta might be a powerful approach for the treatment of CLL patients. The downstream events following rottlerin treatment engage mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial pathways and ultimately activate caspases that execute the apoptotic cell death. Herein we report that the inhibition of PKC-delta decreases the expression of the important antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and XIAP accompanied by a loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential Deltapsi. In addition, we discovered that ZAP-70-expressing cells are significantly more susceptible to rottlerin-induced cell death than ZAP-70 negative cells. We finally observed that rottlerin can augment cell toxicity induced by standard chemotherapeutic drugs.

However, in all studies imatinib dosage was tapered to 400-600 mg per day. We decided to initiate a clinical trial to evaluate an opposite strategy based on high-dose imatinib (800 mg per day) combined with a less intensive chemotherapeutic regimen (vincristine and dexamethasone), which we called the DIV induction regimen. Thirty-one patients (18 relapsing or refractory Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemias and 13 lymphoid blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemias) were enrolled. Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 28 out of 30 assessable patients. The median bcr-abl/abl ratio after the induction course was 0.1%. Median time to neutrophil recovery was 21 days. Fungus infections were observed in six patients out of 31 and possibly related to dexamethasone. Neuropathy due to vincristine was noted in 14 cases. Nine out of 19 patients under 55 years received allogenic stem cell transplantation after a median time of 78 days post-CR.

In this study, 6/18 patients treated with sequential ATRA and chemotherapy on protocol INT0129 relapsed with complete replacement of the nonmutant pretreatment APL cell population by a PML-RARalpha mutant subclone. Two patients relapsed in proximity of ATRA treatment; however, in four patients there was a 6-48 month hiatus between the last ATRA treatment and relapse. The mutant subclones were not detectable in samples tested > or = 3 months before relapse at > or = 1 in 10(2) (10(-2)) sensitivity. In one patient, a functionally weak mutation was detected at 10(-4) sensitivity before therapy but only limited pre-relapse enrichment of the mutant subclone was observed on subsequent ATRA therapy. These results indicate that proximate ATRA selection pressure is frequently not the main determinant for the emergence of strongly dominant PML-RARalpha mutant subclones and suggest that APL subclones harboring PML-RARalpha mutations are predisposed to the acquisition of secondary genetic/epigenetic alterations that result in a growth/survival advantage.","['Gallagher, R E', 'Schachter-Tokarz, E L', 'Zhou, D-C', 'Ding, W', 'Kim, S H', 'Sankoorikal, B J', 'Bi, W', 'Livak, K J', 'Slack, J L', 'Willman, C L']","['Gallagher RE', 'Schachter-Tokarz EL', 'Zhou DC', 'Ding W', 'Kim SH', 'Sankoorikal BJ', 'Bi W', 'Livak KJ', 'Slack JL', 'Willman CL']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10467, USA. rgallagh@aecom.yu.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Lineage', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2006/01/27 09:00,2006/09/09 09:00,['2006/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404118 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404118 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Apr;20(4):556-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404118.,"['R01 CA056771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1410817,,,['NIHMS7277'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess whether bone marrow CD34+ cell numbers could be used in differentiating between AA and hMDS. The percentage of bone marrow CD34+ cells was normal or increased (mean -3.5+0.5%, range 1-7%) in 15 of 35 patients studied, and low (mean -0.13 +/- 0.02%, range 0.02-0.36%) in 20 of 35 patients. All patients with a normal or increased percentage of CD34+ cells were ultimately diagnosed with hMDS based on the detection of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities or progression to refractory anemia with excess blasts/acute myeloid leukemia.

Another striking feature of the disease is its exquisite sensitivity to interferon (IFN)-alpha. So far, none of the known IFN-alpha regulatory properties have explained IFN-alpha responsiveness nor have they taken into account the morphological characteristics of hairy cells. IFN-alpha profoundly alters cytoskeletal organization of hairy cells and causes reversion of the hairy appearance into a rounded morphology. Because cytoskeletal rearrangements are controlled by the Rho family of GTPases, we investigated the GTPase activation status in hairy cells and their regulation by IFN-alpha. Using immunolocalization techniques and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that hairy cells display high levels of active Cdc42 and Rac1 and that IFN-alpha down-regulates these activities. In sharp contrast, RhoA activity was low in hairy cells but was increased by IFN-alpha treatment. Finally, IFN-alpha-mediated morphological changes also implicated a p53-induced response. These observations shed light on the mechanism of action of IFN-alpha in hairy cell leukemia and are of potential relevance for the therapeutical applications of this cytokine.","['Chaigne-Delalande, Benjamin', 'Deuve, Lynda', 'Reuzeau, Edith', 'Basoni, Caroline', 'Lafarge, David', 'Varon, Christine', 'Tatin, Florence', 'Anies, Guerric', 'Garand, Richard', 'Kramer, Ijsbrand', 'Genot, Elisabeth']","['Chaigne-Delalande B', 'Deuve L', 'Reuzeau E', 'Basoni C', 'Lafarge D', 'Varon C', 'Tatin F', 'Anies G', 'Garand R', 'Kramer I', 'Genot E']","['Unite INSERM 441, Institut National de la Recherche Medicale, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RAC1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '124671-05-2 (RHOA protein, human)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', '*Leukemia, Hairy Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",2006/01/27 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2006/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)62116-5 [pii]', '10.2353/ajpath.2006.050345 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2006 Feb;168(2):562-73. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2006.050345.,,,,PMC1606488,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They demonstrated that this PCR inhibition could be partially resolved by adding nonacetylated bovine serum albumin. In our studies, we observed the same phenomenon in a single follicular lymphoma case and extended our study to other available cases.

In light of our previous studies, the objective of the present investigation was to examine the ability of various cannabinoid compounds to elevate [Ca(2+)](i) in the CB2 receptor-expressing human peripheral blood acute lymphoid leukemia T cell line and the dependence of structural similarity to Delta(9)-THC therein. The present studies demonstrate that CBN and HU-210 [(6aR,10aR)-3-(1,1-dimethylbutyl)-6a,7,10,10a-tetrahydro-6,6-dimethyl-6H-dibenzo[ b,d]pyran-9-methanol], both tricyclic and in that respect structurally similar to Delta(9)-THC, elevate [Ca(2+)](i). The [Ca(2+)](i) elevation elicited by both CBN and HU-210 was attenuated upon removal of extracellular calcium and upon pretreatment with SK&F96365 [1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole], an inhibitor of receptor-operated cation channels. In addition, pretreatment with either CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonists attenuated the CBN- and HU-210-mediated [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. Further investigation of the dependence of Delta(9)-THC, CBN, and HU-210 on cannabinoid receptors using splenocytes from wild-type and CB1(-/-)/CB2(-/-) mice showed that the [Ca(2+)](i) elevation elicited by all three tricyclic cannabinoids was independent of CB1 and CB2. Moreover, both the CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists attenuated that rise in [Ca(2+)](i) elicited by the tricyclic cannabinoids in the wild-type and CB1(-/-)/CB2(-/-) mouse splenocytes. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that classic tricyclic cannabinoids with structural similarity to Delta(9)-THC elicit a robust influx of calcium in T cells putatively through receptor-operated cation channels in a manner sensitive to the cannabinoid receptor antagonists, but independent of the CB1 and CB2 receptors.","['Rao, Gautham K', 'Kaminski, Norbert E']","['Rao GK', 'Kaminski NE']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Center for Integrative Toxicology, 315 Food Safety Building, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824-1317, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Cannabinoids)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cannabinoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Structure', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism']",2006/01/27 09:00,2006/06/10 09:00,['2006/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.105.100503 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.105.100503 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2006 May;317(2):820-9. doi: 10.1124/jpet.105.100503.

Inorganic arsenicals are enzymatically methylated to monomethylarsonic acid (MMAs(V)), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAs(V)), and trimethylarsine oxide (TMAs(V)O) in mammals. We examined the effects of chronic exposure to methylated arsenicals on arsenic tolerance by using rat normal liver TRL 1215 cells. TRL 1215 cells were exposed for 20 weeks to MMAs(V), DMAs(V), or TMAs(V)O at levels that produced submicromolar cellular concentrations of arsenic. On chronic exposure to these methylated arsenicals, the cells acquired tolerance to acute arsenic cytolethality. Cellular arsenic uptake was reduced in these cells compared to passage-matched control cells. The long-term arsenic exposure increased glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and cellular glutathione (GSH) levels. Glutathione S-transferase, multidrug resistance-associated proteins (Mrps; efflux transporters encoded by Mrp genes), and P-glycoprotein [P-gp; efflux transporter encoded by multidrug resistance gene (MDR)] had also increased in these cells at the transcript and protein levels. The depletion of cellular GSH and the inhibition of Mrps and P-gp functions increased cellular arsenic uptake and reduced arsenic tolerance in these cells. These results indicate that chronic exposure to methylated arsenicals induces a generalized arsenic tolerance that is caused by increased arsenic excretion. Because accumulation of methylated arsenicals may occur in patients with chronic arsenic poisoning and arsenic-treated APL patients, this study may provide important information regarding chronic arsenic poisoning and the latent risk of developing multidrug resistance in APL therapy using inorganic arsenite.","['Kojima, Chikara', 'Qu, Wei', 'Waalkes, Michael P', 'Himeno, Seiichiro', 'Sakurai, Teruaki']","['Kojima C', 'Qu W', 'Waalkes MP', 'Himeno S', 'Sakurai T']","['Laboratory of Molecular Nutrition and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University, Yamashiro-cho, Tokushima 770-8514, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arsenic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Liver/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",2006/01/27 09:00,2006/06/22 09:00,['2006/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['kfj117 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfj117 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2006 May;91(1):70-81. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfj117.

Thus, resistance to nucleoside analogues may primarily be due to low levels of deoxynucleoside kinase activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the activity profiles of dCK and dGK and characterize the possible relationship between the levels of dCK enzymatic activities and mRNA levels in B-CLL cells from untreated patient samples in an attempt to determine the best approach for predicting sensitivity to nucleoside analogues and thereby optimizing treatment of CLL. For this purpose, dCK and dGK analyses were done in blood cells from 59 untreated symptomatic patients with CLL. The dGK activity towards 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine was significantly lower than of dCK (median 73 pmol/mg protein/min (85-121, 95% CI) versus 353 pmol/mg protein/min (331-421)). The median dCK mRNA level was 0.107 (0.096-0.120, 95% CI). There was a lack of correlation between the activities of dCK and dGK, which indicates that these proteins are regulated independently. We also found that the dCK and dGK activity measurement towards their endogenous substrates were comparable to the nucleoside analogues tested. Such variations in enzyme activities and mRNA levels may well explain differences in clinical responses to treatment. There was no correlation between the levels of dCK mRNAs and enzymatic activities using a quantitative real-time PCR procedure. Sequencing of dCK mRNA did not reveal alternate splicing or mutations in the coding region. The relation between activity and mRNA levels was studied by short interfering RNA (siRNA) method, which showed that in the siRNA treated cells the down-regulation of dCK expression, and activity followed each other. However, in control cells the mRNA levels remained stable but the protein activity markedly decreased. These data demonstrate that the dCK activity is not reflected by dCK mRNA expression that indicates a post-translational mechanism(s).","['Lotfi, Kourosh', 'Karlsson, Karin', 'Fyrberg, Anna', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Jonsson, Viggo', 'Peterson, Curt', 'Eriksson, Staffan', 'Albertioni, Freidoun']","['Lotfi K', 'Karlsson K', 'Fyrberg A', 'Juliusson G', 'Jonsson V', 'Peterson C', 'Eriksson S', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Medicine and Care, Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden. koulo@imv.liu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.113 (deoxyguanosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA Probes/chemistry', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*enzymology', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*blood', 'RNA, Messenger/*blood', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism']",2006/01/27 09:00,2006/04/07 09:00,['2006/01/27 09:00'],"['2005/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(05)00814-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2005.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2006 Mar 14;71(6):882-90. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2005.12.007.

Previous analyses of tax transgenic mice suggested that protection of peripheral T-cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis by virus-encoded oncoprotein Tax was relevant to the onset of HTLV-I-induced diseases. Here, we show the high level expression of cellular FLICE/caspase-8-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) in Tax-expressing HTLV-I-infected T-cells. The silencing of c-FLIP expression by a lentivirus-based RNA interference system rendered Tax-positive HTLV-I-infected T-cells sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Exogenously expressed Tax by using a conditional Cre-loxP-mediated inducible system also inhibited Fas-mediated apoptosis by up-regulating c-FLIP expression in HTLV-I-negative T-cells. Tax mutant d3 which cannot activate CREB/ATF1, while another M22 mutant which cannot activate NF-kappaB did not, suppressed Fas-mediated apoptosis by inducing c-FLIP expression. Furthermore, expression of the dominant negative mutant of either NF-kappaB or IkappaBalpha canceled not only c-FLIP expression but also inhibitory activity against Fas-mediated apoptosis by Tax. Inactivation of NFAT, however, did not decrease the expression of c-FLIP in HTLV-I-infected T-cells. Taken together, Tax inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis by up-regulating c-FLIP expression in HTLV-I-infected cells, and NF-kappaB activity plays an essential role in the up-regulation of c-FLIP.","['Okamoto, Kazuo', 'Fujisawa, Jun-ichi', 'Reth, Michael', 'Yonehara, Shin']","['Okamoto K', 'Fujisawa J', 'Reth M', 'Yonehara S']","['Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2006/01/27 09:00,2007/04/18 09:00,['2006/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['GTC927 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2443.2006.00927.x [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2006 Feb;11(2):177-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2443.2006.00927.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prolonged exposure to activated leukocytes, playing pivotal roles in chronic inflammation-associated carcinogenesis, is known to lead to oxidative and nitrosative damage to macromolecules in the body since they are primary sources of free radicals, such as superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) and nitric oxide (NO). In this study, we estimated anti-oxidative and anti-nitrosative activities of Okinawan food items by employing two cellular experimental systems: (1) phorbol ester-induced O(2)(-) generation from differentiated HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells; and (2) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO generation in RAW264.7 murine macrophages. A total of 138 food items, consisting of 42 samples unique to Okinawa and 96 common in the Japanese main island, were purchased at local markets in Okinawa and extracted with chloroform. When tested at a concentration of 100 microg/ml, 38% (16/42) of the former showed 70% or more inhibition of O(2)(-) generation while 21% (20/96) of the latter did so. In parallel, 64% (27/42) of the former showed significant NO generation suppression in contrast to 48% (46/96) of the latter . Twenty-one active species were further tested at a concentration of 20 mug/ml, and eleven species, including sugar cane, wild turmeric, and zedoary, were indicated to be most promising items with anti-oxidative and anti-nitrosative properties. In addition, some of the active constituents (chebulagic acid, a resveratrol derivative, and sesquiterpenoids) were identified. Our results suggest that food items typical in the Okinawa area have higher cancer preventive potential than those common in Japan.","['Murakami, Akira', 'Ishida, Hisashi', 'Kobo, Kimie', 'Furukawa, Ikuyo', 'Ikeda, Yasutaka', 'Yonaha, Megumi', 'Aniya, Yohko', 'Ohigashi, Hajime']","['Murakami A', 'Ishida H', 'Kobo K', 'Furukawa I', 'Ikeda Y', 'Yonaha M', 'Aniya Y', 'Ohigashi H']","['Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan. cancer@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Plant Structures', '*Plants, Edible', 'Sesquiterpenes/pharmacology', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology', 'Superoxides/*metabolism']",2006/01/27 09:00,2006/05/19 09:00,['2006/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2005 Oct-Dec;6(4):437-48.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study of 14 patients].,697-9,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The frequency and cause of neurologic complications (NC) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have changed over time. We have analyzed the NC in 185 consecutive patients who underwent HSCT in a period of 5 years in a single HSCT Unit. PATIENTS AND METHOD: 185 consecutive patients underwent HSCT (44 allogeneic) between February 2000 and March 2005 to treat hematologic malignancies. Most frequent diagnoses were multiple myeloma (41 patients) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (n = 35). Demographic and clinical data, HSCT characteristics and procedure-related events with special attention to neurological findings were recorded. Imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging and/or computerized tomography scan), cerebro-spinal fluid analyses and microbiological studies were performed in all patients developing NC. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 27 months, 14 patients (7.5%) developed NC, 6 of them after an allogeneic HSCT. The most common conditioning regimen in these patients was BEAM (5/14); 6 patients submitted to allogenic-HSCT received methotrexate and cyclosporin as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and intrathecal prophylaxis of relapse was administered to 3 patients. The median time to the appearance of a NC was 13 days from HSCT (range: -4 to + 135 days). Seizures (8 cases) and encephalopathy (n = 2) were the most frequent clinical manifestations. In 12 cases the cause of the NC was related to drugs, there was one case of viral encephalitis and in the remaining case was caused by hemorrhage. Two patients died, one due to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura attributed to cyclosporin and the other due to viral encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS: In our series drug toxicity was the main cause of NC (particularly seizures) following HSCT. Our results contrast with previous studies in which infections, especially of fungal origin, were the main cause of NC. These changes over time should be taken into account during diagnostic procedures.","['Batlle, Montserrat', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Lozano, Manuel', 'Ferra, Christelle', 'Sancho, Juan Manuel', 'Xicoy, Blanca', 'Feliu, Evarist']","['Batlle M', 'Oriol A', 'Ribera JM', 'Lozano M', 'Ferra C', 'Sancho JM', 'Xicoy B', 'Feliu E']","[""Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain. mbatlle@ns.hugtip.scs.es""]",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases/*etiology', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/etiology', 'Seizures/etiology']",2006/01/27 09:00,2006/02/01 09:00,['2006/01/27 09:00'],"['2006/01/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-7753(05)72159-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-7753(05)72159-x [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2005 Nov 19;125(18):697-9. doi: 10.1016/s0025-7753(05)72159-x.,,,Complicaciones neurologicas despues de un transplante de progenitores hemopoyeticos.

Patients with MDS are often older and may have contraindications to anthracycline-based regimens. Topotecan-cytarabine regimens have shown encouraging results in higher-risk MDS. The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term results with topotecan-cytarabine versus other intensive chemotherapy regimens in higher-risk MDS. METHODS: Five hundred ten patients with higher-risk MDS treated with intensive chemotherapy were reviewed. Their median age was 63 years; 82% had intermediate 2 or high-risk MDS; 32% had secondary MDS; 40% had chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities. Therapy was: topotecan-cytarabine in 77; idarubicin-cytarabine regimens in 270; topotecan-cytarabine and cyclophosphamide in 67; fludarabine-cytarabine in 96. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the independent associations of different variables, and most important, the treatment regimen, with complete response, induction mortality, and survival. RESULTS: The overall complete response (CR) rate was 55%, induction mortality 17%, and 5-year survival rate 8%. The 5-year survival rate was 11% for patients younger than 65 years old and 17% for patients with a normal karyotype. Among 82 patients younger than 65 years with a normal karyotype, the CR rate was 67%, 5-year survival rate 27%, and 5-year CR duration rate 33%. Topotecan-cytarabine regimens were equivalent to idarubicin-cytarabine regimens in relation to CR rates and survival rates, but were associated with a lower induction mortality. Multivariate analysis confirmed that treatment regimens were not associated with independent significant differences in CR rates or survival. However, topotecan-cytarabine regimens were still selected to be associated with lower induction mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that topotecan-cytarabine regimens are equally effective to other AML regimens in higher-risk MDS and may be less toxic. Topotecan-cytarabine may be considered a reasonable alternative to idarubicin-cytarabine in higher-risk MDS, particularly in older patients with contraindications to anthracyclines.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Cortes, Jorge', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Giles, Francis', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Plunkett, William', 'Keating, Michael', 'Estey, Elihu']","['Kantarjian H', 'Beran M', 'Cortes J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles F', 'Pierce S', 'Shan J', 'Plunkett W', 'Keating M', 'Estey E']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

AML-type therapy results are often derived from studies in younger patients and may not apply to elderly AML. Many investigators and oncologists advocate, at times, only supportive care or frontline single agents, Phase I-II studies, low-intensity regimens, or 'targeted' therapies. However, baseline expectations for outcomes of elderly AML with 'standard' AML-type therapy are not well defined. The aim was to develop prognostic models for complete response (CR), induction (8-week) mortality, and survival rates in elderly AML, which would be used to advise oncologists and patients of expectations with standard AML type therapy, and to establish baseline therapy results against which novel strategies would be evaluated. METHODS: A total of 998 patients age > or = 65 years with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (> 10% blasts) treated with intensive chemotherapy between 1980 and 2004 were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors associated with CR, induction (8-week) mortality, and survival used standard methods. RESULTS: The overall CR rate was 45% and induction mortality 29%. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors identified consistent independent poor prognostic factors for CR, 8-week mortality, and survival. These included age > or = 75 years, unfavorable karyotypes (often complex), poor performance (3-4 ECOG [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group]), longer duration of antecedent hematologic disorder, treatment outside the laminar airflow room, and abnormal organ functions. Patients could be divided into: 1) a favorable group (about 20% of patients) with expected CR rates above 60%, induction mortality rates of 10%, and 1-year survival rates above 50%; 2) an intermediate group (about 50-55% of patients) with expected CR rates of 50%, induction mortality rates of 30%, and 1-year survival rates of 30%; and 3) an unfavorable risk group (about 25-30% of patients) with expected CR rates of less than 20%, induction mortality rates above 50%, and 1-year survival rates of less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic models, based on standard readily available baseline characteristics, were developed for elderly patients with AML, which may assist in therapeutic and investigational decisions. These predictive models, based on a retrospective analysis, will require validation in independent study groups.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Giles, Francis', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Wierda, William', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Estey, Elihu']","['Kantarjian H', ""O'brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Giles F', 'Faderl S', 'Jabbour E', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Wierda W', 'Pierce S', 'Shan J', 'Estey E']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Defects in repairing damaged DNA lead to genetic instability and carcinogenesis. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of the polymorphisms of DNA repair genes on risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURES: We genotyped polymorphisms of X-ray repair cross-complimenting group 1 (XRCC1) codon 194 (Arg to Trp), 280 (Arg to His) and 399 (Arg to Gln), and xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) codon 312 (Asp to Asn) and 715 (Lys to Gln) in 108 children with ALL and 317 healthy controls using PCR-RFLP method. The allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies of these polymorphisms were compared between cases and controls using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. PHASE computer software was used to analyze estimated haplotypes of the XRCC1 and XPD polymorphisms. RESULTS: The frequency of XRCC1 194Trp allele in patients was significantly lower than that in controls (odds ratio (OR) 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47-0.97). Individuals with XRCC1 194 Trp/Trp genotype had a significantly reduced risk of ALL (OR 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05-0.96). The frequency of the XRCC1 haplotype B (194Trp-280Arg-399Arg) was significantly lower in children with ALL when compared to controls. The XRCC1 399Gln allele was associated with a significantly increased risk of ALL (OR 1.67; 95% CI, 1.20-2.33). The frequency of the XRCC1 haplotype C (194Arg-280Arg-399Gln) was significantly higher in patients. There was no difference of allele frequencies of the XRCC1 280 (Arg to His), XPD 312 (Asp to Asn), or XPD 715 (Lys to Gln) between cases and controls. CONCLUSION: The XRCC1 194Trp allele and haplotype B showed a protective effect against development of childhood ALL.

Most common are the competing risks of relapse and death in remission. These two risks are the primary reason that patients fail treatment. In most medical papers the effects of covariates on the three outcomes (relapse, death in remission and treatment failure) are model by distinct proportional hazards regression models. Since the hazards of relapse and death in remission must add to that of treatment failure, we argue that this model leads to internal inconsistencies. We argue that additive models for either the hazard rates or the cumulative incidence functions are more natural and that these models properly partition the effect of a covariate on treatment failure into its component parts. We illustrate the use and interpretation of additive models for the hazard rate or for the cumulative incidence function using data from a study of the efficacy of two preparative regimes for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Klein, John P']",['Klein JP'],"['Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, 8701 Watertown Plank Road, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA. klein@mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Failure', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/standards']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/07/21 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.2246 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2006 Mar 30;25(6):1015-34. doi: 10.1002/sim.2246.,['R01-54706-11/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,

Many case reports and reviews have appeared indicating that the presence of the antiphospholipid antibodies is related to thrombotic associations with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in a proportion of these patients. We investigated the frequency of the thrombotic manifestations in 58 patients demonstrating antiphospholipid antibodies and with a history of neoplasia, including haematologic and lymphoproliferative malignancies. Antiphospholipid antibodies were detected by clotting assay [lupus anticoagulant (LAC)] or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL)] according to the Sapporo criteria. Patients, 39/58, suffered from solid tumours and 19/58 patients from malignant haematologic or lymphoproliferative diseases. One patient was suffering simultaneously from two solid tumours and a malignant lymphoma. Among the patients with solid tumours, 18/39 (46%) patients had thromboembolic complications of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Among the patients with haematologic and lymphoproliferative malignancies, only 6/19 (32%) suffered from thromboembolic complications. There was, however, no relation between the titres of aCL antibodies and the clinical manifestations. The presence, but not the titres, of antiphospholipid antibodies may identify a subset of cancer patients with a high risk of developing thrombotic complications. The frequency of thrombosis, however, is lower in aPL-positive patients with lymphoproliferative and haematological malignancies.","['Miesbach, Wolfgang', 'Scharrer, Inge', 'Asherson, Ronald']","['Miesbach W', 'Scharrer I', 'Asherson R']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590, Frankfurt, Germany. miesbach@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Clin Rheumatol,Clinical rheumatology,8211469,"['0 (Antibodies, Antiphospholipid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Antiphospholipid/blood', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome/*complications/immunology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thromboembolism/epidemiology/etiology', 'Thrombosis/epidemiology/*etiology']",2006/01/26 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2005/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10067-005-0181-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Rheumatol. 2006 Nov;25(6):840-4. doi: 10.1007/s10067-005-0181-2.

IFI incidence is increasing, and associated mortality remains high due to unreliable diagnosis. Antifungal drugs are often limited by inadequate antimicrobial spectrum and side effects. Thus, the detection of circulating fungal DNA has been advocated as a rapid, more sensitive diagnostic tool. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 01 and January 03, weekly blood samples (1,311) were screened from 193 patients undergoing intensive myelosuppressive or immunosuppressive therapy. IFI cases were classified according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria. Fungal DNA was extracted from whole blood and amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) published primers that bind to the conserved regions of the fungal 18S rRNA gene sequence. In our study, two or more consecutive positive samples were always associated with fungal disease. RESULTS: PCR screening predicted the development of IFI to be 17 days (median). This test had a specificity of 91.1% and a sensitivity of 75%. IFI incidence was 7.8%. DISCUSSION: Therefore, our results confirm the potential usefulness of PCR serial screening and the clinical applicability in everyday routine. PCR screening offers a noninvasive repeatable aid to the diagnosis of IFI.","['Ribeiro, Patricia', 'Costa, Fatima', 'Monteiro, Alexandra', 'Caldas, Joana', 'Silva, Madalena', 'Ferreira, Gilda', 'Veiga, Joana', 'Sousa, Manuel O', 'Viegas, Maria P', 'Santos, Ester', 'Goncalves, Antonio J', 'Sousa, Aida B']","['Ribeiro P', 'Costa F', 'Monteiro A', 'Caldas J', 'Silva M', 'Ferreira G', 'Veiga J', 'Sousa MO', 'Viegas MP', 'Santos E', 'Goncalves AJ', 'Sousa AB']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital dos Capuchos, Lisbon, Portugal. patriciamribeiro@sapo.pt']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Fungal)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/immunology/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Fungal/blood', 'Diagnostic Tests, Routine', 'Female', 'Fungemia/*diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/virology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/drug effects', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/etiology', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prospective Studies']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/12/13 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2005/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-005-0903-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2006 May;14(5):469-74. doi: 10.1007/s00520-005-0903-7.

The value of monitoring the CRP levels after stem cell transplantation (SCT) can identify patients at risk of treatment-related complications and mortality. Inflammatory cytokines facilitate donor T-cell activation via antigen presenting cells immediately after SCT. This study examined the relationship between the post-SCT CRP levels and a leukemic relapse. Fifty-four consecutively transplanted patients who relapsed after the allogeneic SCT were compared with nonrelapsing patients. The serum CRP levels were measured on day 0 and every 7 days thereafter until 4 weeks after the SCT. The mean CRP levels throughout the early post-SCT episode were significantly lower in the relapsing patients than in those who did not experience relapse (mean+/-s.e.: 26.8 +/- 6.3 vs 65.3 +/- 9.4 for first week, P = 0.001; 23.9 +/- 3.8 vs 44.6 +/- 6.6 for second week, P = 0.008). Univariate analysis showed that the CRP level on the first and second week, and graft-versus-host disease were significantly associated with a relapse. Multivariate analysis showed that the CRP level on the first week was the strongest independent variable predicting the risk of a relapse after SCT (P = 0.04). These results indicate that the serum CRP levels early after allogeneic SCT might display the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. CRP is a surrogate of the proinflammatory cytokine release that was not measured in this study. The GvL effect appears to be efficiently strengthened by the high CRP levels that may be reflecting T-cell activation.","['Min, C-K', 'Kim, S Y', 'Eom, K S', 'Kim, Y J', 'Kim, H J', 'Lee, S', 'Kim, D W', 'Lee, J W', 'Min, W S', 'Kim, C C']","['Min CK', 'Kim SY', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee S', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Kim CC']","['Catholic Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea. ckmin@catholic.ac.kr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'C-Reactive Protein/*analysis', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/04/04 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705276 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705276 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2006 Mar;37(5):493-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705276.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the significance of IL-7Ralpha SNPs for the outcome in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). IL-7Ralpha polymorphisms were determined in 195 recipient and donor pairs from either matched sibling donors or matched unrelated donors (MUD). Genotyping of 173 normal controls was performed in parallel. In MUD transplants, the +1237 genotype of the donor was associated with survival after SCT, the mortality being highest and intermediate for the GG and AG genotypes, respectively (P = 0.023). This pattern was more pronounced with respect to treatment-related mortality (P = 0.003), while IL-7Ralpha genotypes were unrelated to the risk of relapse of leukaemia. The IL-7Ralpha +1237 genotype of the recipient and the genotypes of the other three polymorphisms, were not significantly associated with the outcome of SCT.

Development of methods for purging tumor cells that do not compromise the engraftment potential of the normal hematopoietic cells in the autograft has been a long-standing goal. Since primitive CML cells differentiate more rapidly in vitro than their normal counterparts and are also preferentially killed by mafosfamide and imatinib, we examined the purging effectiveness on CD34(+) CML cells using a strategy that combines a brief exposure to imatinib (0.5-1.0 microM for 72 h) and then mafosfamide (30-90 microg/ml for 30 min) followed by 2 weeks in culture with cytokines (100 ng/ml each of stem cell factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and thrombopoietin). Treatment with 1.0 microM imatinib, 60 microg/ml mafosfamide and 14 days of culture with cytokines eliminated BCR-ABL(+) cells from chronic phase CML patient aphereses, while preserving normal progenitors.

Here, we show that sublethal concentrations of arsenic trioxide (ATO) specifically enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in leukaemic but not in other tumour cell lines. The combination of ATO and TRAIL synergistically enhanced cleavage of caspase-8, which was blocked by the caspase inhibitor IETD.fmk as well as in cells deficient for caspase-8, suggesting a requirement for the death-inducing signalling complex. Arsenic trioxide led to increased cell surface expression of DR5 (death receptor 5), inhibition of the serine/threonine kinase Akt and downregulation of the short isoform of FLIP (FLICE-inhibitory protein, FLIPS). Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) was equally efficient in sensitising leukaemic cells to TRAIL with similar effects on DR5 and FLIPS expression, suggesting that ATO may in part act through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. These results indicate that the enhancement in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis induced by ATO is due to alteration in the levels of multiple components and regulators of the death receptor-mediated pathway. These findings offer a promising and novel strategy involving a combination of TRAIL and ATO, or more specific Akt inhibitors in the treatment of various haematopoietic malignancies.","['Szegezdi, E', 'Cahill, S', 'Meyer, M', ""O'Dwyer, M"", 'Samali, A']","['Szegezdi E', 'Cahill S', 'Meyer M', ""O'Dwyer M"", 'Samali A']","['Department of Biochemistry, National University of Ireland,University Road, Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (isoleucyl-glutamyl-threonyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*therapeutic use', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*therapeutic use']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/03/28 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['6602954 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6602954 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2006 Feb 13;94(3):398-406. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6602954.,,,,PMC2361137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PML gene is frequently involved in the t(15;17) chromosomal translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The translocation results in a fusion gene product, PML-RARalpha, in which the PML gene fuses to the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) gene. PML-RARalpha has been shown to promote transcriptional repression of genes involved in myeloid terminal differentiation and to disrupt the architecture of PML bodies, a phenotype reversed by treatment with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA). However, there are several alternatively spliced isoforms of PML-RARalpha. Here, we addressed the differences between the short and the long isoforms of PML-RARalpha (L and S) since both are associated with APL. We demonstrate that PML-RARalphaL, but not PML-RARalphaS, can directly promote cell growth by transcriptionally activating the pro-proliferative gene, c-fos, in response to mitogenic stimulation. The activity of the PML-RARalphaL is completely sensitive to ATRA. We further show that this activation is not via direct recruitment of the protein to the c-fos promoter but indirectly by altering the chromosomal environment of the c-fos gene, thereby rendering it more accessible to the signal induced transcriptional activators. Our results suggest that in addition to antagonizing the PML-tumor suppressor or the PML-pro-apoptotic activity, PML-RARalpha proteins can also directly promote cell growth by activating c-fos.","['Tussie-Luna, M I', 'Rozo, L', 'Roy, A L']","['Tussie-Luna MI', 'Rozo L', 'Roy AL']","['Department of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Hdac1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Histone Deacetylase 1', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/07/25 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209388 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209388 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Jun 8;25(24):3375-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209388.

METHODS: A cohort study began in 1994 by an exhaustive collection of the incidental cancers notified in the Ile-de-France area at the health insurance (27,080 patients). A stratified random sample based on tumor localization was followed at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years. The analysis of the observed survival was carried out according to Kaplan-Meier method. Relative survival was calculated according to Ederer II method. RESULTS: The follow-up sample concerned 4,166 patients. For all cancers, relative survival at 5 years was 65% for the women and 51% for the men. Relative survival rate at 5 years was 82% for the women with a breast cancer (98% for the patients in stage I) and 66% for those with a cancer of the cervix. Relative survival at 5 years for colonic cancer was 67% for men and 54% for women. For lung cancer, the relative survival rate fell from 47% for patients in stage I to 5% for those in stage IV. CONCLUSION: Our study produces population-based survival data for a entire geographical area covering 20% of the French population. Survival improves with earlier diagnosis but depends also on quality of care and availability of care: access to medical care can be a favouring factor. While in terms of incidence the situation in the Ile-de-France area is close to the national situation, survival at 5 years for a set of tumors appears to be better in this area than the nationwide figures. Besides providing information useful to determine mortality and incidence, the health insurance data offer additional insight to cancer epidemiology and contribute to better knowledge of this disease.","['Chinaud, F', 'Slota, L', 'Souques, M', 'Asselain, B', 'Blanchon, B', 'Dubois, G', 'Martin, E', 'Rezvani, A']","['Chinaud F', 'Slota L', 'Souques M', 'Asselain B', 'Blanchon B', 'Dubois G', 'Martin E', 'Rezvani A']","[""Service Medical de l'Assurance Maladie d'Ile-de-France, Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie des Travailleurs Salaries (CNAMTS), 26-50, avenue du Professeur-Andre-Lemierre, 75986 Paris Cedex 20.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,7608039,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/mortality', 'Colonic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/mortality', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Paris/epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/mortality', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/03/01 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['s0398-7620(05)84725-x [pii]', '10.1016/s0398-7620(05)84725-x [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 2005 Nov;53(5):477-90. doi: 10.1016/s0398-7620(05)84725-x.,,,Survie a cinq ans des patients ayant eu un diagnostic de cancer en 1994 en Ile-de-France.,,,['Groupe Cohorte PETRI'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Merbarone induced the release of high molecular weight DNA fragments from the nuclear matrix of HL-60 leukemia cells, which preceded the internucleosomalsize DNA fragmentation characteristic of late-stage apoptosis. The chromatin fragments were enriched in a matrix attachment region (MAR) sequence compared with a non-MAR sequence and were similar in size to DNA loops extracted from nuclear matrices. However, merbarone did not directly induce the excision of high molecular weight DNA fragments from the nuclear matrix by promoting topoisomerase II-catalyzed DNA cleavage, because the drug inhibited topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage in isolated nuclear matrix preparations. Instead, merbarone induced rapid activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, which included the following temporal sequence of events: dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential within 30 min, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD) by its inhibitor ICAD. The excision of high molecular weight DNA was inhibited at least 80% in merbarone-treated cells preincubated with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk [Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone] and in caspase-resistant Jurkat cells (ICAD/double-mutated) that express a mutant form of ICAD. These results provide evidence that merbarone can induce rapid disorganization of DNA in tumor cells that have a functional mitochondrial apoptosis pathway without inducing extensive DNA cleavage.","['Otake, Yoko', 'Mims, Alice', 'Fernandes, Daniel J']","['Otake Y', 'Mims A', 'Fernandes DJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, 173 Ashley Avenue, P.O.

Mean annualized rates of skin malignancy were calculated, and the relative risk was determined using a Poisson model. Malignancy-free survival rates for nonskin malignancies were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank test. At 5 yr, the median time to a first skin carcinoma was delayed (491 versus 1126 d; log-rank test, P = 0.007), and the risk for an event was significantly lower with SRL-ST therapy (relative risk SRL-ST to SRL-CsA-ST 0.346; 95% confidence interval 0.227 to 0.526; P < 0.001, intention-to-treat analysis).

Two hundred fifty-seven (10.3%) of 2502 patients had NRAS mutations (NRAS(mut)). Most mutations (112 of 257; 43.6%) were found at codon 12, mostly resulting in changes from glycine to asparagine. The history of AML did not differ significantly in association with NRAS mutations. The subgroups with inv(16)/t(16;16) and inv(3)/t(3;3) showed a significantly higher frequency of NRAS(mut) (50 of 133, 37.6% [P < .001], and 11 of 41, 26.8% [P = .004], respectively) than the total cohort. In addition, in these 2 subgroups, mutations of codon 61 were significantly overrepresented (both P < .001). In contrast, NRAS mutations were significantly underrepresented in t(15;17) (2 of 102; 2%; P = .005) in the subgroup with MLL/11q23 rearrangements (3 of 77; 3.9%; P = .061) and in the complex aberrant karyotype (4 of 258; 1.6%; P < .001).

This mutation is inherently resistant to imatinib and, to date, there remains no effective curative therapy for systemic mastocytosis associated with KITD816V. Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a novel orally bioavailable SRC/ABL inhibitor that has activity against multiple imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL isoforms in vitro that is presently showing considerable promise in early-phase clinical trials of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that high nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib can be achieved safely in humans. In this study, we demonstrate significant inhibitory activity of dasatinib against both wild-type KIT and the KITD816V mutation in the nanomolar range in in vitro and cell-based kinase assays. Additionally, dasatinib leads to growth inhibition of a KITD816V-harboring human masto-cytosis cell line. Significantly, dasatinib selectively kills primary neoplastic bone marrow mast cells from patients with systemic mastocytosis while sparing other hematopoietic cells. Computer modeling suggests that the KITD816V mutation destabilizes the inactive conformation of the KIT activation loop to which imatinib binds, but it is not predicted to impair binding of KIT by dasatinib. Based upon our results, further evaluation of dasatinib for the treatment of systemic masto-cytosis in clinical trials is warranted. Moreover, dasatinib may be of clinical utility in other disease settings driven by activating KIT mutations.","['Shah, Neil P', 'Lee, Francis Y', 'Luo, Roger', 'Jiang, Yibin', 'Donker, Marjolein', 'Akin, Cem']","['Shah NP', 'Lee FY', 'Luo R', 'Jiang Y', 'Donker M', 'Akin C']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, The David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Binding Sites', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Ligands', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2006/01/26 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)64948-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-10-3969 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jul 1;108(1):286-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-10-3969.

DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective, observational follow-up study including: (i) acute myeloid leukemia patients treated with moderately to highly emetogenic chemotherapy and (ii) hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, without reduced intensity conditioning. No exclusion criteria were applied. All patients received at least one 5-HT3 antagonist for emesis prophylaxis. Patients recorded emetic episodes and rated nausea daily. Quality of life was assessed through a validated functional living Index-Emesis questionnaire. A survey of caregivers' predictions of CINV was made and the predictions then compared with the observed CINV. RESULTS: One hundred consecutive transplant and 77 acute myeloid leukemia patients were studied. Transplant conditioning was the most important risk factor for CINV: complete response occurred in only 20% of transplant patients (vs. 47% for leukemia patients). Among patients with emesis, the mean percentage of days with emesis and the mean (+/-SD) total number of emetic episodes were 61% and 9.4+/-8.9 (transplant recipients), and 53.6% and 6.2+/-7.3 (leukemia patients), respectively. CINV control was lower in the delayed than in the acute phase. Antiemetic rescue therapy was ineffective. CINV had a deleterious effect on quality of life, especially among transplant recipients. Caregivers underestimated the incidence of delayed nausea and emesis in the transplant setting. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Despite 5-HT3 antagonist prophylaxis, CINV remains a significant problem in oncohematology, especially in the delayed phase and in transplant recipients.","['Lopez-Jimenez, Javier', 'Martin-Ballesteros, Eva', 'Sureda, Anna', 'Uralburu, Carla', 'Lorenzo, Ignacio', 'del Campo, Raquel', 'Fernandez, Cristina', 'Calbacho, Maria', 'Garcia-Belmonte, Daniel', 'Fernandez, Gonzalo']","['Lopez-Jimenez J', 'Martin-Ballesteros E', 'Sureda A', 'Uralburu C', 'Lorenzo I', 'del Campo R', 'Fernandez C', 'Calbacho M', 'Garcia-Belmonte D', 'Fernandez G']","['Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain. jlopezj.hrc@salud.madrid.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Serotonin Antagonists)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea/*chemically induced', 'Prospective Studies', 'Serotonin Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/methods', 'Vomiting/*chemically induced']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Jan;91(1):84-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alongside major histocompatibility complex disparity, the disparity of various polymorphous proteins encoded by several genes may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogenic SCT. However, the biological effect of VNTR disparity has scarcely been studied. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Eighty-four patients receiving an SCT from an HLA-identical sibling (n=68) or an unrelated donor (n=16) were analyzed. The patients were transplanted because of acute myeloid leukemia (ns=48), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=8), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=15), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=18) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n=3). Polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to amplify three VNTR regions (D1S80, D1S111, and D17S5). These regions were classified as fully matched, partially matched, or mismatched between donors recipients. RESULTS: A strong correlation was observed between D1S80 matching status and transplant outcomes in terms of overall survival (p=0.0179) and non-relapse mortality (p=0.0305), but not for the D1S111 or D17S5 disparity. The fully matched D1S80 pairs showed a better overall survival (72% vs 38%) and lower non-relapse mortality (17% vs 50%) compared to the partially matched or mismatched pairs. In multivariate analyses, a fully matched D1S80 pair was found to be an independent favorable prognostic factor for overall survival (p=0.03) and non-relapse mortality (p=0.05). In addition, D1S80 disparity was significantly associated with the occurrence of gut chronic GVHD (p=0.05). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest that disparities in D1S80--located in chromosome 1--are associated with an increased incidence of gut chronic GVHD and non-relapse mortality.","['Kim, Dong Hwan', 'Jung, Hee Du', 'Kwack, Dong Hoon', 'Lee, Nan Young', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Baek, Jin Ho', 'Kim, Jong Gwang', 'Suh, Jang Soo', 'Lee, Kyu Bo', 'Shin, Im Hee']","['Kim DH', 'Jung HD', 'Kwack DH', 'Lee NY', 'Sohn SK', 'Baek JH', 'Kim JG', 'Suh JS', 'Lee KB', 'Shin IH']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Minisatellite Repeats', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Jan;91(1):71-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the determination of the IGVH mutation status is very labor-intensive, alternative prognostically relevant markers would facilitate CLL diagnostics. DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten genes were selected from previously published gene expression profiling studies based on their differential expression in IGVH mutated versus unmutated cases of CLL, and tested with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in unpurified samples from 130 CLL patients. To ascertain potential contaminating effects by normal hematopoietic cells, the expression levels of the selected genes were determined in normal monocytes, B cells, T cells, NK cells and granulocytes. RESULTS: The selected genes, i.e., ZAP70, LPL, SPG20, ADAM29, NRIP1, AKAP12, DMD, SEPT10, TPM2 and CLECSF2, showed prognostic significance. In multivariate logistic regression analysis expression levels of LPL, ZAP70, ADAM29 and SEPT10 were the most predictive for IGVH mutational status. In univariate analysis the expression of LPL was the best predictor. For survival, expression of LPL was the strongest prognostic factor. In combination with the three cytogenetic markers associated with a poor prognosis, i.e., deletions 17p13, 11q22 and trisomy 12, expression of LPL and IGVH mutational status performed equally well with regard to their predictive value for survival, both being more predictive than ZAP70. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that LPL expression is a predictor for survival in CLL, and for this purpose is as good as IGVH mutational status and more reliable than ZAP70 expression when tested in unpurified CLL samples.","[""van't Veer, Mars B"", 'Brooijmans, Anne M', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Verhaaf, Brenda', 'Goudswaard, Chantal S', 'Graveland, Wilfried J', 'van Lom, Kirsten', 'Valk, Peter J M']","[""van't Veer MB"", 'Brooijmans AM', 'Langerak AW', 'Verhaaf B', 'Goudswaard CS', 'Graveland WJ', 'van Lom K', 'Valk PJ']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. m.vantveer@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/enzymology/mortality', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Jan;91(1):56-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: By immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry MAVER-1 displayed a classical MCL phenotype (IgM+, l+, CD5+, CD10-, CD19+, CD20+, CD23-, CD79a+, cyclin D1+) and genetic analysis showed a typical V/D/J rearrangement with naive mutational status. According to both classic cytogenetic analysis and spectral karyotyping, MAVER-1 harbored the t(11;14) translocation associated with a complex karyotype. Molecular analysis by polymerase chain reactions showed that the t(11;14) breakpoint is within the major translocation cluster. Other important abnormalities of MAVER-1 include TP53 gene inactivation by a combined mutation of exon 8 and chromosome 17p13 deletion, ATM deletion, 8q24 (MYC) rearrangement and 8p22 deletion.

The main goal of the present study was to investigate the pharmacological effects of the administration of PEG-ASP given as a first-line product in children with ALL. DESIGN AND METHODS: PEG-ASP serum enzymatic activity and serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of asparagine were investigated in 20 children with newly diagnosed ALL enrolled in the ongoing AIEOP ALL 2000 protocol and treated with PEG-ASP as a first-line ASP preparation. During induction the drug was administered at the dosage of 1,000 U/m2 i.v. on days 12 and 27. During reinduction the drug was administered only once at the same dosage. RESULTS: Among the 20 patients treated in induction serum PEG-ASP activity equalled or exceeded 100 U/L in 18/18, 11/11 and 15/18 of the samples available on days 22, 25 and 27, respectively, and in 16/16, 12/15 and 5/8 samples available on days 36, 39 and 45, respectively. In the 15 patients treated during reinduction serum PEG-ASP activity > or =100 U/L was observed in 14/15, 11/14, 6/10, and 0/12 samples available on days 11, 15, 18 and 23, respectively, after the administration of the drug. Serum asparagine levels were below the detection limit (< or =0.2 microM) in all patients/samples and at all time points evaluated during induction; during reinduction only one patient had detectable asparagine levels from day 11. CSF asparagine levels were below the detection limit of the method only in a few patients during both induction and reinduction. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: PEG-ASP given as a first-line ASP product in the context of an intensive chemotherapy protocol for pediatric ALL allowed adequate plasma enzymatic activity and asparagine depletion during both exposures to the drug.

T-ALL was significantly more resistant to cladribine than B-cell precursor ALL. A paired analysis of 60 AML and 99 ALL samples demonstrated significant cross-resistance between all four deoxynucleoside analogs. Cross-resistance was also observed between ara-C and etoposide (Rp=0.54, p<0.0001), and ara-C and daunorubicin (Rp=0.48, p<0.0001) in AML. In ALL blasts, cross-resistance was observed between ara-C and vincristine (Rp=0.50; p<0.0001), and between ara-C and daunorubicin and L-asparaginase (Rp=0.25; p=0.01; Rp=0.28; p=0.005). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine appears to be a useful drug in AML, particularly in FAB M5. We observed cross-resistance between ara-C and other deoxynucleoside analogs, as well as between ara-C and drugs with different modes of action in childhood acute leukemia.","['Hubeek, Isabelle', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'Broekhuizen, Richard', 'Zwaan, Christian M', 'Kaaijk, Patricia', 'van Wering, Elisabeth S', 'Gibson, Brenda E S', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta E', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L']","['Hubeek I', 'Peters GJ', 'Broekhuizen R', 'Zwaan CM', 'Kaaijk P', 'van Wering ES', 'Gibson BE', 'Creutzig U', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'den Boer ML', 'Pieters R', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Dept. of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. isabelle.hubeek@vumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Nucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Nucleosides/*therapeutic use']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Jan;91(1):17-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies, however, have concentrated on the effects on individual genes. The effects of etoposide on the MLL, RUNX1, and MLLT3 genes were simultaneously studied in the same hemopoietic cell population. We found MLL to be more susceptible to etoposide-induced cleavage than RUNX1 and MLLT3, with maximum cleavage at a lower drug concentration. A higher level of MLL than other gene cleavage was also detected after cellular exposure to all drug concentrations. Greater susceptibility to topoisomerase 2 inhibitor-induced cleavage may explain the more frequent involvement of MLL in treatment-related leukemogenesis.","['Ng, A', 'Taylor, G M', 'Eden, O B']","['Ng A', 'Taylor GM', 'Eden OB']","['Immunogenetics Laboratory, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK M13 3PL. antng@blueyonder.co.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Etoposide/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/03/11 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2005/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(05)00459-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2005.08.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2006 Jan 15;164(2):164-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2005.08.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The existence of der(9) deletion is reported as a powerful indicator of a poor prognosis. So far, der(9) deletion is considered to be generated when the Ph translocation occurs, because when der(9) deletion is found, it is detected in all the Ph-positive (Ph+) cells of a particular CML patient. On FISH examination of 47 Vietnamese CML patients, we found 11 patients carrying der(9) deletion. Among these, two patients harbored Ph+ metaphase cells with der(9) deletion and also Ph+ cells without it. In CML patients with der(9) deletion, reportedly no ABL/BCR transcript is detected. In these two patients, the proportion of Ph+ cells without der(9) deletion was much smaller than that of the cells with der(9) deletion. Nevertheless, we detected a ABL/BCR (1b-b4) transcript in the two patients. This is further evidence for the existence of Ph+ cells without der(9) deletion.

The first, established from pairs of translocated genes (such as BCR and ABL), considers the spatial proximity of loci in interphase nuclei (static ""contact first"" model). The second model is based on the dynamics of double strand break ends during repair processes (dynamic ""breakage first"" model). Since the MLL gene involved in 11q23 translocation has more than 40 partners, the study of the relative positions of the MLL gene with both the most frequent partner gene (AF4) and a less frequent partner gene (ENL), should elucidate the MLL translocation mechanism. METHODS: Using triple labeling 3D FISH experiments, we have determined the relative positions of MLL, AF4 and ENL genes, in two lymphoblastic and two myeloid human cell lines. RESULTS: In all cell lines, the ENL gene is significantly closer to the MLL gene than the AF4 gene (with P value < 0.0001). According to the static ""contact first"" model of the translocation mechanism, a minimal distance between loci would indicate a greater probability of the occurrence of t(11;19)(q23;p13.3) compared to t(4;11)(q21;q23). However this is in contradiction to the epidemiology of 11q23 translocation. CONCLUSION: The simultaneous multi-probe hybridization in 3D-FISH is a new approach in addressing the correlation between spatial proximity and occurrence of translocation. Our observations are not consistent with the static ""contact first"" model of translocation. The recently proposed dynamic ""breakage first"" model offers an attractive alternative explanation.","['Gue, Michael', 'Sun, Jian-Sheng', 'Boudier, Thomas']","['Gue M', 'Sun JS', 'Boudier T']","[""USM 0503, Departement Regulations, Developpement et Diversite Moleculaire, Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, UMR 5153 CNRS-MNHN, U 565 INSERM, 43 rue Cuvier, CP26, 75231 Paris Cedex 05, France. michael.gue@curie.u-psud.fr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Line, Transformed/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Cell Line, Tumor/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Genes', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', '*Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Models, Genetic', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/04/01 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2005/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-6-20 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-6-20 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2006 Jan 24;6:20. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-6-20.,,,,PMC1388228,20060124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we examine the induction of apoptosis by trimidox in several human leukaemia cell lines, focusing on the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase proteases in the human B cell line NALM-6. Induction of apoptosis by trimidox (300 microM) was detected in NALM-6, HL-60 (premyelocytic leukaemia cells), MOLT-4 (an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells), Jurkat (a T-cell leukaemia cells), U937 (expressing many monocyte-like characteristics), and K562 (erythroleukaemia). NALM-6 was most affected by trimidox among leukaemia cells; therefore, we employed NALM-6 cells in the subsequent experiments. The cells showed a time-dependent increase in DNA damage after trimidox (250 microM) treatment. A significant increase in the amount of cytochrome c release was detected after treatment with trimidox. Bcl-2 and Bax protein expressions were not changed by trimidox. Caspase-3 and -9 were activated by incubation with trimidox, whereas caspase-8 was not. Furthermore, trimidox-induced apoptosis was prevented by a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, a caspase-3, and a caspase-9 inhibitor, but not by a caspase-8 inhibitor. Inhibition of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) by SP600125 appreciably protected cells from trimidox-induced apoptosis, but no effect inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by SB203580. In contrast, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 strongly potentiated the apoptotic effect of trimidox. This report shows that the induction of apoptosis by trimidox occurs through a cytochrome c-dependent pathway, which sequentially activates caspase-3 and caspase-9.","['Kanno, Syu-Ichi', 'Uwai, Kohji', 'Tomizawa, Ayako', 'Hiura, Takako', 'Osanai, Yuu', 'Ujibe, Mayuko', 'Takeshita, Mitsuhiro', 'Ohtake, Takaharu', 'Kimura, Katsuhiko', 'Ishikawa, Masaaki']","['Kanno S', 'Uwai K', 'Tomizawa A', 'Hiura T', 'Osanai Y', 'Ujibe M', 'Takeshita M', 'Ohtake T', 'Kimura K', 'Ishikawa M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Cancer Research Institute, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, Komatsushima, Sendai, Japan. syu-kan@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,"['0 (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamidoxime)', '0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Benzamidines)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (U 0126)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-glutamyl-histidyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Anthracenes/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzamidines/*toxicity', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/09/01 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['PTOpto_188 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-7843.2006.pto_188.x [doi]']",ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2006 Jan;98(1):44-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-7843.2006.pto_188.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence from case-control studies and cohort studies on a possible association between atopic dermatitis (AD) and cancer risk, with particular attention to the case definition of AD. METHODS: Studies with quantitative data on the association between AD (eczematous disease) and cancer risk were obtained from MEDLINE in combination with a review of cited references. RESULTS: In 23 publications, AD was implicated in the risk of haematological [childhood leukaemia (n = 3), adult leukaemia (n = 3), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; n = 4) and different haematological cancers (n = 1)], pancreatic (n = 5), skin (n = 2) and brain malignancies (n = 5). The overall picture of the results of these studies shows that a history of AD may be associated with a decreased risk of pancreatic cancer, brain tumour and childhood leukaemia, although in most instances the findings were not statistically significant. No consistent associations were observed for skin cancer or NHL. The definition of AD had varying quality, and was imprecise in the majority of publications. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the epidemiological studies tend to support a lower risk of cancer among persons with a history of AD. Although a more careful definition of AD is needed, these epidemiological studies could provide an estimate of the background cancer risk in patients with AD when the long-term effects of treatments for AD are assessed.","['Wang, H', 'Diepgen, T L']","['Wang H', 'Diepgen TL']","['Department of Clinical Social Medicine, Occupational and Environmental Dermatology, University of Heidelberg, Thibaut Str. 3, 69115 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/complications/prevention & control', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/*complications', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*complications/prevention & control', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications/prevention & control', 'Risk Assessment', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/06/09 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJD7077 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.07077.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2006 Feb;154(2):205-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.07077.x.,,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviral vectors have been successfully used ex vivo to transduce hematopoietic precursors from patients with two forms of SCID, namely X-linked SCID and ADA deficiency. Fifteen out of 16 patients with XL-SCID and 4 out of 4 patients with ADA deficiency have benefited from gene therapy. Correction of the immunodeficiency has been maintained now for 6 years in the first patients to be treated. These results provide clear-cut proof of the principle of gene therapy in relevant clinical models. However, three patients with XL-SCID have developed a severe complication after gene therapy, consisting of leukemia-like clonal lymphocyte proliferation. One of the three patients has died from this complication. It is due to provirus insertion within or close to proto-oncogenes, and to the enhancer activity of the viral LTR on targeted proto-oncogenes. Vector modifications, based mostly on inactivating the enhancer activity of the LTR, should preserve efficacy while improving safety.","['Fischer, Alain', 'Hacein-Bey-Abina, Salima', 'Lagresle, Chantal', 'Garrigue, Alexandrine', 'Cavazana-Calvo, Marina']","['Fischer A', 'Hacein-Bey-Abina S', 'Lagresle C', 'Garrigue A', 'Cavazana-Calvo M']","[""INSERM U 429, Unite d'Immunologie et Hematologie Pediatrique et Departement de Biotherapie, Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, 149 rue de Sevres, 75015 Paris. alain.fischer@nck.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Bull Acad Natl Med,Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine,7503383,,IM,"['Female', 'Genetic Therapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*genetics/*therapy', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2006/01/26 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2006/01/26 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Acad Natl Med. 2005 May;189(5):779-85; discussion 786-8.,,,"Therapie genique des deficits immunitaires severes: preuve de principe d'efficacite et problemes souleves.

Each cohort was identified from various independent sources and followed using nationwide population and mortality registries. Cancers were ascertained by linkage with nationwide cancer registries. Overall, 75 incident cancers were identified in the Estonian cohort and 80 in the Latvian cohort. The combined-cohort standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for all cancers was 1.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.98-1.34) and for leukemia, 1.53 (95% CI = 0.62-3.17; n = 7).

However, there was no evidence of a dose response for any of these sites, and the relationship to radiation exposure remains to be established. Excess of thyroid cancer cases observed may have been due to screening, the leukemia cases included 2 unconfirmed diagnoses, and the excess cases of brain tumors may have been a chance finding. There was an indication of increased risk associated with early entry to the Chernobyl area and late follow-up, though not statistically significant.

GD3 can also promote apoptosis when externally added to cells. Previous studies showed that the proapoptotic effects of GD3 can be counteracted by 9-O-acetylation. To determine whether 9-O-acetyl GD3 (acGD3) has a general antiapoptotic potential, the apoptosis-sensitive Jurkat cell line and an apoptosis-sensitive variant of the cell line Molt-4 were preincubated with micromolar concentrations of acGD3 and then treated with inducers of apoptosis. A reduced apoptotic index and an increased cell viability were observed. On the other hand, when the Jurkat cells were treated with GD3 for extended periods of time, a population was selected that was resistant to apoptosis induction by N-acetyl sphingosine as well as by the anti-leukemic drug daunorubicin. Comparative analysis of gangliosides revealed the formation of acGD3 in the resistant Jurkat cells that was not found in the apoptosis-sensitive cells. Conversely, exposing the acGD3 positive and apoptosis-resistant cell line Molt-4 to the O-deacetylating activity of salicylate resulted in a complete disappearance of acGD3 and an enhanced sensitivity to N-acetyl sphingosine-mediated apoptosis. Formation of acGD3 might thus represent a new mechanism how tumor cells can escape apoptosis.","['Kniep, Bernhard', 'Kniep, Eva', 'Ozkucur, Nurdan', 'Barz, Steffen', 'Bachmann, Michael', 'Malisan, Florence', 'Testi, Roberto', 'Rieber, Ernst Peter']","['Kniep B', 'Kniep E', 'Ozkucur N', 'Barz S', 'Bachmann M', 'Malisan F', 'Testi R', 'Rieber EP']","['Institute of Immunology, Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany. b_kniep@rcs.urz.tu-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '98743-26-1 (9-O-acetyl-GD3 ganglioside)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gangliosides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2006/01/25 09:00,2006/06/03 09:00,['2006/01/25 09:00'],"['2006/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21788 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Jul 1;119(1):67-73. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21788.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Size measurements of nocodazole-inhibited cells now fully confirm this prediction. Further, release from nocodazole inhibition does not produce cells that move through the cell cycle mimicking the passage of normal unperturbed cells through the cell cycle. Nocodazole, an archetypal whole-culture synchronization method, can inhibit growth to produce cells with a G2-phase amount of DNA, but such cells are not synchronized. Cells produced by a selective (i.e., non-whole-culture) method not only have a specific DNA content, but also have a narrow size distribution. The current view of cell-cycle control that is based on methods that are not suitable for cell-cycle analysis must therefore be reconsidered when results are based on whole-culture synchronization.","['Cooper, Stephen', 'Iyer, Geetha', 'Tarquini, Michael', 'Bissett, Patrick']","['Cooper S', 'Iyer G', 'Tarquini M', 'Bissett P']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0620, USA. cooper@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nocodazole/*pharmacology']",2006/01/25 09:00,2007/03/29 09:00,['2006/01/25 09:00'],"['2005/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00441-005-0118-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2006 May;324(2):237-42. doi: 10.1007/s00441-005-0118-8.

Radiographs of the left hand were obtained and used for DXR. DXA of the total body and of the lumbar spine was performed. RESULTS: In both study populations significant correlations between DXR and DXA were found, and, with the exception of the correlation between DXR bone mineral density (DXR-BMD) and bone mineral apparent density in the GHD population, all correlations had a P-value of <0.001. During treatment a change in DXR-BMD was found in children with GHD.

This block is based on its capacity to inactivate target genes by recruiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methyltransferase activities. Here we report that MBD1, a member of a conserved family of proteins able to bind methylated DNA, cooperates with PML-RARalpha in transcriptional repression and cellular transformation. PML-RARalpha recruits MBD1 to its target promoter through an HDAC3-mediated mechanism. Binding of HDAC3 and MBD1 is not confined to the promoter region but instead is spread over the locus. Knock-down of HDAC3 expression by RNA interference in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells alleviates PML-RAR-induced promoter silencing. We further demonstrate that retroviral expression of dominant-negative mutants of MBD1 in hematopoietic precursors compromises the ability of PML-RARalpha to block their differentiation and thus restored cell differentiation. Our results demonstrate that PML-RARalpha functions by recruiting an HDAC3-MBD1 complex that contributes to the establishment and maintenance of the silenced chromatin state.","['Villa, Raffaella', 'Morey, Lluis', 'Raker, Veronica A', 'Buschbeck, Marcus', 'Gutierrez, Arantxa', 'De Santis, Francesca', 'Corsaro, Massimo', 'Varas, Florencio', 'Bossi, Daniela', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Di Croce, Luciano']","['Villa R', 'Morey L', 'Raker VA', 'Buschbeck M', 'Gutierrez A', 'De Santis F', 'Corsaro M', 'Varas F', 'Bossi D', 'Minucci S', 'Pelicci PG', 'Di Croce L']","['Centre de Regulacio Genomica, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Passeig Maritim 37-49, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MBD1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromatin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*physiology']",2006/01/25 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2006/01/25 09:00'],"['2006/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['0509343103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0509343103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jan 31;103(5):1400-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0509343103.

We have analyzed the consequences of retroviral transduction in T cells from leukemic patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation and donor lymphocytes genetically modified with a suicide gene (HSV-TK). Retroviral vectors integrate preferentially within or near transcribed regions of the genome, with a preference for sequences around promoters and for genes active in T cells at the time of transduction. Quantitative transcript analysis shows that one fifth of these integrations affect the expression of nearby genes. However, transduced T cell populations maintain remarkably stable gene expression profiles, phenotype, biological functions, and immune repertoire in vivo, with no evidence of clonal selection up to 9 yr after administration. Analysis of integrated proviruses in transduced cells before and after transplantation indicates that integrations interfering with normal T cell function are more likely to lead to clonal ablation than expansion in vivo. Despite the potentially dangerous interactions with the T cell genome, retroviral integration has therefore little consequence on the safety and efficacy of T cell transplantation.","['Recchia, Alessandra', 'Bonini, Chiara', 'Magnani, Zulma', 'Urbinati, Fabrizia', 'Sartori, Daniela', 'Muraro, Sara', 'Tagliafico, Enrico', 'Bondanza, Attilio', 'Stanghellini, Maria Teresa Lupo', 'Bernardi, Massimo', 'Pescarollo, Alessandra', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Bordignon, Claudio', 'Mavilio, Fulvio']","['Recchia A', 'Bonini C', 'Magnani Z', 'Urbinati F', 'Sartori D', 'Muraro S', 'Tagliafico E', 'Bondanza A', 'Stanghellini MT', 'Bernardi M', 'Pescarollo A', 'Ciceri F', 'Bordignon C', 'Mavilio F']","['Cancer Immunotherapy and Gene Therapy Program, and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Istituto Scientifico H.

Consequently, inhibition of STAT-mediated signaling has recently been proposed as a potential new therapeutic approach to the treatment of cancers. Having shown previously that the pan-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol binds to DNA and seems to kill cancer cells via that process in some circumstances, we evaluated the hypothesis that flavopiridol might consequently disrupt STAT3/DNA interactions, attenuate STAT3-directed transcription, and down-regulate STAT3 downstream polypeptides, including the antiapoptotic polypeptide Mcl-1. SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting and reverse transcription-PCR were used to assess RNA and polypeptide levels, respectively. DNA cellulose affinity chromatography and a nuclear elution assay were used to evaluate the ability of flavopiridol to disrupt STAT3/DNA interactions. A STAT3 luciferase reporter assay was used to examine the ability of flavopiridol to attenuate STAT3-directed transcription. Colony-forming assays were used to assess cytotoxic synergy between flavopiridol and AG490. Flavopiridol was found to (a) disrupt STAT3/DNA interactions (DNA cellulose affinity chromatography and nuclear elution assay), (b) attenuate STAT3-directed transcription (STAT3 luciferase reporter assay), and (c) down-regulate the STAT3 downstream antiapoptotic polypeptide Mcl-1 at the transcriptional level (reverse transcription-PCR and SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting). Furthermore, flavopiridol, but not the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel, could be combined with the STAT3 pathway inhibitor AG490 to achieve cytotoxic synergy in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells. Collectively, these data suggest that flavopiridol can attenuate STAT3-directed transcription in a targeted fashion and may therefore be exploitable clinically in the development of chemotherapy regimens combining flavopiridol and other inhibitors of STAT3 signaling pathways.","['Lee, Yean Kit', 'Isham, Crescent R', 'Kaufman, Scott H', 'Bible, Keith C']","['Lee YK', 'Isham CR', 'Kaufman SH', 'Bible KC']","['Division of Developmental Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street Southwest, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/pathology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/drug effects/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology']",2006/01/25 09:00,2006/03/11 09:00,['2006/01/25 09:00'],"['2006/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['5/1/138 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0235 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2006 Jan;5(1):138-48. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0235.,['CA097129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we sought to establish whether BLyS levels were elevated in patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and to determine whether elevated BLyS levels correlated with clinical characteristics of the disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Specimens were collected from the peripheral blood of individuals diagnosed with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL; n = 70) or from age- and sex-matched patients seen at the same institution (n = 41). Serum BLyS levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and sequencing of the BLyS promoter was performed by conventional methods and confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: We found that elevated BLyS levels were more common in patients with familial B-CLL than individuals with sporadic B-CLL or normal controls. Because of this association, we sequenced the BLyS promoter in patients with B-CLL and normal controls and identified a polymorphic site, -871 C/T. We found that the wild-type sequence was significantly underrepresented in patients with familial B-CLL (4%) compared with patients with sporadic B-CLL (30%; P = .01) or controls (24%; P = .04). Furthermore, using a luciferase reporter under control of the BLyS promoter containing either a C or a T at position -871, we found that the reporter construct containing a T at -871 had a 2.6-fold increase in activity (P = .004). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest serum BLyS levels are elevated in patients with familial B-CLL and that elevated BLyS levels correlate with the presence of a T at -871 in the BLyS promoter.","['Novak, Anne J', 'Grote, Deanna M', 'Ziesmer, Steven C', 'Kline, Michael P', 'Manske, Michelle K', 'Slager, Susan', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Shanafelt, Tait', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Gross, Jane A', 'Harder, Brandon', 'Dillon, Stacey R', 'Ansell, Stephen M']","['Novak AJ', 'Grote DM', 'Ziesmer SC', 'Kline MP', 'Manske MK', 'Slager S', 'Witzig TE', 'Shanafelt T', 'Call TG', 'Kay NE', 'Jelinek DF', 'Cerhan JR', 'Gross JA', 'Harder B', 'Dillon SR', 'Ansell SM']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Cell Activating Factor', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*blood/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*blood/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",2006/01/25 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/01/25 09:00'],"['2006/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.02.7938 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.02.7938 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Feb 20;24(6):983-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.7938.

Receptor tyrosine kinases not only mediate tumor growth but also initiate adverse signaling in heart failure. We investigated whether imatinib, by inhibiting the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRbeta), prevents cardiac and renal damage in TGR(mRen2)27 (Ren2) rats. Eight-week-old male homozygous Ren2 and Sprague Dawley rats were treated either with imatinib (30 mg/kg; STI-571) or placebo for 8 weeks (Ren2 n=12 for each group; Sprague Dawley n=6 for each group). Imatinib did not affect blood pressure or left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in both groups. Imatinib attenuated the decline in fractional shortening (imatinib versus Ren2 placebo 45+/-4.5% versus 32+/-3%; n=7-11; P<0.05) and in diastolic function in Ren2 rats (baseline diastolic dP/dt corrected for systolic blood pressure Ren2 imatinib versus Ren2 placebo 38.6+/-0.67 versus 35.3+/-0.41 [1 . s(-1)]; n=7-11; P<0.05). This was associated with decreased cardiac fibrosis and decreased activation of PDGFRbeta and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Renal microvascular hypertrophy and perivascular fibrosis in Ren2 rats were significantly decreased by imatinib. In vitro, imatinib blocked angiotensin II-induced activation of the PDGFRbeta and significantly decreased fibroblast proliferation and collagen production. In conclusion, imatinib did not affect LV hypertrophy but attenuated the decline in cardiac function and reduced renal microvascular damage associated with reduced activation of the PDGFRbeta. The simultaneous improvement in both heart and kidneys suggests that inhibition of the PDGFRbeta has broad protective effects that may provide novel avenues for a blood pressure-independent protection against end-organ damage.","['Schellings, Mark W M', 'Baumann, Marcus', 'van Leeuwen, Rick E W', 'Duisters, Rudy F J J', 'Janssen, Suzanne H P', 'Schroen, Blanche', 'Peutz-Kootstra, Carine J', 'Heymans, Stephane', 'Pinto, Yigal M']","['Schellings MW', 'Baumann M', 'van Leeuwen RE', 'Duisters RF', 'Janssen SH', 'Schroen B', 'Peutz-Kootstra CJ', 'Heymans S', 'Pinto YM']","['Experimental and Molecular Cardiology, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, University Hospital Maastricht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hypertension,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",7906255,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Ren2 protein, mouse)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 3.4.23.15 (Renin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Arterioles/drug effects/pathology', 'Benzamides', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibrosis', 'Heart Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Hemodynamics/drug effects', '*Homozygote', 'Hypertension/complications/*genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kidney/blood supply', 'Kidney Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Kidney Glomerulus/drug effects/pathology', 'Kidney Tubules/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Myocardium/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Renin/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']",2006/01/25 09:00,2006/03/18 09:00,['2006/01/25 09:00'],"['2006/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['01.HYP.0000202487.68969.f7 [pii]', '10.1161/01.HYP.0000202487.68969.f7 [doi]']",ppublish,Hypertension. 2006 Mar;47(3):467-74. doi: 10.1161/01.HYP.0000202487.68969.f7.

Over the past few years, a number of animal studies have demonstrated the critical role of these cells in the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). In these models, T(reg) can exert a potent suppressive effect on immune effector cells reactive to host antigens and prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD) while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia effect (GVL). The present review summarizes current knowledge on the role of T(reg) populations in humans following allogeneic HCT. Recent investigations focusing on T(reg) in transplant patients have generated conflicting results mostly due to the use of different parameters to assess T(reg). Nonetheless, these studies suggested that an imbalance between T(reg) and effector cells during immune reconstitution can substantially impair regulatory mechanisms and contributes to the development of GVHD. Building on these studies, a number of therapeutic strategies are being developed to positively modulate T(reg) pools in vivo and prevent or even correct GVHD. Conversely, clinical interventions can also be envisaged to decrease T(reg) activity in vivo and enhance the GVL effect. These potential strategies are discussed herein. Coming years will undoubtedly yield additional knowledge on how to use T(reg) subsets in vivo and successfully control and modulate immune responses in patients post-HCT.","['Zorn, Emmanuel']",['Zorn E'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 44 Binney Street, MA 02115, USA. emmanuel.zorn@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology']",2006/01/25 09:00,2006/05/18 09:00,['2006/01/25 09:00'],"['2006/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1044-579X(05)00078-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semcancer.2005.11.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 2006 Apr;16(2):150-9. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2005.11.008.

The phase oscillations predicted by the model are observed experimentally and the timing of a second camptothecin pulse is shown to significantly alter the overall treatment effectiveness. To explore the feasibility of designing resonance chemotherapeutic treatments to preferentially eliminate one cell type over another, Jurkat and HL60 leukemia cells are exposed to the same dual-pulse camptothecin treatment regimen. With the model framework validated for simplified cases, the model is used to extrapolate the effectiveness of resonance chemotherapy considering in vivo effects such as quiescence, drug metabolism, drug properties, and transport considerations that were not included in the in vitro experiments.

Unfortunately, relatively little is known about how cell differentiation is regulated. JWA (AF070523) is a novel all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) responsible gene that initially isolated from ATRA-treated primary human tracheal bronchial epithelial cells. For the notable performance achieved by ATRA in the differentiation induction therapy, we investigated the role of JWA in the induction of differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells. Our results showed that JWA was not only regulated by ATRA but also by several other differentiation inducers such as phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (TPA), arabinoside (Ara-C), and hemin, involved in the mechanisms of differentiation along different lineages of myeloid leukemia cells arrested at different stages of development. Generally, JWA was up-regulated by these inducers in a time-dependent manner. Inhibition of JWA by RNA interference decreased the induced cellular differentiation. However, in NB4 cells treated with ATRA, dissimilar with others, the expression of JWA was down-regulated, and the induced cellular differentiation could be enhanced by silencing of JWA. Collectively, JWA works as a potential critical molecule, associated with multi-directional differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells. In NB4 cells, JWA may function as a lineage-restricted gene during differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage-like or granulocytic pathway.","['Huang, Shu', 'Shen, Qun', 'Mao, Wen-Ge', 'Li, Ai-Ping', 'Ye, Jian', 'Liu, Qi-Zhan', 'Zou, Chang-Ping', 'Zhou, Jian-Wei']","['Huang S', 'Shen Q', 'Mao WG', 'Li AP', 'Ye J', 'Liu QZ', 'Zou CP', 'Zhou JW']","['Department of Molecular Toxicology, The Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics and Applied Toxicology, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, 140 Hanzhong Road, Nanjing 210029, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (ARL6IP5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Hemin/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2006/01/25 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2006/01/25 09:00'],"['2005/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)00046-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.197 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 Mar 10;341(2):440-50. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.197.

It is also useful for staging of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as diagnosing recurrence. The diagnosis of leukemia on FNA samples from deep-seated lymphadenopathy poses an even greater challenge. Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an uncommon, but distinct, lympho-proliferative disorder of B cell origin. It usually affects the spleen and bone marrow and uncommonly involves lymph nodes. There are only a few cases reported where HCL was diagnosed on FNA specimens. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the first case of HCL accurately rendered on EUS-FNA samples. CONCLUSION: This report underscores the concept that the presence of a cytopathologist in the endoscopy suite plays an important role in providing accurate diagnoses of lymphoid lesions biopsied with EUS-FNA.","['Meara, Regina S', 'Reddy, Vishnu', 'Arnoletti, Juan Pablo', 'Jhala, Darshana', 'Varadarajulu, Shyam', 'Jhala, Nirag']","['Meara RS', 'Reddy V', 'Arnoletti JP', 'Jhala D', 'Varadarajulu S', 'Jhala N']","['Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA. rschmidt@path.uab.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytojournal,CytoJournal,101231642,,,,2006/01/25 09:00,2006/01/25 09:01,['2006/01/25 09:00'],"['2005/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/25 09:01 [medline]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-6413-3-1 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-6413-3-1 [doi]']",epublish,Cytojournal. 2006 Jan 23;3:1. doi: 10.1186/1742-6413-3-1.,,,,PMC1402319,20060123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one children with cancer undergoing a first course of immunosuppressive chemotherapy and 30 healthy control children were included in the study. Samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 of the cure (and equivalent dates in controls). Susceptibility to antibiotics was tested using an agar dilution method and galleries with predefined concentrations of selected antibiotics. RESULTS: There was a significant drop in the total anaerobic cultivable flora on day 14 and in the prevalence of Capnocytophaga on days 14 and 21 in the children with cancer. The proportion of Capnocytophaga in the anaerobic flora, however, was high in certain cancer patients. Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, imipenem, clindamycin, and tetracycline were the most effective against Capnocytophaga. CONCLUSION: This study showed that Capnocytophaga decreased in prevalence and proportion in the dental plaque of cancer patients during chemotherapy but became predominant in some cases. It is recommended that imipenem or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations be used to treat Capnocytophaga bacteraemia.","['Sixou, J L', 'Aubry-Leuliette, A', 'De Medeiros-Battista, O', 'Lejeune, S', 'Jolivet-Gougeon, A', 'Solhi-Pinsard, H', 'Gandemer, V', 'Barbosa-Rogier, M', 'Bonnaure-Mallet, M']","['Sixou JL', 'Aubry-Leuliette A', 'De Medeiros-Battista O', 'Lejeune S', 'Jolivet-Gougeon A', 'Solhi-Pinsard H', 'Gandemer V', 'Barbosa-Rogier M', 'Bonnaure-Mallet M']","['Department of Paediatric Dentistry, Rennes Cedex, France. jean-louis.sixou@univ-rennes1.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Paediatr Dent,International journal of paediatric dentistry,9107511,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Infective Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Capnocytophaga/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Dental Plaque/*microbiology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2006/01/25 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/01/25 09:00'],"['2006/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['IPD697 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-263X.2006.00697.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Paediatr Dent. 2006 Mar;16(2):75-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-263X.2006.00697.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We have examined the ultrastructure and cytomorphological features of MC derived from cord blood cells, neoplastic bone marrow MC in patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM, n = 4), myelomastocytic leukaemia (MML, n = 2), mast cell leukaemia (MCL, n = 2) and tryptase-positive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n = 4). RESULTS: Based on their ultrastructure and morphology, four distinct cell types could be delineated: (i) mature well-granulated tissue MC exhibiting a round central nucleus; (ii) atypical MC type I with oval nuclei, hypogranulated cytoplasm, and prominent surface projections; (iii) immature atypical MC with bi- or polylobed nuclei (atypical MC type II = promastocytes); and (iv) metachromatic blasts. Type I atypical MC were detected in a patient with indolent SM, whereas type II MC and metachromatic blasts were primarily found in MML, MCL and tryptase-positive AML. In all samples examined, the identity of MC could be reconfirmed by immunoelectron microscopy, irrespective of the stage of cell maturation or the disease variant, all types of MC contained tryptase in their cytoplasmic granules.

METHOD AND RESULTS: A polyclonal antibody to the C terminus of CD19 was used to immunostain paraffin-embedded samples of normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissues. CD19 was widely expressed in normal B cells and in extramedullary plasma cells. It was found in most B-cell neoplasms, but expression in follicular lymphoma was weak (33/69) or negative (four cases). Similarly, CD19 expression in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas was weak (28/56) or negative (eight cases). In T-cell-rich B-cell lymphomas, CD19 was also weak (4/10) or negative (three cases). CD19 was often absent in post-transplant B lymphoproliferative disease, classical Hodgkin's disease and plasma cell neoplasms. An unexpected finding was the frequent absence of CD19 in the neoplastic cells in lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease. CONCLUSIONS: CD19 can now be detected in routine biopsy specimens. In contrast to the classical pan-B marker CD20, CD19 is not always strongly expressed in B-cell neoplasms.

Similarly, an increased bone marrow zeta-chain associated protein kinase-70 (ZAP-70) expression was seen in patients with high serum sCD23 levels (P = 0.009, correlation co-efficient was 0.714). Cumulative and the progression free survivals of the patients with low serum sCD23 levels were 60.1 +/- 5.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI); 49.0-71.2] and 51.1 +/- 6.6 months (95% CI; 38.0-64.1), respectively. However, they were 43.8 +/- 6.5 months (95% CI; 31.0-56.6) and 26.5 +/- 6.4 months (95% CI; 14.0-39.1) in patients with high levels. Serum sCD23 is increased in B-CLL patients and can be used in the clinical follow-up of the disease in prediction of the tumor mass and prognosis.","['Saka, B', 'Aktan, M', 'Sami, U', 'Oner, D', 'Sanem, O', 'Dincol, G']","['Saka B', 'Aktan M', 'Sami U', 'Oner D', 'Sanem O', 'Dincol G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey. sakab@medscape.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/blood/diagnosis/mortality/secondary', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/diagnosis/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, IgE/*blood', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/blood']",2006/01/25 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/01/25 09:00'],"['2006/01/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLH750 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2257.2006.00750.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2006 Feb;28(1):30-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2257.2006.00750.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We have integrated a PROAFTN method and developed a web-based clinical decision support system using standard JSP, servlets, and XML technologies. All website data are database-driven; and the database system can handle data store, update, and retrieval instantly. Since the system was moved to a web server, we have started our experimental testing on 191 AL cases. RESULTS: The percentage of correct classification in this experimental testing was consistent with the proposed prototype. 96.4% of AL cases were correctly classified, proving that web-integration can be a promising tool for dissemination of CDSS tools. We found our system to be robust and capable of deployment for referring physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental results suggest that the Internet has promise as a means for distribution of CDSS tools. This system will help to: 1) make a ""virtual"" diagnosis and to compare its performances with given clinical diagnosis; 2) exchange health information between physicians and hematologists at the location and time of need; 3) assist online learning and simulate cases for training practitioners; 4) implement a strict security and access control for transmission of electronic health data through the Internet.

According to World Health Organization the exclusion includes all neoplastic disorders in which eosinophils are part of the neoplastic clone. Excluded should be also T cell population with aberant phenotype and abnormal cytokine production, recently considert also as ""lymphocytic"" variants of the HES [42]. HES has to be reclassified as chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) when there is evidence for clonality based on the presence of chromosomal abnormalities or inactivation of X-chromosome in female patients. The successful empiric treatment of patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Glivec) suggested the presence of an imatinib-sensitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The identification of a specific intersticial chromosome deletion del(4)(q12;q12) creating the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene confirmed this hypothesis. Patients carrying this gene should be reclassified as CEL and detection of this gene is a positive predictor for response to imatinib therapy. Effective doses of imatinib are 100 mg/day. The side effects are minimal. The only exception is an acute left ventricular dysfunction which has been reported in three patients within the first week of treatment with imatinib. Imatinib has been successfully used also in some patients with the constitutively activated thyrosine kinase ETV6-PDGFRbeta [1] and in systemic mast cell disease associated with eosinophilia.

It is a dual inhibitor of topoisomerases I and II which impairs the binding of the enzyme to DNA, but does not stabilize the cleavage complex. Nevertheless, both etoposide and tafluposide induce DNA strand breaks and are potent pro-apoptotic agents. In this study, we have compared the cellular response of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells treated with etoposide and tafluposide. We show that tafluposide induces delayed, but extensive, DNA strand breaks, whereas etoposide provokes rapid and massive DNA damage. The two drugs trigger similar types of alterations at the mitochondrial and cell cycle levels, and lead to the generation of comparable levels of reactive oxygen species, but with different kinetics. Our data suggest that modification of the mitochondrial mass plays an important role in apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging anti-cancer agents, at least in the epipodophyllotoxin series. We suggest that drug-induced mitochondrial alterations can be divided into three successive steps: (i) hyperpolarization, (ii) depolarization and (iii) increase of the mitochondrial mass.","['Kluza, Jerome', 'Mazinghien, Romain', 'Irwin, Helen', 'Hartley, John A', 'Bailly, Christian']","['Kluza J', 'Mazinghien R', 'Irwin H', 'Hartley JA', 'Bailly C']","['INSERM U524, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, Lille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'QN043X3ZDW (tafluposide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Naphthalenes/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrans/*therapeutic use', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/06/28 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['00001813-200602000-00006 [pii]', '10.1097/00001813-200602000-00006 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2006 Feb;17(2):155-64. doi: 10.1097/00001813-200602000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to investigate whether either continuous or intermittent exposure of these cells to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in vitro can overcome this limitation to the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CD34(+) leukemic cells were isolated from six newly diagnosed chronic phase CML patients and cultured for 12 days in serum-free medium with or without G-CSF and/or imatinib mesylate present either continuously or intermittently (three cycles of G-CSF for 0, 1, or 4 days +/- imatinib mesylate for 0, 3, or 4 days). Every 4 days, the number of residual undivided viable cells and the total number of viable cells present were measured. RESULTS: Intermittent but not continuous exposure to G-CSF significantly accelerated the disappearance in vitro of initially quiescent CD34(+) CML cells. This resulted in 3- and 5-fold fewer of these cells remaining after 8 and 12 days, respectively, relative to continuous imatinib mesylate alone (P < 0.04). Cultures containing imatinib mesylate and intermittently added G-CSF also showed the greatest reduction in the total number of cells present after 12 days (5-fold more than imatinib mesylate alone). CONCLUSION: Intermittent exposure to G-CSF can enhance the effect of imatinib mesylate on CML cells by specifically targeting the primitive quiescent leukemic elements. A protocol for treating chronic-phase CML patients with imatinib mesylate that incorporates intermittent G-CSF exposure may offer a novel strategy for obtaining improved responses in vivo.","['Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Copland, Mhairi', 'Allan, Elaine K', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Eaves, Allen', 'Eaves, Connie', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Jorgensen HG', 'Copland M', 'Allan EK', 'Jiang X', 'Eaves A', 'Eaves C', 'Holyoake TL']","['Section of Experimental Haematology, Division of Cancer Sciences and Molecular Pathology, University of Glasgow, Queen Elizabeth Building, Royal Infirmary, 10 Alexandra Parade, Glasgow G31 2ER, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/03/01 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/2/626 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0429 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 15;12(2):626-33. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0429.,"['G84/6317/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'SCD/04/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hRFC gene is regulated by six noncoding exons (A1/A2 and A to E) and multiple promoters. In ALL, hRFC-A1/A2 and hRFC-B are the major transcript forms. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: RNAs from 18 ALL lymphoblast specimens and 10 nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient ALL xenografts were assayed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR for hRFC-A1/A2 and hRFC-B transcripts and for transcripts encoding USF1, GATA1, Sp1, and Ikaros transcription factors. For the xenografts, gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays assessed transcription factor binding to the hRFC-A1/A2 and hRFC-B promoters. CpG methylation density within a 334-bp region, including the core hRFC-B promoter, was established by bisulfite sequencing. hRFC-A1/A2 and hRFC-B promoter polymorphisms were assayed by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: For the 28 ALLs, hRFC-A1/A2 and hRFC-B transcripts spanned a 546-fold range. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays, binding was confirmed for USF1 and GATA1 for hRFC-A1/A2, and for Sp1, USF1, and Ikaros for hRFC-B. hRFC transcript levels correlated with those for GATA1 and USF1 for hRFC-A1/A2 and with Sp1 and USF1 transcripts for hRFC-B. CpG methylation in ALL did not correlate with hRFC-B transcripts. In 40 ALL and 17 non-ALL specimens, 2 cosegregating high-frequency polymorphisms (T-1309/C-1217 and C-1309/T-1217; allelic frequencies of 36% and 64%, respectively) were detected in the A1/A2 promoter; none were detected in promoter B.

This form of resistance, termed de novo drug resistance, occurs independent of chronic exposure to cancer-related therapies and likely promotes the development of multidrug resistance. Consequently, it is of major interest to identify compounds or drug combinations that can overcome environment-mediated resistance. In this study, we investigated the activity of tipifarnib (Zarnestra, formerly R115777) combined with bortezomib (Velcade, formerly PS-341) in microenvironment models of multiple myeloma and AML. The combination proved to be synergistic in multiple myeloma and AML cell lines treated in suspension culture. Even in tumor cells relatively resistant to tipifarnib, combined activity was maintained. Tipifarnib and bortezomib were also effective when multiple myeloma and AML cells were adhered to fibronectin, providing evidence that the combination overcomes cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). Of importance, activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response was enhanced and correlated with apoptosis and reversal of CAM-DR. Multiple myeloma and AML cells cocultured with bone marrow stromal cells also remained sensitive, although stromal-adhered tumor cells were partially protected (relative to cells in suspension or fibronectin adhered). Evaluation of the combination using a transwell apparatus revealed that stromal cells produce a protective soluble factor. Investigations are under way to identify the cytokines and/or growth factors involved. In summary, our study provides the preclinical rationale for trials testing the tipifarnib and bortezomib combination in patients with multiple myeloma and AML.","['Yanamandra, Niranjan', 'Colaco, Nandita M', 'Parquet, Nancy A', 'Buzzeo, Robert W', 'Boulware, David', 'Wright, Gabriela', 'Perez, Lia E', 'Dalton, William S', 'Beaupre, Darrin M']","['Yanamandra N', 'Colaco NM', 'Parquet NA', 'Buzzeo RW', 'Boulware D', 'Wright G', 'Perez LE', 'Dalton WS', 'Beaupre DM']","['Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, Malignant Hematology, Experimental Therapeutics, and Bone Marrow Transplant Divisions, H.

Late results, toxicity, and second tumor incidence were reviewed in all the patients treated. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The drugs of three previous alternating regimens [CAD (lomustine, melphalan, and vindesine), MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone), and ABV (doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine)] were intensified and hybridized, the cumulative dose of mechlorethamine was lowered, and irradiation was delivered to no more than two sites either bulky or partially responding to chemotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 307 previously untreated advanced-stage patients underwent MOPPEBVCAD chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was delivered to 118 of 307 patients (38%). Remission was complete in 290 patients (94%). With a median follow-up of 114 months, 10-year overall, disease-free, and failure-free survival rates were 79%, 84%, and 71%, respectively. Forty-two patients relapsed and 60 died. The causes of death were Hodgkin's lymphoma in 36 patients, second neoplasms in 12, cardiorespiratory diseases in 4, pulmonary diseases in 2, and unknown in 6. Sixteen second tumors (of which nine were myelodysplasia and/or acute leukemia) were diagnosed in all. Outside this series of 307 patients, MOPPEBVCAD obtained complete responses in 12 of 15 relapsed and 9 of 9 refractory patients who had previously been treated with other regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical response and long-term results are very satisfactory, whereas the second tumor incidence was lower than would have been expected with MOPP analogues. Given its response/late toxicity balance, MOPPEBVCAD does not undermine the leading role of ABVD as first-line regimen but can be indicated as a very effective second-line conventional therapy.","['Gobbi, Paolo G', 'Broglia, Chiara', 'Levis, Alessandro', 'La Sala, Antonio', 'Valentino, Francesco', 'Chisesi, Teodoro', 'Sacchi, Stefano', 'Corbella, Franco', 'Cavanna, Luigi', 'Iannitto, Emilio', 'Pavone, Vincenzo', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Corazza, Gino Roberto', 'Federico, Massimo']","['Gobbi PG', 'Broglia C', 'Levis A', 'La Sala A', 'Valentino F', 'Chisesi T', 'Sacchi S', 'Corbella F', 'Cavanna L', 'Iannitto E', 'Pavone V', 'Molica S', 'Corazza GR', 'Federico M']","['Medicina Interna, Oncologia e Gastroenterologia, Universita di Pavia, IRCCS, Policlinico San Matteo, Piazzale Golgi no. 2, 27100 Pavia, Italy. gobbipg@smatteo.pv.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CAD protocol 2', 'EBV protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Lomustine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Vindesine/administration & dosage/toxicity']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/03/01 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/2/529 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1707 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 15;12(2):529-35. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1707.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These classification systems are flawed because they do not take into account cellular function. The leukemia cell population is functionally heterogeneous: it consists of leukemia stem cells (LSC) and mature leukemia cells that differentiate abnormally to varying extents. Like normal hematopoietic stem cells, LSCs are quiescent and have self-renewal and clonogenic capacity. Because they are quiescent, LSCs do not respond to cell cycle-specific cytotoxic agents used to treat leukemia and so contribute to treatment failure. These cells may undergo mutations and epigenetic changes, further leading to drug resistance and relapse. Recent data suggest that mature leukemia cells may acquire LSC characteristics, thereby evading chemotherapeutic treatment and sustaining the disease. Ongoing research is likely to reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for LSC characteristics and lead to novel strategies for eradicating leukemia.","['Ravandi, Farhad', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Ravandi F', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA. fravandi@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/03/01 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/2/340 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1879 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 15;12(2):340-4. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-1879.,,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, individuals may be measured at irregular intervals, with those having a history of poorer health outcomes being measured with somewhat greater frequency and regularity. In this paper, we consider likelihood-based estimation of the regression parameters in marginal models for longitudinal binary data when the follow-up times are not fixed by design, but can depend on previous outcomes. In particular, we consider assumptions regarding the follow-up time process that result in the likelihood function separating into two components: one for the follow-up time process, the other for the outcome measurement process. The practical implication of this separation is that the follow-up time process can be ignored when making likelihood-based inferences about the marginal regression model parameters. That is, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the regression parameters relating the probability of success at a given time to covariates does not require that a model for the distribution of follow-up times be specified. However, to obtain consistent parameter estimates, the multinomial distribution for the vector of repeated binary outcomes must be correctly specified. In general, ML estimation requires specification of all higher-order moments and the likelihood for a marginal model can be intractable except in cases where the number of repeated measurements is relatively small. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose a pseudolikelihood for estimation of the marginal model parameters. The pseudolikelihood uses a linear approximation for the conditional distribution of the response at any occasion, given the history of previous responses. The appeal of this approximation is that the conditional distributions are functions of the first two moments of the binary responses only. When the follow-up times depend only on the previous outcome, the pseudolikelihood requires correct specification of the conditional distribution of the current outcome given the outcome at the previous occasion only. Results from a simulation study and a study of asymptotic bias are presented. Finally, we illustrate the main results using data from a longitudinal observational study that explored the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin chemotherapy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children.","['Fitzmaurice, Garrett M', 'Lipsitz, Stuart R', 'Ibrahim, Joseph G', 'Gelber, Richard', 'Lipshultz, Steven']","['Fitzmaurice GM', 'Lipsitz SR', 'Ibrahim JG', 'Gelber R', 'Lipshultz S']","[""Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, 655 Huntington Avenue and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. fitzmaur@hsph.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Biostatistics,"Biostatistics (Oxford, England)",100897327,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Bias', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Computer Simulation', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Heart Ventricles/diagnostic imaging/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', '*Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', '*Regression Analysis']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['kxj019 [pii]', '10.1093/biostatistics/kxj019 [doi]']",ppublish,Biostatistics. 2006 Jul;7(3):469-85. doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxj019.

The lymphoma cell line, Daudi, exhibited a significant resistance to VP-16 treatment in comparison to the lymphoma/leukemia cell line, U-937. While U-937 cells degraded their DNA into internucleosomal fragments, Daudi cells failed to undergo such fragmentation in response to the drug. Activation of both caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation factor was not sufficient to trigger internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in Daudi cells. No correlation was found between expression levels of topoisomerase-II, Pgp, Bcl-2, Bax, or Bad and decreased sensitivity of Daudi cells to VP-16. Daudi cells failed to express DNAS1L3 and ectopic expression of this protein significantly sensitized the cells to VP-16. An enhancement of caspase-3 activity and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential underlie DNAS1L3-mediated sensitization of Daudi cells to VP-16, which may be a direct result of DNAS1L3-mediated increase in PARP-1-activating DNA breaks after VP-16 treatment. Our results suggest that DNAS1L3 plays an active role in lymphoma cell sensitization to VP-16 and that its deficiency may constitute a novel mechanism of drug resistance in these cells.","['Boulares, Hamid', 'Zoltoski, Anna', 'Kandan, Sangeetha', 'Akbulut, Talha', 'Yakovlev, Alexander', 'Oumouna, Mustapha']","['Boulares H', 'Zoltoski A', 'Kandan S', 'Akbulut T', 'Yakovlev A', 'Oumouna M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA. hboulr@lsuhsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (DFFB protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (DNASE1L3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Proteins/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2005/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)00062-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.01.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 Mar 10;341(2):653-62. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.01.014.

The cytotoxic effects of ENT on non-cancer cells lines (NHBE and NIH3T3) were smaller than on leukemia cell lines. AO/EB staining and flow cytometry assays showed that ENT induced HL-60 cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the release of cytochrome c and the increase of caspase-8, -9, and -3 activities were tested after HL-60 cells were treated with ENT, which indicated that the mitochondrial pathway and cell death receptor pathway were both involved in the apoptosis signal pathways induced by ENT.

In one mutant, the cleavage is blocked; in the other, the conserved proline at the N-terminus of CA has been replaced with glycine. No infectivity was detected in either mutant. Mutant particles cannot synthesize full-length DNA upon infecting permissive cells. Particles composed of a mixture of wild-type and mutant proteins have severely impaired infectivity. These mixed particles are defective in their ability to synthesize DNA upon infection, but this defect is less severe than the loss of infectivity. Thus, proteins lacking the correct N-terminus of CA inhibit DNA synthesis and also interfere with formation or integration of a full-length, normal provirus. The results imply that CA proteins function as part of a large, highly organized structure in reverse transcription and apparently at a later step as well.","['Rulli, S J Jr', 'Muriaux, D', 'Nagashima, K', 'Mirro, J', 'Oshima, M', 'Baumann, J G', 'Rein, A']","['Rulli SJ Jr', 'Muriaux D', 'Nagashima K', 'Mirro J', 'Oshima M', 'Baumann JG', 'Rein A']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, SAIC Frederick, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, P.O.

BMP2 and LIF induce distinct signal transduction pathways that each activate a different transcription factor [Smad1 and signal transducing activating transcriptional factor (Stat) 3, respectively] and common signal pathway [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)]. We previously demonstrated that BMP2 and LIF protect cardiomyocytes via Smad1 and STAT3 signaling pathways, respectively. On the other hand, these signals are known to act in synergy via synergistic integration of signaling pathways. Here, we examined interaction between BMP2 and LIF in primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. LIF sustained phosphorylation/activation of Smad1 by BMP2. The role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 cascade activated by LIF was highlighted by the use of a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor, U0126, or overexpression of dominant-negative form of MEK1 that abolished sustained phosphorylation of Smad1 and cell survival effect induced by co-stimulation of LIF with BMP2, while BMP2 alone did not activate ERK1/2. Conversely, overexpression of the constitutive-active form of MEK1 increased BMP2-induced phosphoration of Smad1 without additional LIF. Moreover, BMP2 and LIF synergistically induced bcl-xL mRNA in doxorubicin (DOX)-injured cardiomyocytes. These findings suggest that the ERK1/2 pathway downstream of LIF is involved in sustained phosphorylation/activation of Smad1 by BMP2 and provide a possible mechanism for cooperation between intracellular signals activated by LIF and BMP2 in protection against DOX-induced injury of cardiomyocytes.","['Izumi, Masahiro', 'Masaki, Mitsuru', 'Hiramoto, Yoshimune', 'Sugiyama, Shoko', 'Kuroda, Tadashi', 'Terai, Kazuo', 'Hori, Masatsugu', 'Kawase, Ichiro', 'Hirota, Hisao']","['Izumi M', 'Masaki M', 'Hiramoto Y', 'Sugiyama S', 'Kuroda T', 'Terai K', 'Hori M', 'Kawase I', 'Hirota H']","['Department of Cardiology, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease, 1-3-3, Nakamichi, Higashinari-ku, Osaka, Osaka 537-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Cell Cardiol,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,0262322,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BMP2 protein, human)', '0 (Bmp2 protein, rat)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Smad1 Protein)', '0 (Smad1 protein, rat)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Smad1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",2006/01/24 09:00,2008/02/02 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2005/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2828(05)00345-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Cardiol. 2006 Feb;40(2):224-33. doi: 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2005.11.007.

This has become particularly relevant in the era of imatinib therapy when residual levels of leukaemia usually fall below the level of detection by bone marrow cytogenetic analysis. Studies of imatinib-treated patients have determined that BCR-ABL levels measured early in therapy can predict subsequent response and the probability of acquired resistance. The defining of a molecular level of response that indicates a high probability of progression-free survival highlights the relevance of molecular analysis for clinical management. Small increases in the BCR-ABL level can identify patients with kinase domain mutations that lead to imatinib resistance. Therefore, these assays can be used as a screening strategy for mutation analysis. As second generation kinase inhibitors commence clinical trials, the molecular response will be a primary end-point that determines efficacy.","['Hughes, Timothy', 'Branford, Susan']","['Hughes T', 'Branford S']","['Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Frome Road, Adelaide, 5000 SA, Australia. timothy.hughes@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/03/18 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(05)00009-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2005.01.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2006 Jan;20(1):29-41. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2005.01.008.

To study the relationship of these markers to each other and to the pattern of PCs, immunohistochemical stains for ZAP-70 and MUM1/IRF4 were performed and the PC patterns assessed (where possible) in 29 tissue biopsies with CLL/SLL. CD38 expression was assessed in 18 cases using flow cytometry. Ten evaluable cases had a typical PC pattern and 16 an atypical pattern with larger or more confluent PCs and/or more numerous paraimmunoblasts/transformed cells. ZAP-70 was positive in 14 of 28 cases, including 3 with atypical PCs and enhanced PC staining. All 29 cases showed MUM1/IRF4 expression in PCs. Seven cases, none with atypical PC, also showed uniform positivity throughout, 14 showed weaker staining of surrounding lymphocytes, and 8 had PC staining only. CD38 was positive in 14 of 18 cases. The only significant association identified was between uniform MUM1/IRF4 positivity and typical PCs (P = .004). These findings highlight the complex interrelationship of prognostic markers in CLL/SLL and demonstrate potentially important microenvironmental variations in their expression. They support the hypothesis that PCs are a site for B-cell receptor signaling, which helps explain reported site-dependent antigenic variation in CLL/SLL, and suggest that PC morphology may correlate with other biological features.","['Soma, Lorinda A', 'Craig, Fiona E', 'Swerdlow, Steven H']","['Soma LA', 'Craig FE', 'Swerdlow SH']","['Division of Hematopathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15213-2582, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/02/25 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2005/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(05)00542-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2005.09.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2006 Feb;37(2):152-9. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2005.09.029.

In this study, we demonstrated that a soluble secreted form of the ST2 gene product (ST2), a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, suppressed the production of IL-6 in an LPS-stimulated human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed the binding of ST2 to the surface of the THP-1 cells, in which ST2 led to decreased binding of nuclear factor-kappaB to the IL-6 promoter. Furthermore, the degradation of IkappaB in the cytoplasm after LPS stimulation was reduced by pretreatment with ST2. These results demonstrated that ST2 negatively regulates LPS-induced IL-6 production via the inhibition of IkappaB degradation in THP-1 cells.","['Takezako, Naoki', 'Hayakawa, Morisada', 'Hayakawa, Hiroko', 'Aoki, Shinsuke', 'Yanagisawa, Ken', 'Endo, Hitoshi', 'Tominaga, Shin-ichi']","['Takezako N', 'Hayakawa M', 'Hayakawa H', 'Aoki S', 'Yanagisawa K', 'Endo H', 'Tominaga S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Jichi Medical School, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Minamikawachi-machi, Kawachi-gun, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (IL1RL1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Lac Operon', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Statistical', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Silver Staining', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/04/19 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2005/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)00005-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.206 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 Mar 10;341(2):425-32. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.12.206.

Study of 81 patients].,41-6,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) includes 4 immunological subtypes: pro-T, pre-T, thymic or cortical and mature. In some studies, pro-T and mature subtypes have a poor prognosis. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics, the result of treatment and the prognosis of the immunological subtypes of T-cell ALL in 81 adult patients included in 2 protocols of the Spanish PETHEMA group (ALL-96 and ALL-93). PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between 1993 and 2003, 81 adult patients from 22 Spanish hospitals were included in two PETHEMA protocols: ALL-96 for standard-risk patients, and ALL-93 for high- risk patients. The main clinical and biological parameters as well as the rate of response to treatment, the frequency of complete remission , disease free survival and overall survival were compared in each T-cell ALL subtype. RESULTS: Of the 64 evaluable patients the distribution of the immunological subtypes was: 3 pro-T, 17 pre-T, 22 thymic or cortical and 22 mature. Patients with mature T-ALL had higher frequency of central nervous system involvement and myeloid antigen expression than those of the remaining subgroups. Patients with mature T-cell ALL had a slow rate of response to treatment in comparison with patients wit pre-T and mature T-cell ALL but this did not translate to significant differences in frequency of complete remission (77% vs 94%), disease free survival (42% vs 46%) and overall survival (29% vs 47%). CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with mature T-cell ALL had a slow rate of response to treatment and their survival tended to be shorter, in the present study there were no statistically significant differences in the prognosis of the different subtypes of T-cell ALL.","['Xicoy, Blanca', 'Ribera, Josep M', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Abella, Eugenia', 'Tormo, Mar', 'del Potro, Eloy', 'Bueno, Javier', 'Grande, Carlos', 'Fernandez-Calvo, Javier', 'Orts, Maribel', 'Novo, Andres', 'Rivas, Concepcion', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M', 'Feliu, Evarist', 'Ortega, Juan J']","['Xicoy B', 'Ribera JM', 'Oriol A', 'Sanz MA', 'Abella E', 'Tormo M', 'del Potro E', 'Bueno J', 'Grande C', 'Fernandez-Calvo J', 'Orts M', 'Novo A', 'Rivas C', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Feliu E', 'Ortega JJ']","[""Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-7753(06)71823-1 [pii]', '10.1157/13083566 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2006 Jan 21;126(2):41-6. doi: 10.1157/13083566.,,,Significado pronostico de los subtipos inmunologicos de la leucemia aguda linfoblastica T del adulto.

In this study, we examined the role of PTTG-1 expression in lung cancer with regard to histological subtype, the correlation of PTTG-1 to clinical parameters and relation on patients' survival. METHODS: Expression of PTTG-1 was examined immunohistochemically on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 136 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 91 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), retrospectively. The intensity of PTTG-1 expression as well as the proportion of PTTG-1 positive cells within a tumor was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: PTTG-1 expression was observed in 64% of SCLC tumors and in 97.8% of NSCLC tumors. In patients with SCLC, negative or low PTTG-1 expression was associated with a shorter mean survival time compared with patients with strong PTTG-1 expression (265 +/- 18 days vs. 379 +/- 66 days; p = 0.0291). Using the Cox regression model for multivariate analysis, PTTG-1 expression was a significant predictor for survival next to performance status, tumor stage, LDH and hemoglobin. In contrast, in patients with NSCLC an inverse correlation between survival and PTTG-1 expression was seen. Strong PTTG-1 expression was associated with a shorter mean survival of 306 +/- 58 days compared with 463 +/- 55 days for those patients with no or low PTTG-1 intensities (p = 0.0386). Further, PTTG-1 expression was associated with a more aggressive NSCLC phenotype with an advanced pathological stage, extensive lymph node metastases, distant metastases and increased LDH level. Multivariate analysis using Cox regression confirmed the prognostic relevance of PTTG-1 expression next to performance status and tumor stage in patients with NSCLC. CONCLUSION: Lung cancers belong to the group of tumors expressing PTTG-1. Dependent on the histological subtype of lung cancer, PTTG-1 expression was associated with a better outcome in patients with SCLC and a rather unfavourable outcome for patients with NSCLCs. These results may reflect the varying role of PTTG-1 in the pathophysiology of the different histological subtypes of lung cancer.","['Rehfeld, Nina', 'Geddert, Helene', 'Atamna, Abedelsalam', 'Rohrbeck, Astrid', 'Garcia, Guillermo', 'Kliszewski, Slawek', 'Neukirchen, Judith', 'Bruns, Ingmar', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Fenk, Roland', 'Gabbert, Helmut E', 'Kronenwett, Ralf', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Rohr, Ulrich-Peter']","['Rehfeld N', 'Geddert H', 'Atamna A', 'Rohrbeck A', 'Garcia G', 'Kliszewski S', 'Neukirchen J', 'Bruns I', 'Steidl U', 'Fenk R', 'Gabbert HE', 'Kronenwett R', 'Haas R', 'Rohr UP']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institut fur Pathologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institut fur Pathologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Carcinog,Journal of carcinogenesis,101153623,,,,2006/01/24 09:00,2006/01/24 09:01,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2005/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:01 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1477-3163-5-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-3163-5-4 [doi]']",epublish,J Carcinog. 2006 Jan 20;5:4. doi: 10.1186/1477-3163-5-4.,,,,PMC1360069,20060120,,,,,,,10.1186/1477-3163-5-4 [doi],,,,,,,,

Here we report the existence of erythroid differentiation factors in erythroid cytoplasm. Purification of these factors from cultured Friend virus anaemia (FVA)-infected mouse splenic erythroblasts was carried out using isoelectrophoresis and high performance of liquid chromatography techniques. We have identified intracellular erythroid differentiation denucleation factors (EDDFs) that were able to mediate the events of post-Epo-dependent erythroblast terminal differentiation. Purified EDDF proteins bound specifically to the enhancer HS2 sequence of the globin gene activated the expression of haemoglobin in mouse erythroleukaemia and K562 erythroleukaemic cells and promoted them to differentiate into mature erythrocytes. EDDF proteins began to emerge at the pro-early erythroblast stages upon exposure to Epo in culture, and increased dramatically in early erythroblast stage. The dynamic of EDDF expression and its action on the key events of erythroblast differentiation and denucleation appeared to be closely consistent with its spatiotemporal distribution. These results suggest that EDDFs are the critical intracellular regulatory factors that may act as the successive regulators to Epo, responsible for the final stages of erythroid terminal differentiation.","['Xue, S-P', 'Zhang, S-F', 'Ma, W', 'Zhang, Z', 'Liu, P', 'Zhao, Q', 'Han, D']","['Xue SP', 'Zhang SF', 'Ma W', 'Zhang Z', 'Liu P', 'Zhao Q', 'Han D']","['Department of Cell Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, China. xuesp@public.bta.net.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (erythroid differentiation and denucleation factor, mouse)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '93443-12-0 (Inhibin-beta Subunits)']",IM,"['Activins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/metabolism/virology', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibin-beta Subunits/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Spleen/cytology']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['CPR366 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00366.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2006 Feb;39(1):61-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00366.x.,,,,PMC6496009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several areas of ethical importance are explored. Research justification and the need to consider both deontological and teleological aspects are examined. Ethical sensitivity in research and the requirement to respond to areas of ethical concern identified by the European Commission, such as the involvement of human beings, the use of human tissue, and the use of animals are also explored.

STUDY DESIGN: A self-completion questionnaire. METHODS: Ninety-one children and 82 adults with JIA were age and gender matched with 152 healthy controls. For those below the age of 16 years, the parents' attitude, knowledge and dental health practices were investigated by the questionnaire. The adult subjects and controls completed an identical questionnaire assessing their own attitude, knowledge and dental health practices. RESULTS: Response rates of 84% and 75% were achieved for the subject and controls respectively. Both groups responded similarly to questions assessing perception of different medical conditions. The majority of respondents thought leukaemia was a very serious condition. Twenty-seven percent of subjects and 34% of controls felt dental decay was ""slightly or not serious"". Ninety percent of subjects and 93% of controls knew having sweet snacks during the day would harm teeth, but fewer were sure that eating sweet foods at mealtimes only would help reduce decay. The majority of respondents (63% and 56% respectively) did not know whether children should receive fluoride tablets but the majority of subjects in both groups had attended a dentist within the last year. STATISTICS: Descriptive analyses and chi-squared analysis were undertaken. A p-value of < or =0.01 was taken as strong evidence of a difference between groups. CONCLUSION: The perception of health and illness by both groups was appropriate. The questions investigating dental knowledge revealed understanding of the basic messages of prevention of dental disease, but finer detail appeared less well understood. Responses concerning dental health confirmed positive attitudes towards good dental health habits. The benefits of brushing with fluoride toothpaste were known, and the majority toothbrushed daily and received dental care within the previous year.","['Waterhouse, P J', 'Thomason, J M', 'Fitzgerald, J F', 'Foster, H E', 'Steen, I N', 'Welbury, R R']","['Waterhouse PJ', 'Thomason JM', 'Fitzgerald JF', 'Foster HE', 'Steen IN', 'Welbury RR']","['School of Dental Sciences, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. p.j.waterhouse@ncl.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Eur J Paediatr Dent,European journal of paediatric dentistry,101121881,"['0 (Cariostatic Agents)', '0 (Dietary Carbohydrates)', '0 (Toothpastes)', 'Q80VPU408O (Fluorides)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/*psychology', '*Attitude to Health', 'Cariostatic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Caries/psychology', 'Dietary Carbohydrates/adverse effects', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Fluorides/therapeutic use', '*Health Behavior', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oral Health', 'Toothbrushing', 'Toothpastes/therapeutic use']",2006/01/24 09:00,2006/03/01 09:00,['2006/01/24 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Paediatr Dent. 2005 Dec;6(4):202-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiphoton excitation of NADH by ultrashort, 740-nm laser pulses provides a significant improvement over UV excitation by eliminating peripheral photobleaching; however, molecules within the subfemtoliter excitation volume remain susceptible. We have investigated the photophysical mechanisms responsible for multiphoton photobleaching of NADH in living cells to permit the imaging technique to be optimized. The loss of fluorescence because of multiphoton photobleaching was measured by repetitively imaging individual planes within rat basophilic leukemia cells. The photobleaching rate was proportional to the fourth power of the laser intensity. Based on these measurements, we propose a double-biphotonic, four-photon photobleaching mechanism and estimate the quantum yield of photobleaching of intracellular NADH to be 0.0073 +/- 0.0002 by this mechanism. In addition to photobleaching, the development of bright, punctate fluorescent lesions can also be observed. The frequency of lesion formation also increased approximately as the fourth power of the laser intensity after an intensity-dependent threshold number of images had been exceeded.

Without effective therapy, it progresses to an accelerated phase (AP) and eventually to a fatal blast crisis (BC). To identify the genes involved in stage progression in CML, we performed a genomewide screening of DNA copy number changes in a total of 55 CML patients in different stages with the use of the high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) technique. We constructed Human 1M arrays that contained 3,151 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNAs, allowing for an average resolution of 1.0 Mb across the entire genome. In addition to common chromosomal abnormalities, array CGH analysis unveiled a number of novel copy number changes. These alterations included losses in 2q26.2-q37.3, 5q23.1-q23.3, 5q31.2-q32, 7p21.3-p11.2, 7q31.1-q31.33, 8pter-p12(p11.2), 9p, and 22q13.1-q13.31 and gains in 3q26.2-q29, 6p22.3, 7p15.2-p14.3, 8p12, 8p21.3, 8p23.2, 8q24.13-q24.21, 9q, 19p13.2-p12, and 22q13.1-q13.32 and occurred at a higher frequency in AP and BC. Minimal copy number changes affecting even a single BAC locus were also identified. Our data suggests that at least a proportion of CML patients carry still-unknown cryptic genomic alterations that could affect a gene or genes of importance in the disease progression of CML.

Therefore, it is assumed that ATLL cells either express particular cytokines or induce their expression in host immune cells, disrupting the balanced production of cytokines and causing the host's immune system to break down. We examined the levels of serum cytokines including T helper type 1- (Th1-) associated cytokines [IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-2], Th2-associated cytokines (IL-4, -5 and -6) and regulatory T cell-associated cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-beta1) in 94 ATLL patients, 39 asymptomatic human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) carriers and 50 healthy adult volunteers, to clarify whether elevated levels of particular cytokines are associated with the prognosis of ATLL patients. On multivariate analysis, high IL-5 and IL-10 levels were independent and significant unfavorable prognostic factors among the ATLL patients. The IL-10 level significantly increased with disease progression at each step from asymptomatic HTLV-1 carrier to ATLL of the indolent variant (chronic and smoldering subtypes) to ATLL of the aggressive variant (acute and lymphoma subtypes). Furthermore, high IL-10 was significantly associated with high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating that the IL-10 level reflects the tumor burden. The IL-5 level was not associated with disease progression nor LDH. Among ATLL patients with the aggressive variant, high IL-5, but not high IL-10, was an independent and significant unfavorable prognostic factor on multivariate analysis. Measurement of serum IL-5 and IL-10 levels is useful for predicting the prognosis and for determining a suitable treatment strategy for ATLL patients.","['Inagaki, Atsushi', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Ishii, Toshihiko', 'Komatsu, Hirokazu', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Ding, Jianmin', 'Yonekura, Kentaro', 'Takeuchi, Shogo', 'Takatsuka, Yoshifusa', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Ueda, Ryuzo']","['Inagaki A', 'Ishida T', 'Ishii T', 'Komatsu H', 'Iida S', 'Ding J', 'Yonekura K', 'Takeuchi S', 'Takatsuka Y', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Ueda R']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Molecular Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya-shi, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Interleukin-10/*blood', 'Interleukin-2/blood', 'Interleukin-4/blood', 'Interleukin-5/*blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/*immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/blood', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/05/24 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.21688 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Jun 15;118(12):3054-61. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21688.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

We explored possible relationships among asparaginase (ASNase) activity levels, asparagine (ASN) depletion, anti-ASNase antibody titers, and response to re-induction therapy in children and adolescents with ALL and an 'early' first marrow relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After appropriate informed consent, we enrolled children and adolescents 1-21 years old with ALL and first marrow relapse within 12 months of completion of primary therapy. Induction therapy included intramuscular pegylated ASNase on Days 2 and 16. We assessed ASNase activity, anti-ASNase antibody titers against native and pegylated (E. coli) ASNase, and amino acid levels of asparagine (ASN) and glutamine (GLN) on Days 0, 14, and 35 of re-induction. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were at least partially assessable. Among 21 patients with M1 marrow status at Day 35, the median Day 14 ASN level was <1 microM. This is significantly lower than the median Day 14 ASN level of 4 microM in the group of patients with M3 marrow at Day 35. Neither Day 0 nor Day 35 antibody titers predicted ASNase enzymatic activity level on Day 14. Surprisingly, Day 14 ASNase activity did not predict serum ASN level on Day 14. However, Day 0 and Day 35 anti-native ASNase antibody titers, and Day 0 anti-PEG ASNase antibody titers correlated positively with Day 14 serum ASN levels as one might expect from neutralizing antibody. Day 35 anti-PEG ASNase antibody titers did not. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with greater ASN depletion were more likely to achieve second remission in the context of six-drug therapy.","['Jarrar, Mohammad', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Periclou, Antonia P', 'Fu, Cecilia', 'Harris, Richard E', 'Stram, Daniel', 'Altman, Arnold', 'Bostrom, Bruce', 'Breneman, John', 'Steele, David', 'Trigg, Michael', 'Zipf, Theodore', 'Avramis, Vassilios I']","['Jarrar M', 'Gaynon PS', 'Periclou AP', 'Fu C', 'Harris RE', 'Stram D', 'Altman A', 'Bostrom B', 'Breneman J', 'Steele D', 'Trigg M', 'Zipf T', 'Avramis VI']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, USC Keck School of Medicine, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Conference', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antibody Formation/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Asparagine/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Child', 'Female', 'Glutamic Acid/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20713 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Aug;47(2):141-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20713.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The X-gal stain was used to detect the activity of the expressed beta-galactosidase enzyme. The delivered reporter gene was expressed successfully not only in the neuronal cells of the injected areas but also in cells that project to the injection area such as cortex cells about 6 mm away from the injection sites.

Most of the episodes of bloodstream infection (58%) occurred in non-neutropenic patients. Acute leukaemia and bone marrow transplantation predominated in the neutropenic group. Non-neutropenic patients tended to be older and to have a higher frequency of solid tumours and advanced or uncontrolled diseases.

METHODS: In total, 12 donor eyes from six subjects with diabetes mellitus, and 10 eyes from five nondiabetic subjects without known ocular disease serving as control subjects were examined. Immunohistochemical techniques were used with antibodies directed against cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), Akt (protein kinase B), Mcl-1, Bad, cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), tumour necrosis factor receptor-1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD). RESULTS: In retinas from all subjects without diabetes, cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for the antiapoptotic molecules Cox-2, Akt, and Mcl-1 was noted in ganglion cells. Cytoplasmic immunostaining for Cox-2 was also noted in the retinal pigment epithelial cells. Weak immunoreactivity for the mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins cytochrome c, and AIF was noted in the inner segments of photoreceptors, in the inner one-third of the outer plexiform layer, in cells in the inner nuclear layer, in the inner plexiform layer, and in ganglion cells. There was no immunoreactivity for the other antibodies tested. All diabetic retinas showed de novocytoplasmic immunoreactivity for Bad in ganglion cells, and in occasional cells in the inner nuclear layer. Upregulation of cytochrome cand AIF immunoreactivity was noted. Cox-2, Akt, and Mcl-1 immunoreactivity was not altered in the diabetic retinas. There was no immunoreactivity for TRADD, and FADD. CONCLUSIONS: Ganglion cells in diabetic and nondiabetic retinas express the antiapoptotic molecules Cox-2, Akt, and Mcl-1. Retinal ganglion cells express the proapoptotic molecule Bad in response to diabetes-induced neuronal injury.

Approximately 50 different fusion partners of the MLL gene have already been molecularly identified. These leukemias are commonly regarded as high-risk cases and are treated accordingly with intensified therapy regimens, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, a subset of patients may achieve long-term remissions with conventional therapy. Monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) is undoubtedly of great value in clinical decision making, also in the pre- and post-transplant setting. Here, we describe a novel method for detecting MRD in leukemias with MLL aberrations. The method is based on monitoring patient-specific chromosomal breakpoint DNA sequences. This has several advantages over other methods that are based either on detecting specific RNA molecules of MLL fusion genes or on surrogate markers. An accurate and absolute quantification of the MRD level is possible. No reference to housekeeping genes is necessary and the target structure is much more stable than any mRNA fusion transcript.","['Burmeister, T', 'Marschalek, R', 'Schneider, B', 'Meyer, C', 'Gokbuget, N', 'Schwartz, S', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Thiel, E']","['Burmeister T', 'Marschalek R', 'Schneider B', 'Meyer C', 'Gokbuget N', 'Schwartz S', 'Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Hindenburgdamm 30, Berlin, Germany. thomas.burmeister@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Fragile Sites', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404082 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404082 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Mar;20(3):451-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404082.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SKI, a nuclear oncogene, was highly up regulated. In a second set of 183 AML patients analyzed with real-time PCR, the highest expression level of SKI in AML with -7/del7q could be confirmed. As previously described, Ski associates with the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) complex and can repress transcription. We wanted to investigate the interference of Ski with RARalpha signaling in AML. Ski was co-immunoprecipitated and colocalized with RARalpha. We also found that overexpression of wild-type Ski inhibited the prodifferentiating effects of retinoic acid in U937 leukemia cells. Mutant Ski, lacking the N-CoR binding, was no more capable of repressing RARalpha signaling. The inhibition by wild-type Ski could partially be reverted by the histone deacetylase blocking agent valproic acid.

No mutation of the Pu1 gene was observed, whereas mutation in the Runt domain of AML1 gene was observed in 12 of 45 patients (27%). No point mutation or insertion-deletion in the c-kit gene was found. Three point mutations (7%) and 11 internal tandem duplications (22%) were seen in FLT3 gene.

Moreover, HF-induced downregulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, two antiapoptotic proteins that control mitochondrial permeability. HF also downregulated two proteins which are overexpressed by B-CLL patients' cells, the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 through caspase-dependent cleavage into a p23 form, and the nitric oxid (NO) synthase of type 2 (inducible NO synthase). This latter was accompanied by reduction in the production of NO known to be antiapoptotic in B-CLL cells. Preventing effects of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk indicated that HF-promoted apoptosis of B-CLL cells was mostly caspase dependent.

Although SPARC has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in humans, its function in normal or malignant hematopoiesis has not previously been studied. We found that the leukemic cells of AML patients with MLL gene rearrangements express low to undetectable amounts of SPARC whereas normal hematopoietic progenitors and most AML patients express this gene. SPARC RNA and protein levels were also low or undetectable in AML cell lines with MLL translocations. Consistent with its tumor suppressive effects in various solid tumor models, exogenous SPARC protein selectively reduced the growth of cell lines with MLL rearrangements by inhibiting cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. The lack of SPARC expression in MLL-rearranged cell lines was associated with dense promoter methylation. However, we found no evidence of methylation-based silencing of SPARC in primary patient samples. Our results suggest that low or absent SPARC expression is a consistent feature of AML cells with MLL rearrangements and that SPARC may function as a tumor suppressor in this subset of patients. A potential role of exogenous SPARC in the therapy of MLL-rearranged AML warrants further investigation.","['DiMartino, J F', 'Lacayo, N J', 'Varadi, M', 'Li, L', 'Saraiya, C', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Yu, R', 'Sikic, B I', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Dahl, G V']","['DiMartino JF', 'Lacayo NJ', 'Varadi M', 'Li L', 'Saraiya C', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Yu R', 'Sikic BI', 'Raimondi SC', 'Dahl GV']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA. jorge.dimartino@cchmc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Osteonectin)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Osteonectin/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404102 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404102 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Mar;20(3):426-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404102.,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA818818/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR 00070/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA90916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA92474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In one patient with trisomy 8 and four patients with a normal karyotype, a new clone with an aberrant karyotype emerged 1-14 months after 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) therapy as shown by G-banding analyses. Fluorescence in situ hybridization disclosed that an abnormal clone existed in approximately 3-6% of bone marrow cells at onset or before 6-MP therapy in all the four cases examined, and increased to approximately 12-90% during the treatment. In culture with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, cytogenetically abnormal clones that proliferated during 6-MP therapy possessed significantly less sensitivity to the antimetabolite, compared with cells that decreased in numbers after the therapy. A PTPN11 mutation was detected in all of granulocyte-macrophage colonies irrespective of karyotypic aberration in one patient, whereas approximately 80% of erythroid colonies and 20% of mixed colonies possessed neither a PTPN11 mutation nor chromosomal abnormalities. The appearance of chromosomal aberrations shown by G-banding during 6-MP therapy in some JMML cases may result, in part, from the growth of a 6-MP-refractory clone that already exists at onset. It is possible that treatment with 6-MP promotes progression of the disease.","['Matsuda, K', 'Matsuzaki, S', 'Miki, J', 'Hidaka, E', 'Yanagisawa, R', 'Nakazawa, Y', 'Sakashita, K', 'Kamijo, T', 'Asami, K', 'Sano, K', 'Koike, K']","['Matsuda K', 'Matsuzaki S', 'Miki J', 'Hidaka E', 'Yanagisawa R', 'Nakazawa Y', 'Sakashita K', 'Kamijo T', 'Asami K', 'Sano K', 'Koike K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shinshu University Hospital, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mercaptopurine/*therapeutic use', 'Mutation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404106 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404106 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Mar;20(3):485-90. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404106.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the end of the era of interferon-alpha as a single-drug first-line treatment for most patients we present a case report which exemplifies a rare but exciting property of interferon-alpha in CML: the induction of complete hematological and cytogenetic remissions which can persist over years after discontinuation of the drug.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of cytotoxic effects of depsipeptide (FK228), one of the most effective HDAC inhibitors against leukemia, using human myeloid leukemic cell lines HL-60 and K562. We found that FK228 activated caspase-9 and a subsequent caspase cascade by perturbing the mitochondrial membrane to release cytochrome c, which was almost completely blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2. The mitochondrial damage was caused by the translocation of Bax but not other pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to the mitochondria. FK228 did not affect the interaction between Bax and Bax adaptor proteins such as 14-3-3theta and Ku70. FK228-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial translocation of Bax were markedly enhanced by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. The synergistic action of FK228 and bortezomib was at least partly mediated through conformational changes in Bax, which facilitate its translocation to the mitochondria. These results suggest that the combination of HDAC inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors is useful in the treatment of leukemia especially in the context of molecular-targeted therapy. The status of Bcl-2 and Bax may influence the sensitivity of tumors to this combination and thus can be a target of further therapeutic intervention.","['Sutheesophon, Krittaya', 'Kobayashi, Yukiko', 'Takatoku, Masa-aki', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Kano, Yasuhiko', 'Ishii, Hideshi', 'Furukawa, Yusuke']","['Sutheesophon K', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Takatoku MA', 'Ozawa K', 'Kano Y', 'Ishii H', 'Furukawa Y']","['Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (YWHAH protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Depsipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/02/17 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['89471 [pii]', '10.1159/000089471 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2006;115(1-2):78-90. doi: 10.1159/000089471.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 S.

The strong association of NOD2/CARD15 variants with transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was confirmed in univariate and multivariate analysis; TRM increased from 20% in cohort I/22% in cohort II in recipient/donor pairs without any NOD2/CARD15 variants to 47% in cohort I/32% in cohort II in the presence of one variant in either donor or recipient and further to 57% in cohort I/74% in cohort II in the presence of 2 or more variants (P < .002 in both cohorts). NOD2/CARD15 SNPs were not associated with relapse rate but had a strong impact on overall survival. In an analysis of center effects, the type of gastrointestinal decontamination was the only factor interfering with the prognostic significance of NOD2/CARD15 SNPs.

The antisense strand of the HTLV-1 genome encodes HBZ, a novel nuclear basic region leucine zipper (b-ZIP) protein that in overexpression assays down-regulates Tax oncoprotein-induced viral transcription. Herein, we investigated the contribution of HBZ to HTLV-1-mediated immortalization of primary T lymphocytes in vitro and HTLV-1 infection in a rabbit animal model. HTLV-1 HBZ mutant viruses were generated and evaluated for viral gene expression, protein production, and immortalization capacity. Biologic properties of HBZ mutant viruses in vitro were indistinguishable from wild-type HTLV-1, providing the first direct evidence that HBZ is dispensable for viral replication and cellular immortalization. Rabbits inoculated with irradiated cells expressing HTLV-1 HBZ mutant viruses became persistently infected. However, these rabbits displayed a decreased antibody response to viral gene products and reduced proviral copies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as compared with wild-type HTLV-1-infected animals. Our findings indicated that HBZ was not required for in vitro cellular immortalization, but enhanced infectivity and persistence in inoculated rabbits. This study demonstrates that retroviruses use negative-strand-encoded proteins in the establishment of chronic viral infections.","['Arnold, Joshua', 'Yamamoto, Brenda', 'Li, Min', 'Phipps, Andrew J', 'Younis, Ihab', 'Lairmore, Michael D', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Arnold J', 'Yamamoto B', 'Li M', 'Phipps AJ', 'Younis I', 'Lairmore MD', 'Green PL']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, 1925 Coffey Road, Columbus, OH 43210, USA .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/virology', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA Primers', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/06/15 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63826-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-11-4551 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 15;107(10):3976-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-11-4551.

To explore the biological background of low toxicity, we examined the numbers, immunophenotype, and functional properties of granulocytes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving HiDAC or IDAC. Interestingly, the absolute numbers of neutrophils remained >500/microl until day 10 in 92 of 125 (74%) HiDAC cycles and in 106 of 113 (94%) IDAC cycles. As assessed by electron microscopy, these day-10 granulocytes surviving chemotherapy were found to be mature cells containing secondary granules and phagolysosomes. They also expressed opsonization- and phagocytosis-linked surface Ags (C3biR, CR1, C1qR, C5aR, FcgammaRI, FcgammaRII, FcgammaRIII, and G-CSF and GM-CSF receptors) like neutrophils in healthy controls. Moreover, these day-10 neutrophils exhibited oxidative burst activity and took up and digested bacteria in the same way as neutrophils in healthy controls. There was a negative correlation between absolute neutrophil counts and severe infections in HiDAC- and IDAC-treated patients with a later onset of infections in IDAC patients (median: IDAC, day 18; HiDAC, day 16). Together, functionally mature neutrophils are detectable at least until day 10 in patients treated with HiDAC or IDAC, and may explain the relatively low hematologic toxicity of these consolidation protocols.

Although initiation relies on the GC receptor (GR) and de novo gene expression, the effector phase differs among cell types. Proteasomal degradation as well as caspase-3, - 8, and -9 activity are essential for GC-induced apoptosis in murine thymocytes, but the same enzymes are dispensable in splenic T cells. Live imaging by confocal microscopy revealed that lysosomal cathepsin B, an unrecognized component of this pathway to date, becomes rapidly activated in thymocytes after GC exposure. This is followed by leakage of cathepsin B into the cytosol, nuclear condensation, and processing of caspase-8 and -3. According to our model, activation of caspase-3 by caspase-9 in thymocytes occurs both directly as well as indirectly via a lysosomal amplification loop. Interestingly, acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells depend on caspase activity to undergo GC-induced cell death similar to thymocytes.

Recent study showed that MBD2 could not only recruit immature dendritic cells but also activate them by Toll-like receptor 4 and thus may provide a critical link between the innate immune system and the adaptive immune response. In this report, we examined the antileukemia activity of MBD2 in a murine model of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) L1210. L1210 cells were engineered to secrete biologically functional MBD2. MBD2-modified L1210 (L1210-MBD2) showed significantly reduced leukemogenecity, resulting in a 80% rate of complete leukemia rejection. Inoculation of mice with L1210-MBD2 induced enhanced CTL and natural killer (NK) activity and augmented interleukin-12 and IFN-gamma production. All the recovered mice from the inoculation showed a protective immunity to the following challenge with parental L1210 cells and generate leukemia-specific memory CTL. Vaccines with irradiated L1210-MBD2 cells could cure 50% leukemia-bearing mice. Depletion of CD8+ T cells but not CD4+ T cells completely abrogated the antileukemia activity of MBD2. Interestingly, NK cells were also required for the MBD2-mediated antileukemia response, although ALL generally display a high degree of resistance to NK-mediated lysis. Our results suggest that MBD2 can activate both innate and adaptive immunity to generate potent antileukemia response, and MBD2 immunotherapy warrants further evaluation as a potential treatment for ALL.","['Ma, Xiao-Tong', 'Xu, Bin', 'An, Li-Li', 'Dong, Cheng-Ya', 'Lin, Yong-Min', 'Shi, Yang', 'Wu, Ke-Fu']","['Ma XT', 'Xu B', 'An LL', 'Dong CY', 'Lin YM', 'Shi Y', 'Wu KF']","['National Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin 300-020, China. ma_xt@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (DEFB4A protein, human)', '0 (beta-Defensins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Female', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'beta-Defensins/*immunology']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/2/1169 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2891 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 15;66(2):1169-76. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2891.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OSI-930 selectively inhibits Kit and KDR with similar potency in intact cells and also inhibits these targets in vivo following oral dosing. We have investigated the relationships between the potency observed in cell-based assays in vitro, the plasma exposure levels achieved following oral dosing, the time course of target inhibition in vivo, and antitumor activity of OSI-930 in tumor xenograft models. In the mutant Kit-expressing HMC-1 xenograft model, prolonged inhibition of Kit was achieved at oral doses between 10 and 50 mg/kg and this dose range was associated with antitumor activity. Similarly, prolonged inhibition of wild-type Kit in the NCI-H526 xenograft model was observed at oral doses of 100 to 200 mg/kg, which was the dose level associated with significant antitumor activity in this model as well as in the majority of other xenograft models tested.

Furthermore, pharmacokinetic evaluation of the plasma exposure levels of OSI-930 at these effective dose levels provides an estimate of the target plasma concentrations that may be required to achieve prolonged inhibition of Kit and KDR in humans and which would therefore be expected to yield a therapeutic benefit in future clinical evaluations of OSI-930.","['Garton, Andrew J', 'Crew, Andrew P A', 'Franklin, Maryland', 'Cooke, Andrew R', 'Wynne, Graham M', 'Castaldo, Linda', 'Kahler, Jennifer', 'Winski, Shannon L', 'Franks, April', 'Brown, Eric N', 'Bittner, Mark A', 'Keily, John F', 'Briner, Paul', 'Hidden, Chris', 'Srebernak, Mary C', 'Pirrit, Carrie', ""O'Connor, Matthew"", 'Chan, Anna', 'Vulevic, Bojana', 'Henninger, Dwight', 'Hart, Karen', 'Sennello, Regina', 'Li, An-Hu', 'Zhang, Tao', 'Richardson, Frank', 'Emerson, David L', 'Castelhano, Arlindo L', 'Arnold, Lee D', 'Gibson, Neil W']","['Garton AJ', 'Crew AP', 'Franklin M', 'Cooke AR', 'Wynne GM', 'Castaldo L', 'Kahler J', 'Winski SL', 'Franks A', 'Brown EN', 'Bittner MA', 'Keily JF', 'Briner P', 'Hidden C', 'Srebernak MC', 'Pirrit C', ""O'Connor M"", 'Chan A', 'Vulevic B', 'Henninger D', 'Hart K', 'Sennello R', 'Li AH', 'Zhang T', 'Richardson F', 'Emerson DL', 'Castelhano AL', 'Arnold LD', 'Gibson NW']","['OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc., 1 Bioscience Park Drive, Farmingdale, NY 11735, USA. agarton@osip.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (OSI 930)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*physiology', 'Quinolines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/2/1015 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2873 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 15;66(2):1015-24. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2873.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structure is determined in complex with the small-molecule inhibitor VX-680 (Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA), which blocks the activity of various imatinib-resistant mutant forms of Abl, including one (T315I) that is resistant to both imatinib and BMS-354825 (dasatinib), a dual Src/Abl inhibitor that seems to be clinically effective against all other imatinib-resistant forms of BCR-Abl. VX-680 is shown to have significant inhibitory activity against BCR-Abl bearing the T315I mutation in patient-derived samples. The Abl kinase domain bound to VX-680 is not phosphorylated on the activation loop in the crystal structure but is nevertheless in an active conformation, previously unobserved for Abl and inconsistent with the binding of imatinib. The adoption of an active conformation is most likely the result of synergy between the His(396)Pro mutation, which destabilizes the inactive conformation required for imatinib binding, and the binding of VX-680, which favors the active conformation through hydrogen bonding and steric effects. VX-680 is bound to Abl in a mode that accommodates the substitution of isoleucine for threonine at residue 315 (the ""gatekeeper"" position). The avoidance of the innermost cavity of the Abl kinase domain by VX-680 and the specific recognition of the active conformation explain the effectiveness of this compound against mutant forms of BCR-Abl, including those with mutations at the gatekeeper position.","['Young, Matthew A', 'Shah, Neil P', 'Chao, Luke H', 'Seeliger, Markus', 'Milanov, Zdravko V', 'Biggs, William H 3rd', 'Treiber, Daniel K', 'Patel, Hitesh K', 'Zarrinkar, Patrick P', 'Lockhart, David J', 'Sawyers, Charles L', 'Kuriyan, John']","['Young MA', 'Shah NP', 'Chao LH', 'Seeliger M', 'Milanov ZV', 'Biggs WH 3rd', 'Treiber DK', 'Patel HK', 'Zarrinkar PP', 'Lockhart DJ', 'Sawyers CL', 'Kuriyan J']","['Departments of Molecular and Cell Biology and Chemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '639089-54-6 (VX680)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aurora Kinases', 'Benzamides', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallography', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/2/1007 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2788 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 15;66(2):1007-14. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2788.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TCL1 gene, responsible for prolymphocytic T cell leukemia, is also overexpressed in human B cell malignancies and overexpression of the Tcl1 protein occurs frequently in CLL. Aging transgenic mice that overexpress TCL1 under control of the mu immunoglobulin gene enhancer, develop a CD5+ B cell lymphoproliferative disorder mimicking human CLL and implicating TCL1 in the pathogenesis of CLL. In the current study, we exploited this transgenic mouse to investigate two different CLL-related issues: potential treatment of CLL and characterization of neoplasms that accompany CLL. We successfully transplanted CLL cells into syngeneic mice that led to CLL development in the recipient mice. This approach allowed us to verify the involvement of the Tcl1/Akt/mTOR biochemical pathway in the disease by testing the ability of a specific pharmacologic agent, rapamycin, to slow CLL. We also showed that 36% of these transgenic mice were affected by solid malignancies, in which the expression of the Tcl1 protein was absent.

P2X(7) triggering may result in stimulation of cell proliferation or induction of apoptosis depending on the level of activation. P2X(7) expression and function in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been shown to correlate with disease severity. Here, we have asked the question of whether P2X(7) is expressed and functional in neuroblastoma, a pediatric tumor of neuroectodermal origin. P2X(7) was detected both in primary neuroblastoma tumors and in neuroblastoma cell lines. In the latter cells, P2X(7) stimulation by ATP was found to trigger (a) increased intracellular calcium fluxes, (b) plasma membrane depolarization, and (c) formation of a nonselective plasma membrane permeable pore. In contrast to the usual response typically observed in the majority of cell types, P2X(7) in vitro stimulation did not induce caspase-3 activation or apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells but rather supported their proliferation. Growth stimulation was partially due to substance P release from nucleotide-activated neuroblastoma cells. Therefore, neuroblastoma cells seem to have molded P2X(7) function to their advantage in two ways (i.e., by silencing P2X(7) proapoptotic activity and by coupling P2X(7) stimulation to release of locally acting trophic factors).","['Raffaghello, Lizzia', 'Chiozzi, Paola', 'Falzoni, Simonetta', 'Di Virgilio, Francesco', 'Pistoia, Vito']","['Raffaghello L', 'Chiozzi P', 'Falzoni S', 'Di Virgilio F', 'Pistoia V']","['Laboratory of Oncology, Giannina Gaslini Institute, Largo Gerolamo Gaslini 5, Genoa, Italy 16147. lizziaraffaghello@ospedale-gaslini.ge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (P2RX7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7', 'Substance P/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/2/907 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3185 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 15;66(2):907-14. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3185.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DBP), was given to pregnant mice (15 mg/kg body weight, gavage) on gestation day 17. Significant mortalities in offspring, beginning at 12 weeks of age, were observed due to an aggressive T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Lymphocytes invaded numerous tissues. All mice surviving 10 months, exposed in utero to DBP, exhibited lung tumors; some mice also had liver tumors. To assess the role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in DBP transplacental cancer, B6129SF1/J (AHR(b-1/d), responsive) mice were crossed with strain 129S1/SvIm (AHR(d/d), nonresponsive) to determine the effect of maternal and fetal AHR status on carcinogenesis. Offspring born to nonresponsive mothers had greater susceptibility to lymphoma, irrespective of offspring phenotype. However, when the mother was responsive, an AHR-responsive phenotype in offspring increased mortality by 2-fold. In DBP-induced lymphomas, no evidence was found for TP53, beta-catenin, or Ki-ras mutations but lung adenomas of mice surviving to 10 months of age had mutations in Ki-ras codons 12 and 13. Lung adenomas exhibited a 50% decrease and a 35-fold increase in expression of Rb and p19/ARF mRNA, respectively.

Wnt signaling has been shown to control normal apoptotic behavior and is required for normal B-cell development whereas aberrant activation of this pathway has been observed in CLL. We show aberrant DNA methylation and silencing of SFRP4, as well as of additional SFRP family members, in primary CLL samples. Induction of their expression in a dose-dependent manner following treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, was shown. Of the five SFRP family members studied in detail, SFRP1 was hypermethylated and down-regulated in all CLL patient samples studied, suggesting that this epigenetic event is a critical step during leukemogenesis.

Moreover, it has recently been debated whether common virus integrations are always a hallmark of tumor cells and contribute to the oncogenic process. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with a variable response to treatment. Recurrent cytogenetic defects and acquired mutations in regulatory genes are associated with AML subtypes and prognosis. Recently, gene expression profiling (GEP) has been applied to further risk stratify AML. Here, we show that mouse leukemia genes identified by retroviral insertion mutagenesis are more frequently differentially expressed in distinct subclasses of adult and pediatric AML than randomly selected genes or genes located more distantly from a virus integration site. The candidate proto-oncogenes showing discriminative expression in primary AML could be placed in regulatory networks mainly involved in signal transduction and transcriptional control. Our data support the validity of retroviral insertion mutagenesis in mice for human disease and indicate that combining these murine screens for potential proto-oncogenes with GEP in human AML may help to identify critical disease genes and novel pathogenetic networks in leukemia.","['Erkeland, Stefan J', 'Verhaak, Roel G W', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Touw, Ivo P']","['Erkeland SJ', 'Verhaak RG', 'Valk PJ', 'Delwel R', 'Lowenberg B', 'Touw IP']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3000 DR Rotterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/02/16 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/2/622 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2908 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Jan 15;66(2):622-6. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2908.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such information is important for early diagnosis of this frequent complication and for choosing an appropriate treatment strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Osteonecrotic lesion size and location were determined in a retrospective analysis of MR images of the knee obtained in our institution during the past 10 years. Association between MRI findings and clinical symptoms expressed by the knee scores was tested for a subgroup of our patient population who had clinical evaluation of the knees in the orthopedic clinic within 6 weeks of their MRI studies. RESULTS: In 80% of patients, osteonecrosis was bilateral. Lesions were distributed as follows: femur and tibia, 66% of the knees; femur alone, 26%; and tibia alone, 8%. Clinical symptoms of knee osteonecrosis were associated with lesions involving the articular surface of the distal femur, large lesions, and involvement of any part of the tibia. MR images showed milder osteonecrosis in patients who were less than 10 years old at the time of primary diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Osteonecrosis affecting the knees of children treated for leukemia and lymphoma is mostly asymptomatic. Children who are 10 years old or older have signs of more advanced osteonecrosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of MRI studies of the knee performed in a single institution between April 1994 and July 2003. Knee osteonecrosis was identified in 168 children with a primary diagnosis of hematologic malignancy. This substantial number prompted us to design a staging system for use with pediatric patients. To assess interobserver reliability of two primary observers in using the system, they reviewed and interpreted the same 36 imaging studies of randomly chosen patients. For the assessment of intraobserver reproducibility, each observer rereviewed 16 studies. A senior observer coded potential causes of disagreement between the primary observers. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was substantial: the kappa value was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.75) in locations where the observers had to record only the presence or absence of a lesion, and the weighted kappa value was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.59-0.72) in locations where they had to classify the extent of involvement. The presence of marrow edema, punctate foci of altered signal, and mottled marrow changes was associated with a higher level of disagreement between the primary observers. CONCLUSION: Our proposed classification system, developed specifically for use with MRI, was used with substantial intra- and interobserver agreement. We think its use can contribute to a standardized approach to the interpretation of MRI findings in pediatric osteonecrosis of the knee.","['Karimova, Evguenia J', 'Rai, Shesh N', 'Deng, Xin', 'Ingle, David J', 'Ralph, Amy C', 'Neel, Michael D', 'Kaste, Sue C']","['Karimova EJ', 'Rai SN', 'Deng X', 'Ingle DJ', 'Ralph AC', 'Neel MD', 'Kaste SC']","[""Department of Radiological Sciences, Division of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N Lauderdale St., Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

All solvent extracts except hot water extract showed a significant and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of four cancer cell lines, MCF-7 breast cancer, B16 mouse melanoma, HL-60 human premyelocytic leukemia and HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma, with IC(50) values below 132 microg/ml. The EtOAc extract, in particular, had the most potent effect against all four cancer cell lines, with IC(50) between 12 microg/ml (on B16) and 45 microg/ml (on MCF-7). In contrast, it had much lower cytotoxicity against normal mouse bone marrow cells. The EtOAc extract contained carbohydrates, adenosine, ergosterol and trace amount of cordycepin, of which ergosterol and related compounds were identified as a major class of active constituents contributing to the in vitro cytotoxicity. In an animal test, the EtOAc extract showed significant inhibiting effect on B16-induced melanoma in C57BL/6 mice, causing about 60% decrease of tumor size over 27 days.

Regulation of Bcl-6 expression is incompletely characterized. Terminal B cell differentiation is associated with down-regulation of Bcl-6, activation of Blimp-1, modulation of Myc, and specifically with the up-regulation of the Mad1 and Mad4 transcription factors, which play a critical role in cell differentiation and cell cycle regulation. Because the Mad E-box consensus binding site is present in the upstream promoter of Bcl-6, we investigated whether Bcl-6 may be under control of the Mad1 transcription factor. Anti-sense Mad1 oligonucleotides abrogated the down-regulation of Bcl-6 expression that occurred during in vitro differentiation of mouse splenic B cells induced by dextran-conjugated anti-IgD Ab and IL-5. Transduction of the WEHI 231 B cell line with retroviruses expressing Mad1 down-regulated Bcl-6 expression. Expression of the 5' upstream promoter region of Bcl-6 was down-regulated by co-expression of Mad1. Last, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with anti-Mad1 Ab demonstrated in vivo interaction of Mad1 with the Bcl-6 promoter region.

However, the presence of neutralizing antibodies in cats recovering from natural FeLV infection clearly correlates with resistance to subsequent infection and passive transfer of antibodies can protect other animals. After demonstrating the induction of neutralizing antibodies in rats and goats immunized with the transmembrane envelope protein p15E of FeLV, cats were immunized with the same antigen. High titres of neutralizing antibodies specific for FeLV were induced and epitope mapping revealed a pattern of recognition similar to that seen following immunization of rats and goats. These epitopes are highly related to epitopes recognized after immunization with porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) p15E and to epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. The ability of p15E to induce neutralizing antibodies in cats suggests that it should be included in the next generation of vaccines. In contrast, sera from FeLV-infected animals usually fail to recognize the neutralization-relevant epitopes in p15E. Since homologous epitope sequences are present in feline endogenous retroviruses, it appears that tolerance against these sequences is not induced.","['Langhammer, Stefan', 'Hubner, Janine', 'Kurth, Reinhard', 'Denner, Joachim']","['Langhammer S', 'Hubner J', 'Kurth R', 'Denner J']","['Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (feline leukemia virus protein p15E)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cats', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/04/07 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['IMM2291 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2567.2005.02291.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2006 Feb;117(2):229-37. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2005.02291.x.,,,,PMC1782217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, further investigations focusing on dendritic cells, which are central in orchestrating the immune response, are needed. The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of myeloid leukaemia-derived cell lines, such as KG-1, THP-1 and MUTZ-3, to serve as in vitro models for dendritic cells. The ability of these cell lines to mature into functional dendritic cells, expressing costimulatory molecules, was assessed by functional and transcriptional profiling and compared with that of monocyte-derived dendritic cells, which are now used as a standard source of dendritic cells. High-density microarray analysis was utilized to study the transcriptional activity and kinetics of activation of the differentiated MUTZ-3 cell line, in response to a cocktail of inflammatory cytokines. The data obtained clearly demonstrate that MUTZ-3 cells have the ability to induce antigen-independent proliferation in CD4(+) CD45RA(+) T cells, whereas KG-1 and THP-1 only induced a marginal response. Furthermore, MUTZ-3 displayed the phenotypic and transcriptional profiles of immature dendritic cells, after differentiation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4. Upon activation with inflammatory cytokines, MUTZ-3 matured phenotypically and exhibited a gene induction similar to that of monocyte-derived dendritic cells. This delineation of the cellular and transcriptional activity of MUTZ-3, in response to maturational stimuli, demonstrates the significance of this cell line as a model for functional studies of inflammatory responses.","['Larsson, Kristina', 'Lindstedt, Malin', 'Borrebaeck, Carl A K']","['Larsson K', 'Lindstedt M', 'Borrebaeck CA']","['Department of Immunotechnology, Lund University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', '*Models, Biological', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/04/07 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['IMM2274 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2567.2005.02274.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2006 Feb;117(2):156-66. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2005.02274.x.,,,,PMC1782214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A related area of interest is the use of conditional probability calculations to make interim decisions in stochastic curtailment procedures. PURPOSE: The purpose of the paper is to develop group sequential designs based on conditional probabilities, to compare our results to the general closed form family of designs developed by Pampallona and Tsiatis, and to relate these to commonly used stochastic curtailment procedures. METHODS: The problem and its solution are formulated and derived mathematically. A graphical interpretation of the results provides the reader with an alternative mechanism to understand the results and their significance. RESULTS: One-sided group sequential design boundary points, as closed form functions, are derived from conditional probability statements. These conditional probability statements can be interpreted as the probability, at the final analysis, of reversing the conclusion reached at an interim state. Under mild constraints, these boundary points are identical to the Pampallona and Tsiatis boundary points. At any interim stage when a boundary point is attained or surpassed we suggest a graphical approach to examine the conditional probability of reversing the interim decision at the final stage versus a range of possible parameter values. For stochastic curtailment procedures, we recommend relaxing (increasing) the conditional probability levels to at least 0.50 so that early stopping is at least as likely as for the O'Brien-Fleming procedure. LIMITATIONS: The results are limited to one-sided group sequential designs. CONCLUSIONS: Conditional probabilities of reversing interim decisions provides a useful concept to develop group sequential designs and to evaluate stochastic curtailment procedures.","['Moser, Barry K', 'George, Stephen L']","['Moser BK', 'George SL']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B Statistical Center, Duke University Medical Center, Box 2717, Durham, NC 27710, USA. moser004@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Clin Trials,"Clinical trials (London, England)",101197451,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Endpoint Determination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', '*Models, Statistical', '*Probability', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Research Design']",2006/01/21 09:00,2006/03/18 09:00,['2006/01/21 09:00'],"['2006/01/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1191/1740774505cn120oa [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Trials. 2005;2(6):519-28. doi: 10.1191/1740774505cn120oa.,['CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study of increased incidence of malignancies was initiated after the accident. METHODS: The cohort included 1,137,106 inhabitants who were 0-60 years old in 1986 and lived in 8 counties of Sweden with the highest fallout of caesium-137. With the dwelling coordinate, GIS-technique and a digital map on caesium-137, each individual was matched for the exposure. Adjustments were made for several potential confounding factors. During the follow-up 33,851 malignancies was recorded 1988-1999. RESULTS: Exposure categories were: 0-8 (reference), 9-23, 24-43, 44-66, 67-84, and > or =85 nGy/hr.

Their treatment has always been incorporated into either paediatric or adult clinical trials depending on the mode of referral and hence there is a need to address an age and risk specific strategy for improving the outcome of this neglected group of patients. This article has summarised the recent and updated retrospective comparative analysis of adolescents treated on the Medical Research Council (MRC) trials. This analysis adds further emphasis to the treatment approach and the merits and limitations of treatment of adolescents on paediatric and adult trials. METHODS: A retrospective comparative analysis of adolescents aged 15-17 years, treated on either MRC ALL97/revised 99 (n = 61), a randomised paediatric trial or UKALLXII/E2993 (n = 67), an adult trial, between 1997 and 2002 was undertaken. RESULT: Results suggest a trend towards a superior outcome on paediatric trials. The 5-year EFS on ALL97 was 65% (95% CI = 52-78%) and on UKALLXII/E2993 was 49% (95% CI = 37-61%; P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis allowing for age and Ph status, diminished the EFS difference, but confirmed a reduced rate of death in remission in patients managed on the paediatric protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations in the methodology, comparative studies including our MRC study suggest a consistent advantage for adolescents managed intensively on paediatric trials. Redefining age limits with risk-based strategy and multi-centre collaboration should be considered to improve the survival of young adults.","['Ramanujachar, Ramya', 'Richards, Sue', 'Hann, Ian', 'Goldstone, Anthony', 'Mitchell, Christopher', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Rowe, Jacob', 'Webb, David']","['Ramanujachar R', 'Richards S', 'Hann I', 'Goldstone A', 'Mitchell C', 'Vora A', 'Rowe J', 'Webb D']","['Department of Molecular Haematology, Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['*Adolescent', '*Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', '*Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Remission Induction', 'Research Design', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2006/01/20 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2006/01/20 09:00'],"['2006/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20749 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Mar;48(3):254-61. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20749.,['MC_U137686856/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated if this mAb could bind and kill acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) B-progenitor lymphoblasts in vitro. ALL cell lines were used to determine if combining mAb 216 with chemotherapeutic drugs would enhance killing and cell lines were used to measure cytotoxicity by mAb 216 with human complement. PROCEDURE: Expression of cell surface markers and mAb 216 epitope on fresh and banked ALL bone marrow samples was determined by flow cytometry. Fresh lymphoblasts were incubated for 20 hr with mAb 216 without complement to measure cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity of ALL cell lines incubated with mAb 216 and vincristine (VCR) or human complement was determined using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Pre-B-ALL cells but not T-ALL cells are bound and killed by mAb 216. The combination of mAb 216 and VCR at sub-therapeutic levels demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity beyond that observed for either agent alone. Incubation of mAb 216 with human complement increased cytotoxicity of ALL cell lines. CONCLUSION: This increased cytotoxicity with chemotherapy and the functional ability of mAb 216 to use multiple pathways to induce cell death identify mAb 216 as a potentially novel therapeutic tool in the treatment of B-progenitor ALL. Based on the results from this preclinical study, a Phase I clinical trial with mAb 216 for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory B-lineage ALL is ongoing.","['Bieber, Marcia M', 'Twist, Clare J', 'Bhat, Neelima M', 'Teng, Nelson N H']","['Bieber MM', 'Twist CJ', 'Bhat NM', 'Teng NN']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA. bieber@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/immunology', 'Child', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy', 'Specimen Handling', 'Tissue Preservation']",2006/01/20 09:00,2007/04/28 09:00,['2006/01/20 09:00'],"['2006/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20770 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Apr;48(4):380-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20770.,['CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow trephines obtained from CML patients in complete remission with prolonged pancytopenia secondary to imatinib generally show marrow hypoplasia. Morphological features may be in keeping with either aplastic anemia or myelodysplasia developing in Philadelphia-negative hematopoiesis. Single or multilineage myelodysplasia may be accompanied by an excess of blasts and rarely evolves into acute leukemia in CML patients. Severe adverse hematological effects of imatinib are extremely rare. Current questions involve the molecular mechanisms of hematological side effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with special regard to the emergence of distinct aberrant clones.","['Schmitt-Graeff, A', 'Hochhaus, A']","['Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Hochhaus A']","['Pathologisches Institut, Universitat Freiburg, Postfach 214, 79002 Freiburg. annette.schmit-graeff@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*chemically induced', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects']",2006/01/20 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2006/01/20 09:00'],"['2006/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00292-005-0806-x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathologe. 2006 Feb;27(1):40-6. doi: 10.1007/s00292-005-0806-x.,,,Hamatologische Nebenwirkungen der Tyrosinkinaseinhibition mit Imatinib.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adult stem cells reside in every tissue of the body and have the ability to self-renew and to give rise to a high number of differentiated progeny. These are indeed the essential steps in tissue regeneration, which in some cases occurs constitutively, whereas in other cases happens in response to an injury. The identification of the key factors involved in self-renewal and differentiation pathways is at the top of the agenda of stem cell biologists. Interestingly, a number of factors that govern the fate of adult stem cells also play a role in malignant cell transformation, such as the Wnt cascade, Oct-4, Bmi-1 and Evi1. In addition, rare subpopulations of cancer stem cells were identified for leukemia and other solid tumors. These rare fractions of cancer stem cells are in large part responsible for maintaining the tumor mass, as they have the capacity to self-renew and to generate a high number of progeny via differentiation program. These findings can be considered a major breakthrough in cancer research. Currently, oncologists and stem cell biologists have two main goals: i) the assessment of the consistency of the line that divides adult stem cells and carcinogenesis; ii) to better characterize the biology of cancer stem cells. This new line of investigation may allow for the development of novel therapeutics and cancer diagnostics.","['Romano, Gaetano']",['Romano G'],"['Department of Neurosurgery, Thomas Jefferson University, Jefferson Hospital for the Neurosciences, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.

It is the precursor of an effective chemotherapeutic agent for leukemias and other hematological malignancies and received accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Clofarabine is phosphorylated intracellularly by human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) to the 5'-monophosphate, which is the rate-limiting step in activation of the prodrug. dCK has a broad substrate specificity, with a much higher activity to deoxycytidine than to deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine. As a purine-nucleoside analog, clofarabine is a better substrate of dCK than deoxycytidine. The crystal structure of dCK has been solved previously in complex with pyrimidine nucleosides and ADP [Sabini et al. (2003), Nature Struct. Biol. 10, 513-519]. In the current study, the crystal structure of clofarabine- and ADP-bound dCK was solved to 2.55 angstroms by molecular replacement. It appears that the enzyme takes the same conformation as in the structures of the pyrimidine nucleoside-bound complexes. The interactions between 2-Cl and its surrounding hydrophobic residues contribute to the high catalytic efficiency of dCK for clofarabine.","['Zhang, Yan', 'Secrist, John A 3rd', 'Ealick, Steven E']","['Zhang Y', 'Secrist JA 3rd', 'Ealick SE']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,"Acta crystallographica.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Apart from the removal of PCRT in NHL-BFM95, the chemotherapy of the three trials was identical except for the amount of l-asparaginase and daunorubicin during induction. The therapy in NHL-BFM95 was accepted to be noninferior when compared with trials NHL-BFM90/86 if the lower limit of the one-sided 95% CI for the difference in the 2-year probability of event-free-survival (pEFS) between target patients of NHL-BFM95 and the historical controls of NHL-BFM90/86 did not exceed -14%. The target patient group consisted of stage III and IV patients who were CNS negative and responded well to induction therapy. RESULTS: The number of target patients was 156 in NHL-BFM95 (median age, 8.6 years; range, 0.2 to 19.5 years) and 163 in NHL-BFM90/86 (median age, 8.4 years; range, 0.6 to 16.6 years). For the target group, the pEFS rates at 2 and 5 years were 86% +/- 3% and 82% +/- 3%, respectively, in NHL-BFM95 (median follow-up time, 5.1 years; range, 2.1 to 9.1 years) compared with 91% +/- 2% and 88% +/- 3%, respectively in NHL-BFM90/86 (median follow-up time, 10.7 years; range, 5 to 15.4 years). The lower limit of the one-sided 95% CI for the difference in pEFS was -11% at 2 years and -13% at 5 years. In NHL-BFM95, one isolated and two combined CNS relapses occurred compared with one combined CNS relapse in NHL-BFM90/86.

We investigated venous and arterial thromboembolism and associated outcomes in hospitalized cancer patients actively receiving therapy, as identified by neutropenia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the discharge database of the University HealthSystem Consortium. This included 66,106 adult neutropenic cancer patients with 88,074 hospitalizations between 1995 and 2002 at 115 medical centers in the United States. RESULTS: Thromboembolism was reported in 5,272 patients (8%), with 5.4% patients developing venous thromboembolism and 1.5% developing arterial thromboembolism during the first hospitalization. Patients with lymphoma and leukemia accounted for one third of venous and nearly one half of arterial events. Clinical variables most frequently associated with thromboembolism were age > or = 65 years; primary site of cancer, including lung, GI, gynecologic, and brain; and comorbidities, including infection, pulmonary and renal disease, and obesity. In-hospital mortality was significantly greater in patients with venous (odds ratio [OR] = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.83 to 2.22) or arterial thromboembolism (OR = 5.04; 95% CI, 4.38 to 5.79). From 1995 to 2002, there was a 36% increase in venous events and a 124% increase in arterial events (P < .0001 for trend). CONCLUSION: Thromboembolism is frequent in hospitalized neutropenic cancer patients, including in perceived low-risk subgroups such as patients with hematologic malignancies and nonmetastatic disease, and seems to be increasing. Thromboembolism is associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Increased efforts at thromboprophylaxis are warranted.","['Khorana, Alok A', 'Francis, Charles W', 'Culakova, Eva', 'Fisher, Richard I', 'Kuderer, Nicole M', 'Lyman, Gary H']","['Khorana AA', 'Francis CW', 'Culakova E', 'Fisher RI', 'Kuderer NM', 'Lyman GH']","['James P.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subsequent malignant neoplasm history was determined in 13,136 participants (surviving > or = 5 years postmalignancy, diagnosed from 1970 to 1986 at age < 21 years) of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. RESULTS: In 71 individuals, 71 carcinomas were diagnosed at a median age of 27 years and a median elapsed time of 15 years in the genitourinary system (35%), head and neck area (32%), gastrointestinal tract (23%), and other sites (10%). Fifty-nine patients (83%) had received radiotherapy, and 42 (59%) developed a second malignant neoplasm in a previous radiotherapy field. Risk was significantly elevated following all childhood diagnoses except CNS neoplasms, and was highest following neuroblastoma (SIR = 24.2) and soft tissue sarcoma (SIR = 6.2). Survivors of neuroblastoma had a 329-fold increased risk of renal cell carcinomas; survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma had a 4.5-fold increased risk of gastrointestinal carcinomas. Significantly elevated risk of head and neck carcinoma occurred in survivors of soft tissue sarcoma (SIR = 22.6), neuroblastoma (SIR = 20.9), and leukemia (SIR = 20.9). CONCLUSION: Young survivors of childhood cancers are at increased risk of developing subsequent carcinomas typical of later adulthood, underscoring the importance of long-term follow-up and risk-based screening. Follow-up of the cohort is ongoing to determine lifetime risk and delineate individual characteristics that contribute to risk.","['Bassal, Mylene', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Taylor, Leslie', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Greffe, Brian S', 'Hammond, Sue', 'Ronckers, Cecile M', 'Friedman, Debra L', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Yasui, Yutaka Y', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Meadows, Anna T', 'Kadan-Lottick, Nina S']","['Bassal M', 'Mertens AC', 'Taylor L', 'Neglia JP', 'Greffe BS', 'Hammond S', 'Ronckers CM', 'Friedman DL', 'Stovall M', 'Yasui YY', 'Robison LL', 'Meadows AT', 'Kadan-Lottick NS']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'SEER Program', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology']",2006/01/20 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2006/01/20 09:00'],"['2006/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/3/476 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.02.7235 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jan 20;24(3):476-83. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.7235.,"['K12RR17594/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 284 patients with late chronic-phase Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -positive chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib 400 mg daily after interferon-alpha failure. In a retrospective study, we evaluated the pattern and rapidity of the response to imatinib, comparing the cytogenetic and molecular responses, progression-free and overall survival rates in patients who obtained a complete cytogenetic response within 1 year of treatment (early responders), and in patients where a complete cytogenetic response was detected after 12 months (late responders). RESULTS: After 3 or 4 years of treatment, the molecular response of the late cytogenetic responders was similar to that of the early cytogenetic responders. At 36 months of treatment the amount of residual disease measured by standardized quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was 0.00047 in late responders versus 0.00022 in early responders, and at 48 months it was 0.00019 versus 0.00026 (median values, P value = nonsignificant). The estimated 4-year progression-free survival rate was 88% for early responders and 100% for late responders, while the estimated 4-year overall survival rates were 92% and 100% for early and late responders, respectively. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and the response (cytogenic and molecular) to imatinib may require 1 year or more. Long-term follow-up results continue to improve in terms of rates and durability of the complete cytogenetic response, major or complete molecular response, and progression-free and overall survival.","['Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Amabile, Marilina', 'Poerio, Angela', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Montefusco, Enrico', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Iuliano, Francesco', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Terragna, Carolina', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Iacobucci I', 'Rosti G', 'Amabile M', 'Poerio A', 'Soverini S', 'Cilloni D', 'Testoni N', 'Abruzzese E', 'Montefusco E', 'Ottaviani E', 'Iuliano F', 'Russo D', 'Gobbi M', 'Alimena G', 'Martino B', 'Terragna C', 'Pane F', 'Saglio G', 'Baccarani M', 'Martinelli G']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""Seragnoli"", University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/01/20 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2006/01/20 09:00'],"['2006/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/3/454 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.03.2011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Jan 20;24(3):454-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.2011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study included 280 incident cases of acute leukaemia and 288 controls frequency matched on gender, age, hospital, and ethnic origin. The data were obtained from standardised face to face interviews of the mothers with detailed questions on parental occupational history, home and garden insecticide use, and insecticidal treatment of pediculosis. Odds ratios were estimated using unconditional regression models including the stratification variables parental socioeconomic status and housing characteristics. RESULTS: Acute leukaemia was observed to be significantly associated with maternal home insecticide use during pregnancy (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.8) and during childhood (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4), with garden insecticide use (OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.3), and fungicide use (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 6.2) during childhood. Insecticidal shampoo treatment of pediculosis was also associated with childhood acute leukaemia (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.3). CONCLUSION: The results reported herein support the hypothesis that various types of insecticide exposure may be a risk factor for childhood acute leukaemia. The observed association with insecticidal shampoo treatment of pediculosis, which has never been investigated before, requires further study.","['Menegaux, F', 'Baruchel, A', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Lescoeur, B', 'Leverger, G', 'Nelken, B', 'Sommelet, D', 'Hemon, D', 'Clavel, J']","['Menegaux F', 'Baruchel A', 'Bertrand Y', 'Lescoeur B', 'Leverger G', 'Nelken B', 'Sommelet D', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['INSERM, U170, IFR69, Villejuif, France. menegaux@vjf.inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Insecticides)', '0 (Pesticides)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Insecticides/toxicity', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Lice Infestations/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Paternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Pesticides/*toxicity', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Scalp Dermatoses/drug therapy']",2006/01/20 09:00,2006/02/01 09:00,['2006/01/20 09:00'],"['2006/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['63/2/131 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2005.023036 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2006 Feb;63(2):131-4. doi: 10.1136/oem.2005.023036.,,,,PMC2078075,,,['HALMS85342'],,,,['NLM: HALMS85342'],,,,,,,,,

To demonstrate this, we targeted the c-MYB protooncogene's mRNA in human leukemia cells with fully phosphorothioated 2'F-ANA-DNA chimeras (PS-2'FANA-DNA) and compared their gene silencing efficiency with AS ON containing unmodified nucleosides (PS-DNA). When delivered by nucleofection, chemically modified ON of both types effected a >90% knockdown of c-MYB mRNA and protein expression, but the PS-2'F-ANA-DNA were able to accomplish this at 20% of the dose of the PS-DNA, and in contrast to the PS-AS DNA, their silencing effect was still present after 4 days after a single administration.

Interestingly, both decreasing and increasing effects of DTT on arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis have been reported. We now provide data to show that, at high concentrations, DTT, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS) decreased arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. In contrast, at low concentrations DTT, DMSA, and DMPS increased the arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis. DTT at a high concentration (3 mM) decreased, whereas at a low concentration (0.1 mM), it increased the cell growth inhibition of arsenic trioxide, methylarsonous acid (MMA(III)), and dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)) in NB4 cells. DMSA and DMPS are currently used as antidotes for acute arsenic poisoning. These two dithiol compounds also show an inverse-hormetic effect on arsenic toxicity in terms of DNA damage, micronucleus induction, apoptosis, and colony formation in experiments using human epithelial cell lines derived from arsenic target tissues such as the kidney and bladder. With the oral administration of dithiols, the concentrations of these dithiol compounds in the human body are likely to be low. Therefore, the present results suggest the necessity of reevaluating the therapeutic effect of these dithiol compounds for arsenic poisoning.","['Jan, Kun-Yan', 'Wang, Tsing-Cheng', 'Ramanathan, Balakrishnan', 'Gurr, Jia-Ran']","['Jan KY', 'Wang TC', 'Ramanathan B', 'Gurr JR']","['Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '4076-02-2 (Unithiol)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'DX1U2629QE (Succimer)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Arsenites/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Dithiothreitol/*toxicity', 'Drug Interactions', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective', 'Succimer/*toxicity', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/analysis', 'Unithiol/*toxicity']",2006/01/20 09:00,2006/06/23 09:00,['2006/01/20 09:00'],"['2006/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['kfj108 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfj108 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2006 Apr;90(2):432-9. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfj108.

In systematic reviews on the clinical use of rFVIIa, treatment failures were only rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 45-year old, Caucasian male with persistent intestinal bleeding due to enterocolitis associated with cytomegalovirus infection and acute graft-versus-host-disease. He had received allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from an unrelated HLA-identical donor because of chronic myelogenous leukaemia diagnosed two years earlier. Bleeding started at day 18 after transplantation with bloody diarrhea, which was treated with multiple transfusions of fresh frozen plasma, platelet, and red blood cell concentrates, and continued relentlessly, despite all efforts, including continued transfusions, high-dose prednisolone, broad antibiotic and antiviral coverage, and tranexamic acid. Recombinant FVIIa was started at boluses of 90-120 mug/kg every 4-8 hours. Despite more than 10 doses, recurrent severe bleeding progressed to refractory shock, multiorgan failure and death. CONCLUSIONS: Little can be concluded from single case reports of clinical improvement, because publication bias in favour of positive effects is likely. Our case suggests that rFVIIa is not a panacea, in particular for severe bleeding after bone-marrow transplantation. As long as rigorous, controlled studies or comprehensive registries are lacking, conventional interventions remain the standard of care in non-haemophilic patients with severe bleeding.","['Eller, P', 'Pechlaner, C', 'Wiedermann, Cj']","['Eller P', 'Pechlaner C', 'Wiedermann C']","['2nd Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Central Hospital of Bolzano, Lorenz Boehler Street 5, I-39100 Bolzano (BZ), Italy. christian.wiedermann@uibk.ac.at.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Thromb J,Thrombosis journal,101170542,,,,2006/01/20 09:00,2006/01/20 09:01,['2006/01/20 09:00'],"['2005/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:01 [medline]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['1477-9560-4-1 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-9560-4-1 [doi]']",epublish,Thromb J. 2006 Jan 18;4:1. doi: 10.1186/1477-9560-4-1.,,,,PMC1373608,20060118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cutaneous manifestations are attributed to the underlying bone marrow defect. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is primarily a pediatric disease, and rarely LCH has been described in association with pediatric MDS. We are aware of only a single case report of LCH associated with MDS in an adult. METHODS: We report two new cases of LCH in elderly patients with underlying MDS. The specimens were examined by routine microscopy as well as immunohistochemical stains for S100 protein and CD1a. RESULTS: Both patients were elderly men with established diagnoses of MDS. One presented with a solitary pruritic papule while the other had a 2-year history of erythematous papules involving the trunk and extremities. Histologic examination revealed intraepidermal and dermal collections of mononuclear cells with reniform nuclei. The cells were strongly positive for S100 and CD1a, confirming their identity as Langerhans cells.

The detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) for predicting prognosis and for therapeutic planning still are under discussion. METHODS: The authors studied 216 patients with AML at the time of initial diagnosis and during follow-up and correlated cytomorphology, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and flow cytometry results to evaluate response status. They further tested the prognostic impact of those results, especially in patients who achieved a morphologic CR. RESULTS: Interphase FISH was found to be correlated significantly with the clinical course at the time of complete cytomorphologic remission and was more reliable than morphology for defining CR. Furthermore, interphase FISH was correlated with immunophenotyping results at all times during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that interphase FISH may be used as a valid MRD parameter in patients with AML. Multiparameter immunophenotyping for MRD also was correlated strongly with the clinical course, and the authors suggest integrating such immunophenotyping into the routine diagnostic panel at the time of diagnosis and during the clinical course in patients with AML.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Bacher U', 'Kern W', 'Schoch C', 'Schnittger S', 'Hiddemann W', 'Haferlach T']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department for Internal Medicine III, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. ulrike.bacher@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2006/01/19 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2006/01/19 09:00'],"['2006/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21665 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Feb 15;106(4):839-47. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21665.,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

As a result, genes at the breakpoints can be disrupted, forming fusion genes. One of the genes involved in several chromosome aberrations in hematological malignancies is NUP98 (11p15). As NUP98 is close to the 11p telomere, small translocations might easily be missed. Using a NUP98-specific split-signal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe combination, we analyzed 84 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome with either normal karyotypes or 11p abnormalities to investigate whether there are unidentified 11p15 rearrangements. Neither NUP98 translocations nor deletions were identified in cases with normal karyotypes, indicating these aberrations may be very rare in this group. However, NUP98 deletions were observed in four cases with unbalanced 11p aberrations, indicating that the breakpoint is centromeric of NUP98. Rearrangements of NUP98 were identified in two patients, both showing 11p abnormalities in the diagnostic karyotype: a t(4;11)(q1?3;p15) with expression of the NUP98-RAP1GDS1 fusion product detected in a 60-year-old woman with AML-M0, and an add(11)(p15) with a der(21)t(11;21)(p15;p13) observed cytogenetically in a 1-year-old boy with AML-M7.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: BAALC expression was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in pretreatment blood samples of 307 adults <or= 60 years of age with AML with normal cytogenetics. Patients were dichotomized at BAALC's median expression into low and high expressers. The FLT3 ITD mutant:wild-type ratio was determined by fragment analysis. RESULTS: Compared with low-BAALC patients, high-BAALC patients had a higher rate of primary resistant leukemia (16% v 6%; P = .006). High BAALC expression was associated with a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR; P = .018) and an inferior overall survival (OS; 3-year OS, 36% v 54%; P = .001). On multivariable analysis, high BAALC was independently predictive of resistant disease (P = .019), and high BAALC as well as a high FLT3 mutant:wild-type ratio were confirmed as the only factors predicting a high CIR (BAALC, P = .03; FLT3, P = .01) and inferior OS (BAALC, P = .001; FLT3, P = .012). CONCLUSION: This study strengthens BAALC expression as one of the most important prognostic factors in AML patients with normal cytogenetics.

DLBCL is heterogeneous, and the expression of BCL2 is variable within the two major subgroups of DLBCL, germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL, as well as primary mediastinal DLBCL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated the correlation of BCL2 expression with survival in the two major subgroups of DLBCL, as well as the mechanisms of BCL2 expression. RESULTS: There was no significant correlation between BCL2 protein expression and overall survival within the GCB subgroup, but BCL2 expression had a significant adverse effect on overall survival within the ABC subgroup (P = .008). This correlation was also observed at the mRNA level (P < .04). The difference remained significant when the analyses were performed at different cutoff values. The t(14;18) was frequently observed in the GCB subgroup and was highly associated with BCL2 expression. Patients with ABC DLBCL did not exhibit t(14;18) but had a markedly higher frequency of chromosome 18q21 amplification, on which BCL2 resides. Thus, alternative mechanisms such as 18q21 amplification or activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway, as reported previously, seem to be mainly responsible for the upregulation of BCL2 expression in the ABC subgroup. CONCLUSION: Treating all DLBCL as a single entity ignores the mechanistic differences in BCL2 upregulation and obscures the prognostic significance of BCL2 expression. Hence, the significance of BCL2 and other biomarkers should be assessed in the context of DLBCL subgroups in future studies.","['Iqbal, Javeed', 'Neppalli, Vishala T', 'Wright, George', 'Dave, Bhavana J', 'Horsman, Douglas E', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Lynch, James', 'Hans, Christine P', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Greiner, Timothy C', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Campo, Elias', 'Ott, German', 'Muller-Hermelink, H Konrad', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Grogan, Thomas M', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Vose, Julie M', 'Armitage, James O', 'Staudt, Louis M', 'Chan, Wing C']","['Iqbal J', 'Neppalli VT', 'Wright G', 'Dave BJ', 'Horsman DE', 'Rosenwald A', 'Lynch J', 'Hans CP', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Greiner TC', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Campo E', 'Ott G', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Delabie J', 'Jaffe ES', 'Grogan TM', 'Connors JM', 'Vose JM', 'Armitage JO', 'Staudt LM', 'Chan WC']","['Leukemia/Lymphoma Molecular Profiling Project, Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-3135, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*chemistry', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation']",2006/01/19 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/01/19 09:00'],"['2006/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.03.4264 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.03.4264 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Feb 20;24(6):961-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.4264.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80001 was a study to determine whether SLNS could identify a subset of LNs that predicted the status of the nodal basin for resectable colon cancer and, therefore, could be extensively evaluated for the presence of micrometastases. Patients enrolled onto this study underwent SLNS after injection of 1% isosulfan blue, and both sentinel nodes (SNs) and non-SNs obtained during primary tumor resection were sectioned at multiple levels and stained using anti-carcinoembryonic antigen and anticytokeratin antibodies. RESULTS: Using standard histopathology, SNs failed to predict the presence of nodal disease in 13 (54%) of 24 node-positive patients. Immunostains were performed for patients whose LNs were negative by standard histopathology. Depending on the immunohistochemical criteria used to assign LN positivity, SN examination resulted in either an unacceptably high false-positive rate (20%) or a low sensitivity for detection of MMD (40%). CONCLUSION: By examining both SNs and non-SNs, this multi-institutional study showed that SNs did not accurately predict the presence of either conventionally defined nodal metastases or MMD. As a result, SLNS is not a useful technique for the study of MMD in patients with colon cancer.","['Redston, Mark', 'Compton, Carolyn C', 'Miedema, Brent W', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Dowell, Jeannette M', 'Jewell, Scott D', 'Fleshman, James M', 'Bem, Jiri', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Bertagnolli, Monica M']","['Redston M', 'Compton CC', 'Miedema BW', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Dowell JM', 'Jewell SD', 'Fleshman JM', 'Bem J', 'Mayer RJ', 'Bertagnolli MM']","[""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/analysis', 'Colonic Neoplasms/chemistry/*pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Keratins/analysis', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology/*surgery', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy']",2006/01/19 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/01/19 09:00'],"['2006/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.03.6038 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.03.6038 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Feb 20;24(6):878-83. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.6038.

The goal of this study was to elucidate additional factors potentially characterizing their discordance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated ZAP-70 expression by flow cytometry, VH status by DNA sequencing, and genomic aberrations by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 148 CLL patients. The parameters were analyzed for their associations and their individual prognostic impact. RESULTS: ZAP-70 expression and VH mutation status were strongly associated in CLL without additional genetic high-risk-features as defined by the absence of 11q or 17p deletion and V3-21 usage (concordance 84%). In contrast, the proportion of discordant cases was significantly higher (39%), if such additional genetic high-risk features were present. Discordant cases with V3-21 usage were almost exclusively ZAP-70 positive and VH mutated (89%), whereas all but one of the discordant cases with high-risk aberrations were ZAP-70 negative and VH unmutated (92%). By multivariate regression analysis, two models were developed, which both include high-risk genomic aberrations and, alternatively, VH mutation status and V3-21 usage or ZAP-70 expression as independent outcome predictors. CONCLUSION: There were characteristic modes of discordance between ZAP-70 and VH mutation status depending on the presence or absence of additional genetic high-risk features such as 11q and 17p deletion or V3-21 usage. Although the biologic background for these findings is yet to be determined, these data have biologic and clinical implications regarding ZAP-70 as a pathogenic factor and outcome predictor, respectively.","['Krober, Alexander', 'Bloehdorn, Johannes', 'Hafner, Sebastian', 'Buhler, Andreas', 'Seiler, Till', 'Kienle, Dirk', 'Winkler, Dirk', 'Bangerter, Markus', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Benner, Axel', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Krober A', 'Bloehdorn J', 'Hafner S', 'Buhler A', 'Seiler T', 'Kienle D', 'Winkler D', 'Bangerter M', 'Schlenk RF', 'Benner A', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Mutation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Survival Analysis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/analysis/*genetics']",2006/01/19 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/01/19 09:00'],"['2006/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.03.7184 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.03.7184 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Feb 20;24(6):969-75. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.7184.

The use of tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) that induce the generation/activation of regulatory T (Tr) cells for the treatment of acute GVHD following allogeneic BMT has been recently established. Therefore, the identification of factors that contribute to the development of tolerogenic DCs is highly relevant. We report on the use of the known immunosuppressive neuropeptide, the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), as a new approach to induce tolerogenic DCs with the capacity to prevent acute GVHD. DCs differentiated in the presence of VIP impair allogeneic haplotype-specific responses of donor CD4(+) cells in mice given transplants by inducing the generation of Tr cells in the graft. VIP-induced tolerogenic DCs did not abrogate the graft-versus-leukemia response presumably by not affecting the cytotoxicity of transplanted T cells against the leukemic cells. Therefore, the inclusion of VIP-induced tolerogenic DCs in future therapeutic regimens may minimize the dependence on nonspecific immunosuppressive drugs used currently as antirejection therapy, and facilitate the successful transplantation from mismatched donors, by reducing the deleterious consequences of acute GVHD and extending the applicability of BMT.","['Chorny, Alejo', 'Gonzalez-Rey, Elena', 'Fernandez-Martin, Amelia', 'Ganea, Doina', 'Delgado, Mario']","['Chorny A', 'Gonzalez-Rey E', 'Fernandez-Martin A', 'Ganea D', 'Delgado M']","['Institute of Parasitology and Biomedicine, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, CSIC, Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*immunology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*pharmacology']",2006/01/19 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/01/19 09:00'],"['2006/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65569-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-11-4495 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 1;107(9):3787-94. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-11-4495.

However, transplantation of F/P-transduced hematopoietic stem cells/progenitors (F/P(+) HSCs/Ps) into mice results in a chronic myelogenous leukemia-like disease, which does not resemble HES. Because a subgroup of patients with HES show T-cell-dependent interleukin-5 (IL-5) overexpression, we determined if expression of the F/P fusion gene in the presence of transgenic T-cell IL-5 overexpression in mice induces HES-like disease. Mice that received a transplant of CD2-IL-5-transgenic F/P(+) HSC/Ps (IL-5Tg-F/P) developed intense leukocytosis, strikingly high eosinophilia, and eosinophilic infiltration of nonhematopoietic as well as hematopoietic tissues, a phenotype resembling human HES. The disease phenotype was transferable to secondary transplant recipients of a high cell dose, suggesting involvement of a short-term repopulating stem cell or an early myeloid progenitor. Induction of significant eosinophilia was specific for F/P since expression of another fusion oncogene, p210-BCR/ABL, in the presence of IL-5 overexpression was characterized by a significantly lower eosinophilia than IL-5Tg-F/P recipients. These results suggest that F/P is not sufficient to induce a HES/CEL-like disease but requires a second event associated with IL-5 overexpression.","['Yamada, Yoshiyuki', 'Rothenberg, Marc E', 'Lee, Andrew W', 'Akei, Hiroko Saito', 'Brandt, Eric B', 'Williams, David A', 'Cancelas, Jose A']","['Yamada Y', 'Rothenberg ME', 'Lee AW', 'Akei HS', 'Brandt EB', 'Williams DA', 'Cancelas JA']","[""Division of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Eosinophils/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Interleukin-5/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*genetics', 'Spleen/pathology', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*genetics']",2006/01/19 09:00,2006/06/15 09:00,['2006/01/19 09:00'],"['2006/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63838-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-08-3153 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 15;107(10):4071-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-08-3153.

We report here the identification of the CEBPB gene as a target of translational regulation in myeloid precursor cells transformed by the BCR/ABL oncogene. Expression of CEBPB was repressed in 32D-BCR/ABL cells and reinduced by imatinib (STI571) via a mechanism that appears to depend on expression of the CUG-repeat RNA-binding protein CUGBP1 and the integrity of the CUG-rich intercistronic region of c/ebpbeta mRNA. Constitutive expression or conditional activation of wild-type CEBPB induced differentiation and inhibited proliferation of 32D-BCR/ABL cells in vitro and in mice, but a DNA binding-deficient CEBPB mutant had no effect.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry were used. In total 140,137 newly diagnosed patients diagnosed between 1980 and 2002 and followed until 1 January 2005 were included. Five-, 10- and 20-year relative survival rates were calculated. RESULTS: For total cancer in men and women, childhood cancer, rectal cancer, melanoma in women, breast cancer, prostate cancer and all leukaemias, much higher 10-year survival rates were found with period analyses (differences with cohort analyses were 5.1%, 3.6%, 7.4%, 5.6%, 6.5%, 4.0%, 5.1% and 10.5%, respectively). For laryngeal and bladder cancer the 10-year survival rates estimated with period analyses were about 7.5% lower compared with those estimated by means of cohort analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Period analysis, based on the most recent period of diagnosis, enabled us to show higher survival rates for total cancer, childhood cancer, rectal cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer and acute leukaemia, but also lower rates for laryngeal and bladder cancer.

Antibodies binding the immunosuppressive molecule CD200 were identified by cell panning of an antibody phage display library derived from rabbits immunized with primary CLL cells. B cells from 87 CLL patients exhibited 1.6- to 5.4-fold cell-surface up-regulation of CD200 relative to normal B cells. An effect of increased CD200 expression by CLL cells on the immune system was evaluated in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Addition of primary CLL but not normal B cells to macrophages and T cells downregulated the Th1 response, as seen by a 50-95% reduction in secreted IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Antibodies to CD200 prevented downregulation of the Th1 response in most B cell CLL samples evaluated, indicating abrogation of the CD200/CD200R interaction can be sufficient to restore the Th1 response. A disease-progression-associated shift of the immune response from Th1 to Th2 has been observed in numerous cancers. Because this cytokine shift is also believed to promote the induction of regulatory T cells, reverting the immune response to Th1 through direct targeting of the cancer cells may provide therapeutic benefits in CLL by encouraging a cytotoxic T cell response.","['McWhirter, John R', 'Kretz-Rommel, Anke', 'Saven, Alan', 'Maruyama, Toshiaki', 'Potter, Kathleen N', 'Mockridge, C Ian', 'Ravey, E Prenn', 'Qin, Fenghua', 'Bowdish, Katherine S']","['McWhirter JR', 'Kretz-Rommel A', 'Saven A', 'Maruyama T', 'Potter KN', 'Mockridge CI', 'Ravey EP', 'Qin F', 'Bowdish KS']","['Alexion Antibody Technologies, Incorporated, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Peptide Library)']",IM,"['Antibodies/*chemistry', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/chemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Monocytes/metabolism', '*Peptide Library', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/cytology', 'Th1 Cells', 'Th2 Cells/immunology']",2006/01/19 09:00,2006/03/18 09:00,['2006/01/19 09:00'],"['2006/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['0510081103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0510081103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jan 24;103(4):1041-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0510081103.

However at present, the genetic complexity of AML is only partially understood. To obtain a comprehensive, unbiased, quantitative measure, we performed serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) on CD15(+) myeloid progenitor cells from 22 AML patients who had four of the most common translocations, namely t(8;21), t(15;17), t(9;11), and inv(16). The quantitative data provide clear evidence that the major change in all these translocation-carrying leukemias is a decrease in expression of the majority of transcripts compared with normal CD15(+) cells. From a total of 1,247,535 SAGE tags, we identified 2,604 transcripts whose expression was significantly altered in these leukemias compared with normal myeloid progenitor cells. The gene ontology of the 1,110 transcripts that matched known genes revealed that each translocation had a uniquely altered profile in various functional categories including regulation of transcription, cell cycle, protein synthesis, and apoptosis. Our global analysis of gene expression of common translocations in AML can focus attention on the function of the genes with altered expression for future biological studies as well as highlight genes/pathways for more specifically targeted therapy.","['Lee, Sanggyu', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Zhou, Guolin', 'Shi, Run Zhang', 'Bouffard, Gerard G', 'Kocherginsky, Masha', 'Ge, Xijin', 'Sun, Miao', 'Jayathilaka, Nimanthi', 'Kim, Yeong Cheol', 'Emmanuel, Neelmini', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Minden, Mark', 'Kline, Justin', 'Ozer, Ozden', 'Larson, Richard A', 'LeBeau, Michelle M', 'Green, Eric D', 'Trent, Jeffery', 'Karrison, Theodore', 'Liu, Piu Paul', 'Wang, San Ming', 'Rowley, Janet D']","['Lee S', 'Chen J', 'Zhou G', 'Shi RZ', 'Bouffard GG', 'Kocherginsky M', 'Ge X', 'Sun M', 'Jayathilaka N', 'Kim YC', 'Emmanuel N', 'Bohlander SK', 'Minden M', 'Kline J', 'Ozer O', 'Larson RA', 'LeBeau MM', 'Green ED', 'Trent J', 'Karrison T', 'Liu PP', 'Wang SM', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Lewis X Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2006/01/19 09:00,2006/03/18 09:00,['2006/01/19 09:00'],"['2006/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['0509878103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0509878103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jan 24;103(4):1030-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0509878103.

Decreasing the dose of Cas-Br-E murine leukemia virus when priming neonatal mice results in adult-like, Type 1 protective responses, but the resulting memory cell populations are smaller than after adult priming. After secondary challenge, virus-specific CD8+ memory cell populations expand twice as much in neonate-primed mice as in adult-primed mice. We found that when equivalent numbers of virus-specific cells were transferred into virus-susceptible mice, protection from disease was similar whether donor, immune mice were primed as neonates or adults, and IL-4 did not alter in vivo virus-specific CD8+ memory cell effector function. Hence, neonate-primed CD8+ cells develop into memory cells that rival adult-primed cells in proliferation and effector function.","['Fadel, Shaza A', 'Cowell, Lindsay G', 'Cao, Shui', 'Ozaki, Daniel A', 'Kepler, Thomas B', 'Steeber, Douglas A', 'Sarzotti, Marcella']","['Fadel SA', 'Cowell LG', 'Cao S', 'Ozaki DA', 'Kepler TB', 'Steeber DA', 'Sarzotti M']","['Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunization, Secondary', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Interleukin-4/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/prevention & control', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/prevention & control']",2006/01/19 09:00,2006/08/24 09:00,['2006/01/19 09:00'],"['2006/01/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['dxh360 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxh360 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2006 Feb;18(2):249-57. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxh360.

In most cases (18/23), abnormalities (bright, dim, or negative expression) of 2 or more pan-T-cell antigens were identified, with all cases showing abnormal CD5 levels. Abnormal expression of CD94 was identified in 22 of 23 cases, and 15 of 21 cases also showed abnormal expression of class 1 MHC receptor molecules identified by antibodies against CD158a, CD158b, CD158e, CD158i, CD158k, and CD94.

Normal control specimens and 18 cases of monocytic neoplasia were evaluated and results correlated with morphologic findings. We found the MY4 epitope first appearing at the early promonocyte stage and the MO2 epitope appearing only on mature monocytes after the promonocyte stage. Expression of the MY4 and MO2 epitopes by neoplastic monocyte populations was found to usually parallel the normal monocyte differentiation patterns, although exceptions were noted.

There has been increasing interest in their potential role in some of the behavioral features of depressive disorders. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a proinflammatory cytokine, produces stimulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion in response to emotional and inflammatory stress and recently has been linked to depressive-type behavior. Both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the immune system, including cytokine-mediated responses, appear to be susceptible to long-term programming during fetal and neonatal development. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to characterize the effects of perinatal exposure to corticostereone on behavior, hypothalamic LIF and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA expression, and basal plasma corticosterone levels in adult female mice. METHODS: Corticosterone was added to the drinking water beginning the last week of gestation and continued until weaning. Behavior in the open field and forced swim tests, baseline plasma corticosterone levels, and hypothalamic LIF and CRH gene expression were evaluated in the adult offspring. RESULTS: Mice exposed to perinatal corticosterone showed increased immobility in the forced swim test and increased locomotor activity in the open field test. Although there were no differences between treatment groups in terms of basal plasma levels of corticosterone or hypothalamic CRH mRNA, LIF mRNA expression was increased in the hypothalamus. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that perinatal exposure to glucocorticoids can produce long-term behavioral changes and upregulation of central LIF mRNA expression.","['Pechnick, Robert N', 'Kariagina, Anastasia', 'Hartvig, Evelyn', 'Bresee, Catherine J', 'Poland, Russell E', 'Chesnokova, Vera M']","['Pechnick RN', 'Kariagina A', 'Hartvig E', 'Bresee CJ', 'Poland RE', 'Chesnokova VM']","['Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8730 Alden Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. pechnickr@cshs.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Psychopharmacology (Berl),Psychopharmacology,7608025,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/blood/*pharmacology', 'Behavior, Animal/*drug effects', 'Corticosterone/blood/*pharmacology', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Motor Activity/drug effects', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/drug effects', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'RNA, Messenger']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/08/04 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2005/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00213-005-0258-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychopharmacology (Berl). 2006 Mar;185(1):76-83. doi: 10.1007/s00213-005-0258-2.

Modulation of resistance has been attempted in different studies, but the results have been contradictory. We conducted an open, randomized multicenter clinical trial involving patients more than 60 years old with secondary leukemia preceded by a myelodysplastic syndrome. The induction chemotherapy regimen included idarubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide (group A); randomization involved simultaneous administration of cyclosporin-A per os (group B). Fifty-five patients were evaluated, 26 in group A and 29 in group B. Overall complete remission was achieved in 40% of the patients, 27% vs 52% in groups A and B, respectively (p=0.01). Leukemia-free survival was more favorable in patients who received cyclosporin-A, 12 vs 7 months for groups B and A, respectively (p=0.03). In a follow up period of 30 months, 7 out of 55 patients (13%) were alive, 4 of whom were in complete remission.

However, little is known about the reasons for this lack of expression in neoplasia. In a previous report, our group demonstrated how MC-IXC, a neuroblastoma cell line which lacked DMBT1 expression, restored it after a 5-Aza-2'-deoxycitidine treatment. So, we wondered whether DMBT1 aberrant promoter methylation could be responsible for DMBT1 silencing in several tumor cell lines, in spite of the fact that there is no CpG island near the 5' end of the gene. We studied the possibility that methylation in CCWGG sequences of the DMBT1 promoter (where ""W"" means ""A"" or ""T"") is able to silence the gene, as had previously been reported for TP53 in leukemia. We digested genomic DNA by the methylation sensitive restriction enzyme EcoR II (C|CWGG), and made two PCRs to amplify the three CCWGG domains placed in the 1 kb upstream DMBT1 5' end. After the PCRs, we could not find correlation between methylation in CCWGG domains and DMBT1 lack of expression.

METHODS: Cases were collected from the clinical laboratory diagnosis database at USLabs/LabCorp over the past two years (2002 to 2004). Cases that showed deletions in the long arm of chromosome 7 were then reviewed. Interstitial deletions in the long arm of chromosome 7 were further investigated according to the indications for clinical laboratory studies and flow cytometry findings. The final clinical diagnosis for each case was obtained from the referring physician. RESULTS: A total of 19,483 cases were included in this series. Eighty-five cases were observed to have either terminal or interstitial deletion in the long arm of chromosome 7. Of the 85 cases, 46 had interstitial deletions accounting for 54.1% of the 7q deletions combined. B-LPDs were found in 10 of the 46 cases, accounting for 21.7%. The B-LPDs associated with 7q interstitial deletions were diverse, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) in five cases. The deleted region in the long arm of chromosome 7 in the 10 cases associated with B-LPDs was solely confined to the 7q22-q32 region. CONCLUSION: (1) The frequency of 7q interstitial deletions associated with B-LPDs is substantially high; (2) 7q interstitial deletions are not uncommon in B-CLL.","['Lu, Gary', 'Zhang, John', 'Pauper, Katherine']","['Lu G', 'Zhang J', 'Pauper K']","['Department of Pathology and Genetics, USLabs/LabCorp, Irvine, California 91612, USA. ghlu2003@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

We demonstrate essential roles of the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF), a sensor of cytoskeletal actin dynamics, in all these processes. Conditional deletion of the mouse Srf gene reduced neurite outgrowth and abolished mossy fiber segregation, resulting in ectopic fiber growth inside the pyramidal layer. SRF-deficient mossy fibers aberrantly targeted CA3 somata for synapse formation. Axon guidance assays showed that SRF was a key mediator of ephrin-A and semaphorin guidance cues; in SRF-deficient neurons, these resulted in the formation of F-actin-microtubule rings rather than complete growth cone collapse. Dominant-negative variants of the SRF cofactor megakaryocytic acute leukemia (MAL) severely impeded neurite outgrowth and guidance. These data highlight essential links between SRF-mediated transcription and axon guidance and circuit formation in the hippocampus.","['Knoll, Bernd', 'Kretz, Oliver', 'Fiedler, Christine', 'Alberti, Siegfried', 'Schutz, Gunther', 'Frotscher, Michael', 'Nordheim, Alfred']","['Knoll B', 'Kretz O', 'Fiedler C', 'Alberti S', 'Schutz G', 'Frotscher M', 'Nordheim A']","['Interfakultares Institut fur Zellbiologie, Abt.

We report the discovery of a new class of Bcr-abl inhibitors using an unbiased differential cytotoxicity screen of a combinatorial kinase-directed heterocycle library. Compounds in this class (exemplified by GNF-2) show exclusive antiproliferative activity toward Bcr-abl-transformed cells, with potencies similar to imatinib, while showing no inhibition of the kinase activity of full-length or catalytic domain of c-abl.

Neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands is a recently described clinical entity and an evolving disease concept. Its relationship to acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome), pyoderma gangrenosum, and a primary vasculitis has been debated. OBSERVATIONS: We present 9 cases (8 women and 1 man) of neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands, all with consistent histologic features. Two cases had histologic evidence of vasculitis, and 3 had clinical extension of lesions onto the forearms. Most showed fever, leukocytosis, and/or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Individual cases were associated with leukemia, lung carcinoma, and inflammatory bowel disease. All 9 patients responded to systemic corticosteroid therapy, with additional response to dapsone, methotrexate, and potassium iodide therapies in several cases. Of the 9 patients, 5 showed complete resolution of their skin disease, whereas 4 required ongoing therapy. We assessed the 43 cases previously reported in the literature. CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation, laboratory data, histologic features, and response to corticosteroid therapy offer strong evidence that neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands is a localized variant of Sweet syndrome and is also identical to atypical pyoderma gangrenosum when that condition presents on the hands.","['Walling, Hobart W', 'Snipes, Clancy J', 'Gerami, Pedram', 'Piette, Warren W']","['Walling HW', 'Snipes CJ', 'Gerami P', 'Piette WW']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA. hobartwalling@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Hand Dermatoses/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Pyoderma Gangrenosum/*diagnosis', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Sweet Syndrome/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Vasculitis/*diagnosis']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['142/1/57 [pii]', '10.1001/archderm.142.1.57 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 2006 Jan;142(1):57-63. doi: 10.1001/archderm.142.1.57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To estimate the cancer initiating roles of nearby roads and railways and to measure effective ranges. DESIGN: Birth and death addresses of all children born between 1955 and 1980 in Great Britain, and dying from leukaemia or other cancer during those years, were linked to locations of railway stations, bus stations, ferry terminals, railways, roads, canals, and rivers. Nearest distances to births and deaths were measured, and migration data relating to children who had moved house were analysed. Excesses of close to hazard birth addresses, compared with close to hazard death addresses, indicate a high prenatal or early postnatal risk of cancer initiation. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Child cancer birth and death addresses and their map references were extracted from an earlier inquiry. Map references of putative hazards were downloaded from the Ordnance Survey national digital map of Great Britain. These data are recorded to a precision of one metre and have ground accuracies around 20 metres. MAIN RESULTS: Significant birth excesses were found within short distances of bus stations, railway stations, ferries, railways, and A,B class roads, with a relative risk of 2.1 within 100 m, tapering to neutral after 3.0 km. About 24% of child cancers were attributable to these joint birth proximities. Roads exerted the major effect. CONCLUSIONS: Child cancer initiations are strongly determined by prenatal or early postnatal exposures to engine exhaust gases, probably through maternal inhalation and accumulation of carcinogens over many months. The main active substance is probably 1,3-butadiene.","['Knox, E G']",['Knox EG'],"['Mill Cottage, Front Street, Great Comberton, Pershore, Worcestershire WR10 3DU, UK.

Menin has been shown to interact with SET-1 domain-containing histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferases including mixed lineage leukemia proteins to regulate homeobox (Hox) gene expression in vitro. Using conditional Men1 knockout mice, we have investigated the requirement for menin in hematopoiesis and myeloid transformation. Men1 excision causes reduction of Hoxa9 expression, colony formation by hematopoietic progenitors, and the peripheral white blood cell count. Menin directly activates Hoxa9 expression, at least in part, by binding to the Hoxa9 locus, facilitating methylation of H3K4, and recruiting the methylated H3K4 binding protein chd1 to the locus. Consistent with signaling downstream of menin, ectopic expression of both Hoxa9 and Meis1 rescues colony formation defects in Men1-excised bone marrow. Moreover, Men1 excision also suppresses proliferation of leukemogenic mixed lineage leukemia-AF9 fusion-protein-transformed myeloid cells and Hoxa9 expression. These studies uncover an important role for menin in both normal hematopoiesis and myeloid transformation and provide a mechanistic understanding of menin's function in these processes that may be used for therapy.","['Chen, Ya-Xiong', 'Yan, Jizhou', 'Keeshan, Karen', 'Tubbs, Anthony T', 'Wang, Haoren', 'Silva, Albert', 'Brown, Eric J', 'Hess, Jay L', 'Pear, Warren S', 'Hua, Xianxin']","['Chen YX', 'Yan J', 'Keeshan K', 'Tubbs AT', 'Wang H', 'Silva A', 'Brown EJ', 'Hess JL', 'Pear WS', 'Hua X']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chd1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Men1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genotype', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Histones/chemistry', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Homozygote', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lysine/chemistry', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Statistical', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells', 'Time Factors', 'Transgenes']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/03/18 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['0510347103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0510347103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jan 24;103(4):1018-23. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0510347103.

Inactivating the viral protease prevents protein cleavage; the resulting virions lack condensed cores and contain fragile RNA dimers. Therefore, protein cleavage is linked to virion morphological change and increased stability of the RNA dimer. However, it is unclear whether protein cleavage is sufficient for mediating virus RNA maturation. We have observed a novel phenotype in a murine leukemia virus capsid mutant, which has normal virion production, viral protein cleavage, and RNA packaging. However, this mutant also has immature virion morphology and contains a fragile RNA dimer, which is reminiscent of protease-deficient mutants. To our knowledge, this mutant provides the first evidence that Gag cleavage alone is not sufficient to promote RNA dimer maturation. To extend our study further, we examined a well-defined human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag mutant that lacks a functional PTAP motif and produces immature virions without major defects in viral protein cleavage. We found that the viral RNA dimer in the PTAP mutant is more fragile and unstable compared with those from wild-type HIV-1. Based on the results of experiments using two different Gag mutants from two distinct retroviruses, we conclude that Gag cleavage is not sufficient for promoting RNA dimer maturation, and we propose that there is a link between the maturation of virion morphology and the viral RNA dimer.","['Fu, William', 'Dang, Que', 'Nagashima, Kunio', 'Freed, Eric O', 'Pathak, Vinay K', 'Hu, Wei-Shau']","['Fu W', 'Dang Q', 'Nagashima K', 'Freed EO', 'Pathak VK', 'Hu WS']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, P.O.

The specific features of inflammation that mediate this risk are unknown. There are few studies on whether ankylosing spondylitis increases the risk of lymphoma. Besides inflammation-lymphoma aetiology, information on risk of lymphoma in ankylosing spondylitis is particularly important as a benchmark in the evaluation of, for example, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors. METHODS: The association between ankylosing spondylitis and malignant lymphomas overall, and separately for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, was assessed in a nationwide, population-based case-control study of 50 615 cases of lymphoma and 92 928 matched controls by using prospectively recorded data on lymphomas from the Swedish Cancer Register (1964-2000) and data on pre-lymphoma hospitalisations for ankylosing spondylitis from the Swedish Inpatient Register (1964-2000). The odds ratios (ORs) associated with pre-lymphoma hospitalisation for ankylosing spondylitis were calculated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: 23 (0.05%) patients with lymphoma and 41 (0.05%) controls had a pre-lymphoma hospitalisation listing ankylosing spondylitis, relative risk = 1.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 1.7). The number of discharges and the mean latency between ankylosing spondylitis and lymphoma were similar in patients and controls. Analyses restricted to lymphomas diagnosed during the 1990s showed similar results (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.5, number of exposed cases/controls = 14/21). CONCLUSIONS: On average and in the absence of tumour necrosis factor inhibitors, patients hospitalised with ankylosing spondylitis do not appreciably show an increased risk of lymphoma.","['Askling, J', 'Klareskog, L', 'Blomqvist, P', 'Fored, M', 'Feltelius, N']","['Askling J', 'Klareskog L', 'Blomqvist P', 'Fored M', 'Feltelius N']","['Department of Medicine, Clinical Epidemiology Unit M9:01, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, SE-171 77, Stockholm, Sweden. johan.askling@ki.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Rheum Dis,Annals of the rheumatic diseases,0372355,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spondylitis, Ankylosing/*complications/epidemiology', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/09/27 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['ard.2005.047514 [pii]', '10.1136/ard.2005.047514 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Rheum Dis. 2006 Sep;65(9):1184-7. doi: 10.1136/ard.2005.047514.

This effect depended on the nature and mode of action of the counteracting genotoxic compound as well as on the experimental model system used. In the Saccharomyces bioprotectivity assay, GM increased resistance towards ofloxacin-induced toxicity in the wild type and recombination repair-deficient yeast strains significantly enhancing survival of the cells. In the chromosomal aberration assay, GM exerted anticlastogenic effect against maleic hydrazide induced clastogenicity in Vicia faba L. In the DNA-topology assay, GM protected plasmid DNA from the breaks induced by Fe(2+) ions, but enhanced damage induced by bleomycin and hydrogen peroxide. In the cell-revitalization assay, it enhanced cytotoxic/cytostatic effect of teniposide applied to mouse leukemia cells. Thus, depending on the experimental model, GM acted as antimutagen, anticlastogen, DNA breaks inhibitor or inducer, and as cytotoxic/cytostatic effect enhancer. Several possible mechanisms of bioprotective action underlying the observed activities are suggested including iron chelation and free radical scavenging. The results imply that GM is a polysaccharide with marked biological activities and suggest its potential biomedical application, especially in combination with other bioactive compounds.","['Miadokova, Eva', 'Svidova, Sona', 'Vlckova, Viera', 'Duhova, Viola', ""Nad'ova, Slavomira"", 'Rauko, Peter', 'Kogan, Grigorij']","['Miadokova E', 'Svidova S', 'Vlckova V', 'Duhova V', ""Nad'ova S"", 'Rauko P', 'Kogan G']","['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Sciences, Comenius University, 84215 Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Mannans)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '36W3E5TAMG ((1-6)-alpha-glucomannan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bleomycin/pharmacology', 'Candida/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Damage', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', 'Mannans/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/drug effects']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/08/10 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2005/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0887-2333(05)00277-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2005.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2006 Aug;20(5):649-57. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2005.12.001.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML cell lines and primary blasts from 10 patients with AML were first incubated for 72 hours in the presence of G-CSF (5 or 100 ng/mL) and then exposed to increasing concentrations of GO (1-1,000 ng/mL) for an additional 72 hours. RESULTS: Pretreatment with G-CSF translated into significant enhancement of GO-induced cytotoxicity in the GO-sensitive HL-60 and NB-4 cells. Conversely, the response of GO-insensitive KG-1a, TF-1, and K562 cells was unaffected by in vitro priming with G-CSF. In vitro exposure to G-CSF augmented GO-induced apoptosis in 7 of 10 primary AML samples and rendered blast cells from three refractory patients sensitive to killing effect of GO. The G-CSF-induced increase of the cytocidal activity of GO was independent of effects on the cell cycle and on the expression levels of CD33 antigen. Of potential interest, G-CSF induced dose-dependent inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) function in the GO-sensitive HL-60 and NB-4 cells and in blasts from three patients with AML that we tested. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings point to G-CSF as a potential sensitizing agent that can be exploited therapeutically to improve the clinical efficacy of GO.","['Rutella, Sergio', 'Bonanno, Giuseppina', 'Procoli, Annabella', 'Mariotti, Andrea', 'Lucia, M Barbara', 'Contemi, Anna Maria', 'Cauda, Roberto', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Scambia, Giovanni', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Leone, Giuseppe']","['Rutella S', 'Bonanno G', 'Procoli A', 'Mariotti A', 'Lucia MB', 'Contemi AM', 'Cauda R', 'Fianchi L', 'Scambia G', 'Pagano L', 'Leone G']","['Department of Hematology, Catholic University Medical School, Rome, Italy. srutella@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/drug effects/physiology', 'Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/drug effects/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2005/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2005/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00500-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Jan;34(1):54-65. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.10.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human homolog of the murine double-minute 2 oncoprotein (MDM2) is a putative TAA because it is overexpressed in several malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells compared with normal B lymphocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Autologous, MDM2-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-restricted T cells were identified using interferon (IFN)-gamma-ELISPOT assays and HLA-A2/dimer-peptide staining after 4 weeks of in vitro culture. RESULTS: Using native CLL cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), we demonstrate the generation of MDM2-specific T cells in 7/12 CLL patients that recognized specifically the MDM2-derived peptide MDM2(81-88) bound to HLA-A2-dimers while they were inactive against an unrelated MAGE-3 peptide (p = 0.002). After 4 weeks, up to 32.3% of the expanded CD8(+) T cells specifically recognized MDM2(81-88) by HLA-A2-dimer/peptide staining and up to 0.9% of all T cells expanded reacted specifically against this MDM2-derived peptide in the IFN-gamma-ELISPOT assay. If T cells were not expandable using native CLL cells as APC, leukemic cells were stimulated with CD40-ligand to increase the antigen-presenting capacity. This resulted in successful generation of MDM2-specific T cells in three of five remaining cases tested. Additionally, the factor that correlated best with successful generation of antigen-specific T cells in CLL patients was the ability of APCs to secrete IFN-gamma upon stimulation. CONCLUSION: In summary, MDM2(81-88) was shown for the first time in humans to elicit a functional autologous immune response. MDM2 was demonstrated to be naturally processed and presented as TAA in primary human CLL cells enabling expansion of functional autologous tumor-specific T cells.","['Mayr, Christine', 'Bund, Dagmar', 'Schlee, Martin', 'Bamberger, Martina', 'Kofler, David M', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin']","['Mayr C', 'Bund D', 'Schlee M', 'Bamberger M', 'Kofler DM', 'Hallek M', 'Wendtner CM']","['KKG Gene Therapy, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00467-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.09.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Jan;34(1):44-53. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.09.016.,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present subcutaneous dosing schedule, 75 mg/m(2) for 7/28 days, is based on early clinical studies and may constitute a practical problem for patients. The present in vitro study aimed at evaluating the pharmacodynamics of azacytidine, thereby providing a rationale for clinical dose-finding studies. METHODS: P39 cells were incubated with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 microM azacytidine daily for 24, 48, and 72 hours, followed by 48 hours in drug-free medium. The effects of azacytidine on cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle status, and promoter methylation of E-cadherin, ER, and HIC genes were studied. RESULTS: Azacytidine decreased cell growth and proliferation, increased apoptosis, and affected cell cycle status in a dose-dependent manner. However, the exposure time, 24 to 72 hours, at doses between 0.5 and 1 microM, did not significantly affect any of these variables. Using first-order exponential pharmacokinetic model, we found that the effect of 1, 2, or 3 microM over 24 hours did not differ from that of 0.5 to 1 microM given over 48 to 72 hours. Induction of promoter hypomethylation was observed already after 24 hours of exposure with >or=0.5 microM azacytidine with no clear dose-effect relationship. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that optimal cellular effects of azacytidine might be achieved by shorter exposure times. The model provides information about the relation between azacytidine dose intensity and exposure time on malignant myeloid cells, which could serve as a rationale for further clinical development of practical, safe, and cost-effective dosing schedules.","['Khan, Rasheed', 'Aggerholm, Anni', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Hassan, Moustapha', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva']","['Khan R', 'Aggerholm A', 'Hokland P', 'Hassan M', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital-Huddinge, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (MDFIC protein, human)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cadherins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Methylation', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2005/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00456-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.09.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Jan;34(1):35-43. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.09.007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the possibility of a cytokine/chemokine network participating in the pathophysiology of anemic disorders, we evaluated the ability of inflammatory cytokines to induce chemokine expression using erythroid progenitor cells. METHODS: Erythropoietin-dependent human leukemia cell line AS-E2 was used as a model of erythroid colony-forming unit (CFU-E) cells. The expression of mRNA of 8 chemokines was examined using RT-PCR, before and after TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-1beta stimulation. For MIP-3alpha, the promoter activity was analyzed by luciferase assay and secretion was confirmed by ELISA. The expression of CCR6, the specific receptor for MIP-3alpha, was analyzed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Unstimulated AS-E2 cells constitutively expressed transcripts for MCP-4, IP-10, PF-4, IL-8, and MIP-3alpha. Stimulation with TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-1beta upregulated MIP-3alpha mRNA expression and induced its protein secretion. Luciferase assay revealed that these cytokines could upregulate promoter activity of the MIP-3alpha gene, possibly through the NF-kappaB pathway. CCR6 mRNA was detected and its intracellular expression was confirmed. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that inflammatory cytokine-stimulated erythroid progenitors secrete MIP-3alpha, which may function in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Furthermore, the existence of intracellular CCR6 suggests the involvement in cytokine signaling of a MIP-3alpha-dependent internal autocrine mechanism. These mechanisms may play a role in pathophysiology of anemic disorders, such as secondary anemia and bone marrow failure syndromes.","['Inoue, Yoriko', 'Tsushima, Hideki', 'Ando, Koji', 'Sawayama, Yasushi', 'Sakai, Mari', 'Yamasaki, Reishi', 'Matsuo, Emi', 'Tsutsumi, Chizuko', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Imanishi, Daisuke', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Tomonaga, Masao']","['Inoue Y', 'Tsushima H', 'Ando K', 'Sawayama Y', 'Sakai M', 'Yamasaki R', 'Matsuo E', 'Tsutsumi C', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Iwanaga M', 'Imanishi D', 'Taguchi J', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Tomonaga M']","['Department of Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CCL20 protein, human)', '0 (CCR6 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL20)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR6)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL20', 'Chemokines/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Chemokines, CC/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR6', 'Receptors, Chemokine/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2005/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2005/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(05)00462-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2005.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Jan;34(1):19-26. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2005.09.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dissociated cultures of the cochlear spiral ganglion provide an experimental environment in which to examine molecular mechanisms of survival, development and physiology of auditory neurons. To relate survival to the total number of neurons present in the source tissue, three cochleas from different newborn CD-1 mice were embedded in Araldite resin and serially sectioned at 5 mum thickness. All neurons were counted. To avoid overcounting, each section served as a lookup section for the next, giving 8240+/-423 (S.D.) neurons per ganglion. Cultures maintained in the presence of adjacent non-neural tissue, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin 3, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and 10% fetal bovine serum returned the best overall survival (30%) at 42 h post-plating. Best overall survival required the continuous presence of a serum component(s) larger than 100,000 MW. Plating efficiency (number of neurons that attach to the well after 4 h) was similar in the presence or absence of LIF. Inclusion of LIF maintained 100% survival of plated neurons over 42 h of culture; without LIF, a large fraction of the neurons did not survive. LIF appeared to maintain survival by preferentially preserving a population of bipolar neurons, while having little effect on the number of monopolar neurons. This work provides quantitative measures of survival and morphology of auditory neurons in vitro. The results support the idea that survival of spiral ganglion neurons in vivo may depend on interactions with adjacent, non-neural tissue and raise the possibility that maintenance of bipolar morphology after hair cell damage may require biochemical mechanisms in addition to those induced by neurotrophins.","['Whitlon, D S', 'Ketels, K V', 'Coulson, M T', 'Williams, T', 'Grover, M', 'Edpao, W', 'Richter, C P']","['Whitlon DS', 'Ketels KV', 'Coulson MT', 'Williams T', 'Grover M', 'Edpao W', 'Richter CP']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, 303 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611, USA. whitlon@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,['0 (Integrin alpha Chains)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Auditory Pathways/*anatomy & histology/cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Survival', 'Cochlea/cytology', 'Integrin alpha Chains/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neurons/*cytology', 'Spiral Ganglion/*cytology']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-4522(05)01326-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.11.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2006;138(2):653-62. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.11.030.

Therefore, 34 patients were treated, with newly diagnosed AML less than 56 years of age, with daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 on days 1-3, cytarabine 100mg/m2 days 1-7 and cytarabine 2g/m2 for 12 h on days 8-10 (7+3+3). rhIL-11 (50 microg/kg/day,) and GM-CSF (250 microg/kg/day) were administered subcutaneously from day 11 until recovery. The complete remission rate was 59% (90% C.I. 43-73%). The median time to recovery of neutrophils to >500 and platelets to > or =20,000 microl(-1) was 27 days (95% C.I. 27-30 days) and 25 days (95% C.I. 24-29 days), respectively.

However, the frequency of ischemic stroke after chemotherapy has been mentioned only occasionally in clinical studies. A large-scale study is lacking. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, to analyze the incidence of ischemic stroke post-chemotherapy, further, to evaluate a possible causative relationship between the ischemic stroke and the chemotherapy regimen, the interval between the latest chemotherapy session and onset of ischemic stroke and the survival of patients with ischemic stroke post-chemotherapy. The data were retrieved from the Cancer Database from 1993 to 2004. RESULTS: During this period, a total of 10,963 patients, with malignancies were followed-up for 1 month after chemotherapy, underwent 45,294 chemotherapy sessions. Among this group, there were 15 patients experiencing 16 ischemic strokes within the first month after the latest chemotherapy. Among them, 14 patients were followed-up until death and one patient was lost in follow-up after discharge against medical advice. The incidence of post-chemotherapy ischemic stroke was 0.137% and the frequency of chemotherapy cycles complicated by ischemic stroke was 0.035%. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histological type not only in ischemic stroke (40%) but also in overall patients (36.7%). The hemispheric stroke with middle cerebral artery territory involvement was the most common image finding. Platinum compounds, especially cisplatin, were the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for ischemic stroke patients. Twelve (75%) of these 16 ischemic strokes occurred within 10 days of the latest chemotherapy session and 10 (62.5%) occurred after the first cycle of chemotherapy. The median survival after ischemic stroke was 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Our results provide valuable data on the relationship between malignancy, treated with chemotherapy, and ischemic stroke. The risk of ischemic stroke after chemotherapy is predicted by the use of cisplatin-based chemotherapy not cancer histologic type. Infarction usually involves the territorial subtype, causes obvious neurological disabilities and carries a grave prognosis.","['Li, Shau-Hsuan', 'Chen, Wei-Hsi', 'Tang, Yeh', 'Rau, Kun-Ming', 'Chen, Yeng-Yang', 'Huang, Tai-Lin', 'Liu, Jia-Shou', 'Huang, Cheng-Hua']","['Li SH', 'Chen WH', 'Tang Y', 'Rau KM', 'Chen YY', 'Huang TL', 'Liu JS', 'Huang CH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, 123 Ta-Pei Road, Niaosung Hsiang, Kaohsiung Hsien, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,7502039,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Ischemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Stroke/*epidemiology/etiology']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/04/12 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2004/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0303-8467(05)00059-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clineuro.2005.03.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Neurol Neurosurg. 2006 Feb;108(2):150-6. doi: 10.1016/j.clineuro.2005.03.008.

Two DNA repair enzyme systems, i.e. the O6-guanine-alkyl-transferase (MGMT) and mismatch repair (MMR), play a predominant role in conditioning the cytotoxic effects of triazenes. In particular, high levels of MGMT associated with target cells are responsible of resistance to triazenes. On the contrary, the presence of MMR is required for the cytotoxic effects of these compounds. Previous studies performed by our group and a more recent clinical investigation reported by Karen Seiter, pointed out that triazene compounds could play an important role in the treatment of refractory acute leukaemia. Leukaemia blasts, especially of lymphoblastic leukaemia, show frequently high levels of MGMT activity. Therefore, it reasonable to hypothesize that combined treatment of leukaemia patients with triazene compounds along with MGMT inhibitors could lead to a better control of the disease. PaTrin-2 (O6-(4-bromothenyl)guanine, PAT) is a potent and scarcely toxic MGMT inhibitor recently introduced in clinical trials. This drug is used in combination with triazene compounds in order to augment their anti-tumour efficacy against neoplastic cells endowed with high MGMT activity. The present report describes, for the first time, pre-clinical in vitro studies on the cytotoxic activity of combined treatment with PAT+TMZ against long-term cultured leukaemia cells and primary leukaemia blasts obtained from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or acute myeloblastic leukaemia. The results point out that, both in long-term cultured leukaemia cell lines and in primary blast samples, PAT could improve dramatically the sensitivity of malignant cells to the cytotoxic effects of TMZ. This sensitizing effect is detectable when leukaemia cells show resistance mechanisms based on a MGMT-proficient phenotype. On the contrary, when resistance to TMZ is dependent on MMR deficiency, no influence of PAT can be detected in various experimental conditions. In conclusion, these results appear to provide disease-oriented rational basis to design novel clinical protocols for the treatment of acute leukaemia with combined administration of PAT and triazene compounds.","['Turriziani, M', 'Caporaso, P', 'Bonmassar, L', 'Buccisano, F', 'Amadori, S', 'Venditti, A', 'Cantonetti, M', ""D'Atri, S"", 'Bonmassar, E']","['Turriziani M', 'Caporaso P', 'Bonmassar L', 'Buccisano F', 'Amadori S', 'Venditti A', 'Cantonetti M', ""D'Atri S"", 'Bonmassar E']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", School of Medicine, via Montpellier 1, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (O(6)-(4-bromothenyl)guanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/pathology', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Temozolomide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/06/20 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2005/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2005/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-6618(05)00210-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phrs.2005.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 2006 Apr;53(4):317-23. doi: 10.1016/j.phrs.2005.12.001.

Reverse transcription is a crucial event in the retrotransposition of the active human L1 element and is carried out by the L1-encoded ORF2 protein. Previously, we performed biochemical characterization of the human L1 ORF2 protein with reverse transcriptase (RT) activity (referred to as L1 RT), expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells. In the present study, we describe the properties of DNA- and RNA-dependent DNA synthesis catalyzed by the L1 RT on the L1 templates in vitro. We found that L1 RT synthesized at least 620 of nucleotides per template binding event utilizing L1 RNA in vitro. Under processive conditions the L1 RT synthesized cDNA over 5 times longer than that Moloney murine leukemia virus RT on the heteropolymeric RNA template used in these studies. These data are the first to demonstrate that RT from the human L1 element is a highly processive polymerase among RT enzymes. This report also presents a strong evidence of lack of RNase H activity for the L1 ORF2 protein in vitro, distinguishing L1 RT from retroviral RTs. Finally, we found strong pausing for of the L1 RT during DNA polymerization within the 3' untranslated region of L1 mRNA, that is result of contribution both rGs runs of the polypurine stretch and immediately adjacent stem-loop structure.

Here we identify a novel transcriptional repressor, PML-associated repressor of transcription (PAROT), which is regulated in its repressor activity through recruitment to PML-NBs. PAROT is a Kruppel-associated box ( KRAB) zinc-finger (ZNF) protein, which comprises an amino terminal KRAB-A and KRAB-B box, a linker domain and 8 tandemly repeated C(2)H(2)-ZNF motifs at its carboxy terminus. Consistent with its domain structure, when tethered to DNA, PAROT represses transcription, and this is partially released by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. PAROT colocalizes with members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family and with transcriptional intermediary factor-1beta/KRAB-associated protein 1 (TIF-1beta/KAP1), a transcriptional corepressor for the KRAB-ZNF family. Interestingly, PML isoform IV, in contrast to PML-III, efficiently recruits PAROT and TIF-1beta from heterochromatin to PML-NBs.

Today, approximately 80% of children treated for this disease in developed countries enjoy long-term event free survival (EFS) and in most instances, would be cured. In this study, treatment outcome of 82 childhood ALL patients in the hospital were analyzed, and ways for how to improve the EFS rate in childhood ALL were explored. METHODS: Eighty-two patients with ALL were enrolled into the Nanfang ALL 99 protocol which derived from German BFM ALL 95 and Hong Kong-Singapore acute lymphoblastic leukemia 97 (HK-SG ALL 97). Dexamethasone instead of hydrocortisone was used for triple intrathecal therapy. Standard at risk patients who had been irregularly treated in other hospitals for short periods of time were classified as at intermediate risk. When ANC was > or = 1.0 x 10(9)/L and platelet > or = 100 x 10(9)/L, chemotherapy was started. Life table method was used to estimate survival rate and statistical analysis was done by using software SPSS for Windows. RESULTS: From March 1999 to September 2003, 82 childhood ALL patients were treated with the Nanfang ALL 99 protocol and 78 (95.1%) patients attained complete remission (CR) in a median time of 33 days. Out of 82 patients, 13 patients dropped out of the the Nanfang ALL 99 protocol because of financial difficulty or other reasons. Sixty nine patients were consecutively treated with the Nanfang ALL 99 protocol. The overall EFS rate at 2 years, 3 years and 5 years were 91.3%, 85.9% and 75.2%, respectively, with a median observation duration of 34 months. Three patients died of complications (4.3%). The disease relapsed in 6 patients and they died finally. CONCLUSION: The outcome of patients treated with the Nanfang ALL 99 protocol was favorable, and the mortality rate of this chemotherapeutic protocol was low. This protocol was well tolerated by Chinese patients and therefore the protocol is worthy of application in China.","['Wu, Xue-dong', 'Li, Chun-fu', 'He, Yue-lin', 'Yang, Ming', 'Zhang, Yu-ming', 'Feng, Xiao-qin', 'Teng, Zhi-li', 'Sun, Shu-mei', 'Qian, Xin-hua']","['Wu XD', 'Li CF', 'He YL', 'Yang M', 'Zhang YM', 'Feng XQ', 'Teng ZL', 'Sun SM', 'Qian XH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/01/18 09:00,2010/05/26 06:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2005 Dec;43(12):890-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and the histological transformation of CLL are not well known. The INK4A/p16, a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor has been considered as a tumor suppressor gene. Inactivation of this gene by homozygous deletions, mutations and hypermethylation occurs in a variety of human neoplasms. The aim of the present study was to determine the frequency of p16 gene deletions and mutations as well as the methylation status of the same gene in CLL patients. METHODS: We examined 34 samples from CLL patients by Southern Blotting, Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP), DNA sequencing and Methylation-Specific PCR. RESULTS: Southern Blot analysis revealed non-rearranged bands in 33/34 cases. Homozygous deletions were not observed in any case. In 1/34 case a rearranged band was detected with EcoRI enzyme. The PCR-SSCP analysis of exons 1 and 3 revealed normal pattern of migration in all cases examined. The analysis of exon 2 revealed abnormal migration pattern in 2/34 cases (5.8%). Sequencing of these cases revealed the presence of the ALA148THR polymorphism. Methylation analysis of p16 gene promoter revealed hypermethylation of CpG islands in 6/34 cases (17.6%). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that genetic alterations of p16 gene are rare events in patients with CLL. The clarification of the role of p16 gene promoter methylation in the pathogenesis and evolution of CLL needs further investigation.","['Tsirigotis, Panagiotis', 'Pappa, Vassiliki', 'Labropoulos, Stefanos', 'Papageorgiou, Sotirios', 'Kontsioti, Frinda', 'Dervenoulas, John', 'Papageorgiou, Efstathios', 'Panani, Anna', 'Mantzios, George', 'Economopoulos, Theofanis', 'Raptis, Sotirios']","['Tsirigotis P', 'Pappa V', 'Labropoulos S', 'Papageorgiou S', 'Kontsioti F', 'Dervenoulas J', 'Papageorgiou E', 'Panani A', 'Mantzios G', 'Economopoulos T', 'Raptis S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Propaedeutic, University of Athens, ATTIKON University General Hospital, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)'],IM,"['CpG Islands', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH604 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00604.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Mar;76(3):230-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00604.x.

PATIENTS: Altogether 1482 adult patients received ASCT in six Finnish centres 1990-2003. The most common diagnoses were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (n = 542), multiple myeloma (MM) (n = 528), breast cancer (BC) (n = 132), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 86) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (n = 63). RESULTS: Forty-two patients (2.8%) died from treatment-related reasons <100 d from ASCT. The median time to death was 38 d from ASCT (0-99). The risk of TRM varied according to the diagnoses. The highest risk was observed in patients with AL amyloidosis (24%) followed by NHL (4.4%) and MM (1.9%). No early TRM was observed in patients transplanted for BC or CLL. Infections were the cause of death in 16 patients (fungal 7, bacterial 6, viral 3). Organ toxicity was responsible for early death in 26 patients (heart 9, lungs 7, other 10). CONCLUSIONS: This nation-wide survey indicated a low early TRM in ASCT recipients in general, but higher risks in patients with AL amyloidosis or NHL. In addition to patient selection, also optimization of transplant procedure may be needed in these patient groups to reduce early TRM.","['Jantunen, E', 'Itala, M', 'Lehtinen, T', 'Kuittinen, O', 'Koivunen, E', 'Leppa, S', 'Juvonen, E', 'Koistinen, P', 'Wiklund, T', 'Nousiainen, T', 'Remes, K', 'Volin, L']","['Jantunen E', 'Itala M', 'Lehtinen T', 'Kuittinen O', 'Koivunen E', 'Leppa S', 'Juvonen E', 'Koistinen P', 'Wiklund T', 'Nousiainen T', 'Remes K', 'Volin L']","['Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. esa.jantunen@kuh.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Amyloidosis/etiology/mortality', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', 'Cause of Death', 'Data Collection', 'Finland', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH605 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00605.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2006 Mar;76(3):245-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00605.x.

PCR results were correlated with the diagnostic classification of the 2002 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group. When two-positive results were used to define an episode as 'PCR positive', the sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value and negative predictive value for 'proven'/'probable' IA (n = 13) were 100%, 75.4%, 46.4% and 100%, respectively. Consecutive positive results occurred in 61.5% of these 13 episodes. Overall, PCR positivity preceded standard diagnosis by a mean of 14 d and the median time between positive results was shorter than that in other categories of IA. All 13 episodes occurred in the setting of allogeneic HSCT recipients and acute leukaemia. If 'eligibility' for antifungal therapy were based on two-positive-PCR tests, use of empiric treatment could have been reduced by up to 37%.

However, FL Ids are subject to hypermutation and subclones may escape antitumour cytotoxic T-cell response. To investigate the intraclonal epitope diversity, we sequenced the FL heavy chain gene (consensus Id gene) and subclones of 24 patients. The derived polypeptide sequences were analysed by bioinformatics for human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A0201-restricted epitope prediction. Epitopes were classified according to BIMAS and SYFPEITHI scores. Surprisingly in these highly mutated polypeptides, the epitopes concentrated in short hotspots in the conserved framework regions (FRs), both in HLA-A0201(+) and HLA-A0201(-) patients. Similar hotspots have been observed by others in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Ids which in contrast to FL have low mutation frequency. FR3 amino acids 78-88 displayed the best-score epitopes in Ids containing a VH3-family segment, the most represented in FL Ids. Such VH3-FR3(78-88) epitopes were previously demonstrated as immunogenic. Modifications of the epitope pattern in subclones of HLA-A0201(+) patients were generally absent from high-score peptides, including VH3-FR3(78-88) epitopes (83% unmodified). Therefore, no tendency for loss of HLA-A0201-restricted epitopes was evidenced and, given their limited intraclonal diversity, VH3-FR3(78-88) epitopes may provide a useful target for the induction of cytotoxic response in Id-vaccinated FL patients.","['Molinier-Frenkel, Valerie', 'Popa, Natalia', 'Poulot, Virginie', 'Chaise, Coralie', 'Marquet, Jeanine', 'Haioun, Corinne', 'Gaulard, Philippe', 'Farcet, Jean-Pierre', 'Delfau-Larue, Marie-Helene']","['Molinier-Frenkel V', 'Popa N', 'Poulot V', 'Chaise C', 'Marquet J', 'Haioun C', 'Gaulard P', 'Farcet JP', 'Delfau-Larue MH']","['INSERM, U617, Creteil, F-94000, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Clone Cells', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Epitope Mapping', '*Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Genotype', '*HLA-A Antigens', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5861 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05861.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Feb;132(4):459-68. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05861.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ligation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) on antigen-presenting cells stimulates the generation of strong T-cell helper type 1 (Th1) adaptive immune responses. Although TLR9 ligation has been shown to enhance immunogenicity of a number of leukaemia cell types, there have been few reports of the effects mediated through other TLR. In this study we analysed both the expression of TLR by B-cell precursor ALL cell lines and the effects of individual TLR ligation on the ability of ALL cells to stimulate allogeneic T cells. While ligation of TLR2, TLR 7 and TLR9 led to detectable changes in ALL costimulatory molecule expression, only TLR2 and TLR9 stimulation influenced T-cell responses. The TLR2 ligand Pam3CysSerLys4 provoked the most significant changes in T-cell response, dramatically augmenting interferon-gamma production. These results suggest that TLR ligands, in addition to TLR9 agonists, may provide a strategy to enhance the generation of anti-ALL immune activity by skewing responding T cells towards a Th1 response.","['Corthals, Sophie L', 'Wynne, Kristin', 'She, Kevin', 'Shimizu, Hiromi', 'Curman, Darko', 'Garbutt, Kristy', 'Reid, Gregor S D']","['Corthals SL', 'Wynne K', 'She K', 'Shimizu H', 'Curman D', 'Garbutt K', 'Reid GS']","[""Division of Haematology, Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia and British Columbia's Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptidoglycan)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 1)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 3)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 5)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9CAS0V66OI (loxoribine)']",IM,"['CD40 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Guanosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Ligands', 'Peptidoglycan/pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 1/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 3/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 5/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*metabolism']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH5893 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05893.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Feb;132(4):452-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05893.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GO is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CD33-positive AML at first relapse in patients 60 years and older who are not candidates for other cytotoxic therapy. GO as a single agent has low antileukaemic activity. When given to patients meeting the criteria noted above, it produces a complete response (CR) rate of only 12%, with another 12% achieving CR with inadequate platelet recovery (CRp). The median survival of patients treated with GO monotherapy is 11.2 months. GO therapy at 9 mg/m(2) is complicated with hepatic veno-occlusive disease in 5-10% of patients, particularly prior to or following stem cell transplantation. GO at lower doses combined with chemotherapy as induction or postremission therapy is promising, however, and phase III trials are ongoing. GO is probably most active in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). It is used for induction regimens in high-risk APL and for the elimination of minimal residual APL. Case reports suggest that GO also has activity in CD33-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In conclusion, single agent GO can induce responses in patients with CD33-positive AML in first recurrence. The future of GO is its use in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Ongoing clinical trials may better define the role of GO combinations, particularly in untreated AML.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia-Maria', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Estey, Elihu', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Keating, Michael J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Giles FJ', 'Estey E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Keating MJ', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: The patients studied included 112 ALL survivors (84 patients who had received chemotherapy only, 28 patients who had received chemotherapy and irradiation; 63 males, 49 females; mean age +/- standard deviation, 4.1 yrs +/- 2.6 yrs at diagnosis; mean +/- standard deviation yrs since diagnosis, 6.0 +/- 3.5 yrs), and 33 healthy siblings who participated as a control group. Neurocognitive tests of attention, intelligence, and academic achievement were performed; and magnetic resonance images were obtained and subsequently were segmented to yield tissue volume measurements. Comparisons of neurocognitive measures and tissue volumes between groups were performed, and the correlations between volumes and neurocognitive performance measures were assessed. RESULTS: Most performance measures demonstrated statistically significant differences from the normative test scores, but only attention measures exceeded 1.0 standard deviation from normal. Patients who had received chemotherapy alone had significantly larger volumes of white matter than patients who had received treatment that also included cranial irradiation, but their volumes remained significantly smaller than the volumes in the control group. Smaller white-matter volumes were associated significantly with larger deficits in attention, intelligence, and academic achievement. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood ALL had significant deficits in attention and smaller white-matter volumes that were associated directly with impaired neurocognitive performance. Cranial irradiation exacerbated these deficits.","['Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Shan, Zuyao Y', 'Glass, John O', 'Helton, Susan', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Bonner, Melanie J', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Christensen, Robbin', 'Khan, Raja B', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Mulhern, Raymond K']","['Reddick WE', 'Shan ZY', 'Glass JO', 'Helton S', 'Xiong X', 'Wu S', 'Bonner MJ', 'Howard SC', 'Christensen R', 'Khan RB', 'Pui CH', 'Mulhern RK']","[""Division of Translational Imaging Research, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. gene.reddick@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Attention/*radiation effects', 'Brain/growth & development/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*etiology', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Learning Disabilities/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*psychology/*radiotherapy', 'Survivors/psychology']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21679 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Feb 15;106(4):941-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21679.,"['R01-CA90246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA78957/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090246-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078957/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2396784,,,['NIHMS49116'],,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

The Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont has been recording malignant tumors in children (0-14 years) throughout Piedmont since 1967. The present paper is based on the records of the 2,970 children diagnosed during the period 1970-2001; survival rates are estimated up to June 30, 2004. Based on records from the Registrar Offices of the relevant towns of residence, 1,698 children were reported to be alive, 1,252 deceased, and 20 were of unknown vital status. Over the period 1970-2001, 5-year survival rates for all tumor types combined showed a statistically significant increasing trend (p<0.0001). For acute lymphocytic leukemia, the survival rate increased steadily from 24.7% (95% CI 15.0-34.3) in 1970-1974 to 87.8% (82.1-93.6) in 1995-1999. Five-year survival rates for central nervous system tumors increased from 32.8% (21.0-44.6) in 1970-1974 to 80.3% (72.6-88.0) in 1990-1994 and decreased thereafter. Age of less than 1 year at time of diagnosis was a favorable prognostic factor for neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma. The extent of disease at diagnosis was related to prognosis for neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma and other selected solid tumors. A white blood cell count greater than 50,000 x 10(6) cells/l was associated with decreased survival in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. We have found positive trends in survival for all tumor types in Piedmont, similar to those reported by other population-based cancer registries. Age, extent of disease, and white blood cell count at diagnosis are prognostic factors for selected cancer sites.","['Dama, Elisa', 'Pastore, Guido', 'Mosso, Maria Luisa', 'Maule, Milena Maria', 'Zuccolo, Luisa', 'Magnani, Corrado', 'Merletti, Franco']","['Dama E', 'Pastore G', 'Mosso ML', 'Maule MM', 'Zuccolo L', 'Magnani C', 'Merletti F']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit-CPO Piemonte, CeRMS, S.

Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) may help to distinguish between ischemic stroke and chemotherapy-related leukoencephalopathy. Although conventional MRI correlates have been described for this stroke-like syndrome, DWI data are largely unavailable. Our objective is to present a retrospective analysis of the DWI findings in four patients who suffered subacute neurotoxicity after intrathecal MTX. DESIGN: We reviewed the medical records of four patients, who were seen by us between July 2000 and February 2004 for sudden onset of a central neurological syndrome within days of intrathecal MTX. Patients underwent standardized MRI within 48 h of symptom onset; MRI included DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. RESULTS: DWI of all patients revealed well-demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter corresponding to areas of restricted proton diffusion on ADC maps. Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories. Complete resolution of symptoms within 1-4 days was accompanied by normalization of ADC abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: DWI findings in this cohort seem to reflect cytotoxic edema within cerebral white matter suggesting a reversible metabolic derangement, rather than ischemia, as the basis for this syndrome.","['Haykin, M E', 'Gorman, M', 'van Hoff, J', 'Fulbright, R K', 'Baehring, J M']","['Haykin ME', 'Gorman M', 'van Hoff J', 'Fulbright RK', 'Baehring JM']","['Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, TMP 410, New Haven, CT 06510, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Edema/chemically induced/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11060-005-9569-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2006 Jan;76(2):153-7. doi: 10.1007/s11060-005-9569-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined species prevalence and susceptibility profile for fluconazole and the risk for nosocomial infections by Candida spp at the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, a general tertiary care hospital in southern Brazilian, through a retrospective study, beginning with positive cultures of hospitalized patients. The distribution by species in 131 documented episodes was as follows: Candida albicans (45%), C. parapsilosis (24.4%), C. tropicalis (15.3%), C. glabrata (6.9%), C. krusei (4.6%) and 3.8% other species (C. pelicullosa, C. guilliermondii, C. lusitaniae and C. kefyr). The vast majority of samples (121- 92.4%) were susceptible to fluconazole; the resistant or dose-dependent sensitive samples included only C. krusei and C. glabrata. Blood diseases (leukemia, lymphoma), or neoplasias (solid tumors), were found in 35.0% of the candidemia episodes. We noted the previous use of antibiotics in 128 (97.7%) patients, with 79.7% using three or more antibiotics before the candidemia episode. Other risk factors included a central venous catheter in 94 (71.8%) and abdominal surgery in 32 (24.4%) patients. The overall mortality rate was 51.9%, which varied according to the underlying disease. We found that C. albicans was the most prevalent species, although the non-albicans species predominated. However, in vitro resistance to fluconazole was detected only among the species (C. glabrata and C. krusei) that tend to be resistant to the azolic compounds.

Here, we have characterized a new class of activating point mutations (PMs) that cluster in a 16-amino acid stretch of the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 (FLT3-JM-PMs). Expression of 4 FLT3-JM-PMs in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 cells led to factor-independent growth, hyperresponsiveness to FLT3 ligand, and resistance to apoptotic cell death. FLT3-JM-PM receptors were autophosphorylated and showed a higher constitutive dimerization rate compared with the FLT3-wild-type (WT) receptor. As a molecular mechanism, we could show activation of STAT5 and up-regulation of Bcl-x(L) by all FLT3-JM-PMs. The FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 abrogated the factor-independent growth of FLT3-JM-PM-expressing cells. Compared with FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD mutants, the FLT3-JM-PMs showed a weaker transforming potential related to lower autophosphorylation of the receptor and its downstream target STAT5. Mapping of the FLT3-JM-PMs on the crystal structure of FLT3 showed that these mutations reduce the stability of the autoinhibitory JM domain, and provides a structural basis for the transforming capacity of this new class of gain-of-function mutations of FLT3.","['Reindl, Carola', 'Bagrintseva, Ksenia', 'Vempati, Sridhar', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Ellwart, Joachim W', 'Wenig, Katja', 'Hopfner, Karl-Peter', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Reindl C', 'Bagrintseva K', 'Vempati S', 'Schnittger S', 'Ellwart JW', 'Wenig K', 'Hopfner KP', 'Hiddemann W', 'Spiekermann K']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, CCG Leukemia, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Marchioninistr 25, 81377 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/chemistry', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65556-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-06-2596 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 1;107(9):3700-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2596.

In this study, we demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by CDDO-Me is mediated by direct permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which results in the rapid depletion of mitochondrial glutathione (GSXm), loss of cardiolipin, and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. More importantly, we demonstrate that in addition to activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, the mitochondrial effects of CDDO-Me may mediate its anti-inflammatory activity by modulating the generation of superoxide anion (O2*). It is noteworthy that CDDO-Me did not increase the generation of O2* and pretreatment of leukemia cells with CDDO-Me prevented the increase of this reactive oxygen species elicited by inhibition of complex I or III in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. CDDO-Me, but not other inhibitors of respiration, induced a time- and dose-dependent, cyclosporin A-independent permeability transition (PT) of isolated mitochondria that was sensitive to sulfhydryl antioxidants but not to EDTA. PT induced by CDDO-Me and Ca2+ was accompanied by loss of GSXm, suggesting that the increased permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane facilitates the loss of this antioxidant. Finally, transmission electron microscopy revealed that CDDO-Me rapidly induced caspase-independent mitochondrial swelling and loss of inner membrane structure before the release of cytochrome c. Taken together, our results indicate that CDDO-Me is a novel mitochondriotoxic agent that induces apoptosis and inhibits mitochondrial electron transport via perturbations in inner mitochondrial membrane integrity.","['Samudio, Ismael', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Pelicano, Helene', 'Huang, Peng', 'Frolova, Olga', 'Bornmann, William', 'Ying, Yunming', 'Evans, Randall', 'Contractor, Rooha', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Samudio I', 'Konopleva M', 'Pelicano H', 'Huang P', 'Frolova O', 'Bornmann W', 'Ying Y', 'Evans R', 'Contractor R', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Unit 448, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,['0 (Cardiolipins)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cardiolipins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects', 'Electron Transport', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/06/20 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.105.018051 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.105.018051 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2006 Apr;69(4):1182-93. doi: 10.1124/mol.105.018051.

The abnormal lymphoid populations were sorted by flow cytometry, and the purified tumor populations along with unsorted fractions were subsequently analyzed for the presence of clonal gene rearrangements by PCR and fluorescence-based capillary electrophoresis fragment analysis. RESULTS: In 3 cases, distinct clonality profiles could be detected in the purified tumor cell fraction, and suspicious amplicons of identical sizes were detected among the polyclonal backgrounds in the unsorted specimens. For 1 patient, a monoclonal signal was detected in the sorted tumor cell fraction but not in the unseparated bone marrow specimen containing 0.05% abnormal lymphoblasts. A subsequent bone marrow specimen containing 4.8% recurring leukemia cells tested positive with a clonality profile that matched the previous profile in the sorted cell population.

Interestingly, the AhR can either promote or inhibit proliferation depending on the cell phenotype. Although recent data reveal potential pathways for AhR signaling in cell proliferation, the mechanisms that regulate its activity in tumor cells remain unknown. Here, we have analyzed promoter hypermethylation as a potential mechanism controlling AhR expression in human tumor cells. AhR promoter CpG methylation was sporadic in a panel of 19 tumor cell lines except for the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562 and the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) REH. When compared with normal lymphocytes, REH had very low constitutive AhR expression that could be attributed to promoter hypermethylation since treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine (AZA) significantly increased AhR mRNA and protein. These results in leukemia-derived cell lines were further confirmed in primary ALL, where 33% of the patients (7/21) had AhR promoter hypermethylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed that methylation impaired binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to the AhR promoter, thus providing a mechanism for AhR downregulation in REH cells. Therefore, promoter hypermethylation represents a novel epigenetic mechanism downregulating AhR activity in hematological malignancies such as ALL.","['Mulero-Navarro, S', 'Carvajal-Gonzalez, J M', 'Herranz, M', 'Ballestar, E', 'Fraga, M F', 'Ropero, S', 'Esteller, M', 'Fernandez-Salguero, P M']","['Mulero-Navarro S', 'Carvajal-Gonzalez JM', 'Herranz M', 'Ballestar E', 'Fraga MF', 'Ropero S', 'Esteller M', 'Fernandez-Salguero PM']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Extremadura, Avenida de Elvas s/n, 06071-Badajoz, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/*genetics', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*genetics']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/08/01 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgi344 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgi344 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2006 May;27(5):1099-104. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgi344.

Dysregulation is central to lymphomagenesis in Burkitt lymphoma and other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This suggests targeting c-Myc as a treatment for myc-associated malignancies. METHODS: Microarrays showed c-Myc dysregulation in a B-lymphoblastoid line, TIB-215. This was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and extended to 3 additional Burkitt lymphoma lines. Growth effects of a c-Myc inhibitor, compound 10058-F4, were determined in these 4 lines using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide analyses and direct cell counts. Drug effects on c-Myc gene expression levels were measured using minor groove binding-TaqMan real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Drug specificity was analyzed in rat c-Myc knockout (-/-) and Myc-transfected cells. RESULTS: c-Myc dysregulation was shown to be cell-cycle independent without rapid decay of c-Myc mRNA levels in all 4 lines. Using a c-Myc inhibitor, we found that growth inhibition was time- and dose-dependent. This inhibition caused unexpected downregulation (> or =65%) of c-Myc mRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of c-Myc decreased growth in aggressive lymphoma cells. This mechanism included c-Myc mRNA downregulation and dissociation of c-Myc/Max protein heterodimer. These results support targeting c-Myc in tumors with high morbidity and mortality.","['Gomez-Curet, Ilsa', 'Perkins, R Serene', 'Bennett, Ryan', 'Feidler, Katherine L', 'Dunn, Stephen P', 'Krueger, Leslie J']","['Gomez-Curet I', 'Perkins RS', 'Bennett R', 'Feidler KL', 'Dunn SP', 'Krueger LJ']","['Nemours Biomedical Research, Molecular Genetics, Cellular and Tissue Transplantation, Wilmington, DE 19803, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,"['0 (5-(4-ethylbenzylidene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fibroblasts', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles/agonists', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/08/03 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3468(05)00767-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2005.10.025 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2006 Jan;41(1):207-11; discussion 207-11. doi: 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2005.10.025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparing two diagnostic categories of leukaemia with four groups of CNS tumours, a highly significant positive correlation was found between ALL and astrocytoma (r = 0.57, P = 0.002). Higher rates of ALL and CNS tumours were associated with increased affluence, with the strongest correlation for Gross Domestic Product per capita and CNS tumours (r = 0.70, P < 0.001). National incidence rates of childhood ALL and astrocytomas were highly correlated and this may reflect a common environmental cause whose origin may be infectious in nature. International incidence of ALL and CNS tumours were also correlated with economic related factors. Variation in levels of ascertainment may partially explain this, although childhood environmental exposures related to infections will also be affected by levels of affluence.","['Hepworth, Sarah J', 'Feltbower, Richard G', 'McKinney, Patricia A']","['Hepworth SJ', 'Feltbower RG', 'McKinney PA']","['Paediatric Epidemiology Group, Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Leeds Institute of Genetics, Health and Therapeutics, 30-32 Hyde Terrace, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9LN, United Kingdom. s.j.hepworth@leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Astrocytoma/*epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Ependymoma/*epidemiology', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2005/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2005/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0959-8049(05)01064-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2005.07.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2006 Mar;42(4):509-13. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2005.07.036.

MDR occurs at the cellular level and is multi-factorial in nature. The multidrug resistance gene, MDR1, and its gene product P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are now well known as an important determinant of MDR. Much effort has been devoted to develop P-gp inhibitors to modulate resistance. However, most of these resistance-modifying agents (RMA) are too toxic at the required doses. Therefore, the development of novel RMAs to overcome MDR represents a major challenge to modern cancer chemotherapy. In the present investigation, we describe the effect of oxalyl bis (N-phenyl) hydroxamic acid (OBPHA) and copper N-(2-hydroxy acetophenone) glycinate (CuNG) on multidrug-resistant P-gp-expressing CEM/ADR5000 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. CuNG, a known depleting agent for glutathione (GSH) and inhibitor of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1), also inhibited P-gp-mediated doxorubicin accumulation and retention. The resistance-modifying effects of OBPHA were stronger than that of CuNG. Both novel RMAs overcame drug resistance more efficiently than verapamil, a well-known P-gp inhibitor. OBPHA and CuNG exposure resulted in an increased doxorubicin accumulation after 1-3h incubation by down-regulation of P-gp expression after 24h incubation. This is a clue that different mechanisms may contribute to modulation of P-gp-mediated drug resistance by these compounds.","['Majumder, S', 'Dutta, P', 'Mukherjee, P', 'Datta, E R', 'Efferth, T', 'Bhattacharya, S', 'Choudhuri, S K']","['Majumder S', 'Dutta P', 'Mukherjee P', 'Datta ER', 'Efferth T', 'Bhattacharya S', 'Choudhuri SK']","['Department of Environmental Carcinogenesis and Toxicology, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, 37, S.P.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: From January 1994 to December 2001, 1,288 patients diagnosed with lymphoid neoplasms were recruited in the population-based Cancer Registry of Girona. Former pathological and hematological diagnoses were reviewed and some were prospectively reclassified following the latest WHO classification. RESULTS: Following criteria established by WHO classification the distribution of lymphoid neoplasms was as follows: 77.3% B-cell neoplasm, 5.9% T-cell neoplasm, 8.7% Hodgkin lymphoma and 8,2% was unclassifiable. From 1994 TO 2001 the lymphoid neoplasm crude incidence rates was 35.8 per 100,000 men-year, while it was 25.7 new cases per 100,000 women-year. In children (< 15 years old), precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (65%) and Hodgkin lymphoma (20%) were the most frequent lymphoid neoplasm, whereas myeloma (17.8%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (13.5%) showed the highest incidence rate in adults. CONCLUSIONS: A higher incidence rate of lymphoid neoplasms was found in men in our area compared with other geographical areas in Spain, which could suggested a faster approximation to the pattern observed in industrialized societies. The cause of this geographical distribution is unknown.","['Marcos-Gragera, Rafael', 'Vilardell, Loreto', 'Izquierdo, Angel', 'Masuet, Cristina', 'Gardella, Santiago', 'Bernado, Lluis', 'Sanjose, Silvia de', 'Moreno, Victor']","['Marcos-Gragera R', 'Vilardell L', 'Izquierdo A', 'Masuet C', 'Gardella S', 'Bernado L', 'Sanjose Sd', 'Moreno V']","[""Unidad de Epidemiologia y Registro de Cancer, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Girona, Girona, Spain. rmarcos@ico.scs.es""]",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spain/epidemiology']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-7753(06)71808-5 [pii]', '10.1157/13083323 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2006 Jan 14;126(1):5-12. doi: 10.1157/13083323.,,,"Incidencia poblacional de las neoplasias linfoides segun el subtipo histologico (Clasificacion de la OMS) en Girona, 1994-2001.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-four Wistar rats were randomly divided into a control group (group A, n = 8), an asthma group (group B, n = 8) and a dexamethasone treated group (group C, n = 8). The rat asthmatic model was made by intraperitoneal injection and nebulized aspiration of ovalbumin (OVA) at the concentrations of 10% and 1% respectively. Expression levels of lung LIF, NK-1R and NK-2R were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot two weeks after challenge, and the localization of NK-1R was determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After challenge, the expressions of lung LIF mRNA in group A, B and C were 0.240 +/- 0.020, 0.510 +/- 0.130, 0.180 +/- 0.050, and protein levels were 23 110 +/- 8 018, 40 832 +/- 12 964, 16 160 +/- 2 108 respectively.

The mRNA and protein levels of LIF and NK-1R in group B were significantly elevated as compared with group A and C (all P < 0.01). The expressions of lung NK-2R mRNA in group A, B and C were 0.240 +/- 0.040, 0.200 +/- 0.030 and 0.210 +/- 0.040, and no difference was found among three groups (all P > 0.05). In group B, there was a positive correlation between LIF and NK-1R at mRNA (r = 0.850, P < 0.01) and protein (r = 0.868, P < 0.01) levels respectively. NK-1R immunoreactivity was observed primarily in bronchial epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: LIF and NK-1R were excessively expressed and closely correlated in lungs of the rat asthmatic model, suggesting that LIF may be involved in modulating airway neurogenic inflammation.","['Lin, Min-juan', 'Lao, Xue-jun', 'Ma, Hong-ming', 'Tang, Yan']","['Lin MJ', 'Lao XJ', 'Ma HM', 'Tang Y']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510630, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,8712226,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Neurokinin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Neurokinin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asthma/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Lung/metabolism', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Neurokinin-1/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Neurokinin-2/*metabolism']",2006/01/18 09:00,2010/09/03 06:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi. 2005 Dec;28(12):820-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that NIIs in both sporadic and familial NIID contained the small ubiquitin modifier-1 (SUMO-1) and the SUMOylation substrates promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) and histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). Both PML and SUMO-1 are major components of nuclear bodies (NBs), suggesting that the NIIs in NIID, as well as the intranuclear inclusions in polyglutamine diseases, might derive from these intranuclear functional domains that serve as sites for ubiquitin-related protein degradation. HDAC4 was also a major component of the NIIs. HDACs are transcriptional corepressors that regulate histone remodelling, and NBs are thought to be sites at which the level of histone acetylation is controlled. The presence of PML, SUMO-1 and HDAC4 in NIIs suggests that transcriptional activity regulated by histone acetylation might contribute to the disease process in NIID. In addition, we showed that another SUMOylation substrate, RanGAP1 is associated with NIIs only in the familial NIID patient.

Base catalyzed activation of this prodrug generates two different reactive intermediates: chloroethylating species that covalently interact with DNA at the O6-position of guanine residues that progress to a G-C interstrand cross-link, and a carbamoylating agent, methyl isocyanate. Previous findings from this laboratory have provided initial evidence that methyl isocyanate can contribute to the efficacy of Cloretazine by enhancing the cytotoxicity of the generated chloroethylating species. This action may be due in part to inhibition of the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT); however, activity in cells devoid of AGT indicates that other actions are involved in the synergistic cytotoxicity. Herein we demonstrate that O6-benzylguanine can also produce synergistic cell kill with the alkylating component of Cloretazine but differs from methyl isocyanate in that the enhancement occurs in AGT-containing cells, but not in cells devoid of AGT. Methyl isocyanate generated by the decomposition of 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-[methylaminocarbonyl]hydrazine also acts to enhance the activity of a variety of DNA cross-linking agents, while only producing additive cytotoxicity with methylating agents. Flow cytometric studies using annexin as a marker for apoptosis indicate that in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in human leukemia cells Cloretazine-induced apoptosis is primarily caused by the generated methyl isocyanate. Comet assays designed to detect DNA cross-links in intact cells indicate that the chloroethylating species generated by the activation of Cloretazine produce DNA cross-links, with the co-generated methyl isocyanate increasing the degree of cross-linking produced by the reactive chloroethylating species. These findings provide further evidence that the methyl isocyanate produced by the activation of Cloretazine can be a major contributor to the cytotoxicity produced by this antineoplastic agent.","['Baumann, Raymond P', 'Seow, Helen A', 'Shyam, Krishnamurthy', 'Penketh, Philip G', 'Sartorelli, Alan C']","['Baumann RP', 'Seow HA', 'Shyam K', 'Penketh PG', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Isocyanates)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '01KC87F8FE (O(6)-benzylguanine)', '14J2G0U3NQ (laromustine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'C588JJ4BV9 (methyl isocyanate)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biotransformation', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Synergism', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Isocyanates/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Prodrugs/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2006/01/18 09:00,2006/03/22 09:00,['2006/01/18 09:00'],"['2006/01/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/096504005776404553 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2005;15(6):313-25. doi: 10.3727/096504005776404553.,['CA-90671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A synergy between ATRA and As3O3 was also reported in inducing granulocytic differentiation of APL-derived cells. We have demonstrated that phospholipase C-beta2 (PLC-beta2), highly expressed in neutrophils and nearly absent in tumoral promyelocytes, largely increases during ATRA treatment of APL-derived cells and strongly correlates with the responsiveness of APL patients to ATRA-based differentiating therapies. Here we report that, in APL-derived cells, low doses of As3O3 induce a slight increase of PLC-beta2 together with a moderate maturation, and cooperate with ATRA to provoke a significant increase of PLC-beta2 expression. Remarkably, the amounts of PLC-beta2 draw a parallel with the differentiation levels reached by both ATRA-responsive and -resistant cells treated with ATRA/As2O3 combinations. PLC-beta2 is not necessary for the progression of tumoral promyelocytes along the granulocytic lineage and is unable to overcome the differentiation block or to potentiate the agonist-induced maturation. On the other hand, since its expression closely correlates with the differentiation level reached by APL-derived cells induced to maturate by drugs presently employed in APL therapies, PLC-beta2 represents indeed a specific marker to test the ability of differentiation agents to induce the release of the maturation blockade of tumoral myeloid precursors.","['Brugnoli, Federica', 'Bovolenta, Matteo', 'Benedusi, Mascia', 'Miscia, Sebastiano', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Bertagnolo, Valeria']","['Brugnoli F', 'Bovolenta M', 'Benedusi M', 'Miscia S', 'Capitani S', 'Bertagnolo V']","['Signal Transduction Unit/Laboratory of Cell Biology, Section of Human Anatomy, Department of Morphology and Embryology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (PLCB2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipase C beta/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/*physiology']",2006/01/13 09:00,2009/05/30 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20749 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2006 May 1;98(1):160-73. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20749.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, randomized studies comparing front-line rHEPO vs rHEPO+G-CSF are still lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of ""standard"" doses of rHEPO with the combination of rHEPO and G-CSF in the treatment of anemic patients with low-risk MDS in a prospective randomized trial. Anemic patients with low-risk MDS were randomly assigned to receive either rHEPO (10,000 IU s.c. three times a week) or the same dosage of rHEPO+G-CSF (300 mug s.c. twice a week) for a minimum of 8 weeks. Patients who were unresponsive to rHEPO were offered the combination therapy for another 8 weeks, whereas non-responders to rHEPO+G-CSF were considered ""off study"". Responders continued the treatment indefinitely. Both haematological response and changes in quality-of-life (QoL) scores (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia) were recorded and evaluated. Thirty consecutive patients [10 refractory anemia (RA), 5 RA with ringed sideroblasts, 7 refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 5 RA with less than 10% blasts and 3 5q-syndrome] were enrolled in the study. All of them (15 in the rHEPO arm and 15 in the rHEPO+G-CSF arm) were valuable after the first 8 weeks of treatment. Erythroid response was observed in 6/15 (40%) patients in the rHEPO arm and in 11/15 (73.3%) patients in the rHEPO+G-CSF arm. In 4/9 (44.4%) patients who were unresponsive to rHEPO, the addition of G-CSF induced erythroid response at 16 weeks. No relevant adverse effects were recorded for either treatment in any of the study patients. Erythroid response to HGF was associated with a relevant improvement in QoL. Twenty responders continued the treatment. Afterwards, 8/20 (40%) discontinued therapy because of the following: losing response (2), progression to high-risk MDS (3) and death due to other causes (3). The remaining 12 are still responding and continuing treatment, with a median follow-up of 28 months. Progression to acute leukemia was cumulatively observed in 4/30 (13.3%) patients (2 in each arm).

The mechanisms underlying such resistance are poorly understood. Herein we show that all CLL B-cells tested (30/30) display high mRNA and protein expression of the tumor suppressor Mda-7/IL-24, an IL-10 family member, in comparison to normal B cells. A downstream Mda-7 signaling target, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was highly phosphorylated in all CLL cells but not in normal B-cells. Mda-7 expression and p38 MAPK phosphorylation diminished in culture and the latter could be reinduced by recombinant (r)-IL-24 or LPS and Mda-7 transfection. Mda-7/IL-24 siRNA specifically inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation in CLL without affecting p38 MAPK, bcl2, or Lyn expression, further demonstrating the direct role of Mda-7/IL-24 in p38 MAPK activation. Both pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK and Mda-7 silencing augmented spontaneous apoptosis by three-fold in CLL cells cultured in autologous serum, which was reversed by LPS and r-IL-24. We established the role of p38 MAPK in CLL cell survival and demonstrated a paradoxical effect, whereby Mda-7 and IL-24, inducers of apoptosis in diverse cancer cells, promote the survival of CLL B-cells through p38 MAPK activation.","['Sainz-Perez, A', 'Gary-Gouy, H', 'Portier, A', 'Davi, F', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Galanaud, P', 'Dalloul, A']","['Sainz-Perez A', 'Gary-Gouy H', 'Portier A', 'Davi F', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Galanaud P', 'Dalloul A']","['INSERM Unite 131, IFR 13, Universite Paris XI 32 Rue des Carnets, Clamart, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (interleukin-24)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404073 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404073 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Mar;20(3):498-504. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404073.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the peripheral NK function in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We demonstrated that the peripheral NK cell population was quantitatively normal in MDS patients. Furthermore, NK cells displayed an expression of the activating natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) NKp46 and NKp30 as well as NKG2D similar to that observed in donors, but exert a highly decreased constitutive cytolytic activity compared to resting normal NK cells. Although activation with IL-2 resulted in the upregulation of NKp46 expression by MDS-NK cells, their cytolytic function remained deeply altered as compared to activated donor NK cells. In addition, MDS NK cells did not proliferate in vitro, and displayed an increased rate of apoptosis in response to IL-2 stimulation although the spontaneous apoptosis was not significantly increased. Interestingly, a proportion of peripheral MDS-NK cells were derived from the MDS clone as the cytogenetic anomaly found in bone marrow karyotype was also detected in 20-50% of circulating NK cells.

We screened 79 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and found five positive for JAK2 V617F (HEL, MB-02, MUTZ-8, SET-2, UKE-1), 4/5 with histories of MPD/MDS. While SET-2 expressed both mutant (mu) and wild-type (wt) JAK2, remaining positives carried homo-/hemizygous JAK2 mutations. Microsatellite analysis confirmed losses of heterozygosity (LOH) affecting the JAK2 region on chromosome 9p in MB-02, MUTZ-8 and UKE-1, but also in HEL, the only JAK2mu cell line lacking any reported MPD/MDS history. All five JAK2mu cell lines displayed cytogenetic hallmarks of MDS, namely losses of 5q or 7q, remarkably in 4/5 cases affecting both chromosomes. Our combined FISH and microsatellite analysis uncovered a novel mechanism to supplement mitotic recombination previously proposed to explain JAK2 LOH, namely chromosome deletion with/without selective JAK2mu amplification. Confirming the importance of the mutated JAK2 protein for growth and prevention of apoptosis, JAK2mu cell lines displayed higher sensitivities to JAK2 inhibition than JAK2wt cell lines. In summary, JAK2 V617F cell lines, derived from patients with history of MPD/MDS, represent novel research tools for elucidating the pathobiology of this JAK2 mutation.","['Quentmeier, H', 'MacLeod, R A F', 'Zaborski, M', 'Drexler, H G']","['Quentmeier H', 'MacLeod RA', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. hqu@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Microsatellite Repeats', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404081 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404081 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Mar;20(3):471-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404081.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To define the molecular mechanisms that govern this process during erythropoiesis, we have used tagging/proteomics approaches and characterized protein complexes nucleated by TAL-1/SCL, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that specifies the erythrocytic lineage. In addition to known TAL-1 partners, GATA-1, E2A, HEB, LMO2 and Ldb1, we identify the ETO2 repressor as a novel component recruited to TAL-1 complexes through interaction with E2A/HEB. Ectopic expression and siRNA knockdown experiments in hematopoietic progenitor cells show that ETO2 actively represses erythroid TAL-1 target genes and governs the expansion of erythroid progenitors. At the onset of erythroid differentiation, a change in the stoichiometry of ETO2 within the TAL-1 complex activates the expression of known erythroid-specific TAL-1 target genes and of Gfi-1b and p21(Cip), encoding two essential regulators of erythroid cell proliferation. These results suggest that the dynamics of ETO2 recruitment within nuclear complexes couple cell proliferation to cell differentiation and determine the onset of terminal erythroid maturation.","['Goardon, Nicolas', 'Lambert, Julie A', 'Rodriguez, Patrick', 'Nissaire, Philippe', 'Herblot, Sabine', 'Thibault, Pierre', 'Dumenil, Dominique', 'Strouboulis, John', 'Romeo, Paul-Henri', 'Hoang, Trang']","['Goardon N', 'Lambert JA', 'Rodriguez P', 'Nissaire P', 'Herblot S', 'Thibault P', 'Dumenil D', 'Strouboulis J', 'Romeo PH', 'Hoang T']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Cochin, INSERM U567, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris V, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cbfa2t3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2005/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2005/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['7600934 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600934 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2006 Jan 25;25(2):357-66. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600934.

We identify the mouse erythroid-specific carbonic anhydrase I promoter (CAIe) as a target of c-Myb activity and demonstrate that Myb activity is critical for carbonic anhydrase I (CAI) expression in C19 MEL cells. CAI expression is downregulated when MEL cells differentiate in response to MEnT or treatment with N, N-hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). Coexpression of GATA-1 with c-Myb results in synergistic activation of transcription from the CAIe promoter and both transcription factors interact with the CAIe promoter in vivo. We identify a novel 20 bp sequence in the CAIe promoter that is sufficient to mediate synergistic activation of the CAIe promoter by c-Myb and GATA-1. c-Myb and GATA-1 interact with this DNA sequence suggesting that c-Myb and GATA-1 may be contained in a complex that interacts with this region of the CAIe promoter. Forced expression of CAI delayed HMBA-induced differentiation of MEL cells and maintained them in a proliferating state. These data strongly suggest that CAI is a c-Myb target and is involved in regulating MEL cell proliferation and differentiation.","['Chen, J', 'Kremer, C S', 'Bender, T P']","['Chen J', 'Kremer CS', 'Bender TP']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0734, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', 'EC 4.2.1.- (Carbonic Anhydrase I)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Carbonic Anhydrase I/*genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209295 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209295 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 May 4;25(19):2758-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209295.,"['CA85842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM55985/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling plays a pivotal role in various stem cell systems, including the formation of embryonic germ (EG) cells from primordial germ cells and self-renewal of neural stem cells. Here, we show that myristoylated, active form of Akt (myr-Akt) maintained the undifferentiated phenotypes in mouse ES cells without the addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The effects of myr-Akt were reversible, because LIF dependence and pluripotent differentiation activity were restored by the deletion of myr-Akt. In addition, myr-Akt-Mer fusion protein, whose enzymatic activity is controlled by 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, also maintained the pluripotency of not only mouse but also cynomolgus monkey ES cells. These results clearly demonstrate that Akt signaling sufficiently maintains pluripotency in mouse and primate ES cells, and support the notion that PI3K/Akt signaling axis regulates 'stemness' in a broad spectrum of stem cell systems.","['Watanabe, S', 'Umehara, H', 'Murayama, K', 'Okabe, M', 'Kimura, T', 'Nakano, T']","['Watanabe S', 'Umehara H', 'Murayama K', 'Okabe M', 'Kimura T', 'Nakano T']","['Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)', '17197F0KYM (afimoxifene)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Myristic Acid/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics', 'Tamoxifen/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209307 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209307 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 May 4;25(19):2697-707. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disruption of this balance is increasingly recognized as important in the development of leukemia, by causing enhanced renewal and differentiation arrest. We studied regulation of renewal versus differentiation in primary murine erythroid progenitors that require cooperation of erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit and a transcriptional regulator (glucocorticoid receptor; GR) for sustained renewal. However, mice defective for GR- (GR(dim/dim)), EpoR- (EpoR(H)) or STAT5ab function (Stat5ab(-/-)) show no severe erythropoiesis defects in vivo. Using primary erythroblast cultures from these mutants, we present genetic evidence that functional GR, EpoR, and Stat5 are essential for erythroblast renewal in vitro. Cells from GR(dim/dim), EpoR(H), and Stat5ab(-/-) mice showed enhanced differentiation instead of renewal, causing accumulation of mature cells and gradual proliferation arrest. Stat5ab was additionally required for Epo-induced terminal differentiation: differentiating Stat5ab(-/-) erythroblasts underwent apoptosis instead of erythrocyte maturation, due to absent induction of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-X(L). This defect could be fully rescued by exogenous Bcl-X(L). These data suggest that signaling molecules driving leukemic proliferation may also be essential for prolonged self-renewal of normal erythroid progenitors.","['Dolznig, H', 'Grebien, F', 'Deiner, E M', 'Stangl, K', 'Kolbus, A', 'Habermann, B', 'Kerenyi, M A', 'Kieslinger, M', 'Moriggl, R', 'Beug, H', 'Mullner, E W']","['Dolznig H', 'Grebien F', 'Deiner EM', 'Stangl K', 'Kolbus A', 'Habermann B', 'Kerenyi MA', 'Kieslinger M', 'Moriggl R', 'Beug H', 'Mullner EW']","['Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna Biocenter (VBC), Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Liver/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/06/21 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209308 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209308 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 May 11;25(20):2890-900. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209308.,"['F 2801/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 2802/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 2807/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 2809/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria']",,,PMC3035873,,,['UKMS32172'],,,,['NLM: UKMS32172'],,,,,,,,,

Other studies have described selective deletion of exon 1beta of p14(ARF) or methylation of the p16(INK4A) promoter. Therefore, it is unclear from these studies whether loss of p16(INK4A) and/or p14(ARF) contributes to the development of T-ALL. To elucidate the relative contribution of the ink4a/arf locus to T-cell leukemogenesis, we mated our tal1 transgenic mice to ink4a/arf-/-, p16(ink4a)-/-, and p19(arf)-/- mice and generated tal1/ink4a/arf+/-, tal1/p16(ink4a)+/-, and tal1/p19(arf)+/- mice. Each of these mice developed T-cell leukemia rapidly, indicating that loss of either p16(ink4a) or p19(arf) cooperates with Tal1 to induce leukemia in mice. Preleukemic studies reveal that Tal1 expression stimulates entry into the cell cycle and thymocyte apoptosis in vivo. Interestingly, mice expressing a DNA-binding mutant of Tal1 do not exhibit increases in S phase cells. The S phase induction is accompanied by an increase in thymocyte apoptosis in tal1 transgenic mice. Whereas apoptosis is reduced to wild-type levels in tal1/ink4a/arf-/- mice, S phase induction remains unaffected. Thus, Tal1 stimulates cell cycle entry independent of the ink4a/arf locus, but its ability to induce apoptosis is Ink4a/Arf-dependent.","['Shank-Calvo, J A', 'Draheim, K', 'Bhasin, M', 'Kelliher, M A']","['Shank-Calvo JA', 'Draheim K', 'Bhasin M', 'Kelliher MA']","['Department of Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, 01650, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt5b protein, mouse)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/deficiency/*physiology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Exons/genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, p16', 'Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Preleukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptor, Notch1/physiology', 'S Phase/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Wnt Proteins/physiology']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/07/11 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209326 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209326 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 May 18;25(21):3023-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209326.,['CA096899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of the hematopoietic niche in the chemoresistance of leukemic cells, we examined two pathways: one mediated by adhesion molecules/integrins, and the other by soluble factors of the morphogen Wnt pathway. In our study, both the adhesion of leukemic blasts to fibronectin and the addition of Wnt antagonists induced, independently, resistance of AML cells to daunorubicin in a cell survival assay. Using pharmacological inhibitors and siRNA, we showed that both resistance pathways required the activity of the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta). Moreover, the AML cell protection downstream of GSK3beta was mediated by NF-kappaB. A link between the adhesion and the Wnt pathway was found, as adhesion of U937 on human osteoblasts, a component of the hematopoietic niche, triggered the secretion of the Wnt antagonist sFRP-1 and supported resistance to daunorubicin. The osteoblast-conditioned medium could also confer chemoresistance to U937 cells cultured in suspension, and this cell protective effect was abrogated after depletion of sFRP-1. In the context of this potential double in vivo resistance, modulators of the common signal GSK3beta and of its target NF-kappaB could represent important novel therapeutic tools.","['De Toni, F', 'Racaud-Sultan, C', 'Chicanne, G', 'Mas, V Mansat-De', 'Cariven, C', 'Mesange, F', 'Salles, J-P', 'Demur, C', 'Allouche, M', 'Payrastre, B', 'Manenti, S', 'Ysebaert, L']","['De Toni F', 'Racaud-Sultan C', 'Chicanne G', 'Mas VM', 'Cariven C', 'Mesange F', 'Salles JP', 'Demur C', 'Allouche M', 'Payrastre B', 'Manenti S', 'Ysebaert L']","[""Departement d'Oncogenese et Signalisation Cellulaire dans les Cellules Hematopoietiques, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite 563, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Purpan, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SFRP1 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells/metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/06/28 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1209346 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209346 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 May 25;25(22):3113-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209346.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF stimulation resulted in the induction of endothelial cell-specific genes, including VE-cadherin, Flk-1, and CD31, whereas neither smooth muscle nor cardiac muscle marker genes such as GATA4, GATA6, Nkx-2.5, and calponin were up-regulated. Immunocytochemical examination showed that about 25% of total cells were positively stained with anti-CD31 antibody 14 days after LIF stimulation. Immunofluorescent microscopic analyses identified the Sca-1+ cells that were also positively stained with anti-von Willebrand factor antibody, indicating the differentiating process of Sca-1+ cells into the endothelial cells.

In cardiac stem cells, the transduction with dominant negative STAT3 abrogated the LIF-induced endothelial differentiation. And the inhibition of ERK1/2 with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 also prevented the differentiation of Sca-1+ cells into endothelial cells. Thus, both STAT3 and ERK1/2 are required for LIF-mediated endothelial differentiation in cardiac stem cells. Collectively, it is proposed that LIF regulates the commitment of cardiac stem cells into the endothelial cell lineage, contributing to neovascularization in the process of tissue remodeling and/or regeneration.","['Mohri, Tomomi', 'Fujio, Yasushi', 'Maeda, Makiko', 'Ito, Takashi', 'Iwakura, Tomohiko', 'Oshima, Yuichi', 'Uozumi, Yoriko', 'Segawa, Masashi', 'Yamamoto, Hiroshi', 'Kishimoto, Tadamitsu', 'Azuma, Junichi']","['Mohri T', 'Fujio Y', 'Maeda M', 'Ito T', 'Iwakura T', 'Oshima Y', 'Uozumi Y', 'Segawa M', 'Yamamoto H', 'Kishimoto T', 'Azuma J']","['Department of Clinical Evaluation of Medicines and Therapeutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Suita City, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Endocardium/*cytology/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/enzymology/*metabolism']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/05/17 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)58000-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M508969200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2006 Mar 10;281(10):6442-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M508969200.

In disorders such as malignancy, gene expression often undergoes broad changes of sizable magnitude, whereas in many common multifactorial diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis, the changes in gene expression are modest. In the latter circumstance, it is therefore challenging to distinguish the truly changing from non-changing genes, especially because statistical significance must be considered in the context of multiple hypothesis testing. Here, we present a balanced probability analysis (BPA), which provides the biologist with an approach to interpret results in the context of the total number of genes truly differentially expressed and false discovery and false negative rates for the list of genes reaching any significance threshold. In situations where the changes are of modest magnitude, sole consideration of the false discovery rate can result in poor power to detect genes truly differentially expressed. Concomitant analysis of the rate of truly differentially expressed genes not identified, i.e., the false negative rate, allows balancing of the two error rates and a more thorough insight into the data. To this end, we have developed a unique, model-based procedure for the estimation of false negative rates, which allows application of BPA to real data in which changes are modest.","['Norris, Andrew W', 'Kahn, C Ronald']","['Norris AW', 'Kahn CR']","[""Joslin Diabetes Center, Children's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA. andrew-norris@uiowa.edu""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Obesity, Morbid/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Probability']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/03/01 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['0510115103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0510115103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jan 17;103(3):649-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0510115103.

An HTLV-I encoded protein, Tax, induces proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, resulting in clonal proliferation of infected cells. However, tax gene expression in ATL cells is disrupted by several mechanisms, including genetic changes in the tax gene and DNA methylation/deletion of the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR). Because Tax is the major target of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in vivo, loss of Tax expression should enable ATL cells to escape the host immune system. The 5' LTR of HTLV-I is frequently hypermethylated or deleted in ATL cells, whereas the 3' LTR remains unmethylated and intact, suggesting the involvement of the 3' LTR in leukemogenesis. Here we show that a gene encoded by the minus strand of the HTLV-I proviral genome, HTLV-I basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), is transcribed from 3'-LTR in all ATL cells. Suppression of HBZ gene transcription by short interfering RNA inhibits proliferation of ATL cells. In addition, HBZ gene expression promotes proliferation of a human T cell line. Analyses of T cell lines transfected with mutated HBZ genes showed that HBZ promotes T cell proliferation in its RNA form, whereas HBZ protein suppresses Tax-mediated viral transcription through the 5' LTR. Thus, the single HBZ gene has bimodal functions in two different molecular forms. The growth-promoting activity of HBZ RNA likely plays an important role in oncogenesis by HTLV-I.","['Satou, Yorifumi', 'Yasunaga, Jun-ichirou', 'Yoshida, Mika', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Satou Y', 'Yasunaga J', 'Yoshida M', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Immunology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/03/01 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['0507631103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0507631103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jan 17;103(3):720-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0507631103.

DESIGN: Observational case report and literature review. METHODS: Review of clinical history, radiologic findings, histology of cervical lymph node and orbital biopsies, and follow-up. RESULTS: An 8-month-old girl presented with a 2-week history of right-sided tearing, lid swelling, proptosis, and rhinorrhea. A computed tomographic scan of the orbits revealed a homogeneous, retrobulbar orbital mass eroding into the ethmoid sinuses and nasal cavity, as well as cervical lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the lesion and enlarged lymph node disclosed medium-sized, uniform, cytologically atypical lymphocytes in a starry sky pattern. Immunohistochemical analysis showed reactivity to antibodies against CD-10, CD-19, CD-34, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Cytogenetic analysis of the tumor also revealed a gene rearrangement on chromosome 11q23. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was made, and systemic as well as intrathecal chemotherapy was instituted, which resulted in rapid remission of the leukemia.

We describe a case of SM with coexisting chronic eosinophilic leukemia (SM-CEL). The patient, a 51-year-old male, was first seen in 1992 with small-sized infiltrates of spindle-shaped mast cells in his marrow, and marked eosinophilia. Retrospectively, a CHIC2 deletion and the FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha fusion gene-product were demonstrable by FISH analysis and RT-PCR, respectively. SM-associated organopathy or mediator-related symptoms were not recorded. However, the patient developed cardiomyopathy. Therapy with interferon-alpha, hydroxyurea, and corticosteroids were without effects. By contrast, therapy with imatinib was followed by a fast and sustained response with complete and stable regression of eosinophilia, drop in eosinophil cationic protein, and decrease of serum tryptase to normal levels. This case provides further evidence for the potential of co-existence of SM with a primary eosinophilic disorder (CEL) defined by the FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha fusion gene. Because of the availability of a superior targeted drug (imatinib), it is of importance to screen for FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha in suspected CEL with or without co-existing SM.","['Florian, Stefan', 'Esterbauer, Harald', 'Binder, Thomas', 'Mullauer, Leonhard', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Valent, Peter']","['Florian S', 'Esterbauer H', 'Binder T', 'Mullauer L', 'Haas OA', 'Sperr WR', 'Sillaber C', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 3.1.27.- (Eosinophil Cationic Protein)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Cardiomyopathies/blood/etiology', 'Eosinophil Cationic Protein/blood', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/blood/classification/complications/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/classification/complications/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/blood/classification/complications/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Serine Endopeptidases/blood', 'Tryptases', 'World Health Organization', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/genetics']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/09/13 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2005/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2005/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2005/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(05)00432-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2005.11.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Sep;30(9):1201-5. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.11.014.

METHODS: A total of 45 bone marrow samples from 30 CML patients were included in this work. The patients were in accelerated/blast phase (AP/BP) or late-chronic phase (CP) at the start of imatinib and usually showed resistance to imatinib. ABL kinase domain of BCR-ABL allele was amplified by nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique, followed by direct sequencing and sequence homologous analyzing. RESULTS: The ABL point mutation was detected in 13 of 30 patients, 12 of them had progressed to advanced phase, The other patient who was in late chronic phase showed point mutation when she was at 45th months of imatinib treatment, but she was still in complete cytogenetic remission at 50th months and is doing well. 4 patients had Glu255Lys mutation and 4 had Gly250Glu, the other types of mutation were Phe359Cys, Glu355Gly, Met244Val, Tyr253His and Asp276Gly, each was tested in one patient. 11/12 patients who progressed to advanced disease and showed point mutation were collected samples in advanced stage, 8 patients showed homozygote mutation, and 3 patients had a mixture of wild and mutant type. In advanced stage patients, mutations were detected in a median of 5 months (ranged 0.5-30 months), it appeared much earlier than that in late CP patients (25.5 months, ranged 11-45 months, P < 0.05). In 4/7 followed up patients, the intensity of point mutation increased gradually within 7-15 months before disease progression. 6 patients did not showed ABL point mutation while their disease were in progression. CONCLUSIONS: Abl kinase point mutation is one of the main mechanisms of CML secondary resistance to imatinib.

We have identified a novel antisense sequence in the coding region of bcl-2 mRNA that could enhance chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity of leukemia cells and lung carcinoma cells. This study was designed to investigate inhibitory effects of bcl-2 ASODN on development and growth ability of human lung carcinoma NCI-H460 cells xenograft in nude mice. METHODS: bcl-2 ASODN was added to NCI-H460 cells. Inhibitory rate of cell growth was assayed by MTT assay. bcl-2 ASODN-treated NCI-H460 cells were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice to observe tumor growth and calculate tumor inhibitory rate. Seven days after subcutaneous implantation of untreated NCI-H460 cells, the tumor-bearing mice were randomized into 3 groups: control group, ASODN group, and nonsense oligodeoxynucleotides (NSODN) group. bcl-2 ASODN, bcl-2 NSODN, and saline were separately injected into the tumor bodies of mice in relevant groups for 3 week. The tumor weight and volume were measured, and the morphology of tumor cells was observed under microscope. RESULTS: bcl-2 ASODN reduced the growth of NCI-H460 cells in a time-dependent manner. Inhibitory rate of NCI-H460 cells was significantly higher in bcl-2 ASODN group than in bcl-2 NSODN group (P<0.05). The tumorigenic ability of NCI-H460 cells was reduced by bcl-2 ASODN, with the maximum tumor growth inhibitory rate of 87.5% (P<0.01). The tumor formation time was prolonged to 12.6 days. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in bcl-2 ASODN group as compared with that in NSODN group and control group(P<0.01). The tumor weight was significantly lighter in bcl-2 ASODN group than in bcl-2 NSODN group and control group (P<0.01). The growth inhibitory rate was 71.0% in bcl-2 ASODN group. Serious necrosis foci and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in tumor tissues of bcl-2 ASODN group, while cancer cells were diffused in tumor tissues of bcl-2 NSODN group and control group. CONCLUSION: bcl-2 ASODN can suppress tumorigenic ability of NCI-H460 cells and inhibit tumor growth in nude mice.","['He, Dong-Mei', 'Zhang, Huan']","['He DM', 'Zhang H']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510632, P.

CD3AK cells belong to T lymphocytes activated by anti-CD3McAb. This study was to construct nitric oxide donor CD3AK/iNOS through transfecting inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene into human CD3AK cells by retroviral vector, and investigate the cytotoxic activity of CD3AK/iNOS to leukemia cell lines K562 and K562/ADM. METHODS: The amphotropic packaging cell line PA317 transfected with iNOS gene was cultivated to obtain viral supernatant. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were isolated and activated by anti-CD3McAb and low dose of interleukin-2 (IL-2). CD3AK cells were incubated with viral supernatant. The amount of nitric oxide (NO) and the activity of iNOS in the cultured supernatant of CD3AK/iNOS were evaluated. The cytotoxic activities of CD3AK/iNOS and CD3AK cells to K562 and K562/ADM cells were evaluated by MTT assay. RESULTS: The contents of NO excreted by CD3AK/iNOS and CD3AK cells were (378.60+/-41.57) micromol/L and (98.07+/-22.31) micromol/L, respectively (P<0.001); the activities of iNOS synthesized by CD3AK/iNOS and CD3AK cells were (20.77+/-2.49) U/ml and (9.81+/-1.96) U/ml, respectively (P<0.001). The cytotoxic activities of CD3AK/iNOS cells to K562 and K562/ADM cells were significantly stronger than those of CD3AK [(64.85+/-18.13)% vs. (45.66+/-17.46)%, P<0.05; (63.80+/-9.93)% vs. (47.85+/-12.01)%, P<0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: The content of NO and activity of iNOS synthesized and excreted by CD3AK/iNOS cells are largely increased compared with those of CD3AK cells.

Although biopsy technique and staining procedure are standardized, the prestaining processing of bone marrow biopsies (BMBs) varies markedly without any existing data on its significance for the diagnosis of MF. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study on 712 BMBs from 296 patients with chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), or healthy bone marrow, MF was a characteristic complication of CML and CIMF. However, diagnosis and quantification of MF and detection of its prognostic significance were significantly biased by fixation, decalcification, embedding, marrow tissue shrinkage during biopsy processing and the thickness of marrow sections (P < 0.000005). The relevance of these influences was explained by their effect on the marrow volume to which the fibre content was related, whereas the stainability of fibres was not affected. Semiquantitative grading of fibrosis and measurements of fibre density could not be adjusted to various methods of processing of bone marrow biopsies (P < 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Evaluations of MF and its prognostic significance should consider the bias due to the prestaining processing of BMBs and the necessity of an adjustment to the thickness of tissue sections and the degree of marrow tissue shrinkage.","['Buesche, G', 'Georgii, A', 'Kreipe, H-H']","['Buesche G', 'Georgii A', 'Kreipe HH']","['Department of Pathology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany. guntram.buesche@arcor.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/standards', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry/methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staining and Labeling/methods/*standards', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Fixation']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/02/28 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['HIS2302 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2559.2005.02302.x [doi]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2006 Jan;48(2):133-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2005.02302.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human NSPCs are selectively expanded as free-floating neurospheres in serum-free culture medium containing fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and/or epidermal growth factor (EGF); however, the culture conditions still need to be optimized for performance and cost before the method is used clinically. Here, to improve the NSPC culture method for clinical use, we used an ATP assay to screen the effects of various reagents on human NSPC proliferation. Human NSPCs responded to EGF, FGF2, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in a dose-dependent manner, and the minimum concentrations eliciting maximum effects were 10 ng/ml EGF, 10 ng/ ml FGF2, and 5 ng/ml LIF. EGF and LIF were stable in culture medium without NSPCs, although FGF2 was degraded. In the presence of human NSPCs, however, FGF2 and LIF were both degraded very rapidly, to below the estimated minimum concentration on day 3, but EGF remained above the minimum concentration for 5 days. Adding supplemental doses of each growth factor during the incubation promoted human NSPC proliferation. Among other supplements, insulin and transferrin promoted human NSPC growth, but progesterone, putrescine, selenite, D-glucose, and lactate were not effective and were cytotoxic at higher concentrations. Supplementing with conditioned medium from human NSPCs significantly increased human NSPC proliferation, but using a high percentage of the medium had a negative effect. These findings suggest that human NSPC culture is regulated by a balance in the culture medium between decreasing growth factor levels and increasing positive or negative factors derived from the NSPCs. Thus, in designing culture conditions for human NSPCs, it is useful to take the individual properties of each factor into consideration.","['Kanemura, Yonehiro', 'Mori, Hideki', 'Nakagawa, Atsuyo', 'Islam, Mohammed Omedul', 'Kodama, Eri', 'Yamamoto, Atsuyo', 'Shofuda, Tomoko', 'Kobayashi, Satoshi', 'Miyake, Jun', 'Yamazaki, Tomohiko', 'Hirano, Shun-ichiro', 'Yamasaki, Mami', 'Okano, Hideyuki']","['Kanemura Y', 'Mori H', 'Nakagawa A', 'Islam MO', 'Kodama E', 'Yamamoto A', 'Shofuda T', 'Kobayashi S', 'Miyake J', 'Yamazaki T', 'Hirano S', 'Yamasaki M', 'Okano H']","['Research Institute for Cell Engineering, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Amagasaki, Hyogo, Japan. kanemura@onh.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Neurons/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/06/08 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2005;14(9):673-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to investigate the association of Ras mutations with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with special reference to the presence or absence of mixed-lineage leukemia gene (MLL) rearrangements. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 313 children with B-precursor ALL and 130 children with de novo AML were studied at diagnosis. Southern blot analysis was used to detect MLL rearrangements, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was used to detect common MLL fusion transcripts. Complementary DNA panhandle PCR was used to identify the infrequent or unknown MLL partner genes. DNA PCR or RT-PCR followed by direct sequencing was performed to detect mutations at codons 12, 13, and 61 of the N-Ras and K-Ras genes. RESULTS: Twenty of 313 patients with B-precursor ALL and 17 of 130 patients with de novo AML had MLL rearrangements. N-Ras mutations were detected in 2 of 20 patients with MLL-positive ALL and in 27 of 293 patients with MLL-negative ALL (P = 1.000). N-Ras mutations were detected in 2 of 17 patients with MLL-positive AML and in 14 of 113 patients with MLL-negative AML (P = 1.000). K-Ras mutations were present in 8 of 20 patients with MLL-positive ALL compared with 32 of 293 patients with MLL-negative ALL (P = 0.001). K-Ras mutations were detected in 3 of 17 patients with MLL-positive AML compared with 5 of 113 patients with MLL-negative AML (P = 0.069). CONCLUSIONS: Ras mutations were detected in 20.8% of patients with childhood B-precursor ALL and in 17.7% of patients with childhood AML. MLL-positive B-precursor ALL was associated closely with Ras mutations (50%), especially with K-Ras mutations (40%), whereas MLL-positive AML was not associated with Ras mutations.","['Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Fu, Jen-Fen', 'Li, Huei-Ying', 'Wang, Hsiu-I', 'Hung, Iou-Jih', 'Yang, Chao-Ping', 'Jaing, Tang-Her', 'Chen, Shu-Huey', 'Liu, Hsi-Che']","['Liang DC', 'Shih LY', 'Fu JF', 'Li HY', 'Wang HI', 'Hung IJ', 'Yang CP', 'Jaing TH', 'Chen SH', 'Liu HC']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.21687 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Feb 15;106(4):950-6. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21687.,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,

THE AIMS of the study were to select the optimum panel of primers, evaluate incidence of particular types of monoclonal and oligoclonal gene rearrangements and observe alteration of rearrangement profile between diagnosis of ALL and subsequent relapse(s). METHODS: We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of junctional region of rearranged IgH, TCRD and TCRG genes in combination with heteroduplex analysis in polyacrylamide gel. RESULTS: TCRD gene rearrangements were detected in 64%, TCRG - in 45%, and IgH - in 79% of B-precursor ALL patients. For patients with T-ALL, TCRD gene rearrangements were found in 47%, TCRG gene - in 66%, and IgH - in 19% of cases. Evaluation of biallelic and oligoclonal rearrangements was performed in the study. The highest incidence of oligoclonal rearrangements - 25% was shown for IgH gene in patients with B-precursor ALL. Seven pair cases of patients with de novo leukemia and relapses were analyzed and revealed subclonal deviation in rearrangements of IgH or TCR genes during disease evolution. CONCLUSION: We propose a panel of 13 types of rearrangements (primer pairs) sufficient for tumor cell clonality detection in 96% of patients with ALL. Applications of PCR-based analysis of rearranged IgH, TCRD and TCRG genes for discrimination of mono- and oligoclonality and identification of the origin of relapse were demonstrated.","['Meleshko, A N', 'Lipay, N V', 'Stasevich, I V', 'Potapnev, M P']","['Meleshko AN', 'Lipay NV', 'Stasevich IV', 'Potapnev MP']","['Belarusian Research Center for Pediatric oncology & Hematology, Minsk, Belarus. meleshko@tut.by']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Child', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['24/465 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2005 Dec;27(4):319-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increases of leukemia and of solid cancers with radiation dose have been noted in the population of about 30,000 people who lived in the settlements downstream of the site of the radioactive releases; that population has been studied for several decades by Russian scientists, notably in the framework of cooperation with American and European scientists. The radiation doses are currently estimated by means of the Techa River Dosimetry System-2000 (TRDS-2000). Recently, a scientist from Mayak PA has suggested in several publications that the doses calculated using TRDS-2000 might be underestimated substantially. A special international Workshop, held in Moscow on 8-10 December 2003, aimed to resolve some of the pressing issues related to the determination of the external and internal doses received by the Techa River population and to give recommendations on the further development of methodologies used for dose reconstruction. The authors of this article were selected by the organizers of the Workshop to draw the conclusions of the meeting. They express the view that, while the dose reconstruction system TRDS-2000 is basically sound, additional work is needed and the results of any epidemiological studies making use of TRDS-2000 should be qualified as preliminary, pending resolution of several issues. The most important of these issues is the re-evaluation of the activities released, using additional information that could be obtained with the help of Mayak experts. Other specific suggestions aiming to improve the dose reconstruction methodology for the Techa River cohort, i.e., continued measurements of accumulated dose in environmental samples and human tissues, validation of external dose estimates with thermoluminescence measurements of bricks and with electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of teeth, estimation of individual doses instead of group doses, detailed account of the contributions to dose of medical examinations and of other releases from the Mayak complex, and careful assessment of the uncertainties, were made by the meeting participants.","['Balonov, Mikhail', 'Alexakhin, Rudolf', 'Bouville, Andre', 'Liljinzin, Jan-Olov']","['Balonov M', 'Alexakhin R', 'Bouville A', 'Liljinzin JO']","['International Atomic Energy Agency, Wagramerstrasse 5, P.O.

Malignant transformation may involve development of apoptosis resistance. In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which HTLV-1 Tax confers resistance toward CD95-mediated apoptosis. We show that Tax-expressing T-cell lines derived from HTLV-1-infected patients express elevated levels of c-FLIP(L) and c-FLIP(S). The levels of c-FLIP correlated with resistance toward CD95-mediated apoptosis. Using an inducible system we demonstrated that both resistance toward CD95-mediated apoptosis and induction of c-FLIP are dependent on Tax. In addition, analysis of early cleavage of the BH3-only Bcl-2 family member Bid, a direct caspase-8 substrate, revealed that apoptosis is inhibited at a CD95 death receptor proximal level in Tax-expressing cells. Finally, using siRNA we directly showed that c-FLIP confers Tax-mediated resistance toward CD95-mediated apoptosis. In conclusion, our data suggest an important mechanism by which expression of HTLV-1 Tax may lead to immune escape of infected T cells and, thus, to persistent infection and transformation.","['Krueger, Andreas', 'Fas, Stefanie C', 'Giaisi, Marco', 'Bleumink, Marc', 'Merling, Anette', 'Stumpf, Christine', 'Baumann, Sven', 'Holtkotte, Denise', 'Bosch, Valerie', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Li-Weber, Min']","['Krueger A', 'Fas SC', 'Giaisi M', 'Bleumink M', 'Merling A', 'Stumpf C', 'Baumann S', 'Holtkotte D', 'Bosch V', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']","['Tumorimmunology Program, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/06/15 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)63821-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-06-2567 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 15;107(10):3933-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2567.

We report here the effects of TZD18, a novel dual ligand specific for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and gamma (PPARalpha/gamma) on Ph(+) lymphocytic leukemia cell lines BV173, SD1, and SupB-15. Exposure of these cells to TZD18 resulted in growth inhibition in a dose- and time-dependent manner that was associated with G(1) cell cycle arrest. This effect was much stronger than that mediated by the PPARgamma ligand pioglitazone (PGZ), which also belongs to the thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of ligands. However, it may not be mediated through PPARgamma or PPARalpha activation because antagonists of PPARgamma and PPARalpha cannot reverse it. Study of the key regulators of cell cycle progression by Western blot analysis showed that the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p27(kip1), but not that of p21(cip1), was enhanced, whereas that of c-Myc, cyclin E, cyclin D2, and cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4 (CDK-2 and CDK-4) was decreased when these cells were treated with TZD18 (10 or 20 microM). Therefore, the up-regulation of p27(kip1) and the down-regulation of CDK-2 and CDK-4 may, at least in part, account for the G(1) cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, a remarkable induction of apoptosis was observed in the cells treated with this dual ligand. No obvious alteration of bcl-2 protein level occurred, but bax was up-regulated in these TZD18-treated cells. Activation of caspase 8 and caspase 9 by TZD18 was also observed. Importantly, NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity was markedly decreased by the TZD18 treatment. In addition, TZD18 enhanced the growth inhibitory effect of imatinib, a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapeutically used in the treatment of Ph(+) leukemia. Overall, our findings strongly suggest that TZD18 may offer a new therapeutic approach to aid in the treatment of Ph(+) lymphocytic leukemia.","['Liu, Hongyu', 'Zang, Chuanbing', 'Fenner, Martin H', 'Liu, Dachuan', 'Possinger, Kurt', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Elstner, Elena']","['Liu H', 'Zang C', 'Fenner MH', 'Liu D', 'Possinger K', 'Koeffler HP', 'Elstner E']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, School of Medicine Charite, Humboldt University, Schumannstrasse 20/21, 10117 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (5-(3-(3-(4-phenoxy-2-propylphenoxy)propoxy)phenyl)-2,4-thiazolidinedione)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PPAR alpha)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Phenyl Ethers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'PPAR alpha/agonists/genetics', 'PPAR gamma/agonists/genetics', 'Phenyl Ethers/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Thiazolidinediones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/05/25 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)65554-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2005-05-2103 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 May 1;107(9):3683-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-05-2103.

Early prediction of response to imatinib cannot be anticipated. We used a standardized quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) for BCR-ABL transcripts on 191 out of 200 late-chronic phase CML patients enrolled in a phase II clinical trial with imatinib 400 mg/day. Bone marrow samples were collected before treatment, after 12, 20 and at the end of study treatment (52 weeks) while peripheral blood samples were obtained after 2, 3, 6, 10, 14, 20 and 52 weeks of therapy. The amount of BCR-ABL transcript was expressed as the ratio of BCR-ABL to beta2-microglobulin (beta2M). We show that, following initiation of imatinib, the early BCR-ABL level trends in both bone marrow and peripheral blood samples made it possible to predict the subsequent cytogenetic outcome and response. We propose this method as the method of choice for monitoring patients on imatinib therapy. QRT-PCR studies may be able to identify degrees of molecular response that predict both complete cytogenetic response and long term stability, as well as patterns of response that provide an early indication of relapse and imatinib resistance.","['Martinelli, G', 'Iacobucci, I', 'Rosti, G', 'Pane, F', 'Amabile, M', 'Castagnetti, F', 'Cilloni, D', 'Soverini, S', 'Testoni, N', 'Specchia, G', 'Merante, S', 'Zaccaria, A', 'Frassoni, F', 'Saglio, G', 'Baccarani, M']","['Martinelli G', 'Iacobucci I', 'Rosti G', 'Pane F', 'Amabile M', 'Castagnetti F', 'Cilloni D', 'Soverini S', 'Testoni N', 'Specchia G', 'Merante S', 'Zaccaria A', 'Frassoni F', 'Saglio G', 'Baccarani M']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology L. and A.

Surprisingly, it has been recently shown that extracellular application of NAADP is capable of inducing intracellular Ca2+ release. This is particularly important since the only mammalian enzymes known to catalyze the synthesis of this second messenger are located extracellularly. In the present manuscript, we have investigated whether mammalian cells possess a transport system capable of transporting this highly charged molecule into cells. Indeed, in RBL-2H3 cells, a rat basophilic cell line, and in SK-N-BE cells, a neuroblastoma cell line, [32P]NAADP is efficiently transported inside cells. NAADP transport is Na+ and Ca2+ dependent, is partially blocked by dipyridamole, but is unaffected by nitrobenzylthioinosine. RBL-2H3 cells also transport [32P]cADPR, but the differences in the pharmacological profile suggest that NAADP transport proceeds by a novel mechanism. Lastly, extracellular application of NAADP, but not NADP, induced a raise in intracellular Ca2+. This is the first demonstration that NAADP is transported into cells and highlights the possibility that, alongside a second messenger, NAADP might also act as an autocrine/paracrine signal.","['Billington, R A', 'Bellomo, E A', 'Floriddia, E M', 'Erriquez, J', 'Distasi, C', 'Genazzani, A A']","['Billington RA', 'Bellomo EA', 'Floriddia EM', 'Erriquez J', 'Distasi C', 'Genazzani AA']","['DiSCAFF and DFB Center, Universita del Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy. billington@pharm.unipmn.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (nicotinic acid 1,N(6)-etheno-2-azaadenine dinucleotide phosphate)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '5502-96-5 (NAADP)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Basophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'NADP/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Rats', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Sodium/physiology']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/04/25 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['05-5058fje [pii]', '10.1096/fj.05-5058fje [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2006 Mar;20(3):521-3. doi: 10.1096/fj.05-5058fje.

Multidrug resistant K562/A02 cell line and sensitive K562 cell line from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were induced for differentiating to DC in complete RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with GM-CSF (1 000 U/ml), IL-4 (500 U/ml) and TNF-alpha (100 ng/ml) for 14 days. The morphologic features of DC were observed by means of optical microscopy and the phenotype of DC was detected by flow cytometry. T-cell stimulating activity was determined by allogeneic lymphocyte reaction (allo-MLR). Cytotoxic activity was measured by MTT assay. The results indicated that DC derived from K562/A02 cells and K562 cells similarly showed the typical morphology of dendritic cell and expressed the surface differentiation antigens and costimulatory molecules CD1a, CD83, HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 of DC. In allo-MLR, K562/A02-DC had a higher capacity to induce lymphocyte proliferation, compared with K562-DC (P < 0.05). K562/A02-DC and K562-DC could similarly generate specific cytotoxic activity against K562/A02 cells or K562 cells respectively, but low reactivity against HL-60 cells. More importantly, the cytotoxic activity mediated by K562/A02-DC was stronger than that by K562-DC against K562/A02 cells or HL-60/VCR cells (P < 0.01, respectively).

The results showed that P388/VCR-G were inoculated in the abdominal cavities of DBA mice, the incidence of leukemia was 100%. Any of these mice with leukemia could not obtain remission spontaneously. The model of leukemia was sensitive to cyclophosphamide (Cy) and the time of survival was related to the dose of Cy received. The logarithm of cells inoculated in mice correlated regressionally with the dose of Cy. So this model was ideal for research on minimal residual leukemia. The distribution of residual leukemia cells in complete remission was not uniform in different organs including liver, spleen, thymus and bone marrow. Minimal residual leukemia cells could be found by fluorescent microscopy in freezing tissue slice. It is concluded that the multi-drug resistant model of minimal residual leukemia expressing EGFP can be established by using P388/VCR-G cell line and DBA mice.

Three monoclonal antibodies against P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) were immobilized onto the agarose gel film-coated glass slides. Protein chips were prepared respectively from K562/A02 cells cultured for 12, 24 and 48 hours with Tet alone or in combination with Drol. The results showed that Tet alone or in combination with Drol could decrease only the expression of P-gp in a time-dependent manner, the effect for 48 hours as follows: Tet + Drol 82.620 +/- 3.227; Tet alone 86.440 +/- 2.906; Drol alone 87.230 +/- 2.049; control 93.670 +/- 2.748 (P < 0.05).

The results were coincident with that of FCM. It is concluded that Tet and Drol can downregulate the expression of P-gp in the time-dependent way. There is a significant difference between Tet alone and Tet combined with Drol at 24 hours (P < 0.05).

The effects of TTX and FSK on LiCl-induced growth inhibition of K562 cells were determined by cell counting in liquid culture. The results showed that LiCl (30 mmol/L) caused a sustained arrest in G(2)/M cell cycle and down-regulated the bcr/abl mRNA expression in K562 cells, the intracellular Li(+) concentration of K562 cells increased at 30 minutes after treated with 30 mmol/L LiCl and reached apex at 2 hours, thereafter, gradually decreased and balanced at 4 hours after the treatment.

However the mechanisms by which 4-HPR has the apoptotic effects is not completely elucidated. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of 4-HPR on several leukemic cells and explore its mechanisms of effect on U937 cells. The cell growth and proliferation experiments were performed [corrected] cell apoptosis was detected by annexin V; reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) were determined; protein [corrected] expression was detected by Western blot. The results showed that 4-HPR inhibited the proliferation of U937 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. 4-HPR markedly [corrected] induced apoptosis in U937 cells, triggered the generation of ROS, induced the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, decreased the expression of procaspase-8 and procaspase-3. Pretreatment of L-ascorbic acid suppressed the generation of ROS, disruption of mitochondrial potential, activation of caspases and apoptosis. It is concluded that the generation of ROS followed by the disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential plays an important role on 4-HPR-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells, suggesting that 4-HPR may be one of mitochondrial-targeted agents with clinical potential in treating cancer.","['Xiao, Da-Kai', 'Du, Yan-Zhi', 'Fan, Hui-Yong', 'Chen, Yu-Long', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Zhang, Ji', 'Wang, Kan-Kan']","['Xiao DK', 'Du YZ', 'Fan HY', 'Chen YL', 'Chen Z', 'Zhang J', 'Wang KK']","['Shanghai Institue of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2006/01/13 09:00,2008/09/03 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2005)06-0975-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Dec;13(6):975-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Feb;14(1):97'],,,,,,

The characteristics of cell differentiation or apoptosis were analyzed by cytochemical staining, differentiation antigen detection, cell cycle assay and A(NBT)/A(MMT) value determination. The results showed that HL-60 cell had a lower IC(50) of VPA and TSA compared with K562 cells. ATRA could significantly enhance the inhibition of VPA, TSA on clonegenicity of HL-60 cells and inhibition of VPA on clonegenicity of K562 cells. HL-60 cells treated with VPA displayed the phenotype of neutrophilic like cells, and showed the increases of NBT reduction rate and CD11b expression. No evidence for K562 differentiation was found.

The regularity of the expression of HoxA(10) gene in acute leukemia and the relationship between HoxA(10) level and the prognosis of leukemia was explored. The results showed that HoxA(10) was expressed in all types of acute myelogenous leukemia; HoxA(10) message was also observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and part of control groups. 3 normal donors were found not to express HoxA(10). The level of HoxA(10) mRNA of acute myelogenous leukemia patients was significantly higher than that of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and controls (P < 0.01). HoxA(10) gene appeared to be more strongly expressed in AML-M(1) and -M(2) subtypes than in AML-M(4) and -M(5) subtypes, and the gene was notable high expressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia.

As DNA is a major pharmacological target of antitumor platinum compounds, modifications of DNA by trans-PtHMP and recognition of these modifications by active tumor suppressor protein p53 were studied in cell-free media using the methods of molecular biology and biophysics. Our results demonstrate that the replacement of the NH(3) group in transplatin by the 4-hydroxymethylpyridine ligand affects the character of DNA adducts of parent transplatin. The binding of trans-PtHMP is slower, although equally sequence-specific. This platinum complex also forms on double-stranded DNA stable intrastrand and interstrand cross-links, which distort DNA conformation in a unique way. The most pronounced conformational alterations are associated with a local DNA unwinding, which was considerably higher than those produced by other bifunctional platinum compounds. DNA adducts of trans-PtHMP also reduce the affinity of the p53 protein to its consensus DNA sequence. Thus, downstream effects modulated by recognition and binding of p53 protein to DNA distorted by trans-PtHMP and transplatin are not likely to be the same. It has been suggested that these different effects may contribute to different antitumor effects of these two transplatinum compounds.","['Stehlikova, Kristyna', 'Kasparkova, Jana', 'Novakova, Olga', 'Martinez, Alberto', 'Moreno, Virtudes', 'Brabec, Viktor']","['Stehlikova K', 'Kasparkova J', 'Novakova O', 'Martinez A', 'Moreno V', 'Brabec V']","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (trans-PtCl(2)NH(3)(4-hydroxymethylpyridine))', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'GYV9AM2QAG (Thiourea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Thiourea/chemistry', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/04/04 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJB5061 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.05061.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2006 Jan;273(2):301-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.05061.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A test recombinant adenovirus vector was constructed containing human c-myc antisense fragments to study the effects of altering c-myc overexpression in the human HL-60 cell line. Control vector contained the human LacZ gene. Transfection efficiency in HL-60 cells was determined using control vector in the presence of protamine sulphate and multiplicity of infection of 100. Morphological and mechanistic changes were assessed using immunohistochemical analysis, flow cytometry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Transfection efficiency of control vector was 79.8% and morphological differences were observed after 72 h in culture. The rate of proliferation of HL-60 cells infected with test vector was inhibited by 73% compared with control following 6 days in culture. Normal terminal differentiation leading to apoptosis was only evident in test vector infected cells. Peak apoptosis (34.7%) was detected at day 6 and cell cycle arrest at days 2, 4 and 6. Expression of c-fos protein was significantly increased in test vector treated cells with a noticeable down-regulation of c-myc expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that transfection of a human HL-60 cell line with vector containing c-myc antisense fragments could inhibit proliferation, but induce differentiation and apoptosis. Thus, we believe that further study of this construct is warranted as a potential gene therapy reagent for treatment of acute myeloblastic leukaemia.","['Chen, J P', 'Chen, L', 'Leek, J', 'Lin, C']","['Chen JP', 'Chen L', 'Leek J', 'Lin C']","['Department of Hematology, South-west Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China. chenjpxn@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Antisense Elements (Genetics))', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', '*Antisense Elements (Genetics)', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, myc', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Transfection']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/06/30 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['ECI1589 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2006.01589.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2006 Jan;36(1):49-57. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2006.01589.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This progress is largely owed to the optimization of existing treatment modalities rather than the discovery of new agents. However, the annual number of patients with leukemia who experience relapse after initial therapy remains greater than that of new cases of most childhood cancers. The aim of pharmacogenetics is to develop strategies to personalize medications and tailor treatment regimens to individual patients, with the goal of enhancing efficacy and safety through better understanding of the person's genetic makeup. In this review, we summarize recent pharmacogenomic studies related to the treatment of pediatric acute leukemia. These include work using candidate-gene approaches, as well as genome-wide studies using haplotype mapping and gene expression profiling. These strategies illustrate the promise of pharmacogenomics to further advance the treatment of human cancers, with childhood leukemia serving as a paradigm.","['Cheok, Meyling H', 'Lugthart, Sanne', 'Evans, William E']","['Cheok MH', 'Lugthart S', 'Evans WE']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. meyling.cheok@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol,Annual review of pharmacology and toxicology,7607088,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', '*Pharmacogenetics']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/04/13 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.45.120403.100018 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol. 2006;46:317-53. doi: 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.45.120403.100018.,,207,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reversible electrochemical oxidation of 5,8-DHC at pH 7.0 was characterized by the midpoint potential (E(p/2)) of 0.23 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode. 5,8-DHC was slowly autoxidized at pH 7.0, and it was active as a substrate for peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7) and tyrosinase (TYR, EC 1.14.18.1). Oxidation of 5,8-DHC by POD/H202 yielded the product(s) which reacted with reduced glutathione and supported the oxidation of NADPH by ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (FNR, EC 1.18.1.2) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1, DT-diaphorase, EC 1.6.99.2). The concentration of 5,8-DHC for 50% survival of bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) during a 24-h incubation was (60 +/- 5.5) microM. Cytotoxicity of 5,8-DHC was decreased by desferrioxamine, catalase, the antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine, and potentiated by 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea and dicumarol, an inhibitor of NQO1. This shows that 5,8-DHC possesses the oxidative stress-type cytotoxicity, evidently due to the action of quinodal oxidation product(s). The protective effect of isoniazide, an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 2E1, points to hydroxylation of 5,8-DHC as additional toxification route, whereas the potentiating effect of 3,5-dinitrocatechol, an inhibitor of catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT, EC 2.1.1.6), points to the o-methylation of hydroxylation products as the detoxification route.","['Nemeikaite-Ceniene, Ausra', 'Maroziene, Audrone', 'Pukalskas, Audrius', 'Venskutonis, Petras Rimantas', 'Cenas, Narimantas']","['Nemeikaite-Ceniene A', 'Maroziene A', 'Pukalskas A', 'Venskutonis PR', 'Cenas N']","['Institute of Immunology of Vilnius University, Molety P1. 29, LT-08409 Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Z Naturforsch C J Biosci,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

Case analyses were assigned to interindividual comparison tables representing the following subject areas: complaints, diagnostics, causes, controllability, treatment experiences, and prognosis. This allowed us to describe similarities and contrasts. RESULTS: Dramatic narrations of overwhelming threat in younger patients are in contrast to downplaying, rationalizing, and factual descriptions especially in elderly patients. Feelings of helplessness and efforts of normalization become apparent. Experiences of visible and sensible physical injury are perceived as threatening. Prognosis is estimated as too positive.

The number of long-term survivors, off- threatment for at least 5 years, is rising rapidly and is becoming a new population, which needs a special care. It is becoming increasingly important to know how to prevent and treat the physical late effects as well as the psychosocial ones. The oldest among these patients are now in their 40's. How will their old age be like? Are they really cured? The aim of this study is to present a detailed survey of the literature on this topic as well as the authors' personal experience. Several techniques of psychological investigation for this population are highlighted. The semistructured interviews are mostly used for mono-institutional research, while the narrative dialogues are useful for small groups of patients. Questionnaires are usually conducted by epidemiologists for large groups of survivors. Tests are used for specific items such as defense mechanisms, self-esteem, relationships within the family, fear, and panic. The evaluation of the post-traumatic stress disorder is considered and the most important literature data are reported. It is also stressed the need of prevention of any type of psychosocial distress. In conclusion, most of the survivors appear to lead normal adult lives, to have obtained high school degrees, good jobs, and several have families and children. Nevertheless, a small percentage show some psychological or social problems, such as anxiety, depression, fear over the future or over relapse, a second primary, or sterility. The most vulnerable among them are females, people in poor financial conditions, the unemployed and those with poor educations.","['Massimo, L', 'Zarri, D', 'Caprino, D']","['Massimo L', 'Zarri D', 'Caprino D']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, IRCCS, Genova. luisamassimo@ospedale.gaslini.ge.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Minerva Pediatr,Minerva pediatrica,0400740,,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality/*psychology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/*psychology', 'Psychology', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2006/01/13 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minerva Pediatr. 2005 Dec;57(6):389-97.,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many cases require no treatment at all because of an indolent course, while other patients become symptomatic or develop signs of rapid progression. Treatment is usually noncurative and is directed at reducing the symptoms. Some molecular risk features may help delineate, at initial diagnosis, which patients will have a more aggressive course. Newer CLL treatment regimens incorporating purine nucleoside analogues and monoclonal antibodies have increased the rate of molecular complete remissions, which may lead to better survival times. Reduced intensity allogeneic transplant conditioning regimens have made the potentially curative modality more widely available. All these treatments have significant risks for infectious complications, which must be carefully weighed against the risks posed by the underlying disease.

However, there are several families with FTD that show definite linkage to the region on chromosome 17 that contains MAPt, in which no mutation(s) has been identified. Although these families could have a complex mutation of the MAPt locus that has evaded detection it is also possible that another gene in this region is associated with FTD. This possibility is supported by neuropathological findings in these families, which consist of neuronal inclusions that are immunoreactive for ubiquitin (ub-ir) but not for tau. In addition to neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, several chromosome 17-linked families are reported to have ub-ir neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII); a finding which is uncommon in sporadic FTD. Here, we describe detailed clinical and neuropathological findings in a new large, multigenerational family with autosomal dominant FTD and autopsy proven tau-negative, ub-ir neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions. We have demonstrated that this family is linked to a 19.06 cM region of chromosome 17q21 with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 3.911 containing MAPt. By combining the results of our genetic analysis with those previously published for other families with similar pathology, we have further refined the minimal region to a 3.53 cM region of chromosome 17q21. We did not identify point mutations in MAPt by direct sequencing or any gross MAPt gene alterations using fluorescent in situ hybridization. In addition, tau protein extracted from members of this family was unremarkable in size and quantity as assessed by western blotting. Neuropathological characterization of the ub-ir NII in this family shows that they are positive for promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) and SUMO-1 that suggests that these inclusions form in the nuclear body and suggests a possible mechanism of neurodegeneration in tau-negative FTD linked to chromosome 17q21.","['Mackenzie, Ian R', 'Baker, Matthew', 'West, Gemma', 'Woulfe, John', 'Qadi, Najeeb', 'Gass, Jennifer', 'Cannon, Ashley', 'Adamson, Jennifer', 'Feldman, Howard', 'Lindholm, Caroline', 'Melquist, Stacey', 'Pettman, Rachel', 'Sadovnick, A Dessa', 'Dwosh, Emily', 'Whiteheart, Sidney W', 'Hutton, Michael', 'Pickering-Brown, Stuart M']","['Mackenzie IR', 'Baker M', 'West G', 'Woulfe J', 'Qadi N', 'Gass J', 'Cannon A', 'Adamson J', 'Feldman H', 'Lindholm C', 'Melquist S', 'Pettman R', 'Sadovnick AD', 'Dwosh E', 'Whiteheart SW', 'Hutton M', 'Pickering-Brown SM']","['Department of Pathology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Brain,Brain : a journal of neurology,0372537,"['0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (tau Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Dementia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurons/ultrastructure', 'Pedigree', 'Ubiquitin/analysis', 'tau Proteins/analysis/genetics']",2006/01/13 09:00,2006/04/18 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['awh724 [pii]', '10.1093/brain/awh724 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain. 2006 Apr;129(Pt 4):853-67. doi: 10.1093/brain/awh724.

METHOD: Mice transplantable tumors S180, H22, P388 and Lewis were used in the pharmacodynamic test on the granules of Wulong Kangai. The test on each tumor strain was repeated three times. In each test, 50 mice were used and divided into 5 groups. They were negative control group treated by physiological saline, cyclophosphamide control group and 3 test groups treated respectively with Wulong Kangai at deferent dosages of 10, 25, 40 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) in the treatment of Lewis and P388 and 15, 30, 50 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) in the treatment of S180 and H22. RESULT: The tumor weight were inhibited at the rates of 90.1%, 30.8%, 49.8% and 52. 3% in the mice with tumors of Lewis, P388, S180, and H22 by high dosage of Wulong Kangai as compared with negative control group. The inhibitory rates in cyclophosphamide groups were 90.6%, 77.2%, 79.6% and 60.3% respectively. The mice body weights grew slower in high dose groups treated by Wulong Kangai granule. CONCLUSION: Wulong Kangai was effective in treating mice transplantable tumors of Lewis, P388, S180 and H22 with a dose-dependent manner. The Lewis was the most sensitive strain to the drug among the 4 kinds of tested tumors. Side effects appeared during 9-11 days of uninterrupted treatment with high dose Wulong Kangai.","['Liu, Ya-qian', 'Li, Chun-hai', 'Yang, Geng-lu', 'Chen, Hua']","['Liu YQ', 'Li CH', 'Yang GL', 'Chen H']","['Centra Animal Experimental Laboratory, General Hospital of PLA, Beijing 100853, China. liuyaqian@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,8913656,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Materia Medica)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Arthropods/chemistry', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Male', 'Materia Medica/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Sarcoma 180/pathology']",2006/01/13 09:00,2007/03/30 09:00,['2006/01/13 09:00'],"['2006/01/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi. 2005 Nov;30(21):1689-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been several reports on the presence of genetic polymorphisms in the DNA sequence encoding the leader sequence of the TGF-beta protein, and in the -308 promoter region of TNF-alpha. The association between TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism and the susceptibility to MDS and the progression of the disease was investigated. As compared with healthy control subjects (n = 74), patients with MDS (n = 55) showed no significant deviations in genotype or allele frequencies of TNF-alpha. Similarly, there were no differences in the distribution of TNF-alpha genotypes between the MDS patients with only anemia (mild group) and those with bi- or pancytopenia (severe group). On the other hand the TT homozygosity at codon 10 in exon 1 of TGF-beta1 gene was associated with a severe degree of cytopenia [95% CI OR = 4.889, p = 0.0071].

Each patient received 0.8 mg/kg as a 2 h infusion every 6 h for 16 doses. A total of 690 concentration measurements were analyzed using the nonlinear mixed effect model (NONMEM) program. A one-compartment model with an additive error model as an intraindividual variability including an interoccasion variability (IOV) in clearance (CL) was sufficient to describe the concentration-time profile of busulfan. Actual body weight (ABW) was found to be the determinant for CL and the volume of distribution (V) according to NONMEM analysis. In this limited study, the age (range 7-53 years old; median, 30 years old) had no significant effect on busulfan pharmacokinetics. For a patient weighting 60 kg, the typical CL and V were estimated to be 8.87 l/h and 33.8 l, respectively. The interindividual variability of CL and V were 13.6 and 6.3%, respectively. The IOV (6.6%) in CL was estimated to be less than the intraindividual variability.

However, the effect of ALL and of its treatment on body composition in children in remission from ALL has not been fully examined with the use of a reference method. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the body composition and composition of fat-free mass (FFM) in children in remission from ALL. We also aimed to compare the effects that prednisolone and dexamethasone had on the body composition of an ALL survivor population. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study measured height, weight, body volume, total body water, and bone mineral content in 24 children in remission from ALL and 24 age-matched, healthy control subjects. Body composition and FFM composition were evaluated by using the 4-component model. RESULTS: The mean body mass index and fat mass index were significantly (P = 0.05 for both) higher in the ALL survivors than in age-matched control subjects. The composition of the FFM in the 2 treatment groups was not observed to differ significantly. Examination of the composition of FFM made it evident that children in remission from ALL had both significantly greater hydration (P = 0.001) and lower density (P = 0.0001) of FFM than did the control children. CONCLUSIONS: Children in remission from ALL may develop excess body fat. To measure body composition accurately in an ALL population, the high hydration and low density of FFM in this population should be taken into consideration.","['Murphy, Alexia J', 'Wells, Jonathan C K', 'Williams, Jane E', 'Fewtrell, Mary S', 'Davies, Peter S W', 'Webb, David K']","['Murphy AJ', 'Wells JC', 'Williams JE', 'Fewtrell MS', 'Davies PS', 'Webb DK']","[""Children's Nutrition Research Centre, Discipline of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Queensland, Royal Children's Hospital, Herston, Australia. alexia.murphy@uq.edu.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'AR09D82C7G (Deuterium)']",IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adipose Tissue/*metabolism', '*Body Composition/drug effects/physiology', 'Body Mass Index', 'Body Water/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Deuterium', 'Dexamethasone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism', 'Plethysmography', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Prednisolone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction']",2006/01/10 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2006/01/10 09:00'],"['2006/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['83/1/70 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcn/83.1.70 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 2006 Jan;83(1):70-4. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/83.1.70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain germline and somatic PTPN11 mutations cause leukemias. Mutations have gain-of-function (GOF) effects with the commonest NS allele, N308D, being weaker than the leukemia-causing mutations. To study the effects of disease-associated PTPN11 alleles, we generated transgenic fruitflies with GAL4-inducible expression of wild-type or mutant csw, the Drosophila orthologue of PTPN11. All three transgenic mutant CSWs rescued a hypomorphic csw allele's eye phenotype, documenting activity. Ubiquitous expression of two strong csw mutant alleles were lethal, but did not perturb development from some CSW-dependent receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. Ubiquitous expression of the weaker N308D allele caused ectopic wing veins, identical to the EGFR GOF phenotype. Epistatic analyses established that csw(N308D)'s ectopic wing vein phenotype required intact EGF ligand and receptor, and that this transgene interacted genetically with Notch, DPP and JAK/STAT signaling. Expression of the mutant csw transgenes increased RAS-MAP kinase activation, which was necessary but not sufficient for transducing their phenotypes. The findings from these fly models provided hypotheses testable in mammalian models, in which these signaling cassettes are largely conserved. In addition, these fly models can be used for sensitized screens to identify novel interacting genes as well as for high-throughput screening of therapeutic compounds for NS and PTPN11-related cancers.","['Oishi, Kimihiko', 'Gaengel, Konstantin', 'Krishnamoorthy, Srinivasan', 'Kamiya, Kenichi', 'Kim, In-Kyong', 'Ying, Huiwen', 'Weber, Ursula', 'Perkins, Lizabeth A', 'Tartaglia, Marco', 'Mlodzik, Marek', 'Pick, Leslie', 'Gelb, Bruce D']","['Oishi K', 'Gaengel K', 'Krishnamoorthy S', 'Kamiya K', 'Kim IK', 'Ying H', 'Weber U', 'Perkins LA', 'Tartaglia M', 'Mlodzik M', 'Pick L', 'Gelb BD']","['Departments of Pediatrics and Human Genetics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L.

Nevertheless, diseases, including most malignancies, increase in frequency with advancing age. Although there are many reasons why this might be the case, perhaps most important is that it takes time to progress through the many steps of carcinogenesis and growth to reach a threshold for diagnosis. Other factors, including accumulated nonlethal damage to DNA (eg, by free radicals), increased proinflammatory factors, and age-associated declines in DNA repair and immune competence, are to some degree important. The median age for all cancer is approximately 70 years and will become even older over the next several decades. Myelodysplasia and hematologic malignancies, including lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia, can be effectively treated in older age groups, but advanced age presents a number of additional challenges. With appropriate pretreatment assessment of organ reserve, physical performance, and cognitive function, individualized (tailored) therapy may ultimately prove to offer the greatest chance for successful outcomes.

Matching for HLA alleles remains the cornerstone of donor selection, and recent studies are refining our understanding and use of HLA typing in allo-HCT. High-resolution allelic HLA matching generally improves transplant outcome but may limit the donor pool and delay transplantation. Allelic mismatches may be permissible in certain circumstances without compromising outcome. There is growing interest in the role of natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity in allo-HCT. NK cells express an array of activating and inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), and NK cell activation is negatively regulated by KIR interaction with HLA class I molecules. In haploidentical transplants, NK cell alloreactivity in the graft-versus-host direction can be predicted by the HLA class I and KIR genotypes of donor and recipient and has been associated with potent graft-versus-leukemic effects and low rates of graft-versus-host disease. KIR genotype and expression may influence transplantation outcomes in both HLA-matched and -mismatched transplants. Graft-versus-host disease and major infection remain problematic despite HLA matching, and there is mounting evidence that polymorphisms in non-HLA immune mediators and host defense genes influence the risk of these complications. The importance of non-HLA genomics in nonmyeloablative transplants is poorly understood and is under investigation. These findings suggest that tissue typing for allo-HCT is entering an exciting era in which both HLA and non-HLA genomic data may be used in a more sophisticated fashion to select donors, stratify risk, identify novel therapeutic targets, and ultimately improve outcome for allo-HCT recipients.","['Mullighan, Charles G', 'Petersdorf, Effie W']","['Mullighan CG', 'Petersdorf EW']","[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. charles.mullighan@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (GEM protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Genome, Human/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics/immunology', '*Polymorphism, Genetic/immunology', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2006/01/10 09:00,2006/07/19 09:00,['2006/01/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(05)00667-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.09.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Jan;12(1 Suppl 1):19-27. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.09.014.,"['AI33484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI49213/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A prospective phase II study.,102-10,"The study comprised 37 consecutive patients who underwent transplantation with a Campath-1H in vitro T cell-depleted granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell graft from an HLA-identical sibling, followed 24 hours later by an unmanipulated graft. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was limited to grade I to II, whereas chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in 9 patients, mostly (n = 7) with limited disease. Molecular relapses (8 chronic myeloid leukemia [CML] and 1 non-Hodgkin lymphoma) that occurred not earlier than the sixth month after transplantation were treated with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), which induced complete remission in all but 1 CML patient with persistent very low BCR-ABL molecular levels. With a median follow-up of 54 months (range, 29-84 months), the actuarial 5-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and transplant-related mortality are 78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52%-88%), 78% (95% CI, 52%-86%), and 6% (95% CI, 1.5%-32%), respectively. All CML patients are alive and free of disease. The results of this prospective, nonrandomized study show that incomplete T-cell depletion in vitro with Campath-1H (in combination with DLI for molecular relapses in CML) may decrease the incidence of GVHD and transplant-related mortality with no adverse effect on disease-free survival. The described method decreases the number of T cells to an extent that severe GVHD is prevented while relapse is postponed to a time when the patient can be treated with DLI without severe side effects.","['Chalandon, Yves', 'Roosnek, Eddy', 'Mermillod, Bernadette', 'Waelchli, Laurent', 'Helg, Claudine', 'Chapuis, Bernard']","['Chalandon Y', 'Roosnek E', 'Mermillod B', 'Waelchli L', 'Helg C', 'Chapuis B']","['Hematology Service, Department of Internal Medicine University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland. yves.chalandon@hcuge.ch']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', '*Leukocyte Reduction Procedures', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes']",2006/01/10 09:00,2006/03/25 09:00,['2006/01/10 09:00'],"['2005/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(05)00674-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.09.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Jan;12(1):102-10. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.09.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HA-1 and HA-2 are potential targets of selective graft-versus-leukemia and graft-versus-tumor reactivity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); however, these applications are restricted to a limited number of patients. Here, we show that a far more frequent application of HA-1 and HA-2 disparity relies on their use as markers for the state of host chimerism after allogeneic HSCT. We have determined allelic frequencies of 29.3% and 70.7% for HA-1H and HA-1R, respectively, and of 83.7% and 16.3% for HA-2V and HA-2M, respectively, in >200 healthy individuals from northern Italy. Similar frequencies were observed in nearly 100 patients affected by hematologic malignancies or solid tumors, thus showing that HA-1 and HA-2 variability are not associated with the presence of cancer. On the basis of these data, we predict that HA-1 and HA-2 can be used in 32.8% and 23.5% of Italian transplant patients, respectively, as markers for the state of host chimerism, whereas exploitation of disparity for these mHags for targeted immunotherapy will be possible in 10.7% and 1.1% of Italian patients, respectively. Retrospective HA-2 typing of bone marrow aspirates obtained from a patient during complete remission or recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia after haploidentical HSCT showed the feasibility of using HA-2 as a surrogate marker for disease monitoring. Because of an apparent north-south gradient for HA-1 allelic frequencies, with higher frequencies for the HA-1H variant reported in white populations from Southern Europe as compared with Northern Europe and North America, the diagnostic applicability of HA-1 disparity will be slightly more frequent in transplant patients from the north. Taken together, our data show that determination of HA-1 and HA-2 variability can be an important parameter for the selection of allogeneic stem cell donors, in particular for patients affected by hematologic malignancies without a tumor-specific molecular marker.","['Di Terlizzi, Simona', 'Zino, Elisabetta', 'Mazzi, Benedetta', 'Magnani, Chiara', 'Tresoldi, Cristina', 'Perna, Serena Kimi', 'Bregni, Marco', 'Rossini, Silvano', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Bordignon, Claudio', 'Bonini, Chiara', 'Fleischhauer, Katharina']","['Di Terlizzi S', 'Zino E', 'Mazzi B', 'Magnani C', 'Tresoldi C', 'Perna SK', 'Bregni M', 'Rossini S', 'Ciceri F', 'Bordignon C', 'Bonini C', 'Fleischhauer K']","['San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico H.S.

Forty-six were adults with a median age of 32 years (range, 4-58 years). Forty-two were HLA-A, -B, and -DR matched with their respective donors, and 6 were mismatched at 1 of these loci. The conditioning regimen was myeloablative in all cases: busulfan/cyclophosphamide/etoposide in 34 patients, busulfan/cyclophosphamide in 10 patients, and total body irradiation based in 4 patients. Median follow-up for survivors was 540 days (range, 145-2716 days). Only patients with <5000 peripheral blood blasts per microliter at the time of transplantation survived 2 years (18% versus 0%; P = .003). Similarly, patients with <20% blasts in the marrow at the time of transplantation had superior 2-year survival compared with those who had > or =20% (33% versus 5%; P = .04). Patients with <20% blasts who had > or =3 prior therapies also fared poorly. Cause of death was more commonly treatment related rather than relapse related. This study confirms that patients with acute myeloid leukemia not in remission can achieve prolonged survival with myeloablative conditioning and unrelated donor cell transplantation. However, sustained survival occurs only in patients with a low disease burden at the time of unrelated donor stem cell transplantation, and patients with a high disease burden may benefit from added counseling regarding the high risk of death due to both treatment-related toxicities and disease relapse.","['Blum, William', 'Bolwell, Brian J', 'Phillips, Gary', 'Farag, Sherif S', 'Lin, Thomas S', 'Avalos, Belinda R', 'Penza, Sam L', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Byrd, John C', 'Kalaycio, Matt E', 'Sobecks, Ronald M', 'Pohlman, Brad', 'Brown, Stacey', 'Elder, Patrick J', 'Copelan, Edward A']","['Blum W', 'Bolwell BJ', 'Phillips G', 'Farag SS', 'Lin TS', 'Avalos BR', 'Penza SL', 'Marcucci G', 'Byrd JC', 'Kalaycio ME', 'Sobecks RM', 'Pohlman B', 'Brown S', 'Elder PJ', 'Copelan EA']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University Hospitals, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA. blum-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/toxicity', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden']",2006/01/10 09:00,2006/03/25 09:00,['2006/01/10 09:00'],"['2005/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/01/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(05)00424-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Jan;12(1):61-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.06.004.,,,,,,,,,['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Jun;12(6):691-2.
