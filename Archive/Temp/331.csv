This activity is markedly decreased or not detectable in the cells from three-quarters of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), while supranormal levels are found in less than 10% of the cases. To determine whether the decreased 5'N value in CLL represents a lower activity per cell or fewer enzyme-containing cells than in the normal, conditions were established for the histochemical measurement of 5'N in human lymphocytes. It was found that the cells isolated from the blood of normal subjects or patients with CLL consist of 5'N-positive and 5'N-negative subpopulations. Normal subjects who had high 5'N specific activity were shown to have a greater percentage of 5'N-positive cells than individuals with low 5'N activity. Patients with CLL who had no activity by standard chemical assay had no 5'N-positive cells, while the exceptional patient with CLL with a higher than normal specific activity showed an percentage of 5'N-positive cells. It is suggested that the selective proliferation of 5'N-positive and 5'N-negative populations may account for the heterogeneity of 5'N in CLL.",PMC301996,,,,,,

Electron microscopy also provided a qualitative assessment of the structural integrity of the concentrated virus particles used in various bioassays. The data shows that the leukemogenic and spleen-focus-forming (SFF) activities of TCV, although demonstrable, are respectively 10(5) and 10(4) lower than those of PV. Moreover, TCV has 10(4) less helper activity (S+L- test) than PV.

Further, positive Winn assays were obtained with spleen cells from mice immunized with FLV at times when the mice resisted live FBL-3 tumor challenge. Positive lymphocyte transformation was obtained with spleen cells from mice immunized with FLV or FBL-3, but not with cells from normal mice or mice immune to a syngeneic methycholanthrene-induced tumor, when cultured with papain-soluble FBL-3 or RBL-5 tumor-cell extracts or mitomycin-C (MMC)-treated FBL-3 or RBL-5 cells.

The tumor repeatedly regressed following radiotherapy. The patients eventually died with disseminated lymphocytic lymphoma. In the second patient the thyroid tumor, also locally invasive, was composed principally of neoplastic epithelial cells when studied on electron microscopy. This patient responded poorly to radiation and died within a year after diagnosis. The third patient presented with an enlarging thyroid mass, which ultrastructurally was found to be composed principally of well differentiated lymphocytes.

In addition to blood and urinary histamine the main urinary metabolites of histamine, methylhistamine (MeHi) and 1-methyl-4-imidazoleacetic acid (MeImAA) were measured. In patients with active PV the excretion of MeHi and MeImAA was significantly higher than in controls and secondary polycythaemia, indicating an increased histamine formation. The MeImAA excretion was correlated to the blood histamine level, the degree of blood basophilia, the total white blood count and the spleen volume. The blood histamine level was significantly higher in PV patients compared with controls and secondary polycythaemia. No patients with secondary polycythaemia had an increased blood histamine level. With the bio-assay technique used in this study the urinary excretion of histamine in the PV patients was within the normal range. There was no correlation between the increased histamine formation and ""histamine-related symptoms"". Pruritus and duodenal ulcer occurred with a similar frequency in patients with and without increased MeImAA excretion. The similarity between the disturbance of the histamine metabolism in PV and that found by other authors in chronic myeloid leukaemia is pointed out.",,,,,,,

The mean values calculated for one=year classes of age showed in many cases a decreasing tendency according to the maturation and aging of the animals. This phenomenon concerned the following parameters: the total number of leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes, as well as the lymphocyte percentage. On the contrary, the mean values of the absolute and relative numbers of eosinophils demonstrated an increasing tendency. The other parameters did not show any distinct connection with the age.

Stocks of SFFV derived after extensive growth in this Swiss MEF cell culture system are fully leukemogenic in adult mice for the induction of erythroleukemia and spleen foci. In addition, in vitro-derived LLV-F, when isolated free of SFFV, is fully leukemogenic for the induction of lymphatic leukemia when inoculated into susceptible newborn BALB/c mice. The host range of in vitro-derived FV complex (i.e., FV-TC) for focus formation in vivo is NB-tropic. Unlike in vivo-derived FV complex, FV-TC does not suppress the responsiveness of murine thymocytes to concanavalin A (Con A) in vitro. Rather, FV-TC acts as a mitogen to nonspecifically stimulate the proliferation of BALB/c thymocytes. The mitogenicity of in vitro-derived FV complex is directly associated with the presence of type-C virus particles, is a heat-labile and UV-sensitive property of the virus, and may be primarily due to LLV since equivalent amounts of LLV with or without SFFV present are equally mitogenic. One in vivo passage of FV-TC resulted in the total loss of this mitogenic property with the reappearance of full immunosuppressive properties. This result demonstrates a clear association between in vivo growth of FV and its ability to suppress mouse thymocytes, and suggests that FV complex (SFFV-LLV) is not inherently immunosuppressive for these cells. While the mechanism of this interconversion between immunostimulatory and fully suppressive virus is unknown, both virus markers appear to be dependent upon the presence of infectious FV.",PMC2189940,,,,,,

Experiments were performed with two syngeneic tumor-host system: the T5-BALB/c tumor line chronically infected with a low-leukemogenic Rauscher virus variant and the TM1-C3H tumor line developed from a spontaneous C3H/He mouse mammary tumor. In confirmation of our previous data, peritoneal cells (PC) from advanced tumor-bearing mice (EPC) appeared to have lost any capacity to inhibit specifically the growth of corresponding tumor target cells in vitro colony inhibition (CI) tests, whereas PC from immunized mice (IPC) were perfectly active. When these EPC were adoptively transferred by intraperitoneal inoculation into sublethally irradiated (450 R) syngeneic mice in association with respective tumor extracts (TE), the PC from such recipient mice, taken 5 to 13 days later, were nearly as active in in vitro CI tests as were PC from parallel IPC-recipient mice. For this recovery of specific immunological activity following the adoptive transfer of EPC the adjunction of the TE and irradiation of the recipient animals seem important and may be necessary. On the other hand, no specific immunological activity was seen in PC from irradiated mice to which PC from normal mice had been transferred with TE. In addition to the in vitro results, an effect of adoptive transfer of EPC (retardation of tumor growth) was also observed in vivo. It is concluded that the ""eclipsed"" immunologically inactive state of the EPC in mice bearing advanced tumor is not irreversible and that activation of these cells can occur in vivo under certain conditions helped by the presence of tumor-specific antigenic stimulus.",,,,,,,

Three cell cycle kinetic models are presented under alternative hypotheses concerning the mechanism of the resting cells, while each tumor mass is comprised of cells in proliferating (consisting of the four cycle phases G1, S, G2, and M), resting (Go), and non dividing (D, dead) states. An algorithm and a computer program for simulating the tumor populations during scheduled treatments have been prepared. By a suitable selection of expressions for cell-drug interactions, the program is able to simulate tumor behavior during scheduled treatments with different classes of anticancer agent such as cell cycle phase-specific, cell cycle-specific, or cell cycle-specific, or cell cycle-nonspecific drugs. A preliminary study of the L1210-ara-C therapeutic system is included to demonstrate the computer simulation procedures.",,,,,,,

The metacentric marker of the T1ALD sub-strain made it possible to identify the host or donor orgin of leukaemias. Leukaemias occur either in the thymuc (lymphosarcomas) or in the other lymphoid tissues (extra-thymic leukaemias). After irradiation, the precentage of lymphosarcomas increases from 5 to 95%. The rate of leukaemias in hybrids which have been restored only with BM cells is 55, 56 and 100% respectively depending on the origin of BM: syngenic, C3H and AKR. In this last group 75% of the lymphosarcomas originate from donor cells. The inhibitory efficiency of the three kinds of BM on luekaemogenesis seems to be related to their respective abilities to spontaneous malignant transformation. When AKR or C3H thymic cells are injected together with BM cells, leukaemogenesis is altered. The effect is indirect as these cells are not actually concerned by the malignant transformation. The percentage of LS is significantly reduced and the mean survival improved in hybrids restored with C3H thymic, mixed AKR or C3H BM cells. AKR thymic cells are less efficient. In both cases, the percentage of extra thymic leukaemias increases at the expense of lymphosarcomas. Thymic cells do not change the kinetics of repopulation in thymus and lymph-node by the BM cells, except when C3H thymic cells are mixed with T1ALD BM cells; in this case, the lymph-node repopulation is temporarily enhanced. Different hypotheses might explain the effect of thymic cells on leukaemogenesis: enhanced recovery of the postirradiation immunological deficiency, transfer of virus by the AKR thymic cells, and more probably influence of the thymic cells on the maturation or/and differentiation of the lymphoid cells.",,,,,,,

Plasma concentration ratios of ara-U to ara-C are 0.1 to 0.3, 0.3 to 0.4, and 1.1 to 1.3 at 10 min, 1 hr, and 4 hr following intravenous injection of cyclo-C at 200 mg/m2. Five min after an equal dose of ara-C, this ratio is approximately 2, and by 4 hr, plasma ara-C levels are immeasurable. After intramuscular and subcutaneous administration, cyclo-C is rapidly absorbed. The plasma disappearance curves of the cyclo-C hydrolytic product, ara-C, are similar to those of the intravenous route. Intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and intravenously cyclo-C should be equally effective. Intrathecal injections of cyclo-C (50 mg/m2) result in an effective ara-C level (0.1 mug/ml) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 24 hr. When cyclo-C is given orally to fasting patients, less than 15% of the dose is excreted in urine in 24 hr and none can be detected in the plasma.",,,,,,,

The over-all surgical mortality was 8%. The median duration of response was 4 months, and the mean, 7 months. Increased tolerance to further antitumor therapy and a decreased transfusion requirement were seen among responding patients. Those patients with anemia who had evidence of shortened erythrocyte survival and splenic sequestration of 51Cr-labelled erythrocytes uniformly responded with rises in hemoglobin. However, half of the patients with negative splenic sequestration also showed improvement of anemia. Preoperative diagnostic studies failed to predict favorable responses of patients with thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. The classical criteria for the diagnosis of hypersplenism are not applicable in many cases of neoplastic lymphoproliferative disease; splenectomy could have been considered ""contraindicated"" in most of the patients in this series.

In order to examine the heterogeneity of DNA polymerases in murine leukemia L1210 cells and to characterize their general properties, we have attempted to separate the DNA polymerase activities from L1210 cells. By diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose chromatography (0.2 M-1M KCl) of the whole cell extract from L1210 solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), 4 fractions with DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities were obtained and designated as DD-1, DD-2, DD-3, and DD-4 for eluents with each corresponding concentration of 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 M KCl, respectively. They were distinguishable in properties such as template preference, divalent cation requirement, DNase sensitivity, isoelectric point (pI) and the behavior on the phosphocellulose chromatography. DD-1 preferred native DNA as template exhibiting similar characteristic as nuclear polymerase with low molecular weight and insensitivity to SH-inhibitors. DD-2, DD-3, and DD-4 utilized activated DNA most efficiently, while activity of DD-3 increased even in the presence of DNase 1 under the condition where the others were completely inhibited. Distribution of DNA polymerase activities in the cells is discussed briefly.",,,,,,,

Thus, whereas untreated cells contain no detectable hemoglobin, treated cells accumulate hemoglobin in quantities comparable to those in the mature mouse red blood cell. We have investigated the mechanism of hemoglobin induction by quantitating the number of globin genes and the amount of globin mRNA in cells before and during the period of hemoglobin accumulation. The results indicate the number of globin genes does not change as the cells accumulate hemogtobin: There are less than 5 globin genes per haploid genome. On the other hand, whereas cells lacking hemoglobin contain little, if any, globin mRNA, hemoglobin-containing cells accumulate, on the average, 8,000 molecules of globin mRNA per cell. The most direct, although, by no means, the only interpretation of these results is that the induction of hemoglobin synthesis involves transcriptional activation of the globin genes. Using this same cell line, we show that mouse globin mRNA sequences are also present in viral particles purified from the culture medium of globin-producing cells. These globin mRNA sequences are absent from viral particles derived from T-3-Cl-2 cells which are not producing globin mRNA. Virus-associated globin mRNA sequences sediment in association with 60S viral RNA complex as well as in free, 9S form. However, under mild denaturing conditions which result in the conversion of viral 60 S RNA to 30S and smaller forms, all the globin sequences sediment as 9S RNA. Appropriate control experiments indicate that the virus-associated globin mRNA is resistant to degradation by exogenous ribonuclease; that exogenously added globin mRNA does not become associated with the 60S viral RNA complex; and that globin mRNA can be detected in virions derived from cells both induced for and constitutively synthesizing globin mRNA. The presence of globin mRNA sequences in FLV particles has important implications in terms of our ability to distinguish between host and viral RNAs in viral particles and in terms of the possible role RNA tumor viruses might play in transduction of genetic information.",,,,,,,

(1969) Biochemistry 8, 2057-2062), has been purified about 100-fold from murine leukemia P1534J. Roughly 20% of the original activity was recovered to yield an enzyme preparation with a specific activity of 7.4 mumol of 5-fluorouracil utilized/hour/mg of protein. Disc gel electrophoresis of this preparation revealed the presence of a major band of protein accompanied by several trace contaminants. Emphasis was placed on a study of the substrate specificity of this enzyme. 5-Fluorouracil, uracil, and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase activities purified in parallel during fractionation with ammonium sulfate and protamine sulfate and eluted together from columns of Sephadex tG-150 and DEAE-cellulose. The three phosphoribosyltransferase activities eluted from the Sephadex columns with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 to 60,000. In spite of this coordinate fractionation, preferential losses of orotate activity were experienced during DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Orotate activity continued to behave in a unique manner under other conditions, such as during proteolytic digestion. In the latter case, however, all three activities responded in parallel when digestion took place in the presence of 5mM UMP. The following results provided additional evidence to support the view that all three phosphoribosyltransferase activities may be catalyzed by the same enzyme: (a) the apparent Km for 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P) did not change significantly when enzyme activity was measured with either 5-fluorouracil, uracil, or orotate; (b) 5-fluorouracil and uracil were found to be mutually competitive inhibitors; the effect of 5-fluorouracil on orotate activity was likewise competitive in nature; (c) in the absence of UMP, orotate was a noncompetitive inhibitor of 5-fluorouracil and uracil activities, but in the presence of 5mM UMP it became a competitive inhibitor of both of these activities; (d) 5-fluorouracil and orotate activities co-sedimented in 5 to 20% sucrose gradients (uracil activity was not examined); and (e) a wide variety of normal mouse tissues displayed virtually the same 5-fluorouracil to uracil to orotate activity ratio as found in P1534J enzyme preparations. The apparent Km and Ki values reported in this study indicate that the preferred pyrimidine substrate is orotate. It seems likely, therefore, that this enzyme functions in vivo as an orotate phosphoribosyltransferase. Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase activities (a) eluted together during gel filtration on Sephadex G-150, (b) co-sedimented in 5 to 20% sucrose gradients, (c) remained associated during fractionation with ammonium sulfate and protamine sulfate, and (d) separated into a phosphoribosyltransferase and decarboxylase component when enzyme preparations previously subjected to limited proteolysis by elastase were sedimented in sucrose gradients...",,,,,,,

The 3-methylcholanthrene transformant possessed a ganglioside pattern different from that of the Rauscher leukemia virus transformant. Hydrolysis of the gangliosides indicated that galactosamine, N-acetyl-and N-glycolylneuraminic acid were the labeled components in all cell lines.",,,,,,,

The properties of ferritin in serum have been compared with those of ferritin from a number of tissues including blood cells. On anion-exchange chromatography with DEAE-Sephadex, the behaviour of human heart ferritin is different from that of liver, kidney or spleen ferritin. Reticulocyte ferritin appears to have similar characteristics to heart ferritin. 2. Serum ferritin from normal subjects and patients with various degrees of iron load, leukaemia or liver disease all have a much lower affinity for the anion-exchange column that any tissue ferritin, suggesting a difference in isoelectric point. The elution point of serum ferritin from patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia is significantly different from normal. 3. Density gradient centrifugation in sucrose showed that ferritin in leucocyte extracts and partially purified ferritin from the serum of two patients with iron overload behaved as apoferritin rather than the iron-rich protein. 4. The results suggest that ferritin is modified during its entry into the plasma and that even in cases of iron overload the iron content of serum ferritin may be low.

Annealing experiments with this cDNA have demonstrated that a large proportion of the poly(A) tracts in M2 cell nuclear RNA are adjacent to RNA sequences which are transcribed from nonrepetitive DNA in the mouse genome. The kinetics of hybridization of cDNA to template RNA indicate that nuclear poly(A)-containing RNA consists of at least two abundance classes, the more complex of which is transcribed from approximately 3 percent of the genome. Thus there are at least 5 times more unique DNA sequences represented in nuclear polyadenylated RNA than in polysomal polyadenylated RNA.

Leukemic macrophages exposed in vivo and in vitro to statolon, an extract of the mold Penicillium stoloniferum, shown previously to suppress FV erythroleukemia, regain normal function and release reduced amounts of FV. Statolon's in vivo restoration of leukemic macrophage function is paralleled by restoration of humoral immune competence. Statolon induces interferon in vitro but its effects on leukemic macrophages are probably direct, since restoration of macrophage function occurs at dosage levels far below those that induce interferon. These studies suggest that macrophages play an integral role in both the pathogenesis and the statolon-induced suppression of FV disease.",,,,,,,

Complication rates of bleeding or pneumothorax were comparable to those previously described in nonimmunocompromised patients. In patients with coagulation defects, the risk of having bleeding complications was high. Among 44 patients with primary lymphoma, 22 (50 per cent) had a lymphomatous infiltrate in the lung. Twenty-two patients with severe hypoxemia were studied and their mortality, although significantly greater than in the patients without hypoxemia, was marginally improved when a treatable lung lesion was found. The over-all recovery rate was 70 per cent when a treatable diagnosis was made in contrast to 25 per cent when there was no specific diagnosis.

Patients with acute leukemia also have cellular immune reactivity against tumor associated antigens, as measured by skin tests for delayed hypersensitivity, lymphocyte stimulation, and 51Cr release cytotoxicity. Skin reactions to autologous and allogeneic crude membrane extracts of blast cells correlated with disease state, positive in many patients in remission and negative in most patients in relapse. Extracts of human lymphoid tissue culture cell lines derived from lymphomas or leukemia also gave positive reactions in patients with acute leukemia, and also in patients with lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The antigens detected in the skin tests with the lymphoid cell lines appear to be different from those associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and from those detected in the 51Cr release assay. Evidence is presented which suggests a complex variety of antigens on blast cells and on the cell lines.

Such factors have been isolated from cell-free extracts of human leukemic spleens, bacteria, and mycoplasmata. Unlike immunodepressants and target cell stimulators (which can also increase the pathogenicity of SFFV if applied before infection), nonviral helper factors are most efficient when they are injected with SFFV into helper virus-restrictive mice. In these respects the nonviral factors resemble MuLV. However, helper factors differ from MuLV by their inability to replicate in neonatal mice and by their greater stability to heat. Although the human leukemic helper (HuLV) extracts examined lack detectable mycoplasma or bacterial contamination, the helper assay in mice will be of limited value as a possible detection system for human leukemogenic viruses until a unique marker is found by which to distinguish HuLH activity from that of prokaryotic origin. This makes a systematic comparison among the nonviral helper factors all the more important.",,,,,,,

Hanna et al. also suggested the presence of a fetal antigen on the cell membrane of Rauscher virus-induced leukemia cells. We were able to demonstrate the presence of cross-reacting antibodies against embryonic cells and Rauscher leukemia cells in the sera collected from C57BL/6 mice immunized with Rauscher leukemia cells, employing the indirect immunofluorescence test. Such cross-reacting antigenicity was also found in AKR lymphoma cells by the absorption test. The antibody was completely absorbed with embryonic cells, but not with adult spleen cells or adult C57BL/6 thymocytes. The absorption test showed that this antigen was different from Gross and Friend-Moloney-Rauscher antigens. The antigen detectable by the serum first appeared in 12-day-old embryos. It was found abundantly in the cells from the digestive tract and lungs, but not in the cells from the liver or brain. A natural antibody against the fetal antigen was also found to exist in the sera from a few aged C57BL/6 mice.

During the period 1965-69 a total of 688 cases of cancer (including leukemia) were diagnosed inchildren under 15 years of age resident in this area. The Cancer Registry of Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta (RTP) provided information on 465 children; the other 223 were collected through additional investigation in the files of 31 university of hospital departments of the region and 5 extraregional hospitals. Distribution through the 5 years covered by the investigation is shown in Table 1. Histological or hematological confirmation of the diagnosis was available in 499 cases (73%). The 688 cases included 216 leukemias, 131 tumors of the central nervous system, 40 neuroblastomas, 82 lymphomas (including 34 cases of Hodgkin's disease), 46 nephroblastomas, 32 soft-tissue sarcomas, 29 bone sarcomas (including 5 cases of Ewing's disease), 25 retinoblastomas, 12 thyroid tumors, 10 extragenital teratomas, 5 ovarian dysgerminomas, 4 tumours of the testes, 4 hepatoblastomas and 52 other tumours (Table 2).

Each treatment combination was given in two sequences--high dose first and low dose last, or low dose first and high dose last--administered over 6-7 days. When the initial treatment was a high dose of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy, mortality in the first 24 hours exceeded 40%, and at least 70% of the mice in each group were dead within 2 weeks. When low-dose chemotherapy was given first, mortality in the first 24 hours was minimal but, most significantly, no deaths occurred in the 24 hours after subsequent high-dose treatment. In the most successful group (100 mg cyclophosphamide/kg on day 0, and 250 mg cyclophosphamide/kg and 400 R total-body X-irradiation on day 7), the median survival time increased significantly as compared with the median survival time among mice given the same regimen in reverse sequence (p less than 0.001) or among untreated control mice (p less than 0.01). With this regimen, survival 60 days after the last treatment was 47%. No mouse survived 30 days when the sequence of treatments was reversed. From these results, we conclude that chemotherapeutic and chemoradiotherapeutic regimens for AKR spontaneous leukemia-lymphoma should be designed so that low, minimally lethal doses precede higher doses.",,,,,,,

In addition, there was marginal or no increase of tumor-cell immunogenicity when the parent lines were passaged in nude mice without DIC treatment.

The relative risk estimate (1-47 overall) does not vary significantly between different tumour groups, for different ages at death, nor between sexes. Other epidemiological factors-sibship position, maternal age, social class, region of residence and maternal morbidity-are analysed and show varying degrees of association, but not sufficient to ""explain"" the observed risk in terms of a selection effect. The dependence of the risk on the number of films exposed is highly significant and adequately described by a linear relationship. The timing of and reason for the exposure are also examined. Analysis of the risk by year of birth shows a pattern of steadily declining risk for both solid and haematopoietic tumours; this may be partly attributable to lower radiation doses per film exposed but is also due to the smaller numbers of films used. A consequence may well be that the risk-always of small clinical significance-would become virtually undetectable in future investigations.",PMC2009418,,,,,,

The purification procedure utilized (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography and gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 and yielded a purification of about 1000-fold. The medium from cultures of non-leukaemic cells contained three molecular species of colony-stimulating activity with approximate molecular weights of 93000, 36500 and 14700. On the basis of their sensitivity to enzymes, these species of activity appeared to be proteins. In contrast, medium from cultures of leukaemic cells contained only one detectable molecular species with colony-stimulating activity, usually with an approximate molecular weight of 36500.

These lesions included trauma, inflammatory disease, an aneurysm of the internal carotid artery, and five cases of tumor. Detailed metabolic studies were performed in four patients with hypothalamic obesity and in five age- and weight-matched patients with essential obesity(i.e., obesity with no definable etiology). Fasting insulin concentrations were significantly higher in the patients with hypothalamic obesity. During a seven-day fast the insulin levels in patients with essential obesity decreased by 24 to 48 hours, whereas patients with hypothalamic obesity showed a variety of changes; In three out of four of these patients with hypothalamic obesity there was no evidence for hyperplasia of the fat cells. Basal oxygen consumption, body composition, and metabolism of adipose tissue did not differ between the patients with essential obesity and those with hypothalamic obesity. There was no difference in activity of the enzymes in the glycerophosphate cycle. Our data on eight patients with hypothalamic obesity were compared with data on patients in literature. Most cases of hypothalamic obesity occur with space-occupying tumors arising at the base of the hypothalamus.

The dose-response relation may have been obscured by the narrow range of exposures or by a ""breakage factor"" newly reported in such patients. It appears that in PSS patients the increased chromosomal breakage is not associated with an elevated frequency of leukemia or other neoplasms such as has been reported to be associated with other nonspecific breakage syndromes.",,,,,,,

An LD10 dose of each agent was used for immunosuppression. XR, CY, and PRD were markedly suppressive for the primary immune response if given 24 hr before mice were immunized to Ib cells but less immunosuppressive if given 24 hr later. MTX was only slightly immunosuppressive XR, CY, and PRD also suppressed the secondary immune response if given before but not after antigen. The immunosuppressive effect of these agents was evaluated by defining their median immunosuppressive dose or the median time in days required for mice to recover from graded doses of each immunosuppressive agent. For example, the median recovery time from an LD10 of XR, CY, and PRD was 29.3, 19.7, and 3.7 days, respectively. Immunologic competence remaining after XR or drug treatment was quantified in terms of the LD50 dose of Ib cells required to kill recipient mice. For XR, CY, PRD, and MTX it was 10(6.16), 10(2.15), 10(6.90) and greater than 10(7.0) viable Ib cells, respectively. The overall results provided evidence that the primary and secondary cellular immune responses to a weak syngeneic tumor antigen were resistant to immunosuppression once they were initiated. There was a good correlation between the relative immunosuppressive effect of the test agents and the amount that they reduced the number of immune spleen cells. The agents also impaired the immunocompetence of individual spleen cells. Mechanisms by which XR or drugs might exert their immunosuppressive effects were discussed.",,,,,,,

The analytical chemist works very hard for an answer, but when he gets it, his task is usually completed. When the toxicologist gets an answer from a given experiment, his problems have just started; he must attempt to interpret the data and, even more difficult, to extrapolate the results of animal data to man.

Thymectomized and BNU-treated (C3Hf/Bi times CBA/H-T6T6)F1 mice receiving neonatal thymus tissues from C3Hf donors developed leukemias with or without marked enlargement of the grafts. The origin of leukemic cells was analysed by T6 marker chromosome and thymus allo-antigen theta in this hybrid system. Cells from leukemia with enlarged thymus grafts possessed the sigma-antigen detected by cytotoxicity tests. Cells from leukemia without thymus involvement had no sigma antigen. The leukemic cells arising at the site of thymus grafts were derived from the graft itself (C3Hf) or from the host (C3Hf times CBA/H-T6T6)F1 cells, most probably bone marrow cells which are repopulating into the graft. When the mice were treated with BNU after the lymphoid elements in the grafted thymus had been replaced by host cells, leukemia mainly composed of host-origin cells developed. Leukemia in which neoplastic cells in the thymus grafts were of donor origin and those in other hematopoietic tissues were of host origin was found not infrequently. The present results mean that the target cells in BNU leukemogenesis are distributed within and outside the thymus and that some leukemias are of multifocal tissue origin.",,,,,,,

Using a sensitive enzymic assay, we have measured the concentrations (pools) of these compounds in human bone marrow cells and in lymphocytes. The mean concentrations (pmol/10(6) cells) in normal human bone marrow cells were: deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) 1.5; deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) 0.4; thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) 1.4 and deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) 0.6; and in normal phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes (72 h cultures); dATP 3.7; dGTP 1.9; dTTP 9.4 and dCTP 2.9. The deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate concentrations were increased approximately threefold in the nucleated marrow cells from patients with leukaemia and myeloproliferative diseases. PHA-stimulation of lymphocytes caused a marked increase of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate concentrations, particularly of dTTP, between 24 and 48 h of culture. In PHA-stimulated lymphocytes, the antifolate drugs methotrexate, pyrimethamine and trimethoprim, all produced a fall in dTTP and a rise in dATP concentrations within 1 h. These effects could be reversed by folinic acid. 5-Fluorouracil caused a fall in dTTP and in dCTP but no consistent changes in dATP; hydroxyurea caused a fall in dATP with a rise in dTTP. BCNU caused a significant fall in dATP and dCTP. Dibutyryl cyclic 3', 5' adenosine monophosphate and theophylline had no consistent effect on the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate concentrations. 6-Mercaptopurine caused a fall in dATP and dGTP, the fall in dATP being marked after 4 h incubation. It is concluded that measurement of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates in human cells provides a new method of studying DNA synthesis in human disease states and of analysing the action of antimetabolite drugs on normal and diseased cells.",,,,,,,

Actinomycin D, administered at 60 mug/kg body weight/day prevents the development os splenomegaly and the elevation of polymerase activity following infection, but it has only a slight effect on the production of virus in spleen tissue. Thus, the alteration of RNA synthesis is not a result of virus proliferation, but instead may be a manifestation of leukemic erythropoiesis. Normal erythropoiesis, stimulated by erythropoietin administration, produces a similar but transient increase in RNA polymerase activity in spleen nuclei. Erythropoietin administered before, but not after, Friend virus infection results in an enhancement of RNA polymerase activity, as measured 9 days after inoculation. This effect is most simply explained by assuming that there is a common target cell pool for both erythropoietin and Friend virus, and that this pool becomes refractory to the influence of the hormone as a result of the leukemic process.",,,,,,,

Abnormal stem lines were present in 7 of the patients; the remainder had a diploid chromosome complement. In most patients - also in those without an abnormal clone - some metaphases had a blurred appearance similar to that seen in bone marrow aspirates from patients with acute leukaemia. In many of the chromosome preparations obtained before cytostatic therapy some metaphases with structural aberrations on the chromosomes were seen. Evidence is presented that in the patients with abnormal stem lines in the bone marrow, the chromosome abnormalities are confined to the myeloma cells and are not found in the erythrocytic or granulocytic precursors, which thus do not seem to be involved by the neoplastic process. Based on the present resuts and on a review of the relevant literature some general cytogenetic features are emphasized which may contribute to a better understainding of the disorder. Especially, it is demonstrated that in myelomatosis the cytogenetic changes are much more uniform than in other malignant disorders with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia.",,,,,,,

Alkyldiacylglycerols, a class of lipids that are generally elevated in most neoplastic tissues, occurred only in small quantities (less than 1% of the total lipids) in the thymuses of both control and irradiated mice. However, we found a 3- to 8-fold increase in this fraction in thymic tumors of mice at 5 mo after irradiation when compared to controls of similar age. However, the small quantity of this lipid class in thymic leukemia and the fact that similar levels were found in some samples of involuted thymuses of mice 3 days after irradiation, suggests to us that the level of alkyldiacylglycerols is not sufficiently specific or sensitive for detecting early stages of thymic leukemogenesis. 2. Thymuses 3 days after irradiation and leukemic thymuses contain 2- to 3-fold greater quantities of cholesterol esters than control thymuses. No major differences were found in the distribution of acyl moieties in the cholesterol esters of the various thymus samples from the same aged mice except that in thymic tumors the quantity of 18:1 esters was increased by about 25% over that of the controls. The apparent lack of specificity of increased cholesterol esters for neoplasia indicates that its measurement would not provide a suitable indicator of early neoplastic transformation. 3. Acyl composition of the triacylglycerols of thymuses revealed an increase in the 18:1 and a decrease in the 18:2 acids at 3 days after irradiation when compared to the same aged controls. However, thymic tumors occurring at 5 mo after irradiation contained less 14:0, 16:0, and 16:1 acids and increased amounts of 18:1 and 18:2 acids esterified as triacylglycerols compared to controls. The fatty acid distribution in the phospholipid fraction of thymuses was not altered by the appearance of leukemia.",,,,,,,

Computer analysis pointed out the following results: 1. This group may be differenciated from the group of acute myeloblastic leukemias by: a) a predilection for subjects older than 60 in 73 p. cent of cases; b) male dominance in 70 p. cent of cases; c) a sharply defined improved prognosis with a median of survival of 15 months and with more than 30 p. cent of survivors for more than two years; d) death in 63 p. cent of teh cases is directly due to a complication of bone marrow insufficiency, and only in 14 p. cent of the cases is related to blastic invasion; e) a complete absence of favourable response to intensive chemotherapy. 2. There are five initial prognostic parameters which are of statistical significance: a) the hemoglobin level; b) the sedimentation rate; c) the platelet count, the level of bone marrow cellularity, and age. 3. Multidimensional analysis makes it appear that the whole population obeys a unidimensional phenomenon and depends on a common ""biological axis"" constituted by the five prognostic factors which are inter-related. 4. The disease nevertheless may be subdivided into three subgroups; a) High inflammatory hypoplastic forms are a very high risk group; b) The group of slowly invasive acute leukemias in young subjects is a bad or moderately poor risk group; c) The forms with a purely qualitative disorder of myelopoiesis with very low evolutive potential. These observations point to: a) The concept of OBL as an entity of a distinctive type including the preleukemic syndrome, the myelo-monocytic leukemias, and the smoldering leukemias; b) The concept of a unique and basic bone marrow disorder which embraces the OBL and the common acute myeloblastic leukemia.",,Donnees nouvelles sur les leucemies oligo-blastiques.

Absorption and geometric factors of radiation are elucidated. From this, appropriate measuring conditions are derived. The simultaneous exposure of radioactive standard sources permits the evaluation of absolute amounts of radioactivity. Standard cells with labelled membranes are a suitable source of reference taking into account the physical properties of the isotope. Sheep red blood cells are examined for their suitability as standard cells after enzymatic radioiodination. The absolute number of antigenic substances on the surface of single cells is obtained by determining the specific activity of the labelled antibody molecules, and by measuring the silver grain densities of the cells under investigation and of the standard cells. The radioactivity per standard cell can be assessed by conventional procedures. The new method is applied to the quantification of membrane-bound immunoglobulin molecules of the IgG-type on single human lymphocytes. The determination of an immunologic saturation of the labelled antibody is essential for this purpose. On the lymphocytes of a normal person and of a patient with chronic lymphatic leukaemia quite different amounts of immunoglobulins have been evaluated.",,Quantitative 125-J-Autoradiographic einzelner Zellen,,,,,

A non-transforming virus (GLOH-minus) recovered from a sarcomagenic virus preparation obtained from a tumor induced by the Gross pseudotype of Moloney sarcoma virus was previously shown to retain mouse sequences. The ability to discriminate readily between Gross and Moloney viruses by molecular hybridization, especially with regard to thermal stability of inter-strain hybrid molecules, and the stability of Moloney virus sequences in a rat-mouse interspecies pseudotype, made it possible to specify that the mouse virus-specific sequences in GLOH-minus are derived from Moloney virus and not Gross. Thus, even though GLOH-minus is non-transforming in vitro or in vivo, it still retains sequences highly related to Moloney sarcoma virus. The lack of transforming ability is thus probably based on loss or change of specific sequences necessary for transformation at some point in the history of this virus.",,,,,,,

The level of the hormone has been shown to increase with the tumor diameter and decrease with tumor regression. At the peak of tumor size the tibial bones of the mice were considerably deformed, suggesting osteoclastic activity. The systemic calcium level was not elevated, indicating possible release of calcium into the local tumorous area. In mice treated with indomethacin the tumors failed to develop and PG levels were markedly lower. Tibial bones of treated mice were similar in appearance to those of control, non-tumorous mice. PG levels of DBA/1J mice bearing extensive Cloudaman S91 melanomas were not elevated and no bone deformation was seen. When contrasted with studies of immuno-depressed mice the results suggest that indomethacin acted in conjunction with and possibly to restore the PG-induced depression of the immune system in preventing tumor development. It is also hypothesized that indomethacin, by suppressing the PG-mediated calcium release from bone, could be operative in inhibiting tumor growth.",,,,,,,

Inclusion of erythropoietin (Epo) in the medium was found unnecessary for erythroid colony formation in vitro by these cells, although it was essential for the production of erythroid colonies by hemopoietic cells from normal animals. Development of erythroid colonies also proceeded umimpeded when cells from FV-infected animals were cultivated in medium pretreated with rabbit anti-serum that was shown to inactivate Epo. Thus, the hemopoietic tissues of FV-infected mice contained erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-Es) which appeared to be Epo-independent. When spleen cells from FV-infected mice were exposed to antiserum directed against syngeneic FV-infected spleen cells and complement, and then cultured with or without Epo, the number of erythroid colonies that developed was drastically reduced, indicating that the CFU-Es in these animals carried FV-induced antigen(s), and must themselves have been infected with virus. Electron microscopy of erythroid colonies produced by cells from FV-infected mice revealed the presence of budding and abundant free type-C virus particles. The efficiency of erythroid colony formation in vitro either with or without Epo by hemopoietic cells from FV-infected mice was substantially increased over that of cells from normal mice. The increase in the number of CFU-Es in these animals was due mainly to an increase in the number of Epo-independent CFU-Es. Epo-independent CFU-Es were first detected in bone marrow and spleen as early as 3 days after FV infection; thereafter their numbers progressively increased for at least 9 days. Hypertransfusion with red blood cells prior to FV infection reduced, while bleeding greatly increased, the efficiency of erythoid colony formation without Epo by cells from the spleens of the infected mice. The phenomenon of erythroid colony formation in plasma cultures lacking Epo provides a sensitive and reliable means of detecting Epo-independent CFU-Es, which appear to play a fundamental part in pathogenesis of the disease resulting from infection with the polycythemic strain of FV.",,,,,,,

These ribosomes have unusually low endogenous activity for peptide synthesis in the absence of added mRNA. The system requires components from the postribosomal supernatant and from the 0.5 M KCl ribosomal wash fraction. Both these fractions were derived from either rabbit reticulocytes or unstimulated Friend leukemia cells that produce little or no hemoglobin. The activity of mRNA and enzyme fractions from rabbit reticulocytes and Friend leukemia cells were tested in this system in vitro for their ability to direct the synthesis of the alpha and beta chains of globin. The alpha:beta chain ratio synthesized from mRNA in the rabbit reticulocyte salt wash fraction was 4:1. The corresponding value for the 9-S mRNA fraction from the salt-washed reticulocyte ribosomes was 1:4, thus these two fractions appear to provide sources enriched in either alpha or beta globin mRNA. Under all conditions tested, the ratio and amounts of peptides formed in vitro appear to reflect mRNA composition. Globin mRNA from dimethysulfoxide-stimulated Friend leukemia cells when translated in vitro produced alpha and beta chains in a ratio of 1:1. These peptides are formed in the same ratio in the intact cells.",,,,,,,

Analysis of 125 patients. in the present series showed the following median survival times (in months) from diagnosis: stage 0, is greater than 150; stage I 101; stage II, 71; stage III, 19; stage IV, 19, The median survival for the entire series was 71 mo. The prognostic significance of the stage remained even after adjustment was made for age and sex. However, both sex and age were shown to be poor predictors of survival after adjustment for stage. The method of staging proved to be a reliable predictor of survival whether used at diagnosis or during the course of the disease. The proposed staging system was an equally accurate indicator for survival when applied to two other previously published studies of large series of patients",,,,,,,

In all tissues examined, dihydroxyacetone phosphate entered phosphatidate more rapidly via acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate than via glycerol phosphate. Tissues with a relatively low rate of phosphatidate synthesis via glycerol phosphate, showed no compensating increase in the rate of synthesis via acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The rates at which tissue homogenates synthesize phosphatidate from dihydroxyacetone phosphate via glycerol phosphate increase as glycerol phosphate dehydrongenase increase. Both glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol phosphate: acyl CoA acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15) are more active than dihydroxyacetone phosphate : acyl CoA acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.42).

Central to the question of whether small radiation exposures are carcinogenic is the effect of antenatal radiography. A comparison of singleton and twin births with radiography rates of 10 and 55 per cent respectively showed that radiography must be the main cause of the elevated frequency of malignant disease. In Japanese bomb survivors, most radiation-induced cancer has been found in those irradiated in adult life, less in those irradiated in childhood and adolescence, and least for exposure in utero. Specific biological differences between different kinds of malignant disease in their induction by ionizing radiation are becoming increasingly evident. When dose-response relationships for observed cancer frequencies are to be used as evidence about dose-response relationships for cancer induction, it will always be necessary to allow for the concomitant cell sterilization. When this is done, there is little support for linearity as the method of extrapolation when making predictions about possible effects of low doses but the absence of threshold seems scientifically inescapable. In cellular terms, radiation induction of cancer must be a very rare phenomenon, so rare compared with cell sterilization or mutation induction, that the general corpus of radiobiological understanding may be inapplicable.",,,,,,,

With the exception of minor differences in activities with certain DNA templates, the significance of which is not clear, no qualitative differences in the enzymes from these two sources were found, but an increase in the specific activity of the alpha-amanitin sensitive enzyme, RNA polymerase II, was found in the leukemic spleen.

Of the stimulated protein products only those synthesized in response to added RLV RNA were immune-precipitable with anti-RLV rabbit serum. Furthermore, cell-free incubations with pactamycin at a concentration which specifically inhibits initiation and not elongation prevented the stimulation of amino acid incorporation in response to added RLV RNA. Analysis of the polypeptides synthesized by the cell-free system in response to reticulocyte A-rich RNA, showed them to be globin-like and, therefore, also mRNA specific. The RLV RNA-directed product included at least two classes of polypeptides (mol. wts of 140 000-185 000 and 50 000-75 000) both of which were larger than the group specific polypeptides of mature virions. None of the internal structural polypeptides of mature virions were synthesized in response to RLV RNA.

Forty-seven per cent had clinical and cytologic evidence of central nervous system involvement. Of these, 38 patients had repeated cytologic examinations of the spinal fluid and were suitable for a study of changes that occurred during the course of their disease and treatment. A total of 112 cytologyc specimens from the 38 patients over a period of 8 to 60 months was reviewed. There was accurate correlation between cytologic evidence of leukemia in the spinal fluid, clinical signs and symptoms of central nervous system disease, and autopsy evidence of meningeal leukemia, though the number of cells present did not predict the severity of clinical disease or extent of meningeal infiltrate. Almost every patient with leukemic cells in the spinal fluid had a corresponding leukemia infiltrate in the bone marrow, but not in peripheral blood. The differential diagnosis of leukemia in spinal fluid cytology is discussed and the clinical response to intrathecal chemotherapy correlated with cytologic findings. Serial cytologic observations during treatment, and the phenomenon of autonomous CNS leukemia, are discussed in terms of cell cycle physiology and chemotherapy. The results stress the usefulness of spinal fluid cytology as a screening procedure in asymptomatic patients with leukemia and are of interest in regard to the pathophysiology of leukemia of the central nervous system.",,,,,,,

An average of 5.7 times 10-9 (range 1.4 to 10.9 times 10-9) granulocytes were collected on 25 occasions with the blood cell separator compared with an average of 36.6 times 10-9 (range 20.1 to 61.3 times 10-9) obtained by filtration leukapheresis on 85 occasions. Donor platelet counts decreased following donation by an average of 29,000/mul (14%) with continuous flow centrifugation (CFC) and an average of 40,000/mul (17%) with filtration leukapheresis (FL). Estimated donor packed red blood cell loss, including blood obtained for investigative purposes, was 80 ml per donation with CFC and 67 ml per donation when FL was used. FL resulted in at least a 25 per cent increase in the granulocyte count of donors by donation completion in 61 per cent of donors, although postdonation granulocytosis did not correlate with increased cell harvest. CFC donors generally displayed a postdonation decrease in granulocyte count. Normal numbers of granulocytes were maintained in donors undergoing frequent leukapheresis and no donor's health was compromised by the removal of large numbers of granulocytes. Repeated donations were possible with both systems. Although platelet counts dropped more with FL, the procedure was performed as frequently as eight times in a ten-day period without development of severe donor thrombocytopenia. Donor red blood cell loss appears to be the limiting factor in the repeated use of either system. Blood loss could be significantly decreased under routine conditions if fewer samples were obtained for investigational purposes. Filtration leukapheresis offers the advantage of significantly greater granulocyte yields than is possible with CFC unless modifications such as arterio-venous shunts or the use of steroids and/or rouleaux-inducing agents are employed.",,,,,,,

A complete and accurate analysis of the life cycle of the red cell can be obtained with a full iron kinetic study, in conjunction with a DF32P red-cell survival study. However, a complete iron kinetic study is not always necessary. It may be abbreviated by deleting the in vitro phase of the iron kinetic procedure. The abbreviated iron kinetic study is also done in conjunction with a DF32P red-cell survival study. It can easily be performed by injecting 59Fe-labeled plasma and monitoring externally over the spleen, liver, and sacrum. Measurements of red-cell survival may be obtained with either 51Cr or DF32P. Although 51Cr provides a relatively uniform label of circulating red cells and is convenient to count in vitro, its highly variable elution rate precludes an accurate measurement of erythrocyte survival. The 51Cr method provides only a rough index of circulating red-cell half-times as a measure of red-cell survival. DF32P, HOWEVER, IS A PERMANENT LABEL OF CIRCULATING RED CELLS. It provides a direct measurement of erythrocyte survival and permits in vivo labeling of red cells simply by means of direct intravenous injection. Because it has an elution rate that is virtually zero after minimal elution on the day of injection, and because it is not reutilized, DF32P is unquestionably the best agent known for the determination of red-cell survival. In addition to these diagnostic data, the complete iron kinetic study can provide data on the deposition of iron in storage and the rate of iron storage exchange. It can also determine if erythropoiesis is quantitatively abnormal and if the abnormality is located in the bone marrow or in other organs such as the liver or spleen. Although the study of hematologic disorders is one of the most rapidly developing areas of medical research, techniques that are currently available can provide an understanding of the life cycle of the red cell and valuable data that can be applied directly to the clinical situation. When performed accurately, these studies provide a thorough analysis of the pathophysiology of the erythron and are valuable clinical tools that can be used successfully in the diagnosis and evaluation of a broad spectrum of hematological disorders.",,,,,,,

At 35 degrees it enhances the helix-coil transition of poly[d(A-T)] AND the UV-irradiated calf thymus DNA but is inefficient in ordinary native DNA. This protein also facilitates the rate of UV-endonuclease incision of UV DNA but does not induce any nicks by itself. This finding suggests that the protein may be involved in DNA repair by enhancing such activity, and also offers an explanation for our observation of increased DNA repair in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. When human metaphase chromosomes are exposed to the protein, it induces marked lengthening of chromatids suggesting that this protein may also act on complex chromosomes.

The deoxyuridine suppression test was found to detect changes in biological activity equal to 20 ng (0.044 nmole) of methotrexate and 200 ng (1.94 nmoles) of 5-fluorouracil. Hydrocortisone and prednisone, but not dexamethasone or prednisolone, decreased the methotrexate effect to one-half in both L1210 and human cells as measured by the deoxyuridine suppression test. 5-Fluorouracil biological activity was not affected by any steroid studied. Vincristine produced variable results, but on the average it decreased the methotrexate effect in human marrow. Vincristine consistently decreased the methotrexate effect in L1210 systems. Cephalosporin, 75 mug/ml (0.214 mumole), had no effect. In parallel studies, hydrocortisone decreased the uptake of methotrexate, but no folic acid, in human and L1210 cells. The deoxyuridine suppression test warants further investigation as a method of screening drugs for interaction with antagonists of de novo DNA synthesis.

The potentiating effects of this drug combination in vitro cannot be consistently shown if the drugs are addeded without attention to the growth rate of the cultured population. If the cultured cells have achieved maximum density and have remained at this density for more than 24hr, they are readily killed by vincristine alone and no further kill is achieved by adding prednisolone. Rapidly growing cell cultures, however, are relatively ristant to vincristine. The addition of prednisolone to such cultures restores their sensitivity to vincriestine, but the combination is no more effective than is vincristine alone in stable cell populations.

A readily discernible quantitative difference in the agglutinability of 2, 4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-tagged versus untagged cells was seen at all concentrations of Con A in the range of 12.5 800 mug/ml. The reaction was maximal at 24 degrees C, somewhat diminished at 37 degrees C, and minimal at 4 degrees C. The agglutination of DNP-tagged leukocytes by 50 mug Con A/ml was completely blocked with 0.1 M methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (alpha-MG), but as low a concentration as 0.001 M alpha-MG inhibited agglutination of untagged cells. The ability of Con A to agglutinate DNP-tagged normal leukocutes may be attributed to a lowering of the zeta potential, a topographic rearrangement of receptor sites, or the formation of new antigenic determinants similar to those found on malignant cells. The last alternative would be consistent with the observation that DNP-tagged normal leukocytes could evoke the production of antibodies that reacted with leukemic granulocytes.",,,,,,,

Dynamic state tissue levels of ara-C and of its mono-, di-, and triphosphate (ara-CTP) were measured in L1210 leukemic cells and in C57BL x DBA/2 F1 host tissues at different times after various doses of the agent. The levels were correlated with inhibition of thymidine incorporation into DNA and with cytocidal effects as measured by loss of isotopically prelabeled DNA. ara-CTP levels, but not those of the mono- and diphosphates of ara-C, were higher in leukemic cells and in host cell renewal systems than in other host tissues. DNA synthesis was equally inhibited by similar levels of ara-CTP in ascitic L1210 cells, in leukemic infiltrates in liver, and in small intestine. However, L1210 cells accumulated higher levels of ara-CTP for longer periods than did small intestine, and correspondingly the inhibition of DNA synthesis was greater and more prolonged in leukemic cells. ara-C caused greater losses of prelabeled DNA in ascites cells and in infiltrated liver than in host small intestine. It appears that the differential net tissue level of ara-CTP and its duration are the determinants of chemotherapeutic efficacy of ara-C against L1210 leukemia. ara-C was the predominant nucleoside present in hydrolysates of ara-CTP fractions.

The lysis of the murine tumor cells EL4 and P388 by syngeneic cytotoxic lymphocytes was inhibited by antisera directed against the H-2 antigens on the tumor cells, consistent with the hypothesis that H-2 antigens are part of the target of the cytotoxic lymphocytes. Moreover, it was found that patching and capping of the H-2 antigens on EL4 cells resulted in the co-patching and co-capping of viral antigens as detected by antisera against Rauscher leukemia virus. Capping of H-2 antigens also resulted in co-capping of determinants detected by an antiserum to the viral protein gp69/71. On the basis of these and other observations, we propose the hypothesis that the H-2 molecules serve as adaptors that combine with viral antigens on the cell surface to form hybrid antigens containing elements of self (H-2) and non-self (virus). The adaptor-antigen complex may then be recognized by a subclass of thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes that possesses a repertoire of receptors directed against hybirds of foreign and H-2 antigens. This raises the possibility that other products of the major histocompatibility complex may have analogous functions.",PMC388876,,,,,,

Although RPV-infected mice showed maximum immunodpression in vivo only during the first week after infection, their spleen cells, obtained later in the course of infection, depressed the immunologic responsiveness of normal splenocytes in vitro. Increased doses of SRBC or addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide to cultures of spleen cells from immunodepressed, RPV-infected mice stimulated antibody formation, and near-normal numbers of antibody-producing cells were evident. Peritoneal exudate (PE) cells, but not thymus, bone marrow, or unfractioned spleen cells, restored immunocompetence to cultures of spleen cells from RPV-infected mice but did not affect the suppressive properties of the infected cells on normal splenocytes.

Antibody binding was studied with the use of immunofluorescence reagents and the analytic capacity of the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter-1 (FACS-1). The results indicated that most non-T-cell ALL have three leukemia-associated antigens on their surface which are absent from normal lymphoid cells: 1) an antigen shared with myelocytes, myeloblastic leukemia cells, and fetal liver (hematopoietic) cells; 2) an antigen shared with a subset of intermediate normoblasts in normal bone marrow and fetal liver; and 3) an antigen found thus far only on non-T-cell ALL and in some acute undifferentiated leukemias, which we therefore regard as a strong candidate for a leukemia-specific antigen. These antigens are absent from a subgroup of ALL patients in which the lymphoblasta express T-cell surface markers.

During the preleukemic stages of virus infection, there was slight splenomegaly without peripheral blood erythroblastosis. Granulocyte release and tissue mobilization mechanisms appeared unaffected by the RLV/a infection. Both RLV/a-infected and control mice reacted to endotoxin with peripheral granulocytosis and peritoneal granulocyte mobilization, though the circulating granulocyte levels in RLV/a-treated mice initially were lower than those in controls. Spleen of RLV/a-infected animals were larger than those of controls, but both responded to endotoxin with elevated numbers of granulocytes and erythroblasts. Since numbers of bone marrow erythroblasts in both groups of mice were decreased after endotoxin, stem cell competition and/or shunting of stem cells from marrow to spleen may have been involved. Endotoxin also induced rapid falls in hematocrit levels in both groups. These studies suggested that RLV/a-infected mice can be a model to study 1) erythropoietic dysfunction uncomplicated by defective granulopoietic release and tissue mobilization control mechanisms, and 2) progression of evolving granulocytic leukemia.",,,,,,,

The most popular clinical schedule was 15-25 mg/m2/day for 5 days repeated every 3-4 weeks. Almost all patients had extremely advanced disease. Of 323 patients in whom response could be evaluated, there were 12 complete responses, 25 partial responses (greater than 50% decrease in tumor size), and 23 improvements (greater than 50% decrease in tumor size) for a 19% overall response rate. The tumor most sensitive to cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (II) was testicular carcinoma in which seven complete responses, three partial responses, and three improvements were observed in 16 patients treated at Roswell Park Memorial Institute. Other sensitive tumors were lymphoma (63% response and improvements), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (41% response and imporvements), and ovarian carcinoma (40% response and improvements). Complete responses were also seen in one patient with thyroid carcinoma and two with bladder carcinoma, while partial remissions were recorded in two patients with breast carcinoma and one patient each with acute myelogenous leukemia, endometrial carcinoma, renal carcinoma, malignant thymoma, neuroblastoma, adenocarcinoma of the lung, and an undifferentiated tumor of unknown origin. Five major types of toxicity were encountered: gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, immunosuppressive, otologic, and renal, with the last two generally the most serious. Serial audiometry testing can generally warn of the otologic toxicity and thus prevent permanent acoustic damage. Renal toxicity, which is similar to that seen with heavy-metal poisoning, appears to be dose related, cumulative, and only partly reversible, thus, severely limiting the repeated administration of cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (II).

Leptomeningitis developed during all stages of the patients' clinical course: at time of diagnosis, during progression of systemic disease, and most importantly as the initial site of relapse within 7 mo of attaining a complete clinical remission. Patients with bone marrow involvement are at high risk for the development of leptomeningeal lymphoma. Pathologic findings suggest that entry into the leptomeninges involves extension from the medullary bone marrow cavity along perforating vessels through dura into the arachnoid space. The leptomeningeal lymphoma has been successfully controlled in all patients receiving intensive central nervous system therapy consisting of a combination of intrathecal drug administration and radiotherapy.

This binder, which previously was believed to be a single factor, has now been resolved into two distinct binding proteins. Separation of each binder was obtained by DEAE chromatography of the partially purified lysate of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. One binder has a molecular weight of 30;000-35,000, and the second binder has a molecular weight of 40,000-45,000. Both proteins bind the mono-, di-, and triglutamates of folic acid, N10-methyl-folate, dihydro-folate, and N5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Neither binder has determinants for N5-formyltetrahydrofolate or methotrexate. The preferred substrates for both binders appear to be the fully oxidized and partially reduced folates rather than the fully reduced folates. The lower-molecular-weight folate binding protein shows reversible binding with partially and fully reduced folates but irreversible binding with oxidized folates. This property suggests that this binder may have some function in the transport and storage of folate. The higher-molecular-weight folate binding protein, however, has only slight reversibility of binding with the partially and fully reduced folates, and it is therefore more difficult to postulate a physiologic function for this binding factor.",,,,,,,

The table lists the various diseases, along with whatever HL-A-antigen associations may be present, and the ranking that is based on the accumulated confidence of the associations; also, it lists the individual antigens and those disease states in which the incidence of the various antigens is increased ro decreased. The Table should expand rapidly in future years. There are a number of problems involved in this area of research: (1) There is a scarcity and lack of stability of good reagents, as well as the general difficulty of HL-A serology. (2) Many studies are retrospective on cells that may be abnormal. We have mentioned the changing sensitivity of lymphocytes to HL-A antibodies in disease. Increased sensitivity of weak antibodies present in the HL-A antisera may create the false impression of increased frequencies. (3) What control population one selects is also of the utmost importance. One method of internal control is to include in the controls related and unrelated individuals, all tests being run at the same time, employing the same reagents, and being run by the same technician. (4) In some disease states, notably Hodgkin's disease and SLE, autoantibodies present may interfere with the HL-A antisera reactions. All of this is compounded by the fact that the lymphocyte is constantly and rapidly shedding and replacing the HL-A antigens; the rate of turnover may change in patients, thus introducing an additional problem. Finally, there is a need for a standardization of statistical tools and for the reporting of both positive and negative results [133]. The concern for a significant quantity of test data and the problems of evaluating statistical data bring out many views. Boswell, in The Life of Samuel Johnson, noted: ""I recollect nothing passed this day except Johnson's quickness, who, when Dr. Beattie observed, as something remarkable which happened to him, that he had chanced to see both No. 1 and No. 1000 of the hackney-coaches. The first and the last, 'Why Sir' (said Johnson) 'there is an equal chance for one's seeing those two numbers as any other two.'"" A partial solution to these problems may be offered by the evaluation of the LD antigens [49, 63, 64]. In any event, HL-A typing offers an unique opportunity for the grouping of related diseases, as similar clinical findings with related distributions of HL-A antigens may indicate disease relationships not previously considered [27].",,,,162,,,

Potent nonspecific immunostimulants, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and Corynebacterium parvum, exhibit an antitumor activity in experimental animals, which is commonly manifested by reduced tumor growth and sometimes by complete regression of tumors. Antitumor effectiveness of these bacteria is largely related to tumor immunogenicity and host immunocompetence.

Some cardiac alterations were similar to those that occur in patients with hematologic and neoplastic diseases not treated with bone marrow transplantation, and consisted of cardiomegaly, cardiac atrophy, hemorrhage, foci of necrosis due to shock associated with sepsis or hepatic failure, myocardial abscesses secondary to systemic candidiasis or staphylococcal infection, fibrinous pericarditis, and hemosiderosis. Other cardiac alterations were more specifically related to factors associated with transplantation procedure. Six patients exhibited a distinctive interstitial reactive change characterized by the presence of (1) moderate to large numbers of Anitschkow cells, occurring alone or in small cellular aggregates and histiocytes, histiocytic cells with nuclei of the Anitschkow type, lymphoid cells, and plasma cells, and (2) nuclei of the Anitschkow type in cardiac vascular and endocardial smooth muscle, endothelial and Schwann cells, and occasional cardiac muscle cells. This alteration may have been induced by abnormal immune mechanisms, as suggested by the observation that five of the six patients with interstitial change had clinical evidence of graft-versus-host disease. Two patients developed fatal congestive cardiac failure in the early post-transplant period and exhibited myocardial damage with histologic and post-transplant period features indicative of severe acute injury. Findings in these two patients consisted of necrotic muscle cells, which exhibited multiple contraction bands, diastase-resistant PAS staining, and intracellular fibrin deposits; microthrombi, which were composed of fibrin and occasionally of fibrin and platelets; and extravasated erythrocytes and fibrin strands in the interstitium. One of the two patients also exhibited unusual nuclear alterations, which were characterized by replacement of normal chromatin by palely stained fibrous and filamentous material. Clinicopathologic analysis strongly suggested that the fatal cardiotoxicity in both patients resulted primarily from effects of high doses of cyclophosphamide, which were administered as part of a four drug regimen that provided tumor ablation and immunosuppression for bone marrow transplantation. Our findings emphasize the need for less toxic antineoplastic and immunosuppressive therapy for use in bone marrow transplantation procedures.",,,,,,,

In analogy with the petite mutant of certain strains of yeast, animal cells may be transformed by treatment with dyes that alter the structure of their mitochondrial DNA, so that their mitochondria also become deficient in enzymes of the respiratory chain. Whether nutritional or other deficiencies are mutagenic with respect to mitochondrial DNA of animal cells is not known; nor is it known whether mitochondrial mutagenesis is causally involved in carcinogenesis. New knowledge of cytoplasmic genetics and of mitochondrial DNA and membrane structure and dynamics should encourage investigations aimed at examining the possible role of mitochondrial genes in neoplastic transformation.",,,,37,,,

TNF-positive serum is as effective as endotoxin itself in causing necrosis of the sarcoma Meth A and other transplanted tumors. A variety of tests indicate that TNF is not residual endotoxin, but a factor released from host cells, probably macrophages, by endotoxin. Corynebacteria and Zymosan, which like BCG induce hyperplasia of the reticulo-endothelial system, can substitute for BCG in priming mice for release of TNF by endotoxin. TNF is toxic in vitro for two neoplastic cell lines; it is not toxic for mouse embryo cultures. We propose that TNF mediates endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis, and that it may be responsible for the suppression of transformed cells by activated macrophages.",PMC433057,,,,,,

Estimation of immunosuppression, in order to define cancer therapy schedules providing least interference with what might be useful host response to tumour, is described in terms of a reliable radioimmunoassay method assessing lymphocyte replicating ability (LRA). The extent of the effect of radiation or radiomimetic drugs in vitro can be shown upon LRA in response to phytohaemagglutinin or to irradiated cells. In clinical research LRA assessment makes a satisfactory test of the general immune state of patients undergoing cancer treatments, given that matched control subjects are available throughout the period of observation to allow repeated assessment of the relative response. An assured relative response seems feasible if all examinations are related to a common standard, the stored reference lymphocyte. Conversely a relative response can be measured against stored target cells.",,,,,,,

Particular emphasis is given to screening analogues of known active drugs including the approaches in chemical synthesis and tests of experimental tumor activity, as well as the questions that determine clinical interest and capabilities for human trials. In the area of combinations of two or more drugs, the need for experimental systems providing data for rational design of clinical regimens is highlighted. Means for experimental evaluation of the major variables of dose ratio, dose schedule and sequence of drug administration are considered. Finally, the overall problems of drug screening are discussed within the context of combining drugs with other treatment modalities, such as surgery, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. The complexities of designing better cancer treatment will require close interaction between experimental and clinical studies.",,,,,,,

Forty-one children had diffuse, undifferentiated, non-Burkitt lymphoma (lymphoblastic lymphoma). They tended to be boys under 10 years of age and their median survival was 1 year. Almost one-third are surviving for 1-11 years, most in initial complete remission. Nineteen children had diffuse, poorly differentiated, histiocytic lymphoma. They tended to be boys more than 10 years of age, their median survival was only 6 months, and only the 3 patients with Stage I peripheral node tumour survived. Two children had nodular, lymphocytic, poorly differentiated lymphoma and 2 had lymphoma resembling the Burkitt type. From our clinical and pathological observations, we conclude that non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphomata in children cannot be separated from the acute lymphocytic, histiocytic and unclassified leukaemias by cytological or histological methods. What is called diffuse, undifferentiated, non-Burkitt type, or lymphoblastic lymphoma is actually acute lymphocytic leukaemia without apparent invasion of marrow and peripheral blood by neoplastic lymphocytes at time of diagnosis. What is termed diffuse, histiocytic lymphoma is acute histiocytic leukaemia without apparent infiltration of marrow and peripheral blood at initial presentation. One could say just as well that acute lymphocytic leukaemia is Stage IV lymphoblastic lymphoma and that acute histiocytic leukaemia is Stage IV histiocytic lymphoma. Further classification of lymphocytic and histiocytic cancers by newer functional, chemical and morphological methods should include both what is called lymphocytic or histiocytic leukaemia and what is called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as one group of diseases, susceptible to subclassification by the new methods. We recommend that Stage I lymphocytic and histiocytic cancers be treated with local irradiation. Patients with Stages II-IV tumours should receive anti-leukaemic forms of therapy including prolonged multiple agent chemotherapy and preventive central nervous system irradiation. Staging laparotomy should be considered in patients with Stage I tumour in low cervical, axillary and inguinal nodes.",PMC2149589,,,,,,

This functional classification contains 5 major groups: (a) U cell or undefined for those proliferations without specific markers; (b) T cell; (c) B cell; (d) histiocytes as macrophages; (e) unclassifiable for those technically insufficient for specific cytological classification. Retrospective study of several case populations indicates that the majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphomata exhibit features of follicular centre cell (FCC) lymphomata of either cleaved or non-cleaved types. The prognostically favourable status of nodular lymphomata seems to result from the retained capability of follicle formation by FCC types with limited abnormality. Lymphomata of large cell types previously classified as histiocytic lymphoma or reticulum cell sarcoma predominantly resemble transformed lymphocytes and rarely exhibit features of histiocytes as macrophages. They are designated ""immunoblastic sarcoma"" when they occur as large transformed lymphocytes and may have either T or B cell immunological markers. Immunoblastic sarcoma has been observed to develop in individuals with chronic abnormal immune states, Sjogren's syndrome, alpha chain disease, in patients on immunosuppression therapy for graft rejection and in senescence. There is accumulating evidence of lymphomata of T cells but none are firmly established. These include Sezary's syndrome, mycosis fungoides and the convoluted lymphocyte type, prev-ously included designated as acute lymphocytic leukaemia with mediatinal mass. The results of initial functional studies provide support for the proposed classification and indicate that the modern pathological investigative approach requires the collection of fresh lymphomatous tissue and an integrated immunocytochemical and morphological approach for the precise characterization of human lymphoma cell types.",PMC2149570,,,,,,

The data show that about 20% of nude mouse spleen lymphocytes are definitely of T lineage (Ig-thetaBr+). On these cells, the detection of the ""thetaBr"" determinant, which is identical or very close to the ""theta"" determinant, depends on the large amplification produced by indirect immunofluorescence, which suggests a low density of theta antigen. Similar experiments suggest the presence of cells that express some TL antigen in the spleen of nudes made congenic to a TL+ strain (BALB/c).

Normal and leukemic lymphoid populations were therefore examined to determine if the formation of spontaneous E rosettes correlated with the presence of thymus-associated cell surface antigens. Lymphoblasts from four of 12 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) formed spontaneous E rosettes at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C (E+) and bound rabbit antihuman thymocyte serum, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and by an indirect radiolabeled antibody assay. The blasts from the other eight children did not form E rosettes at 4 or 37 degrees C (E-) and did not bind antithymocyte serum. Absorption of the antiserum with peripheral blood leukocytes removed all detectable reactivity with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, normal bone marrow cells, and E- bone marrow cells, but did not remove all reactivity with thymus cells or E+ leukemic blasts. Absorption of the antiserum with thymus from one donor removed all reactivity against thymus cells from another donor.

There are considerable technical difficulties, however, in adapting enzyme histochemical techniques to the study of haemopoietic tissue since individual cells are readily disrupted during processing, show variable enzyme activity according to the stage of maturation, and possess a lipoprotein cytoplasmic membrane which hinders reagent penetration. Cytochemical techniques for the study of oxido-reductase systems are of importance in the study of the neutrophil in infected patients, the erythrocyte in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the primitive blast cell in acute leukaemia. Lysosomal enzymes are of importance in the study of the neutrophil in infected patients and in the differential diagnosis of acute leukaemia. Some examples of recent studies of these enzyme systems are given to illustrate technical procedures involving cytocentrifugation of cells on to glass slides, adjustment of the osmolality of the reaction mixture, and the study of smeared cells as opposed to cells incubated in suspension.",,,,93,,,

Leukemia L1210 has been generally the most successful screening tool for clinically active compounds. Leukemia P388, however, seems to be better in detecting active antibiotics and natural products and P1534 is particularly sensitive to the Vinca alkaloids, while L5178Y, EARAD, and 6C3HED are useful in detecting the activities of various asparaginase containing fractions. Cell cultures of these leukemias can demonstrate mechanism of drug action and quantitate resistance. Spontaneous AKR leukemia is a model of the advanced human disease. In these leukemias vincristine and prednisone produce a 4 log cell kill. Cytoxan and arabinosyl cytosine (Ara-C) are also effective. On the other hand drugs such as mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate which are highly active in the maintenance phase of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and in L1210 have little or no activity against the AKR spontaneous system. Mouse leukemias can also detect schedule dependence, synergistic combinations, cross resistance, oral activity, and the ability of drugs to pass the blood brain barrier. A case in point is the Ara-C analog 2,2'-anhydro-arabinofuranosyl-5-fluorocytosine (AAFC) which is not schedule dependent, is active orally, is potentiated by thioguanine, and is effective against intracerebrally inoculated mouse leukemia. AAFC and its analogs might thus be a considerable improvement over Ara-C which is at the present time the most important component of the combination treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).",,,,45,,,

Similar growth in total cell numbers was observed in both groups of hosts, and no significant difference could be detected between them. In an attempt to exclude the possibility that an inhibitor either did not penetrate to the peritoneum or was inactivated by the chamber membrane, normal serum, or serum from a highly leukemic rat was mixed with the bone marrow cell suspension in the chambers. Again, no difference in growth between the 2 groups could be detected.

However, the nature of the different types of Hodgkin lymphomas needs further consideration. On the other hand, today we are as far from agreement on non-Hodgkin lymphomas as ever before. Earlier European and American classifications have now to be reconsidered in the light of modern concepts of experimental immunology. It has become necessary to apply immunochemical and immunomorphological methods in addition to histological, histochemical, cytological, and ultrastructural techniques. Only such a complex approach has been able to provide new insight into the functional properties of the tumor cells. The result was a new lymphoma classification, which conforms to LUKES' concept in many respects. It was fundamentally accepted by a group of European lymphoma experts and has been condensed and modified in order to be applicable by as many lymphoma centers as possible. It has received the name ""Kiel Classification"" 1974. The main principles of the classification are as follows: 1. A distinction is made between malignant lymphomas of low-grade and those of high-grade malignancy; ""-cytic"", ""-blastic"" m.l. 2. The terms ""sarcoma"" and ""leukemia"" are avoided. All types of malignant lymphoma can be leukemic, however with differnt frequencies. All B-cell lymphomas can also show a monoclonal immunoglobulin increase (""paraproteinemia"") in the blood, mostly of IgM. So-called macroglobulinemia of Waldenstrom is therefore not itself an etity, but instead a clinical syndrome. It has been shown that so-called reticulosarcoma is derived from immunoblasts, not from reticulum cells or histiocytes. The group of reticuloses also needs reconsideration. The term ""reticulosis"" is cytologically incorrect in most cases. Otherwise it refers to a group of diseases which we do not yet understand.",,,,,,,

In acute lymphatic leukaemia, 57 out of 168 patients treated in this way remained in primary remission for 18 months to 10 years after active immunotherapy was begun, the relapse rate became low after 18 months and nil after 36 months. The results varied according to prognostic factors: the cytological type, active immunotherapy being above all effective in small cell (microlymphoblastic and prolymphocytic) types with a hope of cure in 50 to 60 p.cent of cases; malignant cellular volume; meningeal deposits. In microlymphoblastic forms the possibility of survival at the 5th year is greater than 90 p.cent. After relapse during active immunotherapy sensitivity to chemotherapy does not seem to be diminished. Trials of active immunotherapy in acute myeloid leukaemia are worthy of further pursuit. The results of active immunotherapy in leukaemic lymphosarcoma show that immunotherapy may be effective in preventing local recurrence, both of tumour as well as in the marrow. Four patients are in apparently complete remission for more than four years. On the basis of these results, trials of active immunotherapy for ""residual disease"" should be undertaken in the field of cancerology, going beyond the realm of leukaemias.",,Immunotherapie active des leucemies aigues et des lymphosarcomes leucemiques.

Following seven daily injections of RAMB serum, the splenic plaque-forming cell (PFC) response to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) and the percentage of theta-bearing lymphocytes in the spleen were significantly decreased in the C3H and the preleukaemic AKR mice. Decreases in thymic weight and thymocyte numbers were also apparent. Determinations of theta antigen density using in vitro cytoxicity tests indicated that splenic and thymic T lymphocytes (thymus-derived) remaining in the RAMB-treated C3H and preleukemic AKR mice consisted primarily of cells bearing less of the theta surface antigen. Histopathological studies of tissues from these two treated groups revealed cortical lymphocyte depletion in the thymus, and marginal and periarteriolar depletion in the spleen. Leukaemic AKR mice, administered seven injections of RAMB serum, demonstrated less dramatic changes in thymus weight, histopathology and theta-bearing cell percentages when compared with the data from the preleukaemic AKR or matureC3H mice. The results from testing overtly luekaemic AKR mice administered RAMB serum for the 7 or 9 days did not demonstrate differences from findings from groupsof overtly leukaemic control mice. These data indicate that the in vivo activity of RAMB serum in C3H mice and preleukaemic AKR mice is directed primarily toward the less mature T-lymphocyte population.

However, to arrive at some estimate of radiation risk, a conservative approach has been taken, and a linear extrapolation of radiation effects from high doses to low doses has been made. Thus, it is assumed that any exposure to radiation carries some risk of somatic or genetic damage and that there is no threshold or safe dose. In medical practice, diagnostic radiological procedures should be performed only if useful clinical information will be derived. In addition, this information should be obtained at the least possible risk to the patient. For mass chest X-rays, mammography, and lung scans, a quantitative determination of benefit to risk is developed. This approach, though possible desirable, is exceedingly difficult to establish for most diagnostic radiological procedures. Thus, good clinical judgement should be employed in radiological practice, just as it should be employed in all aspects of medical practice.",,,,56,,,

This thesis was contradicted (1) by size distributions of age-homogeneous, newly-born cell populations which were lognormal with increased (instead of decreased) dispersion of volumes and (2) by the macrothrombocytosis found in some populations with normal age distribution. For these reasons, thrombocytopoiesis appeared to play the major role in determining platelet size. A model was built in which the volume variation of platelet territories due to megakaryocyte growth and membrane demarcation at each step of maturation was a random proportion of the previous value of the volume. This model explains the lognormal shape of both newborn and circulating platelet size distributions. It also implies that (1) the mean and standard deviation of platelet logvolumes depend on the rates of volume change of the individual platelet territories (growth rate minus demarcation rate) as well as on megakaryocyte maturation time; (2) platelet hyperdestruction causes an increase in the mean and dispersion of the rates of territory volume change; (3) Mediterranean macrothrombocytosis and some hereditary macrothrombocytotic thrombocytopenias or dysthrombocytopoieses reflect a diminished rate of territory demarcation, and (4) platelet size heterogeneity is caused mainly by the variations in territory growth and demarcation and not by aging in the circulation.",,,,,,,

Two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia of 8 and 9 years duration had a terminal illness characterized by weight loss, persistent fever, lymphadenopathy, and dysglobulinemia. In both cases autopsy revealed a pleomorphic histiocytic lymphoma which contained multinucleate tumor cells and was associated with persistent chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These two cases are examples of Richter's syndrome, a clinically distinct complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia that may be confused pathologically with Hodgkin's disease.

Friend leukemia virus induces a prompt, marked depression of the immune response of mice to antigens such as sheep erythrocytes and E. coli LPS. A functioning T- and B-lymphocyte system is necessary for the response to the SRBC's whereas E. coli LPS, a T cell-independent antigen, stimulates B cells alone. Although the responses to both classes of antigen were markedly depressed in FLV-infected mice, the major defect appeared to be impairment of B-cell function, at least early in the course of infection. In order to examine in more detail the mechanism of interaction between FLV and lymphoid cells with Ig surface receptors, presumably B cells, immmunofluorescent analyses were performed with spleen, and lymph node cells from FLV-infected mice. Within a few days after infection there was a marked decrease in the percentage of spleen cells with Ig surface molecules, although the absolute number of these cells was either unchanged or increased due to marked splenomegaly caused by the virus. A marked decrease in the percentage of splenocytes with theta antigen, considered a marker for mature T cells, also was evident in infected mice. The number of spleen cells showing evidence of FLV infection (i.e., positive for FLV-associated antigens) increased rapidly during the first few days after infection, and within 2 to 2 1/2 weeks nearly all of the nucleated splenocytes were positive for the tumor antigen. In contrast to the results for spleen cells, there were increases rather than decreases in the percentages of Ig-positive and theta-positive cells in the lymph nodes after infection. The number of lymph-node cells that showed the presence of FLV antigen was much lower than in the spleen, and their appearance was also much slower as the leukemic process progressed. Despite these differences between spleen and lymph-node cells in terms of relative percentages of Ig- and theta-positive lymphocytes, relatively similar depressions were evident for the percentages of lymphoid cells that could redistribute their surface Ig receptors into polar caps when incubated with anti-Ig serum at 37 C. Marked impairment of the Ig-capping responses for both spleen and lymph-node cells paralleled the course of infection and development of immunosuppression. These observations indicate that murine leukemia virus infection can both alter the responsiveness of immunocompetent cells to T-dependent and independent antigens and depress the number and normal functional activity of these cells, as reflected by altered surface Ig receptors and antigens.",,,,27,,,

Early grafting is a more conservative course in terms of predictable patient recovery than watchful waiting. The most important aspects of this treatment are immediate grafting and sufficient immobilization of the graft by the dressing.,,,,,,,

Similarly, white blood cell ribonuclease activity was elevated in mice of the strains AKR, C2H/He, PL and RF.

The reticulocyte is considerably more sensitive to Pb2+ than are leukemic leukocytes, HeLa cells or bacteria. In fact, protein synthesis in leukemic leukocytes is actually stimulated by Pb2+. The synthesis of non-heme protein as well as hemoglobin is inhibited by Pb2+ in reticulocytes and the synthesis of alpha chains is inhibited to a greater degree tcids into reticulocytes. All of these observations are consistent with the biosynthesis of heme rather than any of the steps in protein biosynthesis being the locus for inhibition of hemoglobin synthesis by low levels of plumbous ion. Also, there is marked biological variations in the susceptibilities of reticulocytes from different rabbits to Pb2+.",,,,,,,

An analysis of the relative immunogenicity of various admixtures of x-irradiated (XIb) and viable Ib cells (VIb) after i.p. injection showed that the ratio had to be approximately 100:1 to be immunogenic. Viable Ib cells contained in immunogenic mixtures multiplied in vivo at a logarithmic rate up to 5 or 6 days but were eliminated immunologically by 8 or 9 days. Adoptive cell transfer techniques were used to quantify the protective effect of immune spleen cells (ISC). Essentially a constant dose of ISC (10-6.4) protected mice against a challenge dose of 10-2 to 10-5 VIb cells; more than 10-5 VIb cells were lethal. Two techniques were used to quantify immunity even though mice ultimately died of transplanted leukemia, viz., mean survival time (MST) with a fixed challenge dose of VI b cells, or MST with a fixed time for death. The sensitivity and statistical limitations of these assays are presented. To amplify the sensitivity of assays for adoptive cellular immunity a technique of antigenic stimulation was used, viz., 1 day after x-irradiated mice (600 R) received an i.p. injection of normal or immune spleen, bone marrow or thymic cells they received an i.p. injection of XIb cells containing an admixture of VIb cells. The technique amplified the sensitivity of ISC transfer tests approximately 100-fold and made it possible to detect protective effects of bone marrow and thymic cell populations.",,,,,,,

Cells treated with HTLA were examined for their ability to react in a mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) and to form killer cells in a cell-mediated lymphocytotoxicity (CML) system. Sensitized cells were also examined for their ability to respond to purified protein derivative (PPD) by blastogenesis, migration inhibitory factor release (MIP), and lymphotoxin (LT) production, both before and after treatment with HTLA and complement. The HTLA was in itself highly stimulatory to PBL. However, with the addition of complement and subsequent cell destruction, a marked decrease in its stimulatory response was noted. PBL treated with HTLA and complement exhibited marked inhibition of responsiveness to con-A with little decrease in PHA-P -OR PWM stimulation except at very high concentration of HTLA. MLC reaction was inhibited only when responder cells were treated with HTLA + C'. Treatment of stimulator cells with HTLA + C' did not significantly alter the MLC response. The HTLA + C'-treated cells failed to form killer cells in the CML reaction and inhibited PPD-induced blasto-genesis from PPD-sensitized individuals; however, treatment of sensitized cells with HTLA + C' had little effects on the release of MIF and LT. It is suggested that subpopulations of T-cells carry surface antigens that bind with this specific antisera, and that the con-A-responsive cells, the responder cells in the MLC, and killer T-cells comprise a separate subset from cells responding to PHA-P or PWM, OR THE MIF-and LT-producing cells.",PMC301841,,,,,,

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is most often a disease of accumulating B cells so that T lymphocytes are diluted by large numbers of leukaemic cells. Direct comparison with the responses of normal lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation is therefore suspect. To circumvent this difficulty, a method of isolating T cells from normal individuals and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was developed. Lymphocytes containing an average of 16.1 per cent B cells from normal individuals were applied to IgG-anti-IgG-coated Degalan bead columns and held at 4 degrees for 2 hours. The eluted cells contained less than 2 per cent B cells. When chronic lymphocytic leukaemic lymphocytes, containing an average of 68.6 per cent B cells, were applied to IgG-anti-IgG columns, the eluted cells contained 36.4 per cent B cells. To improve the purification of T lymphocytes, columns of uncoated Degalan beads were used to remove non-specifically adherent cells. Eluted lymphocytes were then applied to IgG-anti-IgG columns. This resulted in the recovery of purified populations of T cells with less than 2 per cent contamination with B cells. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were found to have lymphocytes with either a normal density or a low density of surface immunoglobulins. B cells were successfully removed from lymphocyte suspensions in all cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with a normal density of lymphocyte surface immunoglobulins. In the three cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with low density surface immunoglobulins, separation by this method was unsuccessful.

Antipyretic effects were also seen in some patients with reticulum cell sarcoma, lymphosarcoma, acute leukemia, histiocytic medullary reticulosis, plasma cell myeloma, carcinoma of the lung, and carcinoma of the cervix. The drug failed to produce defervescence in four patients with normal granulocyte reserves, who were febrile due to bacterial infection. When infused at a rate of 0.2 mg/kg/hr, the drug apparently caused an acute alteration of protein metabolism in man in that plasma amino acid nitrogen rose acutely while plasma levels of muramidase and ribonuclease fell during the period of the infusion. The data suggest that continuing synthesis of protein may be involved in nonbacterial fever of neoplastic disease. Mammalian granulocytes and monocytes are known to elaborate a pyrogenic protein following appropriate stimulation; it is suggested that in some types of neoplastic disease, particularly Hodgkin's disease, tumor cells may produce and release a pyrogenic protein and that drug-induced inhibition of its synthesis is responsible for the observed lysis of fever.",,,,,,,

The syndrome was accompanied by pleocytosis with lymphocytes, monocytoid cells, and neutrophils. There was evidence of cumulative Mtx toxicity, since the toxic syndrome occurred mostly after the third and fourth dose and did not recur with longer intervals between doses. The incidence of the syndrome was significantly reduced by the use of Elliott's B solution as Mtx diluent, rather than water or normal saline. The occurrence of pleocytosis and toxic clinical syndrome was also significantly reduced in patients receiving concomitant cranial radiation, probably due to the lympholytic action of radiotherapy and the depressed cellular response of irradiated tissues.

Lymphoid cells from strain 2 and strain 13 guinea pigs were surface labeled with 125I by the lactoperoxidase technique. Nonidet P-40 extracts of these labeled cells were precipitated by sandwiches of strain 2 antistrain 13, strain 13 antistrain 2, or outbred anti-B antisera, followed by rabbit antiguinea pig immunoglobulin antisera. Precipitates were dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive peaks representing the 2 and B-cell membrane antigens were obtained from strain 2 lymph node cells, as well as from a B-lymphoid cell population (L2C leukemia cells) and a T-lymphocyte population (STRAIN 2 PERITONEAL EXUDATE LYMPHOCYTES [PELs]). Radioactive peaks representing the 13 and B-cell membrane antigens were obtained from strain 13 lymph node cells and strain 13 PELs. All anti-B precipitates produced two peaks when electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide gels; one representing an antigen with a mol wt of approximately 45,000, and one representing an antigen with a mol wt of about 12,000. Both may be components of a single protein. All anti-2 and anti-13 precipitates produced a single peak when electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide gels. Both the 2 and 13 antigens were found by this technique to have mol wt of approximately 25,000.

Antibody was detected at 14 days following virus infection by MF. In mice that developed primary tumors which regressed, MF titers developed to high levels following a period between 2 and 4 weeks post-innoculation during which the titers remained at low and constant levels. The increase in MF titers corresponded closely on a temporal basis to the initiation of the regression process. In contrast, antibody remained at low levels in those mice that developed progressively growing tumors. ADNLC was detected in the sera of regressor mice approximately 6 weeks post-inoculation but was not detectable at any of the time interavals in sera from mice with progressively growing tumors. Attempts to enhance the cytotoxic activity of normal spleen cells directly with immune serum were unsuccessful.

Four days following the last injection, sera and lymphocytes were collected and tested in vitro for activity against either allospecific antigens (H-2d target cells) or viral-specific antigens, namely, Moloney leukemia virus (MLV). Both groups of animals developed measurable cellular and humoral immunity to the virally determined antigens. However, only the animals in Group i, immunized with irradiated cells, developed detectable immunity to H-2d. Immune and control lymphocytes were tested in microcytotoxicity tests and by 51Cr release. Antibody was assessed by complement-dependent cytotoxicity, indirect membrane immunofluorescence, virus neutralization, and antibody-dependent lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Group I serum, which had both anti-MLV and anti-H-2 antibodies, was absorbed with either living or formaldehyde-fixed YAC cells. The living cells were able to remove both H-2 and MLV antibodies. On the other hand, the formaldehyde-fixed cells removed no H-2 antibody but were able to remove MLV antibody, although less efficiently than living cells.

Five days later spleen cells from the immunized mice were tested for the presence of plaque-forming cells using the immunizing lymphoma cell lines as target. Sera collected from the animals were examined for cytolytic antibody activity by lysis in gel using the same target cells. For comparison, the H-2 immunogenicity of L1210 and its sublines was investigated in H-2-incompatible allogeneic mice. The following results were obtained. (a) All the sublines showed increased immunogenicity and susceptibility to lysis as compared to L1210 cells. The number of plaque-forming cells/spleen ranged from 100 for L1210 to 4450 for L1210/GZL, the most immunogenic subline, and the antibody titer ranged from 1/8 for L1210 to 1/128 for L1210/GZL. (b) All the sublines carried common tumor-associated antigens that apparently made primary contributions to the increased immunogenicity. (c) The common tumor-associated antigens were also expressed on L1210 cells, although in a lesser defree, as evidenced by the definite, albeit low, capacity of L1210 cells to absorb DBA/2J anti-L1210/GZL antibodies. (d) Spleen and thymus cells of DBA/2J mice as well as unrelated murine ascites tumor cells did not cause significant absorption of these antibodies. (e) Only a partial inverse relationship could be demonstrated between tumor-associated antigens but the lowest for H-2. The above results would seem compatible with the hypothesis that the increased immunogenicity of drug-resistant L1210 sublines is attributable to the selection of preexisting highly immunogenic cells during immunosuppression by treatments selecting for drug resistance.",,,,,,,

In 3 of the 82 patients with acute myelocytic leukemia and Hodgkin's disease, the two diseases occurred simultaneously. Of the remaining 79 patients, 76 had received radiation therapy for their Hodgkin's disease and acute myelocytic leukemia had developed 1.2 to 19 years later (mean 6.5 years). Thirty-four of these patients also received antineoplastic chemotherapy. Only three patients with Hodgkin's disease were treated with multiple chemotherapy alone; in these, Hodgkin's disease developed 1.2, 1.5 and 3.2 years later.

Three of the 7 patients also received alkylating agents. It is concluded that the development of acute leukemia, mostly acute myelocytic leukemia but also acute lymphocytic leukemia, during the course of Hodgkin's disease, is most likely related to radiation therapy. There is as yet insufficient evidence to implicate intensive chemotherapy in the causation of acute leukemia since in only three patients with Hodgkin's disease treated with chemotherapy alone has the development of acute leukemia been reported. It is possible, however, that chemotherapy potentiates the effect of radiotherapy. 2t is also possible that acute leukemia is part of the natural history of Hodgkin's disease and is occurring with greater frequency because of improved survival in Hodgkin's disease since the introduction of better radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic treatment regimens.",,,,151,,,

Normal and inflammatory lymph nodes were composed predominantly of T lymphocytes, as were nodes from 14 patients with Hodgkin's disease. Two thymomas were T cell proliferations, whereas a node from a patient with ataxia-telangiectasia was devoid of T lymphocytes.

In immunoglobulin-positive tumors, one predominant heavy chain and one predominant light chain could usually be identified, thus establishing the clonal character of the neoplastic proliferation. Ten of 11 diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas were composed of cells with large amounts of surface immunoglobulin, whereas only 1 of 5 diffuse well differentiated lymphocytic tumors contained such abundant surface immunoglobulin.

In 6 of them more than 50% of the bone marrow blasts formed E rosettes, while in none of the 29 were surface Ig detected. The six children with rosette-forming blasts had WBS greater than 5 times 10-4/mm-3 at admission and 4 of them presented with thymic enlargement. E-positive ALL blasts and normal human thymocytes formed rosettes after incubation for 1 hr at 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C. In contrast, normal human peripheral T lymphocytes from blood, spleen, and pleural fluid also formed rosettes at 4 degrees C but these rosettes dissociated at 37 degrees C. In two patients with E-positive ALL, the disappearance from blood of cells forming rosettes at 37 degrees C during the 1st week of treatments paralleled the reduction in circulating blasts. Conversely, after 6 days of therapy almost one-half of the remaining cells formed rosettes at 4 degrees C and had the morphologic features of normal lymphocytes. We conclude that, in contrast to peripheral T cells, normal thymic cells and E-positive blasts share the property of forming E rosettes after 1-hr incubation at 37 degrees C. In patients with E-positive ALL this property may be used to evaluate drug effects upon leukemic and normal T lymphocytes.",,,,,,,

Morphologically, the principal changes consisted of diffuse reactive astrocytosis and multiple, noninflammatory necrotic foci, often containing varying amount of mineralized cellular debris. Clinical features common to all patients with this leukoencephalopathy were: 1) cranial irradiation of 2000 rads or more and 2) methotrexate administered systemically after irradiation. Comparison of selected clinical features of patients with and without leukoencephalopathy showed that methotrexate administered intravenously after a cumulative dose of CNS irradiation of 2000 rads or more can result in degeneration of CNS white matter in patients with ALL. Age at time of irradiation, bacterial infections, nutrition, and CNS leukemia were not causally related to the development of this disease.

From three to eleven days later, the allograft reactivity of these sensitized and appropriate control mice was evaluated in the peritoneal cavity by the disappearance of injected lymphoma cells or the inhibition of DNA synthesis. For the disappearance test, target cells were labeled with [125-I]-5-ido-2'-deoxyuridine before transfer. For the inhibition test, unlabeled target cells were transferred, but these cells were subsequently exposed to the DNA precursor [125-I]-5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine. In both procedures, cells were recovered from the peritoneal cavity without killing the hosts to measure retained radioactivity. Both tests were immunogenetically specific in detecting secondary allograft reactions, but the disappearance test was less sensitive. By inhibition of DNA synthesis, it was possible to detect primary and secondary reactions, the latter three to eight days after sensitization. Alloantigens associated with the H-2K-Ir regions of Murine Linkage Group IX were more immunogenic than those associated with the Ss-H-2D-Tla regions in eliciting antilymphoma reactions, and female mice responded better than males. It was concluded that the peritoneal inhibition test is sensitive enough to monitor transplantation immunity in vivo and could be applied to animals bearing tumors in sites other than the peritoneum and undergoing chemotherapy.",,,,,,,

The characteristics of this process in human lymphocytes are less clear. This study characterizes the phenomenon of surface membrane Ig redistribution of normal and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lymphocytes with the use of fluoroscein-labeled anti-Ig sera. Normal lymphocytes underwent rapid cap formation after incubation with anti-Ig serum in the cold and subsequent rewarming. The morphology was characteristic with aggregation over the pole of the cell opposite the nucleus and over the uropod when present. The process was energy dependent but independent of protein synthesis, and could be inhibited by vincristine, vinblastine, and colchicine but not by cytochalasin B. CLL cells, on the other hand, though showing fluorescent complex aggregation on the surface, rarely demonstrated unidirectional movement of these aggregates to form a cap. Cap formation in these cells could not be stimulated by supplementing the energy source or protein concentration of the medium nor by adding glutamic acid which could partially reverse the vincristine and vinblastine inhibition of normal capping. The failure of agents which inhibit motility to inhibit capping of the normal lymphocytes suggests that active locomotion is not a direct prerequisite for capping. The results also suggest the involvement of microtubules in normal capping and the possibility that abnormal membrane structure or microtubular function could explain the failure of CLL cells to behave normally in this regard. The role of this cellular defect in the immune deficiencies exhibited by many patients with CLL, however, is not established.",PMC301720,,,,,,

Cell transfer studies indicated that the impaired responsiveness to SRBC was related to a defect in B-lymphocyte function, similar to the impairment in mice infected with untreated FLV. The mitogenic response of splenocytes from Con A-FLV mice to E. coli LPS was also depressed as was the ability of Ig-bearing spleen cells to redistribute these immunoglobulin receptors into polar caps. The impaired immune responsiveness in the Con A-FLV infected mice appeared associated with the persistent virus infection and not to neoplastic transformation generally associated with leukemogenic process.",,,,,,,

These observations led to the study of leukemic development in the NZB strain as a natural model of the experimentally adjuvant-stimulated animal. The results of such investigation would attribute the increased susceptibility of NZB mice to the possession of an enlarged population of pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells in active cell cycle. Studies with radiation chimeras have further shown that elevated endogenous spleen colony formation, the increased potential for autoimmunity, and for susceptibility to Rauscher viral leukemogenesis are all linked through the NZB hemopoietic system. It is concluded that the presence of an enlarged compartment of cyclically active stem cells may be an etiologic factor in the susceptibility to both virus-induced leukemia and the development of autoimmune disease.",,,,,,,

In DBA/1 and DBA/2 mice the appearance of leukaemia is followed by a partial remissions then by an exacerbation of the disease. The infection in C57B1/10Sn, DBA/1 and DBA/2 mice results in a significant tumour-specific immune response. Inhibition of the immune response is followed by an increased progression of leukaemia in DBA/1 and DBA/2 mice only. It is assumed that in C57B1/10Sn mice the remission of incipient leukaemia is associated with a resistance determined in the target cells, whereas in DBA/1 and DBA/2 mice the remission is due to a tumour-specific immune response. As in animals treated with anti-lymphocyte and anti-thymocyte serum the course of the disease runs proportionally to the degree of the inhibition of the immune response, the tumour-specific antibodies play a decisive role in the elimination of the tumour cells. In Balb/c, DBA/1 and DBA/2 mouse strains failing to exhibit a spontaneous reversion of the tumour cells, the appearance of a significant tumour-specific immune response depends on the resistance against the helper component of the Rauscher virus complex.",,,,,,,

These sera were tested on a total of 212 B cells, 101 CLL cells, 76 T cells and 76 lymphoid cell lines. The data was collected and analyzed in Oxford. The analysis showed that six groups of sera could be distinguished. When these groups were compared with the D locus typing of some of the lymphoid lines which were derived from individuals used as MLC typing cells, they were seen to have significant associations with D locus antigens. The serological groups defined were therefore given numbers corresponding to the D locus numbers they associate with, i.e. UK1 is associated with DW1 and so on for UK2, 3, 4, 5 and 7. Comparison of typing techniques showed that long incubation both with antiserum and then with complement, 1 hour + 2 hours gave the best and most reproducible reactions on normal B cells.

The phenotypic abnormality in leukemia may involve an impairment in these interactions. In this report we present some of our views of leukemogenesis with respect to cell-factor interaction and the feasibility of experimental approaches to this problem. In culture, the interaction of myelogenous cells with factor(s) leading to differentiation can be measured either with a suspension mass culture method or by a solid (semi-soft) clonal method. The protein factors that support the growth of hemopoietic cells in suspension culture are termed growth stimulating factors (GSA) and in semi-solid culture, colony stimulating factors (CSA). Studies using conditioned medium prepared from phytohemagglutinin stimulated human lymphocytes (PHA-LyCM) and whole human embryo cells (WHE) revealed that GSA and CSA were not identical for growth of either normal human or leukemic leukocytes. In some cases maturation of leukemic leukocytes was observed. Fractionation of PHA-LyCM showed that there are three peaks for CSA. Each peak contains different fractions for supporting cellular proliferation, differentiation, and self-renewal of precursor cells in suspension culture.

In 174 colonies from a total of 926 colonies derived from bone marrows of leukemic patients, plasma cells and in 20 colonies, blast cells have been observed. In contrast to normal colonies, growth of colonies containing blast cells does not depend upon the conditioned medium of the leukocyte feederlayer. This investigation has demonstrated the necessity of cytological and cytochemical classification in addition to quantiative evaluation of soft agar colonies when studying the effect of factors on proliferation and differentiation of normal and leukemic stem cells.",,,,,,,

After admission the diagnosis was confirmed by the examination of periferal blood, cytologic and histologic examination of the bone marrow and after a subsequent examination of the spleen tissue. All these examinations showed the presence of typical hairy cells--tricholeucocytes in the periferal blood, bone marrow and spleen.

Marrow granulocytic colony-forming capacity was determined in 78 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, subacute myeloid leukemia, preleukemia, Di Guglielmo's syndrome, polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia. A wide range of marrow colony-forming capacity values was noted early in disease courses; however, in 26 of 33 patients decreased colony-forming capacity was associated with disease transformation into acute myeloid leukemia or other clinically aggressive stages. An increased proportion of abnormally light buoyant density (less than 1.062 g/cm3) colony-forming cells was present in the marrow and peripheral blood of 15 of 16 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, subacute myeloid leukemia, preleukemia or essential thrombocythemia; in seven of eight patients with greater than 35 per cent abnormally light colony-forming cells their disease subsequently underwent transformation. Elevated levels of urinary colony-stimulating factor output were noted in 17 of 31 patients, and in 10 of 12 patients whose disease subsequently underwent acute transformation within 10 months of study. In six of seven patients who simultaneously had an increased urinary output of colony-stimulating factor and low colony-forming capacity in marrow, transformation occurred within 10 months. These findings indicate that progressive abnormalities of both marrow clonal growth patterns and levels of possible humoral regulatory substances develop during evolution of these diseases. In contrast, patients with idiopathic sideroblastic ineffective erythropoiesis had normal values for marrow colony-forming capacity, proportion of light density colony-forming cells and urinary colony-stimulating factor output, and in none has their disease transformed into acute myeloid leukemia. These in vitro studies appear useful for clinical staging, evaluating prognosis and categorizing patients with myeloproliferative disorders.",,,,,,,

In 56 solid human tumours the macrophage content of metastatic tumours is low (less than 10%) whereas the range in primary or locally recurrent tumours is 0-30%. It is too early to say whether the low macrophage infiltrated primary will readily metastasize compared to the high macrophage containing tumour.",,,,,,,

Pa-2 was found to be active at lower concentrations than Pa-1, and PWM-G was less potent than the purified mitogens. These three mitogens all stimulated unseparated lymphocytes to secrete large quantities of Ig (20-100 mug/ml) during 7 days in culture. With increasing amounts of mitogens severe decreases in immunoglobulin synthesis were observed at day 6 even with doses which were still optimal for stimulation of thymidine uptake at days 3 and 6. With purified B cells (less than 2% T cells) Pa-1 was the best mitogen for thymidine incorporation. However, the secretory response was very variable. In some experiments B cells did not secrete Ig in response to mitogens; in others Pa-1 was clearly more effective at stimulating secretion than Pa-2 or PWM-G and in some experiments B cells were stimulated by all three. In one experiment Pa-1 stimulated prolymphocytic leukaemia cells to blast transformation and the secretion of IgM.

Two hr after methotrexate, 12 mg/kg, calcium leucovorin induced an immediate but only partial (20 to 25% of control rate) recovery of synthesis with dose dependence from 3 to 12 mg calcium leucovorin per kg. Less synthesis was induced after 96 mg/kg and almost none after methotrexate, 400 mg/kg. With calcium leucovorin, 24 mg/kg, given 2 hr after methotrexate, 12 or 96 mg/kg, a major cycle of synthesis occurred when total drug levels approached the equivalence of the dihydrofolate reductase content. The magnitude of this cycle of synthesis in both L1210 cells and small intestine was the same as that seen in animals recovering from methotrexate alone. However, this is based on the assumption that an approximately equivalent relationship between DNA synthesis and labeled doexyuridine incorporation in each tissue during the period of maximal incorporation within the cycle. The major effect of calcium leucovorin, then, was to induce an earlier resumption of DNA synthesis as a consequence of the pharmacokinetic effect in each tissue. With calcium leucovorin, 24 or 400 mg/kg, given 16 hr after methotrexate, an identical effect on drug retention was observed in both L1210 cells and small intestine. Although there was a difference in the time course for recovery in small intestine at each dosage of calcium leucovorin, the recovery of DNA synthesis as drug levels approached the dihydrofolate reductase content was similar in magnitude. In L1210 cells, however, substantial recovery of synthesis to a comparable level and with a similar time-course occurred only after leucovorin, 400 mg/kg. Little or no recovery of DNA synthesis was observed after calcium leucovorin, 24 mg/kg, during the same time period. This dosage schedule (methotrexate, 400 mg/kg, s.c...",,,,,,,

In 24 of the cases, the vast majority of circulating leukaemic cells had few microvilli. Villous cells were rarely encountered and prominent ridge-like profiles and ruffled membranes were not seen. Only six cases were studied by immunological techniques and four of the cases were of the null type while in two the cells bore detectable T-markers. It seems that ALL is almost always associated with the presence of cells with few microvilli in the peripheral circulation, differing in this respect from most cases of CLL. Although circulating leukaemic lymphocytes with few microvilli are sometimes seen in CLL, the most frequent cell type encountered is a more villous lymphocyte. Differences between leukaemic cells from patients with ALL, CLL and non-lymphoblastic leukaemias are discussed. It appears that SEM may help to distinguish lymphoblastic and nonlymphoblastic leukaemic cells in many instances and can be used as a useful adjunct to other modes of microscopy in the diagnosis of acute leukaemia.",,,,,,,

Fluorescein-labelled HP binds to subpopulations of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) treated with neuraminidase. In normal peripheral blood, HP binds to the T-lymphocytes while the majority of the B cells bearing surface-bound immunoglobulin do not have receptors for HP. In untreated CLL, HP binds to 90-100 percent of the neuraminidase-treated PBL. Almost all of the SI-G-POSITIVE CELLS IN CLL patients also have receptors for HP. Two groups of patients were found: in one the total fraction of SIg+ cells was less than or equal to 50 percent and about 30 percent of these lost their Ig during incubation at 37 degrees C. No such loss of SIg was revealed in the remaining patients where total SIg+ fraction was approximately 70 percent. These patients usually had higher blood lymphocyte counts, probably reflecting a more advanced disease. CLL patients in remission with low numbers of leukaemic cells also had low numbers of blood lymphocytes carrying both SIg and HP-receptors.

These reagents demonstrated varying patterns of expression of fetal antigens at different ages in various tissues of the human fetus. The possibility that nonneoplastic adult cells showing either maturation arrest or excessive proliferation also might express fetal antigens led to studies of human bone marrow. Although normal bone marrow cells expressed low levels of fetal antigens, large amounts were seen on bone marrow cells of patients with anemias due to iron, B12, or folic acid deficiencies, as well as on those with leukemia. Moreover, normal adult tissues adapted to long-term culture also expressed fetal antigens. After 3 weeks in organ culture adult human skin showed morphological changes similar to those seen in fetal periderm and strongly expressed fetal antigens. In addition, lymphoblasts in long-term cultured human lymphoid cell lines established from normal donors also carried surface fetal antigens. These latter antigens were shared with neoplastic B-cells (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) but not with T-cells. Their expression varied with the cell cycle. The reexpression of fetal antigens on malignant cells is thought to signal a basic derangement in the control of differentiation which is considered to be peculiar to neoplasia. However, these studies indicate that normal adult cells also may reexpress fetal antigens under circumstances unrelated to neoplasia but associated with either maturation arrest or rapid and excessive proliferation.",,,,,,,

Since chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells cap poorly when compared with normal human lymphocytes, this study was undertaken to compare the motility of these two cell types. A modification of the Boyden chamber system was employed to quantify lymphocyte motility by placing lymphocyte suspensions on 8-mum convoluted-pore nitrocellulose filters and measuring the depth of migration of the cells into the filter at 37 degrees C. After 3 hr of incubation, CLL cells migrated significantly less into the filter than normal cells. Incubation in the presence of sodium azide or at 4 degrees C abolished all motility, indicating the active nature of the process. The relative motility of individual CLL patients' cells correlated best with the proportion of abnormal cells present as determined by surface receptor assays. The possibility that decreased cell motility in CLL was a reflection of enrichment by a ""bone marrow-derived"" (B cell) population was eliminated by the finding that normal B cells purified by gradient separation of rosetted cells migrated faster than normal T cells and considerably faster than CLL cells. Motility of normal and CLL lymphocytes was decreased by cytochalasin B and increased by colchicine, vincristine, and vinblastine. Thus, human lymphocyte motility appears to be dependent on microfilament integrity but not to require the colchicine-sensitive cytoskeleton. The decreased motility of CLL cells is the result of an intrinsic cell abnormality, but this finding cannot fully explain the decreased capping, since in human lymphocytes the latter is not prevented by an inhibitor of motility.",,,,,,,

To this end, cells from cultures in an early stage of development were pulse-labeled with 3H-TdR, and their multiplication was expressed by an index of proliferation. On the basis of these data, the proportion of unlabeled blasts in the late stage of cultures was calculated in relation to the late-reacting raction to the mitogen. This fraction comprised 50-100% of blasts in late cultures (6 days). The subpopulation was not detected in only 2 of 17 cases. Its magnitude in the peripheral blood amounted to about 3% of the lymphocytes and nearly one half of the total number of lymphocytes reacting to PHA in patients with CLL. It was concluded that the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes reacting to PHA is not diminished at all in patients with leukocytosis between 11,000 and 17,000/mul. The late-reactive population was relatively resistant to X radiation, dependent on L-asparagine, and insensitive to doses of colchicine which are toxic for leukemic cells. The ability of these lymphocytes to form rosettes spontaneously with sheep red blood cells is preserved in a large measure. Only a small proportion lacked this surface marker. It seems that the population of late-reacting lymphocytes to PHA in the blood of patients with CLL is of thymic origin.",,,,,,,

Treatment with AMD also caused a slight accumulation of Pr4 in purified early virus particles produced by a cell line which usually produces virions that contain little Pr4. The cleavage of other intracellular viral precursor polypeptides was not affected by treatment with AMD. Treatment of infected cells with cycloheximide, on the other hand, allowed the cleavage of Pr4 to proceed at the usual rate for a short period of time before further cleavage was drastically slowed or prevented. The cleavage of several other viral precursor polypeptides was also inhibited by treatment with cycloheximide. Different lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of action of AMD is not due to a possible indirect effect on protein synthesis. Thus, the rate of cleavage of Pr4 was not affected by the length of pretreatment with AMD between 1 to 8 h. In addition, the combined effect of AMD and cycloheximide, at their maximal inhibitory concentrations, was greater than the effect of either drug alone, indicating the involvement of two at least partially different mechanisms in the action of AMD and cycloheximide. Furthermore, AMD did not affect the pulse labeling of viral precursor polypeptides. These results suggest that the interaction with viral RNA, whose production is inhibited by AMD, accelerates the cleavage of Pr4 to p30 during virus assembly. A hypothetical model is presented to illustrate th possible advantages of having a step in virus assembly in which genomic RNA interacts with a precursor to capsid proteins before the cleavage of that precursor.",PMC354946,,,,,,

The Kiel classification of NHL is based on morphological and immunological features shared by normal and neoplastic cells. Therefore, the origin, maturation, and reaction of nonneoplastic T- and B-cells together with their immunological, enzyme-cytochemical and morphological features are discussed first. In the T-cell system T-precursor cells, prothymocytes, T1/T2-cells, and T-immunoblasts can be distinguished on the basis of the given features. The B-system is primarily composed of cells of the two antigen-dependent B-cell reactions, the germinal center reaction, and the plasma cell reaction. These cells can be distinguished both morphologically and through demonstration of the complement receptor in frozen sections. We differentiate the following entities of NHL, divided into six groups for better understanding: 1. lymphocytic lymphomas: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, mycosis fungoides, and Sezary syndrome; 2. secretory immunoglobulin-producing lymphomas: plasmacytoma and lymphoplasmacytoid immunocytoma; 3. germinal center cell tumors: centroblastic/centrocytic lymphoma, centrocytic lymphoma, centroblastic lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, and lymphoma of the Burkitt type; 4. lymphoblastic lymphomas: ""convoluted cell"" type and ""unclassified"" type; 5. immunoblastic lymphoma; 6. reticulosarcoma. B-cell characteristics are revealed by more than 80% of the NHL, namely by 97% of the cases of CLL, by all secretory immunoglobulin-producing lymphomas, by all germinal center cell tumors, and by most immunoblastic lymphomas. More than 50% of the B-cell tumors are evidently derived from germinal center cells. The following are T-cell tumors: a few rare forms of CLL, mycosis fungoides Sezary syndrome, about 50% of the lymphoblastic lymphomas, and a few immunoblastic lymphomas. It could be shown that the cells of lymphoblastic lymphoma, ""convolted cell"" type with strong acid phosphatase reactivity have the same features as fetal thymocytes. So far, we have not observed any cases of true reticulosarcoma as described by Roulet and Rappaporti, i.e. tumors of phagocytic reticulum cells.

The irradiation effects were determined also by a viability test of the cells, using trypan blue dye. The irradiated T-cell line (CCRF-HSB-2) showed a remarkably high frequency of chromosome aberrations, including chromosome and chromatid deletions, chromatid exchanges, dicentrics, rings and acentric fragments. On the other hand, the chromosome aberrations observed in the irradiated B-cell line and normal T-lymphocytes consisted mainly of dicentrics, rings, deletions and acentric fragments; the frequency of chromosome and chromatid deletions was low as compared to that of the T-cell line. The cell viability test showed a singificantly higher percent reduction of viable cells at every dose of X-ray in the irradiated T-cell line than in the B-cell line or the normal T-lymphocytes. It is possible that the increased radiosensitivity of the T-cell line is related to the original malignant nature of the cells, which originated from the lymphocytes of a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",,,,,,,

In addition, T- and B-cell values are determined in blood of 35 healthy individuals, in 12 normal lymph nodes, as well as in hyperplastic conditions of lymph nodes from 30 patients and of tonsils from 85 patients. Cell characterizations are done by immunofluorescence and use of monospecific anti-immunoglobulin antisera (H chain specific), anti-thymus antiserum, as well as by the E-rosette test. While normal blood and normal and hyperplastic tissues show a polyclonal distribution or proliferation of lymphoreticular cells, neoplastic conditions are often characterized by an exuberant, possibly monoclonal proliferation of one cell type. According to this, lymphoreticular neoplasias are immunologically grouped into four main classes: B-cell neoplasias comprising most of the chronic lymphocytic leukemias, well differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas, BURKITT's tumor, follicular lymphoma BRILL-SYMMERS, and hairy cell leukemia. T-cell lymphomas represent a large part of poorly or undifferentiated leukemias of children, poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas, prolymphocytic leukemia, and Sezary's syndrome. Monocytic neoplasias are malignant histiocytoses and leukemic reticuloendothelioses. A fourth group, which probably is not homogeneous and might be further classified in the future by use of more sophisticated methods, consists of tumors with T- and B-cell lack. Such tumors are histologically classified as Hodgkin's lymphomas, a certain number of histiocytic lymphomas, and mycosis fungoides. The prognostic and pathogenetic implications of a combined morphological and immunological classification of lymphoreticular neoplasias are briefly outlined.",,Membranrezeptoren lymphoreticularer Zellen bei hyperplastischen und neoplastischen Erkrankungen des lymphatischen Systems,,,,,

Also the frequent appearance of neoplasms in primary immunodeficiency syndromes indicates this fact. Also in human leukaemias there exist leukaemia-associated antigens. Humoral as well as cell-bound immunoreactions may be proved. Possibly leukaemia-associated immunoglobulins are blocking factors which prevent the cellular immunoreactions against leukaemia-associated membrane antigens. The presence of specific reactions against antigens on leukaemia-cells was the condition for a successful immunotherapy. Despite many theoretical possibilities the immunotherapy in the clinic at present restricts to the BCG-vaccination and to the application of living or irradiated leukaemia-cells.

The types of inflammatory cells (IC) found in resultant cell suspensions were determined 6, 11, 14 and 18 days post inoculation. Inflammatory infiltrates were composed almost exclusively of three cell types; neutrophils, T lymphocytes and macrophages. The extent to which each was found in tumors was related to the time post inoculation. Neutrophils were part of an early acute inflammatory response seen in both developing regressing and progressing sarcomas. The onset of regression was associated histologically with the appearance within tumors of a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. T lymphocytes and macrophages were the principal constituents. A higher percentage of T lymphocytes was recovered at all sampling times from regressing, compared to progressing, sarcomas. During development of the mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate there were relatively more large T cells in regressing, than in progressing tumors, and the percentage of macrophages was higher. Thereafter, the proportion of macrophages in the recovered cell population was approximately the same for both types of tumor. Such equality was more apparent than real, however, since IC were restricted to the peripheries of progressing sarcomas after the acute inflammatory phase, but continued to be found throughout regressing neoplasms. The effective ratio of macrophages and T lymphocytes to tumor cells therefore was much lower in progressing sarcomas than was suggested by percentage figures. The data presented support the concept that T lymphocytes are instrumental in causing the regression of Moloney sarcomas, possibly through interactions with macrophages.",,,,,,,

Lymphocytes were obtained from pools of normal spleen cells by filtration of the cell suspension through a nylon-wool column. The purity for both Ig positive and theta-positive cells varied between 85% and 90% in the B-cell and T-cell fractions; both lymphocyte fractions responded very well to stimulation with their respective specific polyclonal mitogens, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and concanavalin A (Con A). Lymphocytes were infected by incubating pelleted cells in 2-6 x 10(4) FFU MuLV for 1 h at 4 degrees C and were then cultured for 5-10 days. Cells releasing infectious MuLV were enumerated as infectious centers (IC). IC were really detectable in the cultures of infected B-cells but none were found in the T-cell cultures. Addition of LPS to the culture medium increased the number of IC in B-cell fractions up to 1,000-fold. Furthermore, in T-cell cultures with LPS, IC also appeared in number which approximately correlated with the contaminating Ig+ cells of the T-cell fraction. In contrast, Con A had no consistent effect on the infection of either B or T cells. In the absence of MuLV-F, mitogenic stimulation alone did not elicit any endogenous IC. In subsequent experiments, purified lymphocytes were infected in diffusion chambers in vivo. The number of IC in infected B cells increased 1,000-fold as compared to infection in tissue culture. The peak of infection at 10 days was followed by a slight decline. Infected cells were also found in diffusion chambers containing T-cell fractions; these IC had very similar kinetics to those in B-cell-containing chambers, but their number was 10 times lower, suggesting that the infected cells were B cells, which comprised about 10% of the T-cell fraction. The virus-related antigens were detectable by immunofluorescence on the membrane of cells recovered from B-cell-bearing chambers but not on cells from T-cell-bearing chambers.",,,,,,,

Twelve patients died. The incidence of these complications in children with intensive chemotherapy and the clinical symptoms which may reveal them are reviewed; the bad prognosis of measles in these patients is stressed. Radiological findings are described and the possible wrong diagnoses are listed. Among viral infections, measles is the severest and its diagnosis is often difficult. Pneumocystis carinii infection is frequent. The use of surgical pulmonary biopsy and other diagnostic procedures is discussed. The immune status of these patients has been studied, which revealed severe impairement of cellular immunity, including low lymphocyte count, while humoral immunity was not changed. Symptomatic treatment may include oxygen supply and mechanical respiratory help, dietary management, and attempts towards non specific immune system stimulation. Aetiologic treatment is essentially the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii, which is discussed. Diagnosis and treatment of pneumonitis in immunosuppressed patients being very difficult, emphasis is made on the prevention of this accident, including caution in the handling of chemotherapy protocols.",,Pneumopathies interstitielles chez les enfants traites pour affections malignes,,,,,

The maximum difference was obtained when the cells were incubated with colchicine at 37 degrees C for 20 h. The sensitivity was measured by a 'sensitivity index' which was an estimate of the average percentage of lymphocytes killed by 1.0 and 0.1 mug/ml of colchicine. The index was 0-15% for lymphocytes from the blood of 14 normal persons and was 61-98% for 23 of 25 leukaemic patients with absolute lymphocyte counts of 8,000 X 10(9)/l or more. 3 of 4 untreated patients with presumptive diagnoses of early leukaemia had low absolute counts of 3,300 to 7,600 X 10(9) lymphocytes/l and high sensitivity indices of 41 to 83%. Tests on treated patients with lymphocytes counts less than 8,000 X 10(9)/l suggested a correlation of the index with remission and relapse.

The isolation technique involves surface cross-linking of the cells's Fc receptors with the use of aggregated human IgG and anti-human IgG. This results in the redistribution (patch formation and capping) of the cells's Fc receptors. Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination of the cells before complex binding indicates that Fc receptor redistribution results in the selective release of surface proteins. SDS-PAGE analyses of the supernatants from cells thus treated reveals a major peak corresponding to a molecular weight of 45,000 daltons. This protein has been purified from the cell supernatants by immunoprecipitation and chromatography of the percipitates on Sephadex G-200 under dissociating conditions. After separation from the immune complex this protein can be bound to heat-aggregated IgG, but not aggregated F(ab')2 fragments.

The class restriction of this surface Ig and other characteristics described for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are considered as evidence for the monoclonality of the neoplastic proliferation. Different CLL cases with various expressions of surface Ig represent various degrees of block in the maturation of the lymphocytes. Through the use of other cell markers, it has been shown that most cases of CLL represent B cell neoplasia. Variations in the expression of the various B cell markers on the leukemic cells were observed. One case in which the leukemic cells were clearly T cell in character, and a single case of mixed B and T CLL, are described. The significance of the sheep red blood cell rosette-forming cells in CLL is discussed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can be a useful adjunct to the identification of B- and T-derived lymphocytes. According to these criteria, leukemic cells are mostly of the B type, although variations in their surface architecture were noted. It is concluded that SEM alone cannot consistently distinguish between leukemic B and T cells. Electron microscope studies of mitogen-transformed CLL lymphocytes suggest that there is a residual normal B and T population of cells in addition to the predominant, abnormally reacting cells, which are mostly of B origin. Antigenic changes on the surface of CLL lymphocytes are suggestive of normal antigens present on young normal lymphocytes, rather than of the emergence of truly ""tumor-specific"" antigens. These antigens are independent of the T or B origin of the leukemia. CLL lymphocytes are shown to be defective in their ability to form caps with concanavalin A and anti-HL-A sera, and in their osmotic regulatory capacity.",,,,,,,

Although established for peripheral blood and bone marrow, T and B lymphocyte distributions have not been previously reported for lymph nodes, appendix, thymus, and spleen tissues in children. Thymus-dependent T cells were determined by the sheep erythrocyte rosette technique, and thymus-independent B cells were determined by the fluorescent labeling of surface immunoglobulins A (IgA), G (IgG), and M (IgM). Fifty percent of lymph node cells were either T or B cells; 65% of these cells were T lymphocytes, whereas 58% of B cells were of the IgM subclass. Less than half of the appendix cells were either T or B cells; 47% of these were T lymphocytes, and the remainder B lymphocytes had subclass distribution similar to that of lymph nodes but different from peripheral blood and bone marrow where B cells bearing IgG predominate. Thymus tissue contained 43% T cells and less than 1% B cells, but the spleen was composed largely of B cells, predominantly of the IgM type. Lymphoid tissue from nine children with either inflammatory or neoplastic diseases were studied and included for contrast.

Similar cyclic variations were noted in the platelet and reticulocyte counts with no apparent alterations in marrow cellularity to account for such changes. Since direct correlation was noted between white blood cells, platelets, and reticulocyte counts versus spleen size, it suggests that splenic hemopoiesis may be responsible for these cyclic changes. A possible inverse relationship between colony-stimulating factor (CSF) activity and the white blood cell count was noted, suggesting that CSF may be the humoral agent controlling granulocyte production. A direct correlation between the white blood cell count and serum unsaturated vitamin B12 binding capacity (UBBC) and lysozyme was also noted and further supports the concept that the latter two are measures of the granulocyte pool and metabolism. An inverse relationship between CSF activity and the UBBC suggests that these may be two different entities.

This suggests that this type of ALL originates in the thymus or alternatively that these properties of ALL blasts reflect changes occurring during blastogenesis. To test these possibilities, we determined whether mitogen-thymus antigens found on blasts from E+ALL and on normal human thymocytes. E-rosettes of blood T-lymphocytes dissociated at 37 degrees; in contrast, rosettes formed by E+ALL blasts, human thymocytes, and pokeweed mitogen-stimulated blasts were stable at this temperature. Blasts that formed stable rosettes did not have cytoplasmic Ig, indicating that they were T-lymphoblasts. By immunofluorescence and a radiolabeled antibody assay we demonstrated a thymus antigen(s) that was present on the membrane of E+ALL blasts and on normal thymocytes, but not on normal blood T-lymphocytes [TL-like antigen(s)]. This antigen was not expressed on blasts induced by mitogens. The finding that that mitogen-induced blasts form temperature-stable rosettes, but lack TL-like antigen(s), indicates that this antigen is not required for the expression of E-receptors stable at 37 degrees. The results support the concept that E+ALL results from the malignant transformation of thymus cells.",,,,,,,

The cycle interval was 53--69 days. Except for reticulocytes all other cells cycled with neutrophils. Plasma colony-stimulating factor (CSF) oscillated out of phase with neutrophils, suggesting that granulocytopoiesis is regulated through CSF by a feed-back mechanism. Plasma erythropoiesis-stimulating factor (ESF) also oscillated. ESF crests preceded or coincided with reticulocyte crests, indicating that the ESF elevation may have been responsible for the reticulocyte peaks. The relationship between neutrophils and reticulocytes and their oscillations with plasma CSF and ESF suggests that there is a common stem cell which differentiates along one cell line or the other depending upon the balance of regulatory stimuli. The fraction of blood neutrophilic precursors (myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes) in DNA synthesis fluctuated with neutrophil level. The calculated generation time was shorter at the crests than at the troughs of the neutrophil cycles. This finding suggested that the rate of proliferation of the neutrophils changed periodically. This observation, along with a periodic increase in differentiation of the stem cell toward the neutrophilic cells, is the probable explanation of oscillation of the neutrophil count in the blood.",,,,,,,

All T- and B-cells had DNA polymerase gamma, DNA polymerase beta, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase both in the soluble (the latter 2 enzymes only in small amounts) and chromatin fraction, whereas DNA polymerase alpha was found only in the soluble fraction. With respect to their sedimentation and chromatographic behavior, template-primer requirements, Km for deoxythymidine triphosphate or deoxyguanosine triphosphate divalent cation preference, effect of NaCI and inhibitors, the enzymes from T- and B-cells resembled each other and those from other mammalian cells. DNA polymerase alpha, beta, and gamma from T-cells like those from ""fresh"" acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, were more thermolabile than those from B-cells or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal lymphocytes. In addition, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase from the above cells was completely inactivated in 5 to 6 min at 50 degrees, whereas the DNA polymerase alpha, beta, and gamma retained considerable activity even after heating for 25 min at 50 degrees. DNA polymerase activity of the soluble fraction from T-cells was of the same magnitude as in B-cells when expressed on a DNA basis but twice that of B-cells when expressed on a protein basis. High terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity, equivalent to that observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, was found in all T-cell lines that, when expressed on a DNA basis, was 30 to 100 times higher than the B-cell lines tested.

There were 38 patients with A.L.L. and 27 with A.M.L. In relapsing A.L.L. 15 observations were made before reinduction therapy. In about 40% of all the cultures PHA stimulation was done simultaneously with PWM-stimulation. Before any treatment normal lymphocytes showed a normal response, being however somewhat diminished at relapse. Most of the cases of A.M.L. had so many leukemic cells in peripheral blood that no reliable measure of stimulation of the few lymphocytes left was possible. In A.L.L. this was however possible in about 30% of all the cases studied. In cultures of the predominantly leukemic cells, lymphoblasts showed a positive response in a minority of cases studied. If the peripheral WBC-count was high, a response was usually absent. In some of the cases of A.M.L., the leukemic cells reacted to PHA and PWM. Unexpected but very remarkable is our finding that in the control cultures, without added mitogen, the incorporation of labelled 3H-thymidine was usually very high in A.M.L. contrasting with A.L.L. leukemic cells who incorporated very little of the label. These striking differences were observed both in 72 and 144 hours cultures and were not caused by differences in viability between these two leukemic cell-types. The capacity of A.L.L.-leukemic cells to form E (""T"") and EAC (""B"") rosettes was studied in 20 cases. The percentages of rosette forming lymphoblasts differed widely from patient to patient. It is concluded that in A.L.L. leukemic cells are in a minority immuno-competent cells and it is suggested that the lymphoblast is an immature cell, arrested in the maturation towards a T-lymphocyte, the degree of maturity differing from patient to patient. Furthermore the striking difference in spontaneous labelling of myeloid versus lymphoblastic leukemic cells seems to be helpful in the differential diagnosis and may in part explain the well known differences in prognosis and behaviour towards cytostatics between these main leukemia types.",,,,,,,

Exhaustively washed peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for 7 days in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with fetal calf serum in the presence of the lectin, pokeweed mitogen. The IgG, IgA, and IgM synthesized and secreted into the medium were measured by competitive double antibody radio-immunoassays. Twenty-two normal individuals synthesized 1625 ng of IgG, 1270 ng of IgA, and 4910 ng of IgM per 2 million lymphocytes in culture. In contrast, the three patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and a thymoma synthesized less than 100 ng of each class of immunoglobulin. When lymphocytes from 2 of the 3 patients studied were cocultured with normal lymphocytes and pokeweed mitogen, the synthesis of immunoglobulin by normal lymphocytes was depressed by a factor of 66 to 97%. Co-cultue of purified T cells from the hypogammaglobulinemic patients with normal lymphocytes resulted in an 87% suppression of immunoglobulin synthesis by the normal cells. However, no suppression of immunoglobulin synthesis was observed when preparations of B cells and macrophages depleted of T cells from the hypogammaglobulinemic patients were co-cultured with normal lymphocytes. In addition, in control studies no such suppression of immunoglobulin synthesis was seen when normal cells were co-cultured with lymphocytes from unrelated normals, patients with isolated IgA deficiency, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or patients with the Sezary syndrome, a T cell leukemia nor were they inhibited when incubated with T cells from unrelated normals. These observations suggest that in some patients the hypogammaglobulinemia associated with a thymoma may be caused or perpetuated by an abnormality of regulatory T cells which suppress the maturation of lymphocytes into antibody producing cells.",,,,,,,

Using quantitative microphotometric immunoautoradiography, surface antigen densities were measured at the cellular level with the following results: (1) The density of T-antigenic sites was less on leukemic cells compared to normal T lymphocytes. (2) The T-antigen densities of leukemic lymphocytes varied less from cell to cell forming a homogeneous peak in histograms. (3) An Ig density of normal B lymphocytes was demonstrated on the residual T-antigen-negative cells. The results were qualitatively confirmed by direct immunofluorescence and electron microscopy with peroxidase-labeled antibodies. Furthermore, the surface antigens were quantitative microcomplement fixation test which revealed reduced binding of anti-T-cell antibodies and complement, and no antiglobulin fixation on the leukemic lymphocytes. Since lymphocytes with normal T-antigen concentration could not be found among the leukemic T lymphocytes, a lack of normal T cells was assumed. The findings that there was a decrease and altered distribution of surface markers on chronic lymphatic leukemia cells of the B- and T-cell type are discussed as further arguments referring to their clonal origin.",,,,,,,

One effect was associated with an increase in the number of availability of potential target cells for spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) in fully susceptible mouse strains. This enhancing effect was optimal when LPS was injected 5 days before SFFV but was nil when LPS and SFFV were given at the same time. In contrast, in mice genetically resistant to the native helper virus of SFFV, the helper effect of LPS was optical when it was injected with SFFV and oil when given 5 days before or after the virus. LPS did not affect helper virus expression in a standard cell culture (XC) assay, but it did increase helper virus replication in mice. Mice lacking T cells or complete endogenous murine leukemia virus genomes were just as sensitive to the helper effects of LPS on SFFV expression as were control animals. Most of the helper activity of LPS is associated with the lipid A component. The mechanism of the helper effect of lipid A is still unknown, but hypotheses must take into account that this effect did not occur in fully susceptible hosts, but only in hosts carrying resistance alleles at either the FV-1 or the FV-2 locus.",,,,,,,

The reactivity was maximal in young rats at 5-8 weeks of age and rapidly declined thereafter. Within reactive rats, the cytotoxicity was widely distributed among the various lymphoid organs. Since immunization of W/Fu rats with (C58NT)D was shown to elicit specific cell-mediated cytotoxic reactivity, studies were done to compare the characteristics of the natural reactivity with those of the immune reactivity. The specificity of both types of reactivity was analyzed in detail by an inhibition assay. The natural and the immune reactivities appeared directed against antigens associated with rat endogenous type-C viruses. The major differences between the natural reactivity and immune reactivity were the nature of the effector cells. Whereas immune reactivity was T-cell dependent, normal reactivity was not affected by treatment with antisera against T cells plus complement. Natural effector cells were not adherent and did not have macrophage properties. The active cells also did not have receptors for Ig or complement. The absence of detectable cell-surface markers on the natural effector cells was seen in studies of natural cytotoxic reactivity of mice, and it is proposed that the natural cytotoxicity in both systems is mediated by a unique subpopulation of lymphoid cells, tentatively designated ""N"" cells.",,,,,,,

This naturally occuring killer (NK) cell had low adherent properties and had the morphological appearance of a lymphocyte. Still it lacked surface characteristics of mature T or B lymphocytes. In the present report a functional study was carried out, comparing in parallel the NK system, the T-cell killing across an H-2 barrier (anti-P815), and the antibody-dependent cell-mediated chicken red blood cell (CRBC) system. In contrast to the effector cells in the CRBC system, the NK cells were insensitive to erythrocyte antibody complement (EAC) rosette depletion and would pass through nylon wool columns. NK activity was not inhibited by the presence of heat-aggregated human or mouse gamma globulin, in contrast to the strong inhibition noted in the CRBC system. Sensitivity to trypsin pretreatment was noted in the NK system as well as in the immune P815 system, whereas the CRBC system was relatively trypsin resistant. Antitheta plus complement eliminated the anti-P815 activity, but did not touch the NK activity. The present results thus further distinguish the NK cell from cytotoxic T lymphocytes or from antibody-dependent killer cells.",PMC2190156,,,,,,

Cells taken from mice, e.g. BALB/c genetically susceptible to leukemogenesis in vivo were much more susceptible to suppression of mitogenesis in vitro than similar cells from genetically resistant mice, e.g., C57BL/6. Nylon wool-purified splenic T cells from BALB/c and C3H mice lost susceptibility to FV-induced suppression of mitogenesis but became suppressible by addition of 10% unfiltered spleen cell. Thus, FV mediates in vitro suppression of lymphocyte proliferation indirectly by ""activating"" a suppressor cell. The suppressor cell adhered to nylon wool but not to glass wool or rayon wool columns. Pretreatment of spleen cells with carbonyl iron and a magnet did not abrogate the suppressor cell function. Suppressor cells were not eliminated by treatment with rabbit antimouse immunoglobulin (7S) and complement (C). However, high concentrations of anti-Thy-1 plus C destroyed suppressor cells of the spleen; thymic suppressor cells were much more susceptible to anti-Thy-1 serum. Nude athymic mice were devoid of suppressor cells and their B-cell proliferation was relatively resistant to FV-induced suppression in vitro. The suppressor cells in the thymus (but not in the spleen) were eliminated by treatment of mice with cortisol. Thus, FV appears to mediate its suppressive effect on mitogen-responsive lymphocytes by affecting ""T-suppressor cells."" Spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice treated with 89Sr to destroy marrow-dependent (M) cells were much more suppressible by FV in virto than normal C57BL/6 spleen cells. However, nylon-filtered spleen cells of 89Sr-treated C57BL/6 mice were resistant to FV-induced suppression in vitro, indicating that the susceptibility of spleen cells from 89Sr-treated B6 mice is also mediated by suppressor cells. Normal B6 splenic T cells were rendered susceptible to FV-induced suppression of mitogenesis by addition of 10% spleen cells from 89Sr-treated B6 mice. Thus, M cells appear to regulate the numbers and/or functions of T-suppressor cells which in turn mediate the immunosuppressive effects of FV in vitro. Neither mitogen-responsive lymphocytes nor T-suppressor cells are genetically resistant or susceptible to FV. The genetic resistance to FV is apparently a function of M cells, both in vitro as well as in vivo.",PMC2190162,,,,,,

By applying a mixed rosette assay using nucleated chicken erythrocytes coated with antibodies and C3, and denucleated ESN, it was found that a considerable number of tumor cells in all five cases formed mixed rosettes, i.e. that they bore the C3 receptor characteristic of B cells and simultaneously the E receptor characteristic of T cells.

The effectiveness of purified mouse interferon in AKR mice was also examined. The decrease in the viral titer of animals that received interferon treatment was markedly greater than of those receiving a combination of cytoreductive therapy with Virazole or immunotherapy. The administration of mouse interferon had a direct effect on the appearance of the spontaneous leukemia in AKR mice.

Tolerance was not achieved with high dose deaggregated sheep IgG, nor were we able to confirm the effectivity of immunochemotherapy based on linking chlorambucil to antibody directed against the tumor-associated ""antigen"" IgE.",,,,,,,

In the first assay, we used a simple density separation technique to remove dense neutrophils (PMN) from suspensions of blood and of bone marrow cells prior to culture in semisolid agar. Conditions were arranged to ensure that control suspensions of unseparated cells and test suspensions of buoyant mononuclear cells differed only in their content of neutrophils. The control and test suspensions contained equal numbers of mononuclear cells (and granulocyte precursors). Colony (and cluster) formation was invariably enhanced in neutrophil-depleted cultures of normal cells. In the second assay, dense PMN, treated by an adherence separation procedure, were recovered, and the non-adherent dense PMN were added back to PMN-depleted cultures. A reproducible dose-related decrease in colony (and cluster) formation to basal levels resulted. The inhibitory effect was identical when the PMN were added directly to the culture (overlayer) or to the underlayer. In PMN-depleted cultures obtained from patients with leukemia and other hemopoietic disorders, neither colony nor cluster formation was enhanced, and sometimes it was reduced. When we compared the effect of adding patient and normal non-adherent PMN to target cultures of normal and patient PMN-depleted cells, some leukemic PMN were noninhibitory. Our results suggest that abnormalities of cellular interactions in vitro detected in the first assay may have more than one explanation, as shown when they are subjected to the closer scrutiny possible with the second assay.",,,,,,,

CSF production was found to be variable and was related to the morphologic subtype of AML--cells from patients with monocytic leukemia produced normal or large quantities of CSF, while (with one exception) those from patients with myeloblastic leukemia produced little or no CSF. There was a general relationship between CSF production and serum lysozyme levels. Attempts to demonstrate a consistent inhibitory effect exerted by leukemic peripheral blood cells on normal leukopoiesis in vitro were negative.

The killing activity shows a marked dependence on the genotype of the donor mouse. In vivo rejection studies with a Moloney lymphoma line in various normal semisyngeneic F1 hybrids showed a clear positive correlation between in vitro natural cytotoxicity and in vivo rejection. Thus mice can be grouped as high- or low-reactive according to their in vitro cytolytic behavior as well as their in vivo rejection potential. A lymphoid cell without detectable T- or B-cell markers is responsible for the in vitro killing effect. The present study also shows that the in vivo growth inhibitory function is T-cell-independent. Lymphoid cells depleted of T- and B-cells and transferred together with Moloney lymphoma cells into an irradiated syngeneic recipent were highly efficient in delaying tumor growth. Furthermore, syngeneic or semisyngeneic thymecto-mized, irradiated, fetal-liver-reconstituted mice showed if anything an increased in vivo resistance to a Moloney lymphoma compared to control mice. In contrast, tumor cells histoincompatible with regard to the H-2 locus showed the expected preferential growth in the thymectomized animals. We thus conclude that the major in vivo resistance against transplantation of the syngeneic or semisyngeneic Moloney lymphoma used in this study is T-independent.",,,,,,,

Ninety-eight patients were randomized to one of two treatment regimens. Schedule 1 consisted of a single intravenous (i.v.) push of cytosine arabinoside followed in 48 hours by a large dose of oral methotrexate distributed over 24 hours and i.v. vincristine. Leucovorin rescue was employed to control the toxic effects of the high dose methotrexate and the cycle was repeated every 7 days. Schedule 2 differed only in that there were three daily injections of cytosine arabinoside preceding vincristine and methotrexate injections and each cycle was given every 10 days. Cell kinetic studies were performed in 30 patients and revealed that the majority of patients who had a response to therapy had some increase in the marrow labeling index 48 hours after cytosine arabinoside injection. In general, those patients who had no response to therapy had little change. There was no significant difference between schedules in the ability to induce an increase in labeling index 48 hours after cytosine arabinoside or in the increment achieved by the responders. However, there was a significant difference in the response rate seen with these schedules. Schedule 1 achieved only a 24% remission rate in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) while schedule 2 was associated with a 52% remission rate. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) both schedules induced a 60% remission rate while none of the four patients with blast crisis of chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) responded. Analysis of the characteristics associated with remission revealed that more females achieved a remission than males and that the presence of pretreatment infection was the greatest contributing cause of early death and thus severely limited the ability to achieve a remission. As opposed to the current regimens used in ANLL, schedule 2 did not require significant bone marrow hypoplasia (as judged by the degree of hematological toxicity) to achieve a remission and there was no decrease in response seen with increasing age. The data suggest that increased efficiency of cycle-specific, antitumor agents may occur by increasing the proportion of human leukemic cells in DNA synthesis.",,,,,,,

Relatively broad regions of biological activity were observed following isoelectric focusing of both neuraminidase-treated and untreated CSF, suggesting that activity was associated with a heterogeneous/polydisperse population of molecular species.",,,,,,,

There is very slight decrease in total RFC in PBL over age 5, but the changes in MFC are quite striking. Treatment with antihuman thymus antiserum (ATS) and with anti-human lymphoblastic antiserum (ATL) resulted in significant inhibition of total rosette and morula rosette formation. No inhibition was seen using normal brain antiserum, anti-IgM antiserum, or anti-L chain antiserum. In two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in some cases of thymic deficiency the ratio of MFC to total RFC was unusually high.

Twenty-nine (93.5%) of the patients had diffuse and 2 (6.5%) had nodular lymphoma. Diffuse histiocytic lymphoma accounted for 10 cases (32.3%), diffuse undifferentiated for 9 (29%), and diffuse lymphocytic, poorly differentiated for 5 (16.1%). Five cases (16.1%) were unclassifiable. No cases of well-differenitated lymphocytic or mixed cell lymphoma were found. A modified classification was attempted, which included also large basophilic cell (LBC), convoluted T-lymphocytic (CTL), and Burkitt's lymphomas. These pathologic subgroups accounted for 35.4%, 16.1%, and 6.5% of the cases, respectively. The patients were almost equally divided between clinically localized and generalized stages, and their survival was stage-dependent. The overall survival was 32.3%; the 3-year survival was 50% for Stages I and II, compared to 7.7% for Stages III and IV. The gastrointestinal tract was the most common site of origin. In 22% of the cases, the disease originated in extra-lymphatic tissues. Central nervous syste, involvement occurred in 10 of 31 children (32%), and a leukemic picture developed in 6 of 31 (19%). The Ctl lymphomas were confined to the mediastinum, whereas the LBC lymphomas arose mostly in Waldeyer's ring and Peyer's patches. We conclude that the extent of the disease as determined by clinical staging had prognostic significance in childhood NHL. The prognostic value of the histological classification could not be clearly established from our data.",,,,,,,

A minor group (termed atypical) was identified by the presence of a pleomorphic cell population with few small lymphocytes. The predominant SmIg was IgG, which was detected intracellularly as well as in the serum.

We have confirmed the observations that high levels are characteristic of thymus gland with both human and calf tissue and that elevated levels may be found in some cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia. High levels were also found in human lymphoblast cell lines with T-cell characteristics, and insignificant activity was observed in leukocytes of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia not in acute blast phase of the disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, human B-cells, and normal human blood lymphocytes even after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin.

This technique is based on binding of antibody-coated bovine erythrocytes by B lymphocytes in the presence of sub-hemolytic concentrations of mouse complement. B lymphocytes can be identified in frozen tissue sections by adherent sensitized bovine erythrocytes. The specificity of the technique for B lymphocytes was established by 1) absence of spontaneous rosette formation with bovine erythrocytes by human T lymphocytes, 2) specific binding of bovine erythrocyte-antibody-complement complexes to B cell regions of normal lymph nodes and spleen and 3) binding of erythrocyte-antibody-complement to a high proportion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (a B cell leukemia) lymphocytes.

Based on radioisotope incorporation data, cellular dimensions, and intracellular radioisotope distributions (3H and 125I intranuclear, 67Ga cytoplasmic) the rates of deposition of cellular, nuclear, and cytoplasmic energy were calculated. In terms of energy absorption/cell, 67Ga (LD50: 2250 keV/hr; 69 rad/hr) was much less toxic than either 3H (LD50: 325 keV/hr; 10 rad/hr) of 125I (LD50:50 keV/hr; 1-5 rad/hr). In terms of energy absorption/nuclesu, 67Ga and 3H produced almost identical effects (LD50: 230 versus 255 keV/hr; 22-2 versus 24-6 rad/hr), but 125I remained much more toxic (LD50: 40 keV/hr; 3-9 rad/hr). These findings indicate that, although decay by electron capture in the cell nucleus (125I) is highly destructive, the same type of decay occurring in the cytoplasm (67Ga) is ineffective in killing L1210 cells. An analysis of the data suggests that the cytotoxic effects of the three radioisotopes result exclusively from nuclear damage.

Prednisone alone did not change the B-, T- and O-lymphocyte counts. Cytostatics alone or in combination with prednisone reduced the B- and T-lymphocyte counts concomitant with a significant increase in the O-lymphocyte count. The findings could be explained by assuming that cytostatics disturb the immunological functions of the lymphocytes and finally deprive the cells of their B- and T-markers.

B type lymphocytes are characterized by the selective presence of IgM and IgD. IgG, the main serum Ig, is rarely found and its previous reported presence was due to secondary adsorption. IgM and IgD occur together on the same lymphocytes and show similar or identical variable regions and antigen combining sites. The membrane Igs are positioned on the lymphocyte surface with a cosiderable part of the C-terminal portion of the heavy chains buried in the membrane. In addition to numerous other lymphocyte membrane markers, recent interest has centered on the new histocompatibility surface antigen, HL-B, which appears related to immune response genes and is selectively represented on B cells. Through the use of this group of lymphocyte markers considerable information on the character of the malignant cells in various leukemias and lymphomas has been obtained. Chronic lymphatic leukemia is essentially a proliferation of B cells. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia falls into two groups, a minor type that represents a proliferation of T cells and a major type that appears to show an immature cell type of probable B cells lineage. Various immunodeficiency syndromes have been clarified considerably through lymphocyte analyses and certain defects have been determined.",,,,,,,

Osteosarcomas were found in 14/15 of the female C3H/H mice--animals known to carry mammary-tumour viruses in milk--compared with 6/15 in their male counterparts. In CBA/H female mice, which have a very low incidence of both mammary tumours and leukaemia, osteo-sarcomas developed in 7/15 of the animals. The CBA/H mice lived about 5-8 months longer and revealed their osteosarcomas at a correspondingly later time than C3H/H mice. Virus particles were observed in each of the three mammary tumours and in 15 out of the 17 osteosarcomas examined by electron microscopy.

Better physiological insight into stimulating and inhibitory factors is obtained in this way. These studies are of diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic importance in the clinical handling of myeloid leukaemia dn neutropenia. It can be accepted today that the concept of myeloid leukaemia as a neoplastic process with an increased production of autonomous cell populations is to a large extent outdated, and these cells can be induced in vitro to differentiate into mature polymorphs. In the past it has been demonstrated that in vitro successes are followed by in vivo results, and in particular it is hoped that with the development of techniques for concentration of colony-stimulating factor, that this might be of therapeutic advantage in selected leukaemia patients in the future.",,Mielopoiese--'n kinetiese benadering,,,,,

We obtained thymic cells by mincing thymus and isolating peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal donors as well as patients with acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (ALL and CLL). Prior to SEM, we purified the lymphocytes in isoosmotic Ficoll-Hypaque gradients. In addition, we examined several lymphoid cell lines in permanent culture derived from normal persons, patients with infectious mononucleosis, as well as from patients with ALL. The surfaces of most thymic cells appear smooth with only a few short microvilli. A small number of thymic cells, on the other hand, are found to exhibit many more microvilli of uniform shape and length. We could further identify lymphocytes from normal donors as T- and B-types according to their rosetting spontaneously with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) resemble thymic cells in their surface topology. However, B-cells rosetting with amboceptor--and complement--treated SRBC show greater number of microvilli. The surface morphology of lymphocytes from leukemic patients appears more or less characteristic of the disease type. In contrast, the surfaces of cultured lymphoid cells show a diversified surface topology, often with large smooth areas, very long and very short microcilli, which may often cluster in groups.

Six patients had B cell lymphomata with normal or strong immunofluorescent staining for surface membrane immunoglobulin; 8 patients had B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with pale staining for surface membrane immunoglobulin; 5 patients had T cell lymphomata and 3 patients were not definitely classifiable. In 6 out of 8 patients with B cell CLL, histopathology of lymph nodes showed infiltration with well differentiated lymphocytes and in all T cell lymphomata, the infiltrating cells were poorly differentiated. By the use of these markers, malignant lymphocytes were identified in the circulation in only 3 out of 6 patients with B cell lymphoma, in all patients with B cell CLL but in none of those with T cell lymphoma or unclassifiable lymphoma.

Furthermore, it is secreted into body fluids. In healthy adults a very low serum concentration may be found. The clinical significance of CEA lies in its increased formation in primary and secondary adenocarcinomas of colon and rectum and pancreatic carcinoma, where values of 20 ng/ml and more are observed. However, other gastrointestinal (e.g. oesophagus, stomach, gall-bladder) and extragastrointestinal tumors (e.g. lung, breast, urogenital, prostatic, ovarial carcinomas) as well as non-malignant diseases mainly of the GI tract (e.g. hepatitis, cirrhosis, pancreatitis, colitis, diverticulitis) may provoke less frequent and lower increases in the CEA level. Healthy smokers also tend to show a slight increase in CEA concentration. A certain relationship exists between the CEA level and the size and extent of the tumor so that a decrease following operation may account for complete tumor removal, whereas a persistent or recurring increase in the CEA level is highly suspicious of metastases and/or recurrent tumor. Difficulties in proving and purifying CEA are mainly caused by multiple cross-reactions of CEA with other substances, e.g. blood group substances (A, B, Lea, Leb) and normal or other antigens (NGP, NCA, CEX, CCEA 2, NCA 2, CCA-III, FSA, BCGP). The radioimmunoassay is the most suitable method to determine CEA levels in body fluids. The 3 procedures used differ in the precipitation of the specific immune complex by ammonium sulphate (AS), Z-gel (ZG) or a second antibody (SA). Depending on the method, the upper normal limit in serum or plasma corresponds to approximately 2.5 (AS, ZG) or 12.5 (SA) nanogramme/milliliter. CEA determination in the urine is of interest in patients suffering from bladder carcinoma.",,Carcinofetale antigene. II. Carcinoembryonales antigen (CEA),,,,,

This sub-population of T-cells has been called the active rosette forming cell by others. The advantages of this modified procedure compared with that previously described are: 1) the elimination of 60 mon incubation period for lymphocytes prior to the assay and 2) the elimination of the need for fetal calf serum in the assay. The mean percentage of RFC in the peripheral blood of 80 healthy adult controls using the modified procedure is 25.2+/-5.5% in buffer lacking FCS. The results were highly reproducible and comparable to the results obtained using the procedure previously described. It was concluded that a 60 min pre-incubation of lymphocytes and the use of FCS are not necessary when the appropriate SRBS: lymphocyte ratio is used in the determination of human adult active RFC. The use of this procedure in evaluating the immune competence of cancer patients is discussed.,,,,,,,

There are three types of myeloid leukemia cells, IR-+D-+, IR-+D-minus and IR-minus D-minus. IR-+D-+ cells were induced to form receptors for EAC but not- for EA by the steroid hormones prednisolone, dexamethasone and estradiol. Induction required protein synthesis and was not inhibited by cordycepin or vinblastine. Optimum induction required the continued presence of the hormones. IR-+D-+ cells were also induced by these hormones to migrate in agar, attach to the surface of a Petri dish and form macrophages. IR-+D-minus cells showed a lower inducibility by these hormones and no formation of macrophages. There was no induction of any of these changes with IR-minusD-minus cells. The steroid hormones progesterone, testosterone and cortisone did not induce these changes in any of the leukemic cells and inhibited induction by prednisolone, dexamethasone and estradiol.

CMC was presumably directed against tumor and viral related antigens in the syngeneic host and primarily against alloantigens in the allogeneic host. CMC was more virgorous in the syngeneic host. This may be due to differences in quantities or immunogenicities of the various antigens involved. Two peaks of T-cells in effector populations were observed during a 20-day post-inoculation period. The first peak corresponded to peak T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity on day 8 and the second peak occurred on days 13 or 14 when CMC was minimal or undetectable.,,,,,,,

Ultrastructural studies revealed a reduction of the cytoplasmic area. Furthermore, the number of lysosomes was diminished corresponding to a decreased activity of lysosomal hydrolases. Increasing blood lymphocytosis was paralleled by an increase of the percentage of lysosome-poor lymphocytes. Response of CLL lymphocytes to in vitro stimulation with PHA and PWM was either lacking or diminished and/or delayed, and the number of transformed cells was reduced. Thus, the majority of CLL lymphocytes appears to represent both morphologically and functionally abnormal neoplastic b cells. During the early and later phase of stimulation the mitogen-reactive CLL lymphocytes exhibited alterations of the lysosomal apparatus similar to those observed in normal cells. The reactive lymphocytes may be derived from residual populations of normally functioning T and/or B cells. However, the neoplastic cells may also be able to respond to the mitogens. In vivo studies showed impaired kinetics of circulation and recirculation of CLL B lymphocytes, whereas the T cells were normal in this respect.",,Der Lymphozyt bei der chronischen lymphatischen Leukamie,,,,,

Thymocytes from normal mice slightly stimulated the replication of the same target cells. This pattern of carrier thymocyte reactivity was evident at all ages tested during both preneoplastic and neoplastic periods. Transplantable lymphoma cells derived from a carrier mouse with overt thymic lymphoma behaved similarly. Lymphocytes from the spleens and lymph nodes of young preleukemic carriers (8-12 weeks old) usually were reactive against MuLV-M-infected tarted cells and not against non-infected target cells. In contrast, lymphocytes from older preleukemic carriers (16-17 weeks old) reacted in a manner similar to carrier thymocytes. These observations suggest that the thymic lymphoma induced by MuLV-M may result in part from an autoreactive process originating in the thymus, but eventually spreading to the peripheral lymphoid tissues.",,,,,,,

Thymus-derived (T-cell) lymphocytes can be identified by their ability to form rosetts with sheep erythrocytes (SRBC); bone marrow-derived (B-cell) lymphocytes bear characteristic surface markers for immunoglobulin, complement, and the Fc portion of IgG. Recently, populations of lymphocytes having either multiple markers or no detectable markers (null cells) have been observed. Based on studies of cell surface markers, a scheme is proposed that expands the known differentiation of the lymphod cell to include subpopulations which represent developmental stages. It is suggested that lymphocyte maturation involves alloantigenic changes in a circulating stem cell-drived nill cell, leading to a cell bearing markers for both T- and B-cells.

Cytomorphologic and cytochemical investigations have been made of the following hemopathies: 1. primary idiopathic dyserythropoietic anemia morphologically similar to types I, II and III but noncongenital and without a positive acidified-serum test; 2. a special form of dyserythropoietic anemia associated with dyshemopoietic genotypical mucopolysaccharidosis, a new ly recognized from of inherited mucopolysaccharide storage; 3. dyserythropoietic anemia in a patient with homozygosity due to increased isolated HbA2, a Cooleg-like anemia characterized by very long survival without transfusion treatment; 4. dyserythropoietic changes prior to any treatment in the bone marrow of cases of promyelocytic, myelomonocytoid and basophilic leukemia. The cytomorphologic and serologic features of this clinical material are discussed. Particular reference is made to a new finding, i.e. phagocytosis of degenerated erythroblasts by Alder's granuloblasts, as a new form of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. Finally, a further dyserythropoietic condition is pointed out which is related to human fetal erythropoiesis and characterized by a large number of reticuloerythroblast islets and a dyserythropoietic pattern. However, although it appears to point to ineffective erythropoiesis this last condition cannot be considered as pathologic but as a teleologic hemopoietic phenomenon.",,Dyserythropoietische Anamien,,,,,

In contrast to immunized mice, animals pretreated with antibody showed rapid activation of their peritoneal macrophages, followed by their disappearance and the inability of the residual peritoneal monocytic cells to attach L1210 cells even in the presence of proved cytophilic antibody to L1210. The inhibitory activity of the antibody, which resided entirely in its IgG2 fraction, was manifested only when the specific antigen (L1210 cells) was also injected within 2 days. Pretreatment with antibody to a different leukemia, EL4, failed to inhibit the monocytic uptake of L1210, but it did inhibit uptake of EL4 by monocytes if injected with its homologous antigen. Restoration of the functional capacity of macrophages was accomplished by injecting 1 X 10-7 bone marrow cells i.v. into ""suppressed"" mice, but 1.5 X 10-7 thymocytes failed to correct the defect. Significantly, thymocytes antagonized the restorative capability of bone marrow cells when they were injected concomitantly. These results indicate that specific inhibition of cytophilic antibody receptors on monocytes could be accomplished through a direct mechanism involving activation and exhaustion of macrophages and an indirect mechanism, perhaps mediated through ""suppressor"" thymus-derived cells. Although enhancement of the growth of leukemia cells did not occur, several parallels exist in mice with enhanced growth of different tumors. This inhibiotry phenomenon may thus represent another instance of ""blocking"" in tumor immunity, where the target of suppressive antibody-antigen is the macrophage as well as the lymphocyte.",,,,,,,

HCL is a rare, unusual type of chronic leukemia and is predominantly particular of middle-aged men. The occurrence of middle-sized lymphoid cells having a hairy cytoplasmic edge, and a tartrate-resistant acid PHOsphatase isoenzyme are the characteristic criteria of the HCL. The diffuse infiltration by hairy cells affecting primarily the spleen and bone marrow results in anaemia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. Differential diagnosis have to be made in relation to other lymphatic leukemias, leukemic malignant lymphomas and monoclonal gammopathies as well as lymphotropic viral infections. Immunologic behaviour of hairy cells is like that of B-lymphocytes.

Their spleen cells were then tested for reactivity against Moloney virus-induced lymphoma of BALB/c origin by the 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assay. In non-drug-treated mice the secondary cytotoxic response was maximal on Days 14 to 15, declined rapidley, and recurred after Day 21. The cytotoxic effector cells were shown to be theta-bearing T-lymphocytes. Cyclophosphamide (CY), 180 mg/kg, given on Day 11, totally prevented the development of a cytotoxic response and when given on Day 14 abolished the response already established. CY, 48 mg/kg, as well as 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea 33 mg/kg, were almost as suppressive. Immune mice given CY on Day 14 and reimmunized on Day 36 exhibited a normal tertiary response. Mice similarly immunized on Days 1 and 10 and given drugs on Day 14 were challenged on Day 15 with up to 3.5 x 10-8 viable Moloney virus-induced lymphoma cells of BALB/c origin. Despite H-2 incompatibility, all nonimmune control mice developed ascites and died, whereas all mice immunized but not given drug failed to develop ascites. By contrast, 17 of 34 immunized mice given CY, 180 mg/kg, and 7 of 34 given 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea developed ascites. The ascites eventually regressed.

All patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura who were studied had greater than that value. Surface IgG was increased in inverse proportion to the platelet count. Surface levels of greater than 1.1 pg correlated with failure to respond to prednisone therapy. Incubation of normal serums with normal platelets did not increase surface IgG of such platelets, but the incubation with thrombocytopenic serums increased their surface IgG 0.5 to 100 times.

In leukaemias, preleukaemic states and bone marrow insufficiencies with or without sideroblastosis, changes in enzyme activity are usually characterized by the coexistence of deficiency of some enzymes and an increased activity of others. The most frequently decreased activities are those of pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase,2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase and adenylate kinase; the most frequently increased activities are those of hexokinase, aldolase, enolase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In primary myelofibrosis and in polycythaemia rubra vera, enzyme deficiencies are infrequent and differ from those observed in leukaemias and related disorders. Phosphohexose isomerase and phosphoglucomutase deficiencies seem relatively specific for polycythaemia rubra vera. Explanations for the acquired enzymopathies are still at the stage of hypothesis. The theory of multiple genetic damage may explain some findings but has not yet been proved right. The possibility of post-translational molecular modification is suggested as a working hypothesis.",,,,,,,

An autopsy of this case as well as that of a 47 year old man revealed the presence of tumoriform chloroleukaemia. The histochemical positivity of naphthol AS-D-chloracetate-esterase and NaF-sensitive non-specific esterase showed the simultaneous double differentiation of tumour cells thus serving as evidence of their myelomonocytic nature. The first observation also revealed the presence of atypical eosinophil leucocytes with PAS-positive, naftol AS-D-chloracetate-esterase-negative granules. Both observations brought evidence of the reticular as well as tumour cells showing signs of erythrocytophagia which may have a share in the development of the tumour tissue green coloration.",,Myelomonocytarni chloroleukemie.
